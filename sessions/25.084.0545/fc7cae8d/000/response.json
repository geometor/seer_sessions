            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger input grid into a smaller output grid.  The input grids seem to contain several distinct \"objects\" composed of contiguous blocks of the same color. There's a background of grey(0) in all inputs. The transformation appears to be some form of object extraction and compression, perhaps focusing on specific colored regions within the larger grid and representing them in a condensed form. The output size is significantly smaller. Color plays a crucial role. Some input colors don't appear in outputs. The relative spatial arrangement of the extracted information appears to be preserved to some extent.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

(e.g., yellow(4) and gray(5) appear in train input 1 but not output, similarly for gray(5) and white(0) in train inputs 2&3)\n  - observation: '0' white/gray color acts as a background in all input grids, this color doesn't feature in the output except for a small number of cells (one '0' in output 1)\n  - observation: The output grids tend to be rectangular, even if the input \"objects\" are of various shapes.\n  - observation: The transformation rule changes from example to example.\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1. **Identify Target Objects:** In each input grid, identify contiguous regions of the same color. Disregard the white/grey (0) background and other colors that seem to be irrelevant according to training examples. The relevant colors seem to be the ones forming shapes.\n2. **Extract Key Colors:** For each example, identify the distinct non-background colors that are present in the input and form significant shapes or lines. Ignore colors not present in the corresponding output.\n3. **Compress and Map:** Condense the extracted color information into a smaller grid. The condensation process seems to select representative colors and their relative positions, but simplifies and significantly reduces the size.\n4. Transform based on shape extraction. In example 1, we extract the azure(8) shape and condense it into the top left corner of the output. The shape is outlined by blue(1), yellow(4) and white(0) are padding and red(2), magenta(6), and green(3) form separate shapes. In example 2, the yellow(4) shape is extracted. The blue(1) outlines the bottom border. In example 3, extract the azure(8) shapes.\n5. Condense shapes into smaller area, output top left.\n"
