The output grids seem to be derived from specific sections or patterns within the input grids. There's a strong indication of object selection based on color and position, and a possible rearrangement or cropping of these selected objects. The output dimensions are often, but not always, smaller than the input. It appears as if objects defined by the lower right sections of the input grid is extracted, re-ordered and potentially inverted in ordering of pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This is the source for constructing the output.\n2. **Identify Objects:** The colored pixel groups in lower-right are the key objects.\n3. **Object Extraction:** Select these objects in the lower right.\n4. **Reordering and Inversion (Conditional):** Reverse the order of the *columns* of objects AND/OR within each object, reverse the color order horizontally.  This step is key and needs careful observation across examples. It's either row-wise or column-wise reordering, possibly both, combined with a possible horizontal flip.\n5. **Cropping (If Necessary):** If a rectangular selection results in a grid that is smaller than a repeating section within the input, create the output grid by taking the subgrid.\n6. **Output Construction:** The extracted, reordered (and possibly inverted and cropped) section becomes the output grid.\n\nKey Uncertainties that need to be addressed in the next phase:\n\n*   **Precise Reordering Rule:** Is it row-wise, column-wise, or a combination? Is there a consistent inversion/flip?\n*   **Cropping Logic:** Is it determined only by size or a more complex repetition pattern.\n"
