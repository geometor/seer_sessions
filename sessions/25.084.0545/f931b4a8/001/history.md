Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and formulating a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid. The output grids seem to be derived from specific sections or patterns within the input grids. There's a strong indication of object selection based on color and position, and a possible rearrangement or cropping of these selected objects. The output dimensions are often, but not always, smaller than the input. It appears as if objects defined by the lower right sections of the input grid is extracted, re-ordered and potentially inverted in ordering of pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: digits (0-9) representing colors

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: digits (0-9) representing colors

  - name: subgrid_objects
    type: grid_selection # a selection or subset of the input_grid
    properties:
     - color(s): a subset of colors that identify subgrids
     - location: variable
     - potential_transformations: [reordering, inversion, cropping]

actions:
  - name: identify_subgrids
    description: Find contiguous blocks of the same color in the lower-right portion of input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: set of subgrid_objects

  - name: extract_subgrids
    description: Creates a new grid from the identified subgrids.
    input: set of subgrid_objects, input_grid
    output: output_grid

  - name: reorder_subgrids
    description: changes pixel ordering within or between subgrids.
    input: set of subgrid objects
    output: reordered set of subgrid_objects

  - name: invert_subgrids
    description: potentially changes color ordering or direction of pixels, within or between subgrids
    input: set of subgrid objects
    output: inverted ordering of subgrid objects or pixels

relations:
  - relation: output_derived_from_input
    description: The output_grid is created by selecting, potentially reordering, and extracting parts of the input_grid.
  - relation: subgrids_defined_by_color
    description: contiguous pixels of a single color can define a region in the input grid.
  - relation: location_matters
    description: the relative position, specifically in the lower right part of the grids is an important feature

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Target Area:** Focus on the lower-right quadrant or section of the input grid. This is the source for constructing the output.
2. **Identify Objects:** The colored pixel groups in lower-right are the key objects.
3. **Object Extraction:** Select these objects in the lower right.
4. **Reordering and Inversion (Conditional):** Reverse the order of the *columns* of objects AND/OR within each object, reverse the color order horizontally.  This step is key and needs careful observation across examples. It's either row-wise or column-wise reordering, possibly both, combined with a possible horizontal flip.
5. **Cropping (If Necessary):** If a rectangular selection results in a grid that is smaller than a repeating section within the input, create the output grid by taking the subgrid.
6. **Output Construction:** The extracted, reordered (and possibly inverted and cropped) section becomes the output grid.

Key Uncertainties that need to be addressed in the next phase:

*   **Precise Reordering Rule:** Is it row-wise, column-wise, or a combination? Is there a consistent inversion/flip?
*   **Cropping Logic:** Is it determined only by size or a more complex repetition pattern.
