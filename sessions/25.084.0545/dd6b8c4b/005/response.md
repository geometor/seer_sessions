1.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Find the single pixel of color 2 (red) within the input grid. If there isn't exactly one red pixel, do not modify the input.

2.  **Identify Connected Green Pixels:** Identify all pixels of color 3 (green) that are directly connected (orthogonally or diagonally) to the red pixel.

3.  **Determine Green Region:** From this set of initially connected Green pixels, identify Green pixels which form a contiguous region with each other. A pixel is considered connected if it shares an edge or a corner with another pixel in the region.

4.  **Transform Green to Maroon:** Change the color of the green pixels, within this connected region identified in the previous step, to color 9 (maroon).
