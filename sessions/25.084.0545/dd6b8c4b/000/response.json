The transformation seems to focus on specific regions or objects within the grid, rather than a global change. There's a recurring pattern involving the digits 7, 3, 2, 6, and 9.  The key seems to be identifying the object defined by '3's, and its relationship to the single '2', surrounded by '3's.  Colors 7 and 9 seem to play a role as a border or background. The digit '6' is another component.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
