The transformation seems to involve a complex interaction between objects, potentially based on color, position and surroundings. There seems to be some kind of \"reflection\" and object interaction.\n*   **Colors:** Specific colors appear to play significant roles (e.g., 1/blue, 8/azure, 4/yellow, 3/green).\n*   **Symmetry/Reflection:** There's a noticeable, albeit imperfect, mirroring or reflection effect. It is not simple, and there is no easy symmetry.\n*\t**Object Interactions** There appears to be some kind of operations between near objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
