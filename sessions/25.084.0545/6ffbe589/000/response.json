The most prominent feature is the presence of multiple colored objects within the grid. These objects appear to be irregular shapes composed of contiguous pixels of the same color. There's a sense of object extraction and rearrangement. The background (color 0, white) seems largely irrelevant except possibly defining the boundaries. The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids, indicating some form of cropping or selection. It is not a simple recoloring or mirroring, rotation that transforms the entire input to the output - portions are selectively included. There seems to be an emphasis on preserving parts with color changes and perhaps eliminating larger \"empty\" or single-color regions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each of these blocks constitutes a \"colored object.\"\n2. **Extract Core:** Extract the a sub-grid containing all non-zero colored pixels. This creates an intermediate grid, much smaller than the original.\n3. **Crop Empty Rows and Columns:** Starting from the edges of this intermediate grid, eliminate rows and columns that only contain the background color (0) until a non-zero pixel is encountered or if the row/column has already contained a non-zero in the traversal of prior columns/rows. This step ensures that the output grid is tightly packed around the core shape and color changes.\n4. **Output:**  The resulting cropped grid is the final output.\n\nThe key idea is to identify and extract the \"interesting\" parts of the input grid (the colored objects and color changes) and discard the surrounding \"empty space\".\n"
