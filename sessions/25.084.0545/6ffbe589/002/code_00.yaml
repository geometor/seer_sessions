      - description: A complex shape composed of green, blue, yellow, magenta, and azure pixels.
        bounding_box: [1, 11, 7, 18]  # [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col] derived manually
    output_objects:
      - description: Cropped version of the input object.
        bounding_box: [0, 12, 3, 15]  #relative to input
