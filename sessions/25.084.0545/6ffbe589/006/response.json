            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the errors, a strategy for addressing them, and the requested documentation:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implements a bounding box extraction, focusing on non-zero pixels. This approach is too simplistic and doesn't account for the nuances in the examples. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Bounding Box:** The code considers *all* non-zero pixels when determining the bounding box. This fails in cases where distinct objects of different colors should be treated separately, or when background '0' pixels are inside a larger non-zero object. It is finding too much in most cases.\n2.  **Ignoring Internal Structure:** It treats the input as a single entity to be cropped, rather than potentially containing multiple, distinct objects or patterns.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is the bounding box logic's inability to distinguish between separate objects of different colors. A more robust strategy involves:\n\n1.  **Iterative Bounding Boxes:** Instead of one large bounding box, we should calculate bounding boxes *for each distinct color*.\n2. **Rebuild the objects**: Examine the relationship between the bounding box, the objects and the background.\n3. **Background consideration**: Re-examine the background pixels (value 0) and consider if the object extends to the edges of the grid, or if 0 pixels could be inside the transformed output.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nTo better understand the errors, let's analyze each example and the associated code. Because the code already has a good structure, using it and extending it will be useful.\n\n"
