facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions.
    elements: Single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value of the pixels.
      - shape: Can be irregular, but the transformation focuses on linear groups of three.
      - size: Variable, but the key is groups of three.
  - type: transformation
    description:  "Snaking" or extension of specific color groups.
    trigger:  Presence of a line of 3 identical colors.
    action: The colors take over some of their neighbors.  Looks like neighbor pixels adjacent and inline with three get changed.
