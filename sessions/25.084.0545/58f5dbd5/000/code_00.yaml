objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (different sizes across examples)
      - cells: colored pixels (integers 0-9)
  - type: block
    properties:
      - color: single integer value (0-9)
      - shape: rectangular
      - size: variable (contiguous area of same color)
      - arrangement: can form patterned groups
    relations:
      - adjacent_to: blocks can be next to other blocks (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)

actions:
  - type: identify_blocks
    description: Locate contiguous regions of the same color.
  - type: isolate_patterns
    description: Separate the grid into distinct regions, often rectangular, formed by groups of colored blocks, that is create subgrids
  - type: simplify_blocks
    description: condense multi-colored subgrids to form alternating colored row patterns
