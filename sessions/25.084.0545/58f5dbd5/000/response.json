The input grids appear to have larger, seemingly random arrangements of colored blocks, while the output grids show a consistent pattern: alternating single-color and multi-color rows within defined regions, ultimately creating smaller, patterned rectangles within larger rectangles of the background color. The \"background\" is consistently color 8.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
