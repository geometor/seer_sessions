The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement or modification of certain colored pixels based on their neighbors. The key colors involved vary between examples, but the logic appears consistent: a color *changes* to another *specific* color if present in the right side of a vertical pair.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
