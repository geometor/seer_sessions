Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary element of change appears to be the insertion or shifting of existing colors, specifically in the central part of the grid. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex rotations or mirroring, but rather localized modifications. There's a sense of maintaining the outer "frame" or edges of the input grid while modifying the inner section based on color patterns. Specifically, a color between other same colors will be replaced by the color on its right side.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are of the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The transformation primarily affects the inner regions of the grid.
  - observation: |
      The outermost rows and columns mostly stay the same, except if the replacement rule can apply.
  - observation: |
      Colors seem to be inserted or shifted based on their context within a row.
  - observation: |
    A new color between two same color will be inserted to the left side of the original color.
  - objects:
    - name: Grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: rows x columns
        - cells: contain color values (0-9)
    - name: Cell
      properties:
        - color: integer value (0-9)
        - position: row and column index
  - actions:
    - name: Insert/Shift
      description: |
          A new color is inserted, or an original color will be shifted.
      parameters:
        - color: The color to insert/shift
        - position: The location for the new color
        - direction: The direction to insert/shift.
  - relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: Neighboring cells in the grid.
    - type: context
      description: The surrounding colors of a cell influence the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Outer Frame:** Keep the first row and last row of the grid identical to the input.

2.  **Iterate Through Inner Rows:** For each row from the second row to the second-to-last row:

3.  **Iterate each inner cell:** Iterate each cell of the row from left to right, check its adjacent cells.

4.  **Check pattern and apply rule**: If the cell's left neighbor and the cell's right neighbor are the same, copy the right side neighbor's color into the current cell, if not, skip current cell.

5.  **Output:** The output will be generated.
