Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code has several issues, as evidenced by the mismatches in all three examples. The primary problems seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Alternating Logic:** The alternating pattern to the right of the divider isn't consistently applied. It seems to sometimes use '0', sometimes the object's color, and sometimes the color to the immediate right of the divider.
2.  **Object Contiguity Handling:** The code attempts to differentiate between objects contiguous to the divider and those that are not, but this logic is flawed, especially when multiple objects are not contiguous.
3. Missing to fill some cells to the right.

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Clarifying Alternating Pattern Rules:** Establish precise rules for the alternating pattern. Based on the examples, the following is observed:

    *   If an object *touches* the divider, the alternation to the right of the divider should be between the object's color and '0' (blank).
    *  If it is *not contiguous* the pattern should be: color immediately at the right of the "2" divider and color of current object.

2.  **Improving Contiguity Detection:** Refine the logic that determines whether an object is contiguous to the divider, looking at the end of the object and the divider.

3. **Filling all cells to the right** Iterate through all positions on the output, and if the position hasn't value, keep the original one.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**

I'll use the provided results, combined with manual inspection of the input/output pairs to gather information. No code execution is needed here, as the provided examples give sufficient information.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Divider:** Locate the vertical line composed entirely of '2's. This line's position is fixed.

2.  **Identify Horizontal Objects:** To the left of the divider, identify continuous horizontal lines of a single, non-zero color. Consider each of these lines as a distinct object. An object is defined by:
    *   Its row index.
    *   Its starting column index.
    *   Its ending column index.
    *   Its color.

3.  **Transform Each Row:** Process each row of the input grid independently:

    *   **Object Existence:** Determine if the current row contains a horizontal object identified in step 2.

    *   **Contiguity Check:** If an object exists in the row, check if the object is contiguous to the divider (i.e., the object's ending column is immediately adjacent to the divider's column).

    * **Transformation Logic**
      * Copy input grid to output grid
      * Fill object cells on output grid

      *   **If Contiguous:** Starting from the cell immediately to the right of the divider, alternate filling cells in the row with the object's color and '0' (blank). Continue this alternation until the end of the row.
      *   **If Not Contiguous:**
            * Get first color to the right of the divider.
            * Starting from the cell immediately to the right of the divider, alternate the first right color with the current object color.

    *   **No Object:** If the row doesn't contain any identified object, then copy the row to the output.

4. **Output** The transformed grid is the final output
