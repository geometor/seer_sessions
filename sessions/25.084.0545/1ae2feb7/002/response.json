            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the vertical line of '2's and attempts to extend horizontal objects to the right, alternating the object's color with '0'. However, there are discrepancies in how the alternating pattern is applied and how different colored objects interact to the right of the divider. The examples show that the single cell object's color interacts with other cells to the right of the divider.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Alternating Pattern Logic:** The current logic assumes a simple alternation of color and '0'. Example 2 shows a '2' can also be inserted in the alternation and that Example 3 doesn't fill the colors after the fifth color to the end. We need to adjust the logic to reflect how colors from different rows interact to the right of the dividing line.\n2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** We need to review to see if an object that extends to the border interacts differently that ones that do not.\n3. **Understand object and divider interaction:** The objects seems to change when they cross the divider.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use the provided information to create a report on each example and results.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The transformation mostly works.\n    *   Error exists in the alternating pattern of some lines.\n    *   Error exist filling values with just the color instead of 0\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The transformation shows some errors.\n    *   The second object from the left has an alternating '2' after crossing\n        the divider.\n    *   Alternating pattern do not follow a simple `color, 0`\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   The transformation shows some errors.\n    *   The sixth line does not have any change.\n    *    The pattern of fill, skip, do not seems to apply.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
