Previous Code:
```python
"""
This program transforms an input grid based on horizontal objects found to the left of a vertical line of '2's. The transformation involves extending each horizontal object to the right, creating an alternating pattern of the object's color and '0' (empty cells).

1.  **Identify the Divider:** Locate the vertical line of '2's. This line remains unchanged in the output.
2.  **Locate Objects:** Find all horizontal lines made of cells with the same color to the left of the identified vertical line.
3.  **Iterate Objects:** Iterate through the rows that contains objects found in the previous step.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** For each horizontal object:
    *   Fill the original object cells with their initial color.
    *   Starting in the column immediately to the right of the vertical '2' line, fill the current column with object color.
    *   Skip one column.
    *   Fill the next column with object color
    *   Continue alternating filling object color and skipping one cell to the end of line.
    *   Fill the remaining cell with color 0.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the vertical line of '2's and attempts to extend horizontal objects to the right, alternating the object's color with '0'. However, there are discrepancies in how the alternating pattern is applied and how different colored objects interact to the right of the divider. The examples show that the single cell object's color interacts with other cells to the right of the divider.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Alternating Pattern Logic:** The current logic assumes a simple alternation of color and '0'. Example 2 shows a '2' can also be inserted in the alternation and that Example 3 doesn't fill the colors after the fifth color to the end. We need to adjust the logic to reflect how colors from different rows interact to the right of the dividing line.
2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** We need to review to see if an object that extends to the border interacts differently that ones that do not.
3. **Understand object and divider interaction:** The objects seems to change when they cross the divider.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use the provided information to create a report on each example and results.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The transformation mostly works.
    *   Error exists in the alternating pattern of some lines.
    *   Error exist filling values with just the color instead of 0

*   **Example 2:**
    *   The transformation shows some errors.
    *   The second object from the left has an alternating '2' after crossing
        the divider.
    *   Alternating pattern do not follow a simple `color, 0`

*   **Example 3:**
    *   The transformation shows some errors.
    *   The sixth line does not have any change.
    *    The pattern of fill, skip, do not seems to apply.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Divider:** Locate the vertical line consisting of '2's. This line's position will remain constant.

2.  **Identify Horizontal Objects:** To the left of the divider, identify horizontal lines (objects) of a single, non-zero color. An object is defined by its row, starting column, ending column, and color.

3.  **Transform Each Row:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.

    *   **If the row contains a horizontal object:**
        1.  Keep the original object unchanged to the left of the divider.
        2. Iterate through the cells to the right of the divider
        3. If the object is contiguous to the divider
           - Alternate filling the cells with the object's original color and '0' (empty), starting immediately to the right of the divider.
        4.  If it is not contiguous to the divider:
            - Get the first cell color to the right of the divider.
            - Alternate cells using: color to the right of the divider and the current object color.

    *   **If the row does not contain a horizontal object:** Keep the row unchanged.
