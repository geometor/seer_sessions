            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of identical dimensions. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   **Vertical Line of 2s:** A consistent element across all inputs is a vertical line of '2's. This line seems to act as a fixed reference point or divider. This line is not changed by the transformation.\n*   **Horizontal Objects:**  Groups of horizontally adjacent pixels of the same color (other than '2') form objects. These objects are always to the left of the vertical '2' line.\n*   **Transformation Scope:** The transformation seems to be limited to the area to the left of the vertical '2' line, and always includes every object found there.\n*   **Object Modification:** The transformation appears to modify the objects to the left of the '2' line. It's not simply copying or moving them.\n*    Output Pattern: The output shows a pattern that incorporates colors from the objects and sometimes 0 inserted in a alternating pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
