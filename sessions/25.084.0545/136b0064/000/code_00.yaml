facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids have vertical stripes of color, alternating with columns of black (0).
  - observation: Input grids share the feature of single yellow (4) stripe, and yellow is not present in the output.
  - observation: Output grids are composed of colored objects from the input, but in different arrangements and often smaller sizes.
  - observation: Only certain colored objects in the input appear to be selected, while other pixels are discarded.
  - observation: The selected color is maintained from input to output, but other non selected colors appear.
  - action: Copy selected objects from the input, reducing in size and rearranging them.
  - action: Discard the yellow stripe, and other parts of the input.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are smaller and derived from the input, but the relationship is not a simple crop.
