objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - dimensions: rows x columns
        - border: outer edge of the grid
        - interior: cells not on the border
  - cell:
    type: individual element within grid
    properties:
     - value: integer (0-9)
     - position: row, column index
     - neighbors: adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals)

actions:
- compare_neighbors:
  description: compare the colors between neighbors to identify patterns
  - find_runs:
  description: find repeats of digits
  
transformations:
  - conditional_change:
      description: Change the value of a cell based on its neighbors, with specific focus on digits 3, and perhaps others.
      constraints: border values remain unchanged

relationships:
  - adjacency: Cells are considered adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - containment: The grid contains cells.
