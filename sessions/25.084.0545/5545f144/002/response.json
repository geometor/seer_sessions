            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code attempts to remove columns containing a specific \"target color\".  The initial implementation hardcoded the target color based on observations from the first training example, and added a few shape based overrides. This approach is brittle and doesn't generalize. The results clearly show the code fails on all three training examples because the target color varies, and columns that *don't* contain the target colors are sometimes needed in the output, and the current logic always keeps those. The core issue is that it is looking for a color to eliminate columns with, when instead, it should be identifying columns to *keep*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Shift the Logic:** Instead of focusing on removing columns with a *target color*, we must identify the columns that are *present* in the output.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Target Color:** Stop trying to guess a target color a priori. The target color will be irrelevant, and should be removed from the code.\n\n3.  **Column Comparison:** Directly compare the input and output grids column by column to identify the preserved columns.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**\n\nWe already have visual representations of input, expected output, and transformed output.  Let's analyze the differences systematically.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (10, 26)\n    *   Output Shape: (10, 8)\n    *   The code incorrectly keeps all columns not containing '3' (green).\n    *   The correct logic should identify the first 8 columns as matching the output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 27)\n    *   Output Shape: (8, 6)\n    *    The code is not keeping the right columns.\n    *   The output appears to be the first 6 columns, ignoring all columns with color '2' (red) and most with '3'(green).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (12, 25)\n    *   Output Shape: (12, 12)\n    *   The code keeps all columns that don't have a '4' (yellow).\n    *   The expected output appears to be the first 12 columns of input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
