The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly handle the replacement of '7's with '6's on the 7th row and column from the bottom and right edges, especially concerning boundary conditions and intersections. It appears the initial logic was too simplistic, not fully accounting for the exceptions when the 7th row/column intersects the outer '6' and '7' frame. It only replaced 7 with 6.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on the differences between the \"Transformed Output\" and the \"Expected Output\".\n2.  **Boundary Condition Refinement:** Pay close attention to how the transformation behaves at the edges and corners of the grid, especially where the 7th row/column intersects with the outer frame of 6's and 7's.\n3.  **Intersection Logic:** The core logic error seems to be related to how intersections of 7's in the designated row and column are handled.\n4. **Rewrite Code**: Rewrite the natural language program, to include new knowledge.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis:**\n\nLet's collect some detailed metrics for each example. The previous reports give a \"Pixels Off\" value, input, expected output and transformed output.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Observation:** The 7's at the top right, and bottom right are not getting replaced correctly. The corner pixels are important.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Observation**: Similar to Example 1, there's an issue with how the transformation interacts with the outer frame and corners. The left border is also involved.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*  The seventh column and rows from the bottom and right, have '7' that is replaced. If they intersect with other values, the other values are copied.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
