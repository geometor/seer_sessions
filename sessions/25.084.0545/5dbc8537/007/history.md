2.  **Identify Inside Objects:** Identify all objects that are *not* part of the frame.
3. **Determine Frame and Inside Object Arrangement:**

4.  **Create Output Grid:**

    *   **Horizontal Arrangement:** The output grid has the same width as the input. The height is determined by the combined heights of the frame and all inside objects stacked vertically.
5. **Reconstruct the Frame:**
    *   **Vertical Arrangement**: Reconstruct the frame in the first *column* of the output grid.
    * **Horizontal Arrangement**: Reconstruct the frame in the first *row* of the output grid.
6.  **Place Inside Objects:**
    *  **Vertical Arrangement:** Place each inside object in subsequent columns, preserving the top-to-bottom order of the objects as they appear in the input. Each object occupies its own column.
    *   **Horizontal Arrangement:** Place each inside object in subsequent rows, preserving the left-to-right and top-to-bottom order of the objects as they appear in the input. Each object occupies its own row.

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

## Example 2:
Error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
Here's an analysis of the errors and a plan to update the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The errors "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" in both examples indicate that `frame_object` is `None`. This happens because `get_frame_object` fails to find an object that encompasses *all* frame coordinates.  The initial assumption that the frame is a *single* contiguous object including the entire border is incorrect. The examples show that the border can be composed of multiple distinct objects of different colors. The core logic of separating the frame and inner objects, then rearranging them, is still valid, but the frame identification needs significant revision.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Revise Frame Identification:** Instead of looking for a single frame object, identify frame *components* as any object touching the edge of the grid.
2.  **Handle Multiple Frame Colors:** The frame can have multiple colors.  The current code assumes a single frame color, which needs to change.
3.  **Refine Object Placement:** Re-examine how inside objects are positioned relative to the frame components.
4. Gather object counts and color counts

**Data Gathering and Metrics:**

I'll use `tool_code` to analyze the input grids, count objects and their properties, and verify the current functions' behavior.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Frame Components:** Frame components are objects that touch any edge (top, bottom, left, or right) of the input grid. There can be multiple frame components, and they can have different colors.
2.  **Identify Inside Objects:** Inside objects are any objects that are *not* frame components (i.e., they don't touch any edge of the grid).
3.  **Determine Frame and Inside Object Arrangement:**
    *   If the input grid height is greater than its width, the arrangement is considered "vertical".
    *   If the input grid height is less than or equal to its width, the arrangement is considered "horizontal".
4.  **Create Output Grid:**
    *   **Vertical Arrangement:** The output grid has the same height as the input grid. The output grid's width is the sum of the widths of a single column to represent the combined frame and a column for each of the inside objects.
    *   **Horizontal Arrangement:** The output grid has the same width as the input grid. The output grid's height is the sum of one row for the frame components, plus the heights of each of the inside objects.
5.  **Reconstruct Frame Components:**
    *   **Vertical Arrangement:** Reconstruct the frame components in the first *column* of the output grid. All frame components are "merged" into this single column, maintaining their vertical positions.
    *   **Horizontal Arrangement:** Reconstruct the frame components in the first *row* of the output grid. Maintain their horizontal positions,
6.  **Place Inside Objects:**
    *   **Vertical Arrangement:** Place each inside object in subsequent columns. Preserve the top-to-bottom and left-to-right order of the inside objects as they appear in the input. Each inside object occupies its own column, and is placed adjacent to the frame or the previous object.
    *   **Horizontal Arrangement:** Place each inside object in subsequent rows. Preserve the top-to-bottom and left-to-right order of the objects. Each object occupies its own row, and is placed adjacent to the frame or previous object.
