"""
1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   A **border object** consisting of connected pixels of colors 3 and 8.  This object forms a single-pixel-wide, continuous line around the edges and within the grid.
    *   An **irregular object** composed of pixels with color 7.
    *   The **background**, consisting of all pixels with color 0.

2.  **Border Transformation (Color Swap):**
    *   Within the *connected* border object, pixels of color 8 change to color 3, and pixels of color 3 change to color 8.

3.  **Irregular Object Transformation (Color Change):**
    *   All pixels of color 7 (the irregular object) change to color 6.

4.  **Adjacent Propagation:**
    *   Any pixel of color 8 that is *adjacent* (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of color 6 changes to color 6. This propagation continues iteratively until no more color 8 pixels are adjacent to color 6 pixels.

5.  **Row Adjustment:**
    *  If the bottom row is all the same color, and it is different from the row above it, the entire row is deleted. The other rows shift down to fill the space, preserving all features.

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program and code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code have significant flaws. The code does not correctly implement the intended logic, especially the color swap and propagation aspects. The `find_connected_border` function attempts to identify a connected border, but the "connectedness" logic is incomplete, and it doesn't properly handle internal structures. The propagation logic is not correctly bounded by the border. Also, row adjustment appears to not be working as there are still some rows with all the same color that are different from the rows above.

The main issues are:
1.  **Incorrect Border Identification:** The `find_connected_border` function needs to accurately identify the connected border, distinguishing it from other isolated pixels of the same color.
2.  **Incorrect Color Swap:** The border color swap is not constrained to the actual connected border, leading to incorrect color changes.
3.  **Unbounded Propagation:** The color propagation is not limited to the region defined by the border and spreads incorrectly.
4.  **Row Adjustment** Row adjustment isn't fully implemented

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Border Identification:** Improve `find_connected_border` to correctly identify the continuous border using a more robust connectivity check, possibly using an iterative approach.
2.  **Constrain Color Swap:** Ensure the color swap occurs *only* within the identified connected border.
3.  **Bound Propagation:** Restrict color propagation to within the border.
4.  **Review and Improve:** Refactor the code significantly to ensure clarity and correctness, testing each step thoroughly.
5. **Fix Row Adjustment**: ensure only bottom rows are evaluated for deletion and fix deletion logic.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Let's analyze each example in more detail and gather metrics.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Shape:** (13, 19)
*   **Output Shape:** (13, 19)
*   **Pixel Differences:** 139
*   **Observations:** The color swap occurs across the *entire* grid wherever 3s and 8s are present, not just the border. Propagation is unbounded.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Shape:** (11, 16)
*   **Output Shape:** (10, 16)
*   **Pixel Differences:** 88. The row adjustment is also not properly implemented, and there is a row which should have been removed.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   A **connected\_border** object: A single-pixel-wide, continuous line of pixels of colors 3 and 8, forming a boundary around and potentially inside the grid. "Continuous" means each pixel in the border is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one other pixel in the border, forming a closed loop or loops.
    *   An **irregular\_object**: One or more pixels of color 7 inside the region(s) defined by the connected\_border.
    *   **Background:** All pixels with color 0.

2.  **Border Color Swap:**
    *   Within the *connected\_border* object, swap colors: 3 becomes 8, and 8 becomes 3.

3.  **Irregular Object Color Change:**
    *   Change all pixels of color 7 to color 6.

4.  **Bounded Propagation:**
    *   Within the area enclosed by the `connected_border`, any pixel of color 8 that is *adjacent* (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a pixel of color 6 changes to color 6. This propagation happens iteratively until no more color 8 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels within the border are found.

5. **Row Adjustment**:

    *  Check if all pixels in the last row of the grid have the same color.
    *  If they do, check if that color is different from the color of all pixels in the row above it.
    * If both conditions are true, delete the last row and allow the remaining rows to shift down.
