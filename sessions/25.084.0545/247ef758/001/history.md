Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation appears to selectively modify certain colored regions within the input grid to produce the output grid. The most prominent change seems to be an infilling or expansion of specific color regions, often around the edges or within existing shapes. There's a sense of "leaking" or "filling" of color, but it's not uniform; it's constrained by certain rules that need to be determined. It seems the outside border of the shape is relatively preserved.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The color '0' (white) often acts as a background or is replaced by other colors.
  - observation: |
      Colors other than '0' form connected regions or "objects."
  - observation: |
      In the output, some color regions within the input expand, primarily around edges or where they are adjacent to '0'.
  - observation: |
      The first non-zero color encountered on each row and column is maintained, and expands to fill the neighboring cells if possible.
  - observation: |
    Colors expand from left-to-right, top-to-bottom along lines where the first non-zero color has been detected.
  - observation: |
     Color expansion stops if it meets the original outer boundary of an object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Iterate** through each row of the input grid from top to bottom.
2. **For each row**:
    *   **Scan** from left to right.
    *   **Identify** the first non-zero pixel.
    * **Propagate** this first non-zero pixel's color to the right, replacing any '0' (white) pixels, from current column until either end-of-row or a different non-zero pixel is reached.
    * **Repeat** Scan and Propagate for each row.
3. Repeat the process on columns.
  * Start from top and move down.
  * Find the first non-zero pixel
  * Propagate the color, replacing '0' (white pixels) below it, until bottom of column, or a non-zero pixel is reached.

4. In the end, what we should have in the output is that each line and each row of original object remains,
but it is filled by the colors, that are closest to the beginning of each line and column.
