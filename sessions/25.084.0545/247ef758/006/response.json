            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempts to fill '0' (white) pixels with the color of their non-zero neighbors. It prioritizes single-neighbor fills and then attempts to resolve \"contested\" pixels (those with multiple different colored neighbors) by checking for \"closed islands\".  However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs in all three examples. The \"island\" detection logic seems flawed or incomplete, and the propagation of colors doesn't consistently match the expected behavior. The strategy should focus on refining the propagation and contested pixel resolution. The core concept of propagating colors from neighbors is sound, but the implementation needs significant adjustment.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Improve Propagation:** The current iterative approach with a fixed number of iterations (`max(rows, cols)`) might not be sufficient for all cases. We need a way to ensure propagation continues until no more changes occur.\n2. **Rethink Contested Pixel Resolution:** The `is_closed_island` function, as currently implemented, seems incorrect and does not reliably identify closed islands. Moreover, the handling of adjacent cells in input and output grids is not correct. It may not capture the intended logic. We should examine the input *and* output to determine the logic for multiple neighbor colors.\n3. **Prioritize observations:** It seems like the island detection is looking at the input only. This may be incorrect, it should use the output grid's context.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using manual review, no tool code needed at this stage):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Many '0' pixels remain unfilled or are filled incorrectly.\n    *   The island detection appears to misinterpret boundaries, often stopping propagation prematurely or incorrectly.\n    *   The 4s (yellow) at the top left corner do not propagate correct.\n    *   The colors in the center vertical strip do not fill correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The transformed output significantly deviates from the expected.\n    *   Propagation from the initial colored pixels seems irregular and doesn't follow the expected \"filling\" pattern.\n    *   The 5s (grey) in the top left corner do not propagate correctly, nor do other colors in the example.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *  Similar to the other examples, the filling is incomplete and inconsistent with the expected output.\n    *   The logic does not handle multi-colored regions correct (upper right).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If a cell has a color value of '0' and has *multiple* neighboring cells with *different* non-zero colors, examine the *output grid* and determine which color should be applied based on neighbors.\n\n4. **Termination:** The algorithm ends when the iterative filling steps and the contested filling resolution are complete.\n"
