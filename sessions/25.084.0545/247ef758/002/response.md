Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a strategy to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code propagates the first non-zero pixel's color in each row and column, replacing '0' pixels. This approach works partially, but fails to capture the nuanced logic of the transformations, as evidenced by the mismatches in all three examples. The strategy should focus on:

1.  **Identifying the core objects**: Instead of simply looking at the first non-zero pixel, it appears there are specific shapes or regions formed by non-zero pixels that are crucial for the transformation.
2.  **Understanding object interactions:** the way objects interact, rather than individual pixels, drives the changes. It's not just about propagating a single color, but potentially propagating within the confines of these objects or areas defined by surrounding colors. The edges of color boundaries stop propagation.
3.  **Refining the propagation rule:** The propagation isn't a simple, unidirectional sweep. It seems more localized and dependent on the shape and colors of nearby objects.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze each example, focusing on the shapes formed by non-zero pixels, and how '0' pixels are replaced *in relation* to those shapes.
2.  **Develop Object-Based Rules:** Describe the transformation not in terms of row/column propagation, but in terms of how objects of different colors influence the filling of '0' pixels.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test and modify these rules iteratively, comparing the code's output with the expected output, adjusting for the context.
4.  **Consider Connected Components:** Examine if thinking of objects in term of connected components (contiguous blocks of pixels with same color) helps.

**Gathering Metrics:**
I don't have access to a `tool_code` environment. I will have to rely on visual inspection to gather certain information.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: 4 # yellow
        shape: vertical line, horizontal line
      - color: 2 # red
        shape: vertical line
      - color: 3 # green
        shape: mostly vertical line, then solid block
      - color: 6 # magenta
        shape: vertical line
      - color: 7 #orange
        shape: vertical line, L-Shape
    transformations:
      - description: "Zeros are replaced by the color of adjacent non-zero areas. The propagation stops at the boundary of a different color."
      - affected_pixels: "0 pixels adjacent to non-zero color regions"
      - rule: "If a '0' pixel is adjacent to a non-zero pixel, it takes the color of the adjacent pixel, unless that would cross the boundary of another differently colored region."
  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: 5, shape: Vertical Line
      - color: 3, shape: Vertical Line
      - color: 4, shape: large connected L
      - color: 7, shape: vertical line
      - color: 8, shape: vertical line
    transformations:
      - description: "Zeros are replaced by neighboring colors, stopping at color borders."
      - affected_pixels: Zeros
      - rule: If a 0 is adjacent to a colored pixel, it gets that color, unless the fill will cross a border
  - example_id: 3
    objects:
     - color: 3, shape: vertical line
     - color: 1, shape: vertical line
     - color: 2, shape: connected vertical line
     - color: 6, shape: vertical line, then L
     - color: 7, shape: large L
    transformations:
     - description: Zeros replaced by nearby color
     - affected_pixels: zero pixels
     - rule: Zeros next to color, take on that color, propagation stops at borders
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all connected regions (objects) of non-zero pixels. Each region is a contiguous block of pixels with the same color.
2.  **Zero Pixel Replacement:** For each '0' pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and perhaps diagonals).
3.  **Propagation with Boundary Check:**
    *   If a '0' pixel has only one non-zero neighboring color, it adopts that color.
    *   If the neighboring colors are different, apply propagation rules as before, but only within the current object (connected component), not beyond.
    * If '0' is surrounded by '0', do nothing.

The key update is the introduction of boundaries of other color areas which stops propagation. The original assumption of simple row and column based propagation without consideration of neighboring object/region boundaries resulted in the errors.
