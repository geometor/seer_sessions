Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The primary background color is azure (8).
*   There are distinct objects of other colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4).
*   The objects appear to be mostly contiguous regions.
*    In the output, a column filled by color yellow (4) and, on top of it, a sequence of two pixels of color red (2) has been inserted to the left of another column that exists in input, starting with two red (2)'s on a background of azure (8).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    type: background
    properties:
      - fills most of the grid
  - color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - forms contiguous regions
  - color: red (2)
    properties:
      - forms contiguous regions
  - color: green (3)
      - forms contiguous regions or single pixels.
  - color: yellow (4)
      - forms contiguous regions or single pixels.

actions:
  - type: insertion
    description: A column of repeating yellow (4) and red (2) elements is inserted adjacent to existing red regions with azure backgroud.

relationships:
 - type: adjacent
   description: inserted objects show a color relationship with objects on the azure (8) background
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all columns which feature, on an azure (8) background, at least two consecutive pixels in red (2).
2.  To the immediate left of each of those columns, insert a new column.
3. The inserted columns consist of the following pattern repeated to fill the entire height of the column: single pixels of red (2), followed by single pixels of yellow (4). The pattern in train\_1 starts with color 2, and in train\_2 starts with color 4, the program should alternate colors starting with color 4.
