The primary colors involved seem to be magenta (6), maroon (9), black (0), grey (5), and orange (7).  The transformations appear complex, and seem to involve a combination of:\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**  Identifying contiguous regions of the same color as distinct objects.\n2.  **Conditional Replacement:** Changing the color of certain pixels based on their neighbors and perhaps their position within a larger object.\n3. **Object movement**: It looks like entire colored regions can be moved or have their position changed.\n4. **Color transformations**: Some colors are changed based seemingly on spatial awareness\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The core idea is the movement of \"9\" objects influencing changes in adjacent regions of \"5\" and \"7\" colored objects. There might be additional specific rules, but this describes the key logic.\n"
