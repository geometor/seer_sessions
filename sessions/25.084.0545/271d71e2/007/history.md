```python
"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid. An object is a group of adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right - no diagonals) with the same color.

2.  **Maroon Movement:** Identify all maroon (color 9) objects. Move each maroon object up by one row. If a maroon object is already at the top row, it stays in place.

3.  **Interaction Check:** For each grey (color 5) object, check if any of its pixels are directly below any of the new positions of the maroon pixels.

4.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a grey pixel is directly below a new maroon pixel position, change that grey pixel's color to orange (color 7).

5. **Output Construction** Create an output grid. All maroon objects are moved, any grey objects that had pixels directly below any of the moved maroon object pixels are changed to orange. All other pixels remain unchanged.

## Example 2:
Error: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

## Example 3:
Error: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The errors "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" consistently across all three examples suggest a fundamental problem in how the `find_objects` function is used or how its return value is handled. The code expects `find_objects` to return a tuple of two elements, and the `for` loop attempts to unpack these two values, `(color, obj)` in


```
for color, obj_coords in maroon_objects:
        for r, c in obj_coords:
```


The `find_objects()` methods *does* return color and object coordinates


```
objects.append((grid[r, c], obj))  # Store color and object
```


but this error indicates that the structure of `objects` is not a list of `(color, coords)` after the maroon objects are selected. The problem occurs when selecting out the maroon and grey objects:


```python
    # Locate maroon (9) objects
    maroon_objects = [obj for color, obj in objects if color == 9]

    # Locate grey(5) objects
    grey_objects =  [obj for color, obj in objects if color == 5]
```


The list comprehension is discarding `color` and only using `obj`, so when the list comprehension is complete, the new list only contains the object coordinates and not the color.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Debug `find_objects` Usage:** First, I need to run `find_objects` on a simple example and inspect its direct output to fully understand its structure.
2.  **Correct Unpacking:** I need to understand better, and probably modify, how the results of `find_objects` are iterated over, so I can correctly access the color and coordinates of each object.
3. **Update the list comprehension** re-include `color` after filtering by color
4.  **Re-test:** After fixing the unpacking, I'll re-run the code on all three examples.

**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis (using code execution):**

I'll create a simplified input grid and use the `find_objects` function to examine its output structure directly.

```
**Analysis of Tool Output:**

The output confirms the problem. `find_objects` *does* return a list of tuples: `(color, [(row, col), (row, col), ...])`.  The list comprehensions to filter maroon and grey objects are discarding the color value.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid. An object is a group of adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right - no diagonals) with the same color.  Store the color and coordinates of each object.

2.  **Maroon Movement:** Identify all maroon (color 9) objects. For each maroon object, move all of its pixels up by one row in the output grid.  If a maroon pixel is already at the top row (row 0), it stays in place.  Clear the original positions of moved maroon pixels (set to color white=0)

3.  **Grey Object Interaction:** Identify all grey (color 5) objects. For each grey pixel, check if there is a maroon pixel directly above it *in the output grid*.

4.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a grey pixel has a maroon pixel directly above it in the output grid, change the grey pixel's color to orange (color 7) in the output grid.

5.  **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by applying the above steps. All pixels that are not part of moved maroon objects or transformed grey objects retain their original color.
