"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat each contiguous block of pixels of the same color as a single object.
2.  **Locate nines:** Identify the locations of all maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Process interaction with maroon object:**
    *   Iterate through each distinct object in the input.

    *   If there exists an area within an object in the input that *would* be adjacent to a maroon object if that object were moved up by one, the maroon is replaced with a black.
    *   if object is grey (5), replace object with orange (7).
    *   If the object is orange(7), keep the object the same.
4. **Handle other pixels:** any colors that are not interacting with the moved nine remain the same
5. **Reconstruct:** any other colors that have not been changed in these operations remain the same.
