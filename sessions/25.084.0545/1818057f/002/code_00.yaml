examples:
  - id: 1
    objects:
      - color: red
        shape: irregular boundary/frame
        notes: Surrounds most of the yellow pixels.
      - color: yellow
        shape: scattered pixels and small groups
        notes: Some are adjacent to red, others are not. Changes to azure based on position relative to red.
  - id: 2
    objects:
      - color: red
        shape: irregular frame
        notes: Creates an inner space.
      - color: yellow
        shape: horizontal lines and 2x2 blocks
        notes: The 2x2 blocks touching the "frame" do *not* change. Other blocks of yellow do.
  - id: 3
    objects:
      - color: red
        shape: irregular boundary and isolated pixels.
        notes:  Creates a complex shape.
      - color: yellow
        shape: lines and groups
        notes: Changes appear inconsistent based on previous logic, especially when red is only present on one side.
