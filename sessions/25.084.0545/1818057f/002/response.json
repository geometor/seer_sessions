            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information, an analysis of the errors, and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code focused on a simple rule: change yellow pixels to azure if they are adjacent to red pixels. However, the results from the additional training examples reveal a more nuanced pattern, and a consistent error. The transformation isn't simply about *any* adjacent red pixel, but it appears that blocks of yellow pixels become azure when bounded by red in certain configurations. It's also important to see if it is a certain kind of object - not just any adjacent red pixels.\n\nMy strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Errors:** Carefully examine *where* the code's output deviates from the expected output in each example. Look for common geometric or topological patterns, specifically how objects relate.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the error analysis, modify the natural language program to capture the *precise* conditions that trigger the yellow-to-azure transformation. It looks to be related to the *shape* defined by red objects and the placement of yellow objects near them.\n3.  **Object Identification:** Make explicit note of the object types (colors) and their configurations.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nI'll use a combination of observation and code execution to gather metrics. Observation will be used for simple counting. Code execution will focus on things like finding bounding boxes of shapes.\n\nFor each example:\n\n*   **Example 1**: Red pixels form a sort of noisy boundary. Yellow pixels exist within the boundary. Many, but not all, of the yellow pixels that should change to azure do in the transformation. It misses changes along the bottom and lower-right.\n*   **Example 2**: Again, red pixels create an irregular frame. The yellow pixels exist in horizontal lines and 2x2 blocks. The top-left and bottom-left 2x2 yellow blocks do not change, while other yellow blocks fully within the 'frame' of red do.\n*   **Example 3**: The red forms an irregular boundary and isolated pixels. Some groups of yellow that are only partially adjacent to red are changed to azure.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n"
