"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules involving
object identification, edge/corner detection, adjacency analysis, and
color transformations. The rules generalize across the provided examples,
focusing on object properties and relative positions rather than
specific color values. The order of rule application appears to be significant.
