Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input grids have varying dimensions (height and width).
*   The output grids seem to be derived from the input grids, with a focus on columns or rows.
*    The output may select or remove some of the input's rows or columns.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: 2D grid
    description: Input and output data are represented as 2D grids.
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: object
    description: contiguous area of the same color, could be line
    properties:
        -color

  - type: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels within a grid.

  - type: column
    description: A vertical line of pixels within a grid.

observations:
  - train_1:
    - input_width equals output_width
    - Each row of input is composed of all the same colors.
    - First element of each row in input becomes single element of each row in output.

  - train_2:
    - Each row of input is composed of unique colors.
    - Output is one row of all input colors

  - train_3:
      - each row is identical
      - output removes repeating colors in input row

  - train_4:
      - height of output is one less than width of input
      - each row is identical colors
      - output removes repeating colors

  - train_5:
    - input width is 4
    - output width is 1

transformation_type:
  - operation: Selection/Extraction
  - description: The transformation seems to involve selecting specific rows or columns from the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each unique row in the input grid.
2.  For each row being iterated, store the first value.
3.    Iterate through the stored values from step two, inserting each unique value on a newline in the output.

Alternative program, operating on columns

1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. Take the first value of the iterated column.
3. print the column values vertically.

Based on my current understanding, it seems that we extract each *unique* row, by using the first value in the row.
