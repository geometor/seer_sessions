Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The code correctly identifies the azure object and attempts to replace it with a red object of the same shape. However, the placement of the new red object is consistently off. The initial strategy of using the distance to the nearest edge to determine the new row, and always placing the object in the first column, is not universally correct. The examples show that the new position might have a more complex rule. The core issue seems to be in the calculation of `new_row`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and transformed output. Focus on the differences to pinpoint the exact error in positioning logic. Specifically calculate the intended `new_row` by comparing the expected and actual outcomes.
2.  **Refine Positioning Rule:** Develop a more robust rule for determining the new position of the red object. Consider alternative relationships between the original azure object's position and the new red object's position. It appears we were calculating `new_row` incorrectly, and possibly the column as well, so look for other relationships that are consistent with expected outputs.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the revised transformation rule, incorporating the corrected positioning logic.
4.  **Test and Iterate:** Generate the updated code based on the revised natural language program and repeat the testing process.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's use code execution to calculate some metrics related to object positioning.


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    if coords.size == 0:
        return None, None, None, None
    min_row, min_col = coords.min(axis=0)
    max_row, max_col = coords.max(axis=0)
    obj = grid[min_row:max_row+1, min_col:max_col+1]
    return obj, min_row, max_row, min_col

examples = [
    {
        "input": [[8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "expected": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    input_grid = np.array(example["input"])
    expected_grid = np.array(example["expected"])

    _, azure_min_row, _, azure_min_col = find_object(input_grid, 8)
    _, red_min_row, _, red_min_col = find_object(expected_grid, 2)

    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Azure object top-left corner: row={azure_min_row}, col={azure_min_col}")
    print(f"  Red object top-left corner: row={red_min_row}, col={red_min_col}")

```
```
Example 1:
  Azure object top-left corner: row=0, col=0
  Red object top-left corner: row=1, col=0
Example 2:
  Azure object top-left corner: row=0, col=1
  Red object top-left corner: row=1, col=1
Example 3:
  Azure object top-left corner: row=1, col=1
  Red object top-left corner: row=2, col=1

```
**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Replace azure object with red object."
  - object_identification:
    - "Objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color."
    - "The target object is azure (color code 8)."
    - "The replacement object is red (color code 2)."
  - transformation_rule:
    - "The shape of the red object is identical to the azure object."
    - "The red object's top-left corner is always in column 0."
    - "The red object's top-left corner row is always one greater than the azure object's top left row."
  - constraints:
     - "The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. If no azure object is found, the output grid will be all white pixels.
2.  **Determine Object Shape:** Determine the shape (height and width) of the identified azure object.
3.  **Create Red Object:** Create a red (2) object with the same shape as the azure object.
4.  **Position Red Object:** Place the top-left corner of the red object at a position where:
    *   The column is always 0.
    *   The row is one greater than the row of the top-left corner of the azure object.
5. **Populate Output Grid**: Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the original input.
6.  **Insert Red Object:** Copy the red object onto the output grid, starting at its determined position. Handle cases where the red object might extend beyond the output grid boundaries by only copying the portion that fits.
7. **Return Output Grid**: The result is the output grid.
