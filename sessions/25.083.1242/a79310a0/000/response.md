Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grids contain azure (8) and white (0) pixels, while the output grids contain red (2) and white (0) pixels. The key seems to be replacing a contiguous block of azure pixels with red pixels, maintaining the same shape and relative position, but shifting the position based on the location of the azure object in the input grid. The shape, width, height, and overall area (number of pixels) are changed.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain red (2) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Azure objects are replaced by red objects.
  - relationship: |
      The shape of the azure object in the input is maintained in the red object
      in the output.
  - relationship: "The size and relative position is maintained, the whole object is shifted."
  - action: |
       Find the azure colored object.
  - action: |
      Create a red colored object of the same shape, width and height.
  - action: |
      Place red object at the specific row and column of the new output.
  - goal: |
      Transform the input grid to the output grid by replacing the azure object with a
      red object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This constitutes the "azure object".
2.  **Determine Object Properties:** find the shape, width and height of the azure object
3.  **Create Red Object:** Based on the determined shape, create a new object of the same shape and size, where the new pixels and color red (2).
4.  **Position the Red Object:** The red object is put in a new grid in which all of the positions are white.
5. The position of the top-left corner of the shape is found by taking the row of the original top-left corner of the shape and taking the distance from that row to the nearest edge, and moving down that many spaces. If there are no rows, the object is placed at row=1.
6. The column of the top-left corner of the red shape is always in column 1.
