The transformation seems to maintain the overall shape (height and width) of the grid. The most obvious change is that some, but not all, instances of the number 6 (magenta) are replaced by the number 2 (red), while the 7s (orange) remain untouched. The core challenge is to determine the rule that dictates *which* 6s are changed to 2s. The rule appears to be spatially/positionally driven, not based on simple counting or overall frequency. It looks like a kind of \"selective replacement\" based on location.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
