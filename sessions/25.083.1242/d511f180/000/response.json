The transformation doesn't involve adding or removing rows/columns. It appears to be a localized operation, where specific digits within the input grid are replaced with other digits in the output grid. The key seems to be identifying *which* digits are changed and *why*. The change is NOT a global substitution (e.g., all 5s become 8s), as can be seen by many instances of 5, where some are changed while others are not. There is no rotation or reflection. The spatial relationship between changed numbers is important.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
