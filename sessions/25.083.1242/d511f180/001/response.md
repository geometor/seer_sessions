Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
For each cell containing the digit 5, check if the cell below, and in the same column, is not a five, and replace the five, with the value in that cell.
Copy any cell that is not a five, as is to the output grid.
If any cell is 5, and the cell below is also five, don't change the current cell, and copy it to the output grid as is.
