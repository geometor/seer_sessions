Each grid cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a manipulation of the grid's contents, specifically a rearrangement or rotation of the colored pixels, rather than a change in color values themselves. The key seems to be the relationship between the positions of non-zero pixels in the input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
