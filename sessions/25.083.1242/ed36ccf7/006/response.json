            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program, describing a simple horizontal reflection, is partially correct. It captures the idea of flipping the grid, but it doesn't fully account for the specific transformations observed in all examples. The code correctly implements the described horizontal flip, but the description itself is incomplete. The examples show a pattern that is more complex than a simple reflection. Specifically, it appears selective portions of rows or columns, and sometime full rows, are changed/moved.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the specific changes in pixel positions and colors. Pay close attention to which pixels moved and which stayed in place.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for a consistent rule that explains *all* the transformations, not just some of them. The current reflection rule is too simplistic.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified pattern, create a new, more precise natural language description of the transformation.\n4.  **Refine code:** use the updated natural language description to develop the code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using provided text results):**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, noting deviations from the simple reflection:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `9 0 0; 9 9 9; 9 9 9`\n    *   Expected: `0 9 9; 0 9 9; 9 9 9`\n    *   Observed: `0 0 9; 9 9 9; 9 9 9`\n    *   *Discrepancy:* The top-left `9` and first two elements of top row are incorrect. Only leftmost two columns were modified.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `6 6 6; 0 0 0; 6 6 0`\n    *   Expected: `6 0 0; 6 0 6; 6 0 6`\n    *   Observed: `6 6 6; 0 0 0; 0 6 6`\n    *   *Discrepancy*: The observed output is the input flipped, the expected output seems the first column copied into third, and the first element of first row copied to second element.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `0 0 9; 0 0 9; 9 9 9`\n    *   Expected: `9 9 9; 0 0 9; 0 0 9`\n    *   Observed: `9 0 0; 9 0 0; 9 9 9`\n    *   *Discrepancy*:\u00a0The observed output is input flipped. The expected output is the third column copied to the first, last element of first row copied into the second.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `2 0 2; 0 0 2; 0 2 2`\n    *   Expected: `2 2 2; 0 0 2; 2 0 0`\n    *   Observed: `2 0 2; 2 0 0; 2 2 0`\n    *   *Discrepancy*: Observed output is input flipped. The transformation seems to change the values.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
