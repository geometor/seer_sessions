facts:
  - rule: "If all rows are identical, the output is the first row of the input replaced with gray (5), and all other cells are white (0)."
  - rule: "If the rows are not all identical, and there is a top-left to bottom-right diagonal of the same color, the output is a gray (5) diagonal matrix with white (0) elsewhere."
  - rule: "If the rows are not all identical, and there is a top-right to bottom-left anti-diagonal of the same color, the output is a gray (5) anti-diagonal matrix with white (0) elsewhere."
  - rule: "If none of the above conditions are met, default output is an all white (0) grid. This needs review."
  - observation: "Examples 1, 2 and 5 have non-identical rows, but neither a diagonal nor anti-diagonal, output is not all white, but a grey diagonal matrix"
  - precedence: identical_rows > diagonal > anti_diagonal > default
