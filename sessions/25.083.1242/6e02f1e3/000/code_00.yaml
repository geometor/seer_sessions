facts:
  - observation: "All input and output grids are 3x3."
  - object: "Input grid, a 3x3 matrix of color values (integers 0-9)."
  - object: "Output grid, a 3x3 matrix of color values."
  - property: "Input grid colors vary (red, green, blue, yellow)."
  - property: "Output grid colors are primarily white (0) and gray (5)."
  - action: "Transformation from input grid to output grid."
  - relationship: "The output grid's gray (5) pixel placement is sometimes diagonal (top-left to bottom-right, or bottom-left to top-right)."
  - condition: "If all rows are identical in the input, output has 5's across top row, else if the grid has an anti-diagonal of the same color it will output a diagonal of 5s. If it has two or more rows that are unique, but the grid has a normal diagonal it will output an anti-diagonal of 5s. Otherwise the output is all 0."
  - observation: "In examples 3 and 4, identical inputs produce different outputs. Example 5's input also only differs by the final row from the previous two, but has a different result"
