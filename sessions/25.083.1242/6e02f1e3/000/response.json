            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the task, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements of the Task**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid. The output grid seems to consist primarily of 0s (white) and 5s (gray). The positioning of the 5s appears to be related to the dimensions of the input grid and, in some cases, forms a diagonal pattern. There's a conditional element: the transformation depends on the specific arrangement and values of colors in the input grid. The relationship between train 4 and train 3 is interesting since the input is the same but the outputs different, meaning the history of inputs and outputs might matter (but likely the whole grid state not just a previous state). Pairs 1, 2 and 5 follow the same diagonal pattern.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
