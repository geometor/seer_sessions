            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs reasonably well, correctly handling cases with identical rows and the main diagonal. However, it fails on Example 2, where an anti-diagonal should be detected. The current logic prioritizes the main diagonal over the anti-diagonal, causing the error. The strategy to resolve this is to adjust the order of checks and potentially combine diagonal and anti-diagonal checks.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's analyze each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Correct. The rows are not identical, and a main diagonal exists.\n*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. The rows are not identical, no main diagonal exists, but an anti-diagonal exists. The code incorrectly identifies the main diagonal case.\n*   **Example 3:** Correct. All rows are identical.\n*   **Example 4:** Correct. All rows are identical.\n*   **Example 5:** Correct. The rows are not identical and a main diagonal is correctly identified.\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n\n"
