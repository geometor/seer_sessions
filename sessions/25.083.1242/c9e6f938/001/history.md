Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be the manipulation of orange (7) pixels within a grid. The transformation seems to involve expanding the existing orange pixels, or adding new orange pixels, in a specific pattern, while also padding the grid with additional white (0) pixels. The output grid is always wider and may have additional padding of white.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: orange_pixels
    description: Pixels with the value 7 (orange).
    properties:
      - color: orange
      - shape: Initially, individual pixels or small contiguous blocks.
  - object: white_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 (white)
    properties:
      - color: white
      - shape: form the background and padding
  - action: expansion
    description:  Orange pixels are expanded horizontally.
    details: >
        Expansion happens, creating duplicates of the existing orange pixels.
        In train_1 we double existing pixels, and in train_2 and train_3 we mirror them.

  - action: padding
    description: The grid is padded with additional columns of white pixels.
    details: >
      The number of added columns depends on the initial configuration of
      orange pixels. The width always doubles.

  - relationship: output_grid
    description: >-
      Output is derived from the input. Output width is double the input width.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Double the width:** The output grid will be twice as wide as the input.
3.  **Expand:** For each orange pixel, duplicate or mirror it, forming a larger shape.
4.  **Padding:** Pad the grid with white pixels. Add columns of white pixels to the right of the shapes to the double width.
5. **Construct Output.** Ensure added white pixels are placed such that the original shape appears in the output.

In summary: double the width of the input, mirror or duplicate, and pad with white.
