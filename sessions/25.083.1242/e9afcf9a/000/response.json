The output rows seem to be an interleaving of the input rows' elements. The numbers themselves represent colors (e.g., 3 might be green, 9 maroon, 4 yellow, 8 azure).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The first new row is formed by alternating elements from the first and second input rows, starting with the first element of the first row. The second new row is formed by alternating elements from the second and first input rows, starting with the first element of the second input row.\n\nIn more concise terms, it's a simple interleaving operation. The first output row takes elements at indices 0, 2, 4 from input row 1 and interjects elements at 0,2,4 from input row 2 at odd indices, to make a pattern. The second output row does the inverse, taking odd elements from input row 2, even from row 1.\n"
