## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two rows of single-digit numbers in the input, which are then transformed into two rows in the output. The output rows seem to be an interleaving of the input rows' elements. The numbers themselves represent colors (e.g., 3 might be green, 9 maroon, 4 yellow, 8 azure).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      elements: [list of numbers]
      length: 6
      index: [0 or 1]

actions:
  - type: interleave
    input: [row_0, row_1]
    output: [new_row_0, new_row_1]

relationships:
  - row_0:  elements are taken alternatively to create new_row_0 and new_row_1
  - row_1: elements are taken alternatively to create new_row_0 and new_row_1
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input consists of two horizontal rows of numbers, each containing six elements of the same value.
2.  **Interleave:** Create two new rows. The first new row is formed by alternating elements from the first and second input rows, starting with the first element of the first row. The second new row is formed by alternating elements from the second and first input rows, starting with the first element of the second input row.

In more concise terms, it's a simple interleaving operation. The first output row takes elements at indices 0, 2, 4 from input row 1 and interjects elements at 0,2,4 from input row 2 at odd indices, to make a pattern. The second output row does the inverse, taking odd elements from input row 2, even from row 1.
