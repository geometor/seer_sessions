Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The digit `5` (gray) seems to play a crucial role, acting almost like a "cursor" or "pointer".
*   It appears the "5" moves diagonally down and to the right, and elements in its original path in the input get "moved" along with it, and placed, in order in the same row that the `5` is on.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: cursor
    type: object
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - initial_position: (row, col)
      - movement: diagonal (down-right)

actions:
  - name: move_cursor
    description: The cursor (value 5) moves diagonally down and to the right.
  - name: transfer_values
    description: Values along the cursor's original path in input are transferred to the output grid.
  - name: align_values
    description: The moved values are placed in the same row where the moving `5` is on the output

relationships:
  - The cursor's movement dictates the rows/columns where value transfer occurs.
  - Output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "cursor":** Find the initial location of the digit `5` (gray) in the input grid. This may not be in the top-left corner.
2.  **Trace the cursor's path:** The cursor moves diagonally down and to the right. Determine the maximum diagonal path length for the `5`.
3. **Identify replacement values.** Record the values from the input, in order, from the cells where the `5` was located.
4.  **Construct the output grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled initially with 0.
5.  **Place the cursor and collected elements:** Move the cursor (5) diagonally on the output grid. Each time the `5` is placed, move to the next element in your list of input elements. Then, go back one space (left) on the row and place that next value. Continue this process until all the values in your list are exhausted.
6. **Cursor stops**: Once the cursor can't move further, you can stop.
7. **Remaining cells**: Leave any un-replaced output cell value as `0`.
