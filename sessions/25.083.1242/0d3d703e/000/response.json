The rows within each input grid are identical.\n*   **Output:** Each output is also a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers, and the rows within each output grid are identical.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to be a mapping or substitution of individual numbers. There's no apparent spatial or geometric manipulation (like rotation, reflection, etc.). The transformation is consistent across the rows of input data. The key seems to be finding a one-to-one mapping between input numbers and output numbers.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
