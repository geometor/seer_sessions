The output grid always consists of a single, repeating digit. The key seems to lie in identifying which digit from the input grid becomes the repeating digit in the output grid. There is no obvious arithmetic or geometric relationship between the input values and repeated output values. It seems related to the position or characteristics of the digits, not the specific value.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
