Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).\n*   The transformation seems to focus on the interaction between the blue (1) and gray (5) pixels, specifically in the last three rows.\n*    It looks like that where there is a '1' in the input, it is replaced by a '0' everywhere except the last row.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
