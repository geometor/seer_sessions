Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
*   The transformation seems to focus on the interaction between the blue (1) and gray (5) pixels, specifically in the last three rows.
*    It looks like that where there is a '1' in the input, it is replaced by a '0' everywhere except the last row.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.
  - colors:
      0: white
      1: blue
      5: gray
  - object_interaction: Blue (1) and Gray (5) pixels interact.
  - transformation_area: Changes mainly occur in the last three rows.
  - row_behavior: Blue (1) in the input on rows other than the last row becomes the background color in the output.
  - last_row_behavior: The last row in the output swaps positions of 1's and non 1's with their respective places in the input row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  If a cell is not in the last row, and its equal to 1, change it to 0 and put the result at the same place in output.
3.  For cells in all rows, if the value is not 1 copy the cell directly to the output grid in the same position.
4.  For the last row: The last row in the output swaps positions of 1's and non 1's with their respective places in the input row.
