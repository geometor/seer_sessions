The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with elements arranged in a 2x3 tiled layout with apparent pixel swapping. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid seem to be preserved and repositioned in the output grid. There is a relationship that is not immediately obvious relating pairs of pixels, their location and color in the input grid and corresponding pairs in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each region is the same size as the input grid.\n\n3. **Copying and Transformation**\n    - Iterate through the six regions of the output\n    - The input grid is copied to each of the 6 regions in the output grid.\n    - Create a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the coordinates and value of a pixel in the input: `pixel_data = [((row,col),value),...]`\n    - Create pairs of tuples by creating an index offset by four from the start of the list `pixel_pairs = list(zip(pixel_data,pixel_data[4:]))` e.g. `[((0, 0), 8), ((1, 1), 5)]`. These will form the swap operations\n    - Iterate through pairs of pixels from the `pixel_pairs` list.\n        -   For each region in the output:\n            - Swap the pixel values of the cell locations\n        - Example:\n          Consider the input:\n          "
