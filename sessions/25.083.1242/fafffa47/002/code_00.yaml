          The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
          Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are mapped to red (2)
          in the output grid. The location of red(2) in the
          output is determined by swapping around the values.
          All other input pixels, regardless of the input color,
          are mapped to white (0).
