1.  **Identify Green Lines:** Find all horizontal and vertical lines formed by contiguous green (3) pixels.
2.  **White Neighbor Condition for Replacement:** Within each identified green line:
    *   A green pixel is replaced with azure (8) if it meets *both* these conditions:
        1. It has at least one adjacent white pixel (up, down, left, or right).
        2. it is *not* at either end of its line segment *unless* it has at
           least two white pixels adjacent

3.  **Copy Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not part of the green lines identified in step 1, or that do not meet the conditions within a line, are copied directly from the input grid to the output grid without modification.
