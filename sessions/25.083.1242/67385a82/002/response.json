            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. The code correctly identifies green pixels and checks for adjacent white pixels, but the condition for replacing green with azure is not entirely accurate, as evidenced by the discrepancies in the test results across multiple examples. The core issue is that the rule needs refinement to better capture the nuances of *when* a green pixel should be turned azure. It's not simply about having two or more adjacent white pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each example where the transformed output doesn't match the expected output. Pay close attention to the *position* of the green pixels relative to the white pixels and other green pixels.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the analysis, modify the natural language program to more accurately describe the transformation. Consider concepts like \"enclosure\" or \"connectivity\" of white pixels around green pixels. It seems the output azure are in a line of green and that seems key.\n3. **Hypothesize, code, and test**: Use the revised natural language program to modify the transformation algorithm, test with given examples, and make more adjustments if needed.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use a combination of observation and code execution to understand the patterns, since the examples are small.\n\n*Example 1*\n\n"
