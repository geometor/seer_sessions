"""
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. Identify green (3) pixels. For each green pixel, check for adjacent white (0) pixels. Count the number of adjacent white pixels. If a green pixel has two or more adjacent white neighbors (up, down, left, or right), replace it with an azure (8) pixel in the output grid. If a green pixel has fewer than two adjacent white pixels, or if it is any other color, copy the original pixel value to the output grid. Return the modified output grid.
