Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are both grids of digits (representing colors).\n*   The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids.\n*   The output grids seem to extract a specific 2x2 section from the top left corner area of a consistent object, based upon a pattern, within each input grid.\n*   The background appears to be consistently black (0).\n*   The examples use different non-zero colors.\n*   There's a recurring pattern in the input grids: a 5x5 grid where the top-left 2x2 quadrant seems to have all its pixels in the non-zero colors, and the distribution of non-zero color pixels in this upper-left sub-grid has non-zero cells on its diagonal. The rest of the top row and left column of the input has an alternating color and black pattern, starting with color. The rest of the grid is filled with black.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
