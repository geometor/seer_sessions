            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of extracting a 2x2 subgrid from the top-left. However, the results show inconsistencies. While Example 2 works perfectly, Examples 1 and 3 have errors in pixel values, even if size of output grid is consistent. The core issue seems to be an incorrect assumption about which 2x2 subgrid to extract. The original assumption that the top-left corner is determined by input_grid[row, col] != 0 is not always correct, the provided examples don't include information to know that. Simply using the actual top-left is working.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully observe each input-output pair to identify the *precise* rule for selecting the 2x2 subgrid. It does *not* appear related to the color, but top-left corner.\n2.  **Simplify the get_corner Function**: The function should be return (0,0).\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the refined rule, emphasizing clarity and precision.\n4.  **YAML fact extraction** Create the Yaml document.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code for verification where needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Error: The top-left pixel of the extracted subgrid is at (0,1) with value 2 in the input. The extraction in the given code starts at first non-zero top-left, giving (0,1), while it should start from (0,0) of the input.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Match: True. The algorithm coincidentally works correctly here.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output shape: (2, 2)\n    *    Error: The top-left pixel of the expected subgrid in at (0,2) with value 8 in the input. The code extracts from (0,0), which doesn't follow the zero/non-zero rule. It should just be position (0,0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
