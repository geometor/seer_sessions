Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the elements within the grid, specifically a mirroring or rotation. It's not a simple color substitution.\n*   Visual inspection suggests that the output is a mirrored version of input along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
