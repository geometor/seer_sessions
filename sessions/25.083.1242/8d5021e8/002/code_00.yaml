        properties:
          - height: 3
          - width: 2

        properties:

    actions:
      - description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
        details: The output grid's height is three times the input's height, and the width is two times the input's width. The transformation appears to involve interleaving and mirroring of the input grid cells rather than simple block replication. Specifically each row seems to be constructed by reversing the sequence of the row and interleaveing it. Each row is repeated.
