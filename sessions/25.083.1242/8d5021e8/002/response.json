            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding the input grid. However, it's clear from the subsequent examples that the transformation isn't a simple expansion or replication. The code incorrectly assumes a fixed expansion factor (2x2 blocks) and doesn't correctly map the input pixels to the output. The \"Pixels Off\" metric in the results indicates significant discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs, meaning the core logic needs revision. The strategy should shift from assuming a fixed expansion to identifying the pattern of how input cells relate to output cells across all provided examples. It seems like mirroring and alternation are at play, but not simple block replication.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary):**\n\nLet's analyze each example individually to pinpoint the transformation rule.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x2 (height x width)\n    *   Output: 9x4\n    *   Input cells seem to get interleaved and mirrored.\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x2\n    *   Output: 9x4\n    *   Similar interleaving/mirroring as example 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x2\n    *   Output: 9x4\n    *    Same pattern.\n\n"
