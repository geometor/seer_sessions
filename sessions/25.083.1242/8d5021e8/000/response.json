The input grids seem to be consistently 3x2.\n*   **Output:** The output is a larger 2D grid, also of color digits. The output grids are 9x4, which is exactly three time bigger in hight and 2 times in width of the input grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve some form of replication or expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern in how the input elements are arranged in the output. It is also notable, that the input grid is present in the output. The input pixels are arranged in such manner to form 2 by 2 squares.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

For each cell (with color *c* at position *i*, *j*):\n    *   Replicate the cell as 2 x 2 square.\n    *  Determine top left corner location of each 2x2 square by multiplying original coordinates by 2 and using formula: *x=2\\*j*, *y=2\\*i*.\n    *  Fill the cells to create a 2x2 block in the output grid.\n3.  **Output:** The resulting output grid is the transformed version of the input grid.\n\nEssentially the transformation is building a grid where the input grid is sort of repeated 2x2, so there is always 4 pixels of the same color in the output.\n"
