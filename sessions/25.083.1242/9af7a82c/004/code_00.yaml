facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves re-arranging the input grid's columns into the output grid's rows.
  - input_objects: |
      Input grid: A 2D array of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - output_objects: |
      Output grid: A 2D array of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - actions:
      - reverse_columns: |
          The order of columns in the input grid is reversed.
      - transpose_and_pad: |
          The reversed columns of the input are placed as rows in the output. The output grid's dimensions are calculated based on, but may not correctly match, the input's.
      - pad_with_zeros: |
          Empty cells in the output grid are filled with 0.
  - dimension_rules:
      - output_height: Input width + 2.
      - output_width: number of non-zero pixels per column + number of columns -1.
