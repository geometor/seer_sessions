facts:
  - type: "input"
    description: "A 2D grid of integers representing colors."
    properties:
      - width: "Variable, observed as 3, 4, and 3 in the examples."
      - height: "Variable, observed as 3, 3, and 4 in the examples."
      - elements: "Integers from 0 to 9, each representing a color."
  - type: "output"
    description: "A 2D grid of integers representing colors."
    properties:
      - width: same as input height
      - height: "input width + 2"
      - elements: "Integers from 0 to 9, each representing a color."
  - relation: "transformation"
    description: "The input grid is transformed into the output grid."
    rules:
      - columns_to_rows: "Input columns, reversed, are converted to rows in output."
      - padding: "Zeros (0) are added to the output grid to fill empty cells to make input_width + 2 rows."
      - width: input height becomes the width of output
      - height: number of rows in output is input width plus 2
