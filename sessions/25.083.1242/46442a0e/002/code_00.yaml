          input: "row_1, row_2"
          output: "Create a 2x2 mirrored matrix by repeating each element of each row, and each column"

          input: "rows"
          output: "rows are mirrored and repeated, and the entire matrix is mirrored about its vertical and horizontal axes"

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - object_id: row_1
          type: row
          values: [6, 9, 9]
      transformations:
        - type: double_and_mirror
          input: rows
          output: rows are mirrored, and the entire matrix is mirrored about both vertical and horizontal axes
