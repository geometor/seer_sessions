facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is transformed into a grid four times its size (2x height and 2x width).
  - quadrant_rules:
      - top_left: |
          The top-left quadrant of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
      - top_right: |
          The top-right quadrant is a horizontal mirror image of the input grid (flipped along the vertical axis).
      - bottom_left: |
          The bottom-left quadrant is a vertical mirror image of the input grid (flipped along the horizontal axis).
      - bottom_right: |
          The bottom-right quadrant is initially a diagonal mirror image of the input grid (flipped along both axes). The modification then: replaces the last column colors of the bottom_right quadrant.
  - bottom_right_column_modification: |
      if width >=3, The colors from the last column of top_right are used to update values in the last column of bottom right except last row.
  - object_interaction: "None. All quadrants use copies of the source, no feedback."
