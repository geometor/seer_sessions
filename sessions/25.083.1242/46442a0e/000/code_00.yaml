  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable
      - elements: digits (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: larger than input_grid, potentially multiples
      - elements: digits (0-9), mirroring input_grid elements in a pattern

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to a larger size.
  - name: replicate
    description: Elements or sections of the input grid are copied and arranged in the output grid.
  - name: alternate
    description: sections from input grid are flipped and alternated

relationships:
  - input_grid elements are contained within output_grid elements, arranged in a specific pattern.
  - output_grid dimensions are related to input_grid dimensions, probably by duplication/expansion.
