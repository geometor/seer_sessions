facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and of varying dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular and smaller than input grids.
  - observation: Integers in grids represent colors.
  - observation: Colors in the output are present in the input.
  - observation: The location of the colors in the output grid does not have a direct, consistent spatial correlation with their locations in the input grid.
  - hypothesis:  The transformation selects a specific sub-region or pattern within the input grid, and the contents of this selected part forms the output.
  - hypothesis: The selection rule is not a simple cropping.
  - observation: example_1 extracts a 2x2 subgrid from near the upper left.
  - observation: example_2 extracts a 1x1 value from upper left corner.
  - observation: example_3 extracts a 2x2 subgrid, but the pattern is less apparent. It is a mix of values from upper left area.
