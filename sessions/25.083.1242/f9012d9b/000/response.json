            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is always a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (colors).  There's a variety of colors used. The dimensions of the input grid vary between examples.\n*   **Output:** The output is also a rectangular grid of single-digit integers, but significantly smaller than the input grid.  The output grid's dimensions and the integers it contains vary between examples. The output sometimes consists of a single cell and in other cases of multiple cells.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct sub-section extraction. There's no immediately obvious spatial correlation between the input and output positions. The colors in output seem to be come from upper left section of input. It appears some form of pattern recognition, or object selection, followed by extraction and resizing/repositioning, is occurring.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

It is a mix of values from upper left area.\n```"

More examples are really needed to fully understand how the sub-region is selected, or if some other more complex selection rule is being applied. Steps 3 and 4 is straight forward, but step 1 and 2 are a mystery.\n"
