The output grids seem to consist primarily of `0` (white) and `5` (gray) values. The transformation doesn't appear to involve complex spatial manipulations or geometric transformations. Instead, it seems to be a direct mapping of some kind, based on rows of matching values in input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
