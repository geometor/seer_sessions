However, the results show that this rule is incorrect for some of the examples (specifically examples 4 and 5). This indicates that the initial hypothesis about the transformation is too simplistic and needs to be revised. The strategy is to re-examine *all* examples, focusing on *why* the rule failed in some cases, and look for a more comprehensive pattern that covers all examples. The current code is producing single integer outputs, and the outputs in the examples have so far been consistent with that, which might not always be the case - we need to pay attention to the shape of outputs in the future.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nLet's look at red pixel counts for all the examples and analyze the ones that had issues:\n\n"
