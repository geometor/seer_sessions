Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are 3x3 grids.\n*   The outputs are single integers.\n*   The inputs primarily contain the values 0 (white) and 2 (red).\n*   The presence and arrangement of red pixels (2) seem crucial.\n*   The outputs are all small single digit numbers.\n*   It appears some kind of counting/summation might occur with some adjustment based on the arrangement of the pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
