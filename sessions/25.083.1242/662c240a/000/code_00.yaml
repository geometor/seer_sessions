task_description: |
  The task involves selecting a specific 3x3 block from a larger input grid and presenting it as the output grid.

observations:
  - input_grid_structure: The input grid is always divisible into 3x3 blocks.
  - output_grid_structure: The output grid is always a 3x3 block.
  - color_consistency:  Each 3x3 block in the input grid consists of pixels of the same color.
  - block_selection_criteria: The selected block in output matches exactly to one of the 3x3 block in input.

  - example_1:
    input_blocks:
        block_1: [[8, 9, 8], [9, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]] # mixed colors
        block_2: [[2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]] # mixed colors
        block_3: [[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 3], [3, 3, 3]] # mixed colors
    output: "block_3"
  - example_2:
    input_blocks:
      block_1: [[1, 5, 5], [5, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1]] # mixed colors
      block_2: [[3, 3, 3], [3, 6, 3], [3, 6, 6]] # mixed colors
      block_3: [[7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 2], [7, 2, 2]] # mixed colors
    output: "block_2"

  - example_3:
      input_blocks:
        block_1: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3]] # mixed colors
        block_2: [[5, 7, 7], [7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 5]] # mixed colors
        block_3: [[8, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1]] # mixed colors
      output: "block_3"

  - example_4:
      input_blocks:
        block_1: [[8, 8, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 8]] # mixed colors
        block_2: [[1, 1, 3], [1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1]] # mixed colors
        block_3: [[6, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 6]] # mixed colors
      output: "block_1"
