The input grids appear to be composed of 3x3 blocks of single colors. The output grid consistently corresponds to one of these 3x3 blocks from the input grid. The selection of which 3x3 block to present in the input seems to be based on the colors in that 3x3 block.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
