            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (selecting the bottom-right 3x3 block) works for examples 1 and 3, but fails for examples 2 and 4. This indicates that the rule is too specific and doesn't capture the underlying pattern across all examples. The strategy needs to shift from a fixed positional rule (bottom-right) to a rule that identifies the correct 3x3 block based on some characteristic *within* the input grid. The variation between the correct outputs across examples is suggestive of a relationship among the inputs, or even with fixed positions within those input grids.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine examples 2 and 4 where the current rule fails. Look for patterns *within* the input grids that correlate with the correct output grids. Is there a color, a shape, or a repeated pattern that consistently defines the output block across *all* examples?\n2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the analysis, formulate a new hypothesis that's more general and considers the content of the input, not just its dimensions.\n3.  **Express as Natural Language Program:** Translate the revised hypothesis into a clear, concise natural language program.\n4.  **Prepare for Coding:** Develop a YAML that is consistent with the program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code when needed):**\n\nLet's examine each example individually, focusing on the relationship between input and output, particularly the errors. I will build up the information in stages.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Result: Correct.\n    *   Observation: Bottom-right 3x3 block is the correct output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The expected output is in the *middle* vertical section, matching color grey (3). The returned value matches color purple (7).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Result: Correct.\n    *   Observation: Bottom-right 3x3 block is the correct output.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The correct output is in the *top* vertical section, matching color purple (8) in first row, blue (4) in rows two and three. The returned value matches color light-blue (6) in first row, red (2) for rows two and three.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
