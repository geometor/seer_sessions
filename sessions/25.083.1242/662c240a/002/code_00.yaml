    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - source: derived from input_grid

actions:
  - name: identify_output_block
    description: Determine the 3x3 block within the input_grid that becomes the output_grid.
    criteria:
      - vertical_position_varies: "The correct 3x3 section can be at the top, middle, or bottom of the input."
      - color_consistency: "The correct section can be determined, but no consistent rule has been determined."
  - name: extract_block
    description: Extract the identified 3x3 block.
    method: "Using array slicing."
