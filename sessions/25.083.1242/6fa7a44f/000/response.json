The transformation seems to be a form of reflection or mirroring, but not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. It appears the input grid is reflected across a horizontal axis *and* the order of rows in reflection is reversed. The size of output grid is different from input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
