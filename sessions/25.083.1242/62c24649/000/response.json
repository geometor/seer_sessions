The output grid appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input grid. The scaling factor seems to be 2x in both dimensions (width and height). The output grid is created by a 2x2 duplication of the input. The copied blocks are mirrored along a diagonal axis.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
