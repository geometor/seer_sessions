Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and develop a perception of the task, document facts, and formulate a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The output grid appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input grid. The scaling factor seems to be 2x in both dimensions (width and height). The output grid is created by a 2x2 duplication of the input. The copied blocks are mirrored along a diagonal axis.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: The original grid to be transformed.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: The transformed grid, larger than the input grid.
      - relationship:  Derived from input_grid by scaling and mirroring.
  - transformation: scaling
    properties:
      - factor: 2
      - dimensions: both width and height
      - description: Each pixel in the input_grid is duplicated to form a 2x2 block in output_grid.
  - transformation: mirroring
    properties:
      - axis: diagonal
      - description: The 2x2 duplication is mirrored along the diagonal
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the width and twice the height of the input grid.

2.  **Duplication and mirroring:** For each pixel in the input grid:

    *   Copy the pixel's value to a 2x2 block in the output_grid, filling four corresponding positions:
        *   Top-left: Directly scaled position.
        *   Top-right: Mirrored horizontally.
        *   Bottom-left: Mirrored vertically.
        *   Bottom-right: Mirrored both horizontally and vertically (same as original due to mirroring).

3.  Specifically, the algorithm follows the following process:
    *    Iterate through each cell (i, j) of input_grid.
    *   output\_grid\[2\*i][2\*j] = input\_grid\[i][j]
    *   output\_grid\[2\*i+1][2\*j] = input\_grid\[i][j]
    *   output\_grid\[2\*i][2\*j+1] = input\_grid\[i][j]
    *   output\_grid\[2\*i+1][2\*j+1] = input\_grid\[i][j]
