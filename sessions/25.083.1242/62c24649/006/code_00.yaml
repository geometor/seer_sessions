facts:
  - observation: Each input grid is expanded to an output grid with twice the dimensions.
    evidence: "The output grid's dimensions are consistently double the input grid's dimensions in all examples."
  - observation: The output grid appears to be constructed by a 2x2 duplication of the input grid's cells.
    evidence: "Examining the output rows and columns reveals patterns of duplication and mirroring from the input grid."
  - observation: The top and bottom rows of the output grid often have identical or mirrored values.
    evidence: 'Example 1: Input Row 0 matches Output Rows 0 and 5. Example 2: Input row 0 matches output rows 0 and 5. Example 3: Input Row 0 matches Output Rows 0 and 5'
  - observation: The transformation involves a combination of duplication and mirroring of rows and columns.
    evidence: The output includes both identical copies (duplication) and reversed sequences (mirroring) of the input rows and columns.
  - observation: The input grid acts as a "tile", and a 2x2 grid of these "tiles" are constructed.
    evidence: "Visual inspection of examples and code execution shows duplication and mirroring."
  - observation: The output grid seems to be built by tiling the input grid, with the original in the top-left, horizontal reflection in the top-right, vertical reflection in bottom-left, and both in bottom-right.
    evidence: The tool output shows mirrored rows and columns.
