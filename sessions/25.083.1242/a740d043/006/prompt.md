"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-blue (non-1) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically as part of the same object.
2.  **Remove Background:** Conceptually remove all blue pixels (value 1). These act as separators.
3.  **Create Bounding Boxes:** Determine the bounding box for each object. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle that fully encloses the object.
4.  **Vertical Stacking:** Stack the objects vertically. Maintain alignment of the object as if within its original bounding box. The height of the output grid is the sum of the heights of the bounding box of all objects, and its width is the maximum width of all bounding boxes.
