Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids seem to consist primarily of the color blue (1) with some other colors forming shapes within the blue background. The output grids appear to extract and condense these non-blue shapes, removing the blue background and sometimes adjusting the arrangement. The output dimensions vary between examples, suggesting the transformation isn't a fixed-size reduction. There's a change of dimensions of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are larger than output grids."
  - observation: "Input grids mostly consist of blue (1) pixels."
  - observation: "Non-blue pixels within the input form contiguous shapes."
  - observation: "Output grids contain only the non-blue colors from the input."
  - observation: "Blue (1) pixels are removed in the output."
  - observation: "The arrangement of non-blue pixels changes between input and output."
  - observation: "The shapes inside of the input grids are all of solid colors."
  - observation:  "The non-blue pixels are adjacent."
  - relationship: "Output grid dimensions are determined by the extent of non-blue pixels in the input."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Blue Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels that are not blue (value 1).
2.  **Extract Non-Blue Shapes:** Group contiguous non-blue pixels into distinct shapes.
3. **Remove the background:** Remove all blue pixels.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a new grid. The dimensions of the new grid
    are determined by the size and number of non-blue pixel groups found.
5.  **Populate Output:** Place the extracted non-blue shapes into the output
    grid. There are potentially multiple groups of pixels - stack them
    vertically. Fill the spaces between the pixel groups with white (0).
6. Iterate until all pixel groups are arranged.
