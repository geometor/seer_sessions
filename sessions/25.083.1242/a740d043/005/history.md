1.  **Identify and Separate Objects:** Scan the input grid. Identify distinct groups of contiguous non-blue pixels (pixels with values other than 1). Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically as part of the same group. Each of those group will be one object.
2.  **Remove Background:** Remove all blue pixels (value 1).
3. **Arrange Objects:** Create a new grid. The height is the sum of the height of each object. The width should be the maximum width of all object.
4.  **Populate Output:** Place each extracted object into the output grid. Stack the object vertically. The objects should be arranged in their original horizontal order, relative to each other, padded by empty (value 0) columns where necessary to reflect their original separation.
5.  **Iterate:** Continue placing object until there are no more groups.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and code.

**General Assessment:**

The code works well for examples 1 and 3, where the objects are neatly separated by blue (1) pixels and can be stacked vertically without overlap. However, it fails on example 2, which presents two non-blue, non-overlapping, and horizontally separated objects. The current code stacks objects one on top of the other, but example 2 demonstrates a requirement for them to be placed side-by-side, each in their own little bounding boxes.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Example 2 Analysis:** We need to closely examine example 2 to understand how objects are positioned when they are not directly above or below each other.
2.  **Bounding Boxes**: Consider each object as a bounding box and check that they preserve their alignment within their respective bounding boxes.
3.  **Refine Object Placement:** The natural language program and code need to be updated to account for placing objects vertically.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

First I will simply examine the shapes.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-blue (non-1) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically as part of the same object.
2.  **Remove Background:** Conceptually remove all blue pixels (value 1). These act as separators.
3.  **Create Bounding Boxes:** Determine the bounding box for each object. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle that fully encloses the object.
4.  **Vertical Stacking:** Stack the objects vertically. Maintain alignment of the object as if within its original bounding box. The height of the output grid is the sum of the heights of the bounding box of all objects, and its width is the maximum width of all bounding boxes.

This revised program addresses the core issue in Example 2 by explicitly handling each object within its own bounding box.
