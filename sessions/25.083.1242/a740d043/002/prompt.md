"""
1.  **Identify Non-Blue Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels that are not blue (value 1).
2.  **Extract Non-Blue Shapes:** Group contiguous non-blue pixels into distinct shapes.
3. **Remove the background:** Remove all blue pixels.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a new grid. The dimensions of the new grid
    are determined by the size and number of non-blue pixel groups found.
5.  **Populate Output:** Place the extracted non-blue shapes into the output
    grid. There are potentially multiple groups of pixels - stack them
    vertically. Fill the spaces between the pixel groups with white (0).
6. Iterate until all pixel groups are arranged.
