facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are larger than output grids."
  - observation: "Input grids mostly consist of blue (1) pixels."
  - observation: "Non-blue pixels within the input form contiguous shapes."
  - observation: "Output grids contain only the non-blue colors from the input."
  - observation: "Blue (1) pixels are removed in the output."
  - observation: "The arrangement of non-blue pixels changes between input and output."
  - observation: "The shapes inside of the input grids are all of solid colors."
  - observation:  "The non-blue pixels are adjacent."
  - relationship: "Output grid dimensions are determined by the extent of non-blue pixels in the input."
