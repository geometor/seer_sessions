The input grids seem to consist primarily of the color blue (1) with some other colors forming shapes within the blue background. The output grids appear to extract and condense these non-blue shapes, removing the blue background and sometimes adjusting the arrangement. The output dimensions vary between examples, suggesting the transformation isn't a fixed-size reduction. There's a change of dimensions of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
