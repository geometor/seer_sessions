observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
    dimensions: variable (but consistent within each example pair)
  - type: integers
    description: Cell values range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Non-zero values can be seen as objects.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a specific rule.
  - type: rule
    properties:
      - description: "The last column of the input grid dictates the expansion"
      - details: "rows with last column value of zero are ignored, the non zero values in the last column dictate which rows from the input are replicated to output"
      - columns: "non zero values from input are vertically expanding in output, mirroring values downwards from the last column"
