The transformation seems to involve replicating a certain pattern or rule from the input to the output. It appears that the non-zero values in the last column of the input are playing a key role in what parts of input get mirrored in the output. Also, rows that contain all zeros seem to be ignored, in other words, are not part of the transformation rule.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
