objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: list of lists, representing rows of the grid
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors

actions:
  - name: merge_rows
    description: >
      Combines elements from a "source" row into a "target" row,
      replacing zeros in the target row with corresponding non-zero values
      from the source row.
    trigger: >
      A row is a source row if it has any non-zero elements.
      A row is a target if it directly follows a source row. Subsequent target
      rows are also affected until we get to next source row or the end
      of the grid.
    constraints: >
      Only zeros in the target row are replaced.
      The last element of the source row is copied into the target row, even if target row last value is zero.
