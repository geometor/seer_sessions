The subsequent tests reveal that the logic is incorrect. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify when and how to modify subsequent rows. It seems to be appending rows unnecessarily and not performing the merging operation as intended across all applicable cases.  The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples to understand the *precise* conditions under which rows are modified. The current code's logic regarding the last element of the row being non-zero is likely a misinterpretation. The relationship between *all* elements, not just the last, needs consideration.\n2.  **Identifying the True Trigger:** Determine the *actual* condition that triggers the modification of a subsequent row. This is the most crucial step.\n3.  **Refining the Merge Logic:** Ensure the merge logic correctly replaces zeros in the target row with corresponding non-zero values from the source row.\n4. **Simplify logic**: The current implementation contains excessive loops, let's try to simplify.\n\n**Gathering Metrics and Observations**\n\nI'll use code execution to calculate a few simple metrics about the input grids. These metrics might help reveal patterns.\n\n"
