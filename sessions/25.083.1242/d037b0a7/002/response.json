However, the results indicate this approach is flawed. It sometimes adds extra, incorrect rows (Examples 1 & 2) and at other times doesn't perform the required expansion (Example 3). The core issue is that the logic doesn't accurately capture the relationship between rows and how they are combined and modified. The strategy should be to revisit the examples, derive correct relationships, and find a consistent pattern that relates input and output rows. Specifically, it should only consider non-zero values of last columns, as those appear to always drive the actions in the output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's examine each example using visual comparisons and derive quantitative metrics where relevant.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
