    description: The input grid's pattern is copied diagonally.
    details: >
        The entire input grid is replicated, starting at the top-left
        corner (0,0) of the output grid. Subsequent copies are offset
        diagonally, one row down and one column to the right.
        This process continues until the entire output grid is filled.
