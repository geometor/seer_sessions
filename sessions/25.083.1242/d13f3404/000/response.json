The input grid seems to contain a pattern of non-zero color values, while the rest of the grid consists of zeros (white pixels). The output grid appears to replicate this input pattern diagonally, extending it downwards and rightwards. The dimensions of the output grid are significantly larger than those of the input grid. There is a sliding and expanding nature of the input data into a much larger space, and replication of original data.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The number of columns in the output grid follows the same rule.\n\n2.  **Iterate through Input Grid:** For each cell in the input grid, starting from the top-left (0,0) and moving row by row:\n\n3.  **Diagonal Replication:**\n    *   Place the value of the current input cell in the output grid at the corresponding position.\n    *   For each subsequent diagonal step (down and to the right), copy the value from the input cell to the new output cell. Each (row, col) of the original input maps to a set of cells in the output, where the coordinates of an output cell are found by adding an offset `k` to both row and col, where `k` ranges from 0 to `min(input_rows, input_cols) -1 `\n\n4.  **Complete Output:** The result is an output grid with the input pattern replicated diagonally.\n"
