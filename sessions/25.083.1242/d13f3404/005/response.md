"""
The transformation rule replicates each element of the input grid diagonally within the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are calculated by adding the number of rows and columns of the input grid and subtracting 1.  For every cell in the input grid, its value is copied to multiple locations in the output grid. These locations are determined by adding the same offset `k` to both the row and column indices of the original cell. The offset `k` starts at 0 and increases, creating the diagonal replication.  `k` must be within the bounds of the output grid. Empty cells in the output grid remain 0.
