objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x cols
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: (input_rows + input_cols - 1) x (input_rows + input_cols - 1)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

actions:
  - name: replicate_diagonally
    description: Each element of the input grid is replicated diagonally in the output grid.
    details:
      - The input grid effectively "slides" along the main diagonal of the output grid.
      - Each input element is copied to a series of cells on a diagonal in output.
      - input[i,j] populates the output diagonal starting at output[i,j].
