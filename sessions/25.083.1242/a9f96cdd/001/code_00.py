"""
Locate the red (2) pixel within the input grid. Remove the red pixel. Based on location of the removed red pixel,
introduce a set of specific colored pixels (3, 6, 8, and 7) at predetermined positions relative to the original red
pixel's location. The rule that maps these locations appears to be complex and inconsistent across the provided
examples. The set of pixels to draw based on the original location is defined as a series of conditional spatial
relationships.
