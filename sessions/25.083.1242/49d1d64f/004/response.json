However, it's clear that the border creation logic is incorrect. Instead of simply adding a border of '0's, the border is constructed by overlapping the duplicated grid's edges. The output grid is one row and one column larger than the duplicated grid, and the duplicated grid's edges form the border. The current code is adding extra rows, columns, and zero values that are out of place.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Dimensions:** Double-check the expected output dimensions for each example. The report says \"Size Correct: False\", I want to double check those values.\n2.  **Border Logic:** Precisely analyze how the '0' border is formed in each example.\n3.  **Object Identification:** Identify if we can consider the input grid as a single object being manipulated, or are there multiple objects at play. In this case, it seems to be a single object (the grid) being transformed.\n4.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program based on the refined understanding of border creation and dimensions.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Validate Assumptions:**\n\nLet's get the dimensions of the input and expected output grids for each example.\n\n"
