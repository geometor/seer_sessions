Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was on the right track by duplicating rows and columns, which is a core part of the transformation. However, it's clear that the border creation logic is incorrect. Instead of simply adding a border of '0's, the border is constructed by overlapping the duplicated grid's edges. The output grid is one row and one column larger than the duplicated grid, and the duplicated grid's edges form the border. The current code is adding extra rows, columns, and zero values that are out of place.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Dimensions:** Double-check the expected output dimensions for each example. The report says "Size Correct: False", I want to double check those values.
2.  **Border Logic:** Precisely analyze how the '0' border is formed in each example.
3.  **Object Identification:** Identify if we can consider the input grid as a single object being manipulated, or are there multiple objects at play. In this case, it seems to be a single object (the grid) being transformed.
4.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program based on the refined understanding of border creation and dimensions.

**Gather Metrics and Validate Assumptions:**

Let's get the dimensions of the input and expected output grids for each example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate Rows:** Create an intermediate grid by duplicating each row of the input grid. Each row appears twice in a row.
2.  **Duplicate Columns:** Create another intermediate grid by duplicating each column of the row-duplicated grid. Each column from the row-duplicated grid will appear twice in a row.
3. **Create Output Grid**: Create an output grid that's one row and one column larger than the grid resulting from column duplication.
4. **Overlap/Border:** Place the twice-duplicated grid into the output grid, such that the duplicated-grid is positioned at indices \[0,0]. This means the right and bottom edge of the twice-duplicated grid become the border.
