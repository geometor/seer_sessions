Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input is a rectangular grid of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Output:** The output is a larger rectangular grid. It appears to be an expansion of the input grid. The original input grid's values are present in the output, but duplicated and surrounded by a border of '0' (white) pixels.  The expansion seems to involve both duplicating the input grid's rows and columns and adding a border.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid with dimensions varying across examples.
    properties:
      - values: Single-digit integers (0-9).
      - structure: 2D array.

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid with dimensions larger than the input grid.
    properties:
      - values: Single-digit integers (0-9), including all values from the input grid.
      - structure: 2D array.
      - relationship_to_input: Contains a duplicated and bordered version of the input grid.

  - type: transformation
    description: Expansion and bordering of the input grid.
    actions:
      - duplicate_rows: Each row in the input grid is duplicated once vertically.
      - duplicate_columns: Each column in the input grid is duplicated once horizontally.
      - add_border: A border of '0' (white) pixels is added around the expanded grid, one pixel thick.
  - type: object
    description: Each colored pixel in the grids.
    properties:
       - color_id: a number 0-9.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate Rows:** For each row in the input grid, create an identical copy of that row immediately below it.
2.  **Duplicate Columns:** For each column in the *resulting* grid (after row duplication), create an identical copy of that column immediately to the right of it.
3.  **Add Border:** Create a new, larger grid that is one pixel wider and one pixel taller (in each direction) than the grid resulting from steps 1 and 2. Fill the outermost rows and columns of this new grid with '0' (white). Copy the grid from step 2 into the center of this bordered grid.

Essentially, the process is: double the input rows, double the input (doubled rows) columns, then add a zero border around all.
