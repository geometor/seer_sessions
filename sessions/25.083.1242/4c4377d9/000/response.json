The input grids appear to have a consistent size and internal structure. There seems to be a pattern related to mirroring or reflecting a part of the grid combined with a vertical extension, since the output grid's height is always double of the height of the input grid. The transformation involves rearranging existing elements rather than introducing new colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This mirrored image is not directly placed in the output.\n2.  **Vertical Extension:** The output grid is created by first copying the input grid's top row to the output grids bottom row. The output is constructed, such that height is double the input.\n3.  **Grid Construction:** The input grid is replicated by extending the reversed rows to the top.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes input grid and mirrors it on the x axis, combining them by making input the bottom half of the output.\n"
