facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain digits 0-9, representing different colors.
  - observation: |
      Output grids primarily contain digits 6 and 0.
  - observation: |
       Input colors 3 (green) and 4 (yellow) becomes 6 (magenta) in output
  - relationship: |
      The output grid dimensions are often, but not always, smaller than the input grid dimensions. Seems to consistently be rows x (columns / 2)
  - transformation_type: Color replacement, specifically (3 and 4) -> 6
  - object_interaction: input_grid elements are evaluated based on the grid
