The output grids predominantly feature the digit '6' (magenta) and '0' (white).\n*   **Dominant Colors:** The input grids seem to focus on colors '4' (yellow), '3' (green), and '0' (white). The output grids mostly use '6' (magenta) and '0' (white).\n*\t**Spatial Relationship:** The transformation appears to involve a spatial mapping, possibly a reduction or simplification of the input. There seems to be a replacement, specifically color 4 (yellow) and color 3(green) are both replaced with color 6 (magenta).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
