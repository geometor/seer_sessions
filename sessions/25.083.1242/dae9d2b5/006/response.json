            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code is close but has a flaw in how it handles the \"propagation\" of the magenta color. It seems to be over-applying the rule, turning too many white (0) pixels to magenta (6). The core issue is that *all* white cells are changing to magenta if *any* green or yellow are to their right, but the actual rule is more specific.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Careful Re-examination of Examples:** We need to meticulously examine *each* example, paying close attention to *which* white pixels turn magenta and *why*. This means looking at precise pixel positions and relationships.\n2.  **Refine Propagation Rule:** The natural language program must be updated to specify the *exact* conditions under which a white pixel changes. It's not enough to say \"any green or yellow to the right\"; we likely need a concept of a *contiguous* region or a more specific spatial relationship.\n3.  **Iterative Testing:** After revising the natural language program, we will generate new code and repeat the testing process.\n\n**Gathering Metrics:**\n\nI'll use Python to extract some specific information from each example, focusing on the white pixels and their relationship to green/yellow pixels. It's difficult to summarize *all* of the critical data as metrics, but these checks will verify my understanding of the input grids.\n\n"
