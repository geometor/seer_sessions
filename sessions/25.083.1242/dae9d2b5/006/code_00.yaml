observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - width: variable, up to 30
      - height: variable, up to 30
    actions:
      - resize: output width is half of input width
      - transform_pixels: based on color and relative position
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), maroon (9)
      - position: row and column index
    actions:
      - change_color:  white can change to magenta based on neighboring pixels. Green and yellow always become magenta.
  - spatial_rule: "A white pixel changes to magenta IF a green or yellow pixel is within it's input slice"
