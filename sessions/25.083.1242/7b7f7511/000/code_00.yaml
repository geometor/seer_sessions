facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output are grids of integers between 1 and 9, with 0 allowed
      but not in this example.
  - object_identification: Each integer represents a colored pixel.
  - object_property: color - Determined by the integer value.
  - object_property: position - Defined by row and column indices within the grid.
  - transformation: Reduction in grid width; height is preserved.
  - transformation_detail: Columns are removed to shrink the grid, retaining specific columns' data.
  - relationship: Output grid's colored pixel positions and colors are preserved from a subset of the input.
  - pattern: The transformation consistently removes every other column starting with the last column.
