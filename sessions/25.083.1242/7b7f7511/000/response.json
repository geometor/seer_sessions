The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the input grid to create the output grid. The specific reduction appears consistent: the output grid dimensions are roughly half the input grid dimensions, achieved by removing columns, not rows. The values within the grids, which represent object colors seem to be retained directly, their relative positions are also maintained in the reduction.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each row, **select** elements (colored pixels) from left-to-right, skipping every other column, beginning the skip with the last (right-most) element.\n3.  **Construct** a new row in the output grid using these selected elements.\n4.
