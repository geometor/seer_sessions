objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - cells:
      type: individual elements within the grid
      properties:
          color: represented by the integer value
  - diagonals:
        type: lines of cells
        properties:
            main_diagonal: cells from top-left to bottom-right
            anti_diagonal: cells from top-right to bottom-left
relationships:
    - cell_color: relationship between a cell and its integer value
    - cell_position: relationship between a cell and its row/column index
    - diagonal_composition: which cells make up each diagonal
actions:
  - counting: determining the number of specific cell configurations
  - diagonal check: a check for non-zero, uniform values that define the x
