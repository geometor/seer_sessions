The input grids contain the value `5` (gray) which seems to act as a key or delimiter. The output grids are the same dimensions as the input grids. The output grids consist almost entirely of `0` (white), except for `2` (red) values. The `2` (red) values in the output seem to correspond to the locations of the `1` (blue) values that are directly adjacent to `5` (gray) in the input grid, but with a shift.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
