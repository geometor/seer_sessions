            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"Duplicate each column of the input grid to its right, resulting in an output grid with double the width\") was a good starting point, but the code implementation has a flaw. It seems to be appending columns in the wrong order, or perhaps misinterpreting which axis represents columns. The consistent `Pixels Off` and `Size Correct` results suggest the core idea of duplication is correct, but the arrangement is wrong. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  Carefully examine the provided input, expected output, and transformed output for *each* example.\n2.  Pinpoint exactly *which* pixels are incorrect. This might reveal a consistent pattern in the error.\n3.  Revisit the code's logic, especially the indexing and appending, to fix the column arrangement.\n4. rephrase the natural language program for clarity\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution for precise details):**\n\nI need a structured way to compare the input, expected output, and transformed output. I will build small matrices and execute the code block to perform a precise diff, counting pixels in each, and report the differences.\n\n"
