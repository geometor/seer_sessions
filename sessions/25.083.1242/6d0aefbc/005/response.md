The transformation rule is: The output grid consists of the original input grid, followed immediately by a complete, identical copy of the input grid appended to the right. The output grid's width is twice the input grid's width, and the height remains the same. The order of the columns is preserved in both the original and duplicated sections. In essence, the entire input grid is duplicated horizontally.
