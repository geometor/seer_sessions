The transformation seems to involve a kind of mirroring or duplication of the input grid's rows and columns, resulting in an output grid that is double the width of the input. The duplicated pixels maintain their original values, appearing as reflections across a vertical axis in the center of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
