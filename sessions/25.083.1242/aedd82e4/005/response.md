"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all pixels with the color red (value 2) and white (value 0) within the input grid. Store their coordinates.

2.  **Find Adjacent Pairs:**
    *   Iterate through each red pixel.
    *   For each red pixel, check its adjacent pixels (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
    * Create pairs of (red pixel, adjacent white pixel).

3.  **Select Target Pixel:**
    * If there are no red pixels with adjacent white pixels, no transformation occurs.
    *   If there are multiple (red pixel, adjacent white pixel) candidates, select the target pixel using the following rules:
    
      - Select the red pixel furthest to the bottom and then to the right of the red pixels sharing the same adjacent white pixel

4.  **Transform:** Change the color of the *selected* red pixel to blue (value 1).

5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
