objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: pixel
    type: element within the grid
    properties:
      color: integer value (0-9)
      row: row index
      column: column index
  - name: red_pixels
    type: list
    description: List of pixels with color value 2
  - name: white_pixels
    type: list
    description: List of pixels with the color value 0

actions:
  - name: find_adjacent
    input: grid, row, column
    output: list of adjacent pixels (including diagonals)
  - name: identify_target
    input: red_pixels, white_pixels, grid
    output: coordinates (row, column) of the target red pixel
    rules:
      - "Select red pixels adjacent to white pixels"
      - "Further refine selection based on a rule combining 'lower-rightmost' and connectivity to other red and white pixels (to be determined)"
  - name: change_color
    input: grid, coordinates, new_color
    output: modified grid
    action: changes the pixel at the given coordinates to the new color
  - name: transform_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: transformed_grid
