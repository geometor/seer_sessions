"""
1. Find all red pixels (value 2).
2. Find all white pixels (value 0).
3. Identify Red Pixels Adjacent to White: From the list of red pixels, identify those that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one white pixel.
4. Select Target: If multiple such red pixels exist, select the "lower-right most".  This is the red pixel with the largest row index, and among those, the largest column index. The selection is limited to those that have white neighbors.
5. Transform: Change the color of the selected red pixel to blue (value 1).
6. Output: Return the modified grid.
