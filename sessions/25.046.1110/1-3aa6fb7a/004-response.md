Okay, I've analyzed the second example and updated the Python code. The key change is placing the blue pixel to the *left* of the rightmost-uppermost azure pixel, instead of to the right. The provided code and explanations accurately reflect this change and the overall transformation logic. The code also includes a test case with the second example's input and expected output, and it passes the test.
