The condition for changing an azure pixel to a blue one is dependent on the size of the azure objects, not on adjacency.\n\nThe core rule appears to be: \"Change the rightmost-uppermost azure pixel of an azure object to blue, if that azure object is made out of more than one pixel.\"\n\nThis revised description is more precise and accurately captures the observed transformation. It clearly defines the action (changing a pixel's color) and the condition under which it occurs.\n"
