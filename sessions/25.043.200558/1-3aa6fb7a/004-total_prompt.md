--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Corner Positions:** Find the two '8' (blue) objects that exist exclusively in the corners of the shapes (2x2 groups) formed by color '8'. These would be in the most upper-left and most bottom-right positions in their respective 2x2 squares.

3. **Apply Color Change** Change the color to '1' of the corners in the previous step.

4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects, remain unchanged.

**In summary:**
The inputs shows two 2x2 squares of color 8.
Locate the top left object of the 2x2 square on the left, and the bottom right corner on the square on the right.
Change those colors to '1'.
All other cells are unchanged.

Okay, I understand the task. Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the resulting Python code:

**Thought Process:**

1.  **Understanding the Rule:** The natural language program clearly describes a targeted color change within specific 2x2 squares of color '8'. The key is identifying the correct corner pixels (top-left of the left square, bottom-right of the right square) and changing only their color to '1'.

2.  **Implementation Strategy:**
    *   I'll create a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original.
    *   I need to iterate through the grid to find the 2x2 squares of color '8'.
    *    Once a square is found, I change the top-left pixel of the left hand square to '1', and bottom-right of the right square to 1.

3.  **Testing:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is crucial. It allows me to directly test the `transform` function with the provided input and expected output, giving immediate feedback on correctness.

**Python Code:**


```python

    # check through grid looking for 2x2 color 8 squares

        print("Transformed Output:", output_grid)

    assert output_grid == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
```
Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Scan the input grid to identify all 2x2 squares composed of objects with color '8' (cyan/light blue).

2.  **Find Top-Left and Bottom-Right Corners in each square:**
    Within each identified 2x2 square locate the cell with the color 8 at two positions:
     * The most top-left '8'.
     * The most bottom-right '8'.

3.  **Conditional Color Change** For *each* 2x2 square of '8's, change the color of the objects in the previous step to '1'.

4. **Preserve Unrelated Cells:** The rest of the grid stays the same.

**In Summary:**
The rule is very similar to the first, however this time ALL the top-left and bottom-right corners of the identified 2x2 squares (composed by '8's) are transformed, changing color from '8' to '1'.

**Python Code (Updated):**

```python

**Key Changes and Explanation:**

*   **Simplified Logic:** The code is now much simpler. Instead of storing the squares in a list and then figuring out which is which, we directly apply the transformation *within* the loop that detects the 2x2 squares.
*   **Direct Transformation:**  As soon as a 2x2 square of '8' is found, its top-left (`output_grid[i][j]`) and bottom-right (`output_grid[i + 1][j + 1]`) elements are changed to '1'.
*   **No More Conditional Logic (for square selection):** We no longer need to determine which are "selected".  *All* detected squares are transformed.
* **Correct Output**: The code now produces the expected result.

This revised code directly implements the core rule discovered in the natural language program, making it both more concise and easier to understand.  It correctly handles all 2x2 squares of the specified color.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**
