Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure-colored components and an isolated azure pixel.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Identical to input, Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure-colored components and an isolated azure pixel.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single pixel
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct shapes components made of azure (color 8) and a single azure pixel. The first is a vertical 2x1 rectangle at the upper left and a horizontal 1x2 shape. The isolated azure pixel is near the bottom right.

2.  **Introduce Blue Pixel**: We pain blue (color 1) the pixel on the right of any azure (color 8) pixel which has no pixel on its right.

**Transformation Rule**
The transformation consists in painting in blue (color 1) the pixels at the right of those azure pixels (color 8) at the right edge of azure shapes.

```python
"""

                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
