Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure components of various shapes and sizes.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Identical to the input grid.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixel
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains multiple azure (color 8) colored pixels, forming various disconnected shapes.

2.  **Introduce Blue Pixel:** For each azure pixel, we check the cell immediately to its right. If that cell is empty (color 0) AND it's not part of azure object, a blue pixel (color 1) is placed in the empty cell.

**Transformation Rule**
The transformation consists in painting in blue (color 1) the pixels at the right of those azure pixels (color 8) at the right edge of azure shapes.

The provided Python code should perform correctly since this logic is the same for both input/output examples.
