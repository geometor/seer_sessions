Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure components"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure components"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two single blue pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we have two separate azure (color 8) components. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle at the top-left (positions (1,1) and (2,1)), and the other is a 1x2 rectangle at the center-right, position (4,4), (4,5).

2.  **Place a Blue Pixel to the top-right of vertical Azure object and to the bottom-left of the horizontal Azure object:** For each azure component, a blue pixel (color 1) is placed.
   - The top-left azure 2x1 object gets one blue pixel added at the position immediately to its right (1,2 -> so row=1, col=1+1)
   - The center-right azure 1x2 object gets a blue pixel added at the position immediately to its left (5,5, -> so row=4+1, col=4)

3. **All Other Pixels Remain Unchanged:** All the pixels that are not azure (color 8) remain as color 0.

**In essence, the transformation rule is to locate each azure component and insert a blue pixel in a specified relative position. All other pixels are not modified.**

```python
"""
Locates azure (color 8) components in the input grid and places a blue pixel (color 1) to the right of the top-left azure object and to the left of the bottom-right azure object. All other pixels remain unchanged (color 0).
"""

import numpy as np

def find_objects(grid, color):
    """
    Finds objects of a specified color in the grid.
    Returns a list of positions where the color is found.
    """
    objects = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == color:
                objects.append((r, c))
    return objects

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)

    # Find top-left azure object (assuming it's the one with the smallest row and col)
    if azure_objects:

      # Sort by row and then by column
      azure_objects.sort()

      top_left_object = []
      center_right_object = []

      #assume the azure objects appear at the top-left first
      if (azure_objects[0][0] + 1, azure_objects[0][1]) in azure_objects:
        #we have a vertical object at top-left
        top_left_object.append(azure_objects[0])
        top_left_object.append((azure_objects[0][0] + 1, azure_objects[0][1]))

        output_grid[top_left_object[0][0], top_left_object[0][1] + 1] = 1

      #now find the horizontal object at bottom-right
      for obj in azure_objects:
          if (obj[0], obj[1]+1) in azure_objects:
            center_right_object.append(obj)
            center_right_object.append((obj[0], obj[1]+1))
            break
      if(len(center_right_object) > 0):
          output_grid[center_right_object[0][0]+1, center_right_object[0][1]] = 1

    return output_grid

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate azure components: 1x2, 2x1, and another irregular shape"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate azure components: 1x2, 2x1, and another irregular shape"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single blue pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) components.

2.  **Classify Azure Objects and place Blue Pixel:**
     - A horizontal 1x2 rectangle: a blue pixel gets added on the row below, and one column to the left (relative to the top-left corner of the component). In this case, the first azure object at (0,4) and (0,5) gets a blue pixel at position (1,4).
    - A vertical 2x1 rectangle: a blue pixel gets added on the same row and one column to the right (relative to the top-left corner of the component). The object with top at (2,2) gets a blue pixel at position (2,3).
    - An irregular object: we first look for a pixel with neighbors at south and east. The first pixel where this condition holds is at row=5, col=4 (neighbor at south is (6,4) and neighbor at east is at (5,5) which does not exists). A blue pixel gets added one row above and one column to the left, therefore at position (5,3).

3.  **All Other Pixels Remain Unchanged:** All pixels that are not part of the identified azure objects remain with color 0.

**In essence, we detect the azure colored components and insert one single blue pixel for each one of these, according to their shape.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
