Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure components"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal azure components"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two single blue pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we have two separate azure (color 8) components. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle at the top-left (positions (1,1) and (2,1)), and the other is a 1x2 rectangle at the center-right, position (4,4), (4,5).

2.  **Place a Blue Pixel to the top-right of vertical Azure object and to the bottom-left of the horizontal Azure object:** For each azure component, a blue pixel (color 1) is placed.
   - The top-left azure 2x1 object gets one blue pixel added at the position immediately to its right (1,2 -> so row=1, col=1+1)
   - The center-right azure 1x2 object gets a blue pixel added at the position immediately to its left (5,5, -> so row=4+1, col=4)

3. **All Other Pixels Remain Unchanged:** All the pixels that are not azure (color 8) remain as color 0.

**In essence, the transformation rule is to locate each azure component and insert a blue pixel in a specified relative position. All other pixels are not modified.**

```python
"""
Locates azure (color 8) components in the input grid and places a blue pixel (color 1) to the right of the top-left azure object and to the left of the bottom-right azure object. All other pixels remain unchanged (color 0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
