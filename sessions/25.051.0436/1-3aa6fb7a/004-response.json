            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n**YAML Description of Input**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 8 (azure)\n    shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical lines\n    positions:\n      - (1,1) and (2,1) # y, x coordinates of the top-left corner\n      - (3,4) and (4,4) # y, x coordinates of the top-left corner\n```\n\n**Transformation Rule: Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid. In this case, there are two separate 2x1 vertical lines of azure color.\n\n2.  **Determine Action:** For each vertical azure-colored object, change the color of the pixel immediately to the right of its *topmost* and *bottom-most* pixels to color 1 (blue), *if* the pixel to its right is not azure.\n\n3.  **Apply Rule:**\n    *   For the first azure object at positions (1,1) and (2,1):\n        *   The pixel to the right of (1,1) is (1,2). Change its color to 1.\n    *   For the second azure object at positions (3,4) and (4,4):\n        *   The pixel to the right of (4,4) is (4,5). Change its color to 1.\n\n4.  **Output:** The remaining grid is unchanged.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying vertical azure-colored objects in the input and applying a color change (to blue) to the pixels immediately to the right of the top and bottom of each object, *if* the pixel to its right is not also azure. This rule accurately transforms the provided input grid to the output grid.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule involves identifying vertical azure-colored objects in the input and applying a color change (to blue) to the pixels immediately to the right of the top and bottom of each object, *if* the pixel to its right is not also azure.
