These objects are vertical lines of varying lengths.\n\n2.  **Determine Action:** For each vertical azure-colored object, change the color of the pixel immediately to the right of its *topmost* pixel to color 1 (blue), *if* there isn't already an azure pixel there.\n\n3.  **Apply Rule:**\n    *   **(0, 4) Length 2:** The pixel to the right of the top (0, 4) is (0, 5), which is azure, so no change.\n    *   **(1, 5) Length 1:** The pixel to the right of the top (1, 5) is (1, 6), which is 0, change it to 1.\n    *   **(2, 2) Length 2:** The pixel to the right of the top (2, 2) is (2, 3), which is 0, change it to 1.\n    *   **(5, 4) Length 1:** The pixel to the right of the top (5, 4) is (5, 5), which is 0, change it to 1.\n    *   **(6, 3) Length 1:** The pixel to the right of the top (6, 3) is (6, 4), which is azure, so no change.\n\n4. **Output:** The output grid will reflect these color changes while keeping all other pixels unchanged.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is: Locate all vertical lines of azure color. For each of these lines, change the color of the cell immediately to the right of the top cell of the azure line to blue, unless the adjacent cell is also azure. The rest of the grid is kept unchanged.\n"
