Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains two distinct types of elements against a white background:
    *   A small, multi-colored rectangular block (the "palette"). This block defines a set of colors and their order (vertically in the examples).
    *   One or more larger, monochromatic shapes (the "templates" or "patterns"). These shapes share the same complex structure but have different colors. The colors used for these template shapes are a subset of the colors found in the palette.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains:
    *   The original template shapes from the input, unchanged in structure and position.
    *   New template shapes, identical in structure to the originals, created using the colors from the palette that *didn't* have a corresponding template shape in the input.
    *   The original palette block is removed.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to complete the set of template shapes based on the colors provided in the palette. The final arrangement of shapes should reflect the order of colors in the palette.
4.  **Key Relationships:**
    *   The palette dictates which colors *should* have a corresponding template shape.
    *   The existing template shapes define the structure to be replicated and provide positioning anchors.
    *   The relative order of colors in the palette determines the relative positioning of the template shapes (including the newly created ones) in the output. In the examples, the vertical order in the palette maps to the vertical stacking order of the shapes.
5.  **Palette Removal:** The original palette block is always absent in the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white
  - type: palette
    description: A small, dense, multi-colored object, often rectangular. Contains a sequence of colors.
    properties:
      - colors: A list of colors present in the palette.
      - sequence: The order of colors (e.g., top-to-bottom).
      - location: Bounding box coordinates.
  - type: template_shape
    description: Larger, monochromatic shapes sharing a common structure.
    properties:
      - color: The single color of the shape.
      - structure: The specific arrangement of pixels defining the shape.
      - location: Bounding box coordinates or reference point.

relationships:
  - type: palette_defines_colors
    description: The colors present in the palette determine the target set of colors for the template shapes.
  - type: template_consistency
    description: All template shapes (existing and new) must share the identical pixel structure.
  - type: sequential_ordering
    description: The final vertical (or horizontal) arrangement of template shapes in the output must match the sequence of their corresponding colors in the palette. Existing shapes maintain their relative order.
  - type: subset
    description: The colors of the template shapes present in the input are a subset of the colors in the palette.

actions:
  - action: identify_palette
    description: Locate the palette object and extract its colors and their sequence.
  - action: identify_template_shapes
    description: Locate all existing template shapes, determine their shared structure, and identify their colors and locations.
  - action: determine_missing_shapes
    description: Compare the palette color list with the colors of existing template shapes to find which colors need new shapes.
  - action: instantiate_new_shapes
    description: For each missing color, create a new shape with the identical structure found in the existing templates, using the missing color.
  - action: position_new_shapes
    description: Calculate the correct locations for the new shapes based on the locations of existing shapes and the color sequence from the palette, maintaining consistent spacing.
  - action: remove_palette
    description: Erase the original palette object from the grid.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Combine the existing shapes and the newly created/positioned shapes onto a white background of the same dimensions as the input.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Analyze the Input Grid:**
    *   Identify the small, multi-colored "palette" object. Record the colors it contains and their sequence (e.g., top-to-bottom).
    *   Identify all larger, monochromatic "template" shapes. Verify they share the exact same structure. Record the structure, the color of each existing shape, and their locations.
2.  **Determine Missing Shapes:**
    *   Compare the list of colors from the palette with the list of colors of the existing template shapes.
    *   Identify the colors from the palette that do *not* have a corresponding template shape in the input.
3.  **Create New Shapes:**
    *   For each missing color identified in step 2, create a new shape using that color. The structure of this new shape must be identical to the structure of the existing template shapes.
4.  **Position Shapes in Output:**
    *   Determine the relative positioning rule based on the palette sequence (e.g., if the palette colors are ordered vertically, the template shapes should be stacked vertically).
    *   Calculate the positions for the newly created shapes so that they fit seamlessly with the existing shapes, maintaining the color order found in the palette and preserving the spacing observed between existing shapes.
    *   Place both the original template shapes and the newly created template shapes at their determined positions in the output grid.
5.  **Finalize Output:**
    *   Ensure the original palette object is not present in the output grid.
    *   Fill the rest of the output grid with the background color (white). The output grid dimensions should match the input grid dimensions.
