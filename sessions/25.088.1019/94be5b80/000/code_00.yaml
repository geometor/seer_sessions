elements:
  - type: background
    color: white
  - type: palette
    description: A small, dense, multi-colored object, often rectangular. Contains a sequence of colors.
    properties:
      - colors: A list of colors present in the palette.
      - sequence: The order of colors (e.g., top-to-bottom).
      - location: Bounding box coordinates.
  - type: template_shape
    description: Larger, monochromatic shapes sharing a common structure.
    properties:
      - color: The single color of the shape.
      - structure: The specific arrangement of pixels defining the shape.
      - location: Bounding box coordinates or reference point.

relationships:
  - type: palette_defines_colors
    description: The colors present in the palette determine the target set of colors for the template shapes.
  - type: template_consistency
    description: All template shapes (existing and new) must share the identical pixel structure.
  - type: sequential_ordering
    description: The final vertical (or horizontal) arrangement of template shapes in the output must match the sequence of their corresponding colors in the palette. Existing shapes maintain their relative order.
  - type: subset
    description: The colors of the template shapes present in the input are a subset of the colors in the palette.

actions:
  - action: identify_palette
    description: Locate the palette object and extract its colors and their sequence.
  - action: identify_template_shapes
    description: Locate all existing template shapes, determine their shared structure, and identify their colors and locations.
  - action: determine_missing_shapes
    description: Compare the palette color list with the colors of existing template shapes to find which colors need new shapes.
  - action: instantiate_new_shapes
    description: For each missing color, create a new shape with the identical structure found in the existing templates, using the missing color.
  - action: position_new_shapes
    description: Calculate the correct locations for the new shapes based on the locations of existing shapes and the color sequence from the palette, maintaining consistent spacing.
  - action: remove_palette
    description: Erase the original palette object from the grid.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Combine the existing shapes and the newly created/positioned shapes onto a white background of the same dimensions as the input.
