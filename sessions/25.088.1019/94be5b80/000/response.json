            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid contains two distinct types of elements against a white background:\n    *   A small, multi-colored rectangular block (the \"palette\"). This block defines a set of colors and their order (vertically in the examples).\n    *   One or more larger, monochromatic shapes (the \"templates\" or \"patterns\"). These shapes share the same complex structure but have different colors. The colors used for these template shapes are a subset of the colors found in the palette.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid contains:\n    *   The original template shapes from the input, unchanged in structure and position.\n    *   New template shapes, identical in structure to the originals, created using the colors from the palette that *didn't* have a corresponding template shape in the input.\n    *   The original palette block is removed.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to complete the set of template shapes based on the colors provided in the palette. The final arrangement of shapes should reflect the order of colors in the palette.\n4.  **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The palette dictates which colors *should* have a corresponding template shape.\n    *   The existing template shapes define the structure to be replicated and provide positioning anchors.\n    *   The relative order of colors in the palette determines the relative positioning of the template shapes (including the newly created ones) in the output. In the examples, the vertical order in the palette maps to the vertical stacking order of the shapes.\n5.  **Palette Removal:** The original palette block is always absent in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

The structure of this new shape must be identical to the structure of the existing template shapes.\n4.  **Position Shapes in Output:**\n    *   Determine the relative positioning rule based on the palette sequence (e.g., if the palette colors are ordered vertically, the template shapes should be stacked vertically).\n    *   Calculate the positions for the newly created shapes so that they fit seamlessly with the existing shapes, maintaining the color order found in the palette and preserving the spacing observed between existing shapes.\n    *   Place both the original template shapes and the newly created template shapes at their determined positions in the output grid.\n5.  **Finalize Output:**\n    *   Ensure the original palette object is not present in the output grid.\n    *   Fill the rest of the output grid with the background color (white).
