            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the underlying hypothesis about the transformation was incorrect. It assumed only the largest object's shape ('template') was replicated, and the color sequence involved the template's original color followed by the 'palette' colors. The results show:\n\n1.  **Template Shape:** The shape of the largest object (by pixel count, with top-left tie-breaking) is indeed the shape used for replication in the output.\n2.  **Palette:** There's a distinct group of pixels (often single pixels arranged linearly, like a horizontal bar near the top) that act as a 'palette'. These pixels *do not* form the shapes themselves but dictate the *colors* and the *order* for the output shapes.\n3.  **Color Sequence:** The output color sequence is determined *solely* by the order of colors in the palette (e.g., left-to-right in the horizontal bar). The original color of the template shape is irrelevant for the output coloring.\n4.  **Stacking:** Copies of the identified template shape are stacked vertically in the output grid.\n5.  **Positioning:** The first stacked shape's top-left corner seems to be placed such that its top row aligns roughly with the row of the palette bar, and its left column aligns with the template shape's original left column.\n6.  **Offset:** Subsequent shapes are stacked directly below the previous one, with a vertical offset equal to the height of the template shape's bounding box.\n7.  **Output Grid Size:** The output grid might need to be taller than the input grid to accommodate the stacked shapes. The width generally remains the same.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the code logic to:\n1.  Correctly identify the template shape (largest object).\n2.  Correctly identify the palette pixels and their sequential order (based on their spatial arrangement, e.g., left-to-right).\n3.  Generate the output color sequence directly from the palette order.\n4.  Calculate the starting position for the first replicated shape based on the palette's vertical position and the template's horizontal position.\n5.  Stack copies of the template shape using the calculated offset (template height) and color them according to the palette sequence.\n6.  Ensure the output grid is large enough.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
