task_description: Fill specific regions defined by intersecting lines with designated colors.

grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Grids contain a background color (white: 0) and a line color (azure: 8).
  - Output grids also contain fill colors (red: 2, yellow: 4, magenta: 6, green: 3, blue: 1).

objects:
  - type: lines
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - orientation: horizontal and vertical
      - count: Typically two horizontal and two vertical lines per grid.
      - function: Divide the grid into nine rectangular regions (a 3x3 conceptual grid).
      - structure: Appear as solid lines spanning the grid width/height in the examples.
  - type: regions
    properties:
      - color: white (0) initially.
      - contiguity: Form contiguous areas.
      - location: Exist within the nine areas defined by the azure lines.

actions:
  - Identify the horizontal and vertical azure lines.
  - Identify all contiguous regions of white pixels.
  - For each white region:
      - Determine its relative position within the 3x3 grid defined by the azure lines.
      - Use a representative point (e.g., the top-left pixel of the region) for position checking.
      - Check if the region's position corresponds to one of the five target locations:
          - Top-center (between vertical lines, above top horizontal line)
          - Middle-left (between horizontal lines, left of left vertical line)
          - Center (between both sets of lines)
          - Middle-right (between horizontal lines, right of right vertical line)
          - Bottom-center (between vertical lines, below bottom horizontal line)
      - If it matches a target location, fill all pixels of that white region with the corresponding color:
          - Top-center -> red (2)
          - Middle-left -> yellow (4)
          - Center -> magenta (6)
          - Middle-right -> green (3)
          - Bottom-center -> blue (1)
  - Leave azure lines unchanged.
  - Leave white regions in the four corner positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) unchanged.
