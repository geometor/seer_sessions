The azure lines themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Coloring Pattern:** Only specific white regions are colored. By comparing input and output, we observe that the regions being colored are those *fully enclosed* by the azure lines, meaning they do not touch the outer boundary of the grid. The regions that touch the grid's border remain white.\n5.  **Color Assignment:** The color assigned to an enclosed region depends on its relative position within the structure defined by the azure lines. In both examples, the pattern is consistent:\n    *   The region above the central horizontal line and between the vertical lines is colored red (2).\n    *   The region left of the central vertical line and between the horizontal lines is colored yellow (4).\n    *   The central region (between both horizontal and vertical lines) is colored magenta (6).\n    *   The region right of the central vertical line and between the horizontal lines is colored green (3).\n    *   The region below the central horizontal line and between the vertical lines is colored blue (1).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each white region, check if it is fully enclosed by azure (8) lines (i.e., it does not touch any of the four outer edges of the grid).\n5.  If a white region is fully enclosed, determine its relative position within the grid structure defined by the azure lines (specifically, identify if it's the top-center, middle-left, center, middle-right, or bottom-center enclosed region).\n6.
