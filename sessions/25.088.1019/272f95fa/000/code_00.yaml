task_description: Fill enclosed white regions based on relative position defined by azure lines.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: lines
    color: azure (8)
    type: horizontal and vertical dividers
  - element: regions
    description: Contiguous areas of white pixels.
    properties:
      - enclosed: True if bounded by azure lines on all sides and not touching the grid border.
      - position: Relative location (e.g., top-center, middle-left) within the structure formed by azure lines.

actions:
  - action: identify_lines
    input: input_grid
    output: locations of horizontal and vertical azure lines
  - action: identify_regions
    input: input_grid, identified_lines
    output: set of white regions, marked as enclosed or not_enclosed
  - action: determine_region_position
    input: enclosed_region, identified_lines
    output: relative position (top-center, middle-left, center, middle-right, bottom-center)
  - action: fill_region
    input: output_grid, enclosed_region, color
    effect: Changes the color of pixels within the region to the specified color.

transformation_rule:
  - Copy input grid to output grid.
  - Find all horizontal and vertical azure lines.
  - Identify all white regions fully enclosed by azure lines (not touching grid border).
  - For each enclosed region:
    - Determine its relative position based on the azure line structure.
    - Apply color fill based on position:
      - top-center: red (2)
      - middle-left: yellow (4)
      - center: magenta (6)
      - middle-right: green (3)
      - bottom-center: blue (1)
  - Leave non-enclosed white regions and azure lines unchanged.

relationships:
  - The azure lines define the boundaries of the white regions.
  - The transformation applies only to white regions that are fully enclosed by azure lines.
  - The fill color is determined by the region's position relative to the enclosing azure lines.
