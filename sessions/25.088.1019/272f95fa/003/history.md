Transformation Rule:
1. Identify horizontal and vertical lines of azure (8) pixels that divide the grid.
2. Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
3. For each white region, determine if it is fully enclosed by the azure lines (i.e., it does not touch the grid boundaries).
4. If a white region is enclosed, determine its relative position within the central 3x3 area defined by the lines (top-center, middle-left, center, middle-right, bottom-center).
5. Fill the enclosed regions with specific colors based on their position:
    - top-center: red (2)
    - middle-left: yellow (4)
    - center: magenta (6)
    - middle-right: green (3)
    - bottom-center: blue (1)
6. Leave the azure lines and non-enclosed white regions unchanged.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the core components of the task: finding azure lines (8), identifying white regions (0), and using the lines to define a conceptual 3x3 grid for conditional filling. However, it failed because it incorrectly interpreted the condition for filling. The code assumed only white regions *not* touching the absolute grid boundaries should be filled, based on a misinterpretation of "enclosed".

The analysis of the failed examples reveals that white regions should be filled based purely on their relative position within the 3x3 grid defined by the azure lines, regardless of whether they touch the outer grid boundary. Specifically, the five regions corresponding to the 'plus' or 'cross' shape within the 3x3 grid (top-center, middle-left, center, middle-right, bottom-center) are filled with designated colors. The corner regions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are left unfilled (remain white or their original color, which is white in these examples).

The strategy is to remove the check for touching the grid boundary (`is_on_border`) and apply the relative position coloring logic to all identified white regions.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill specific regions defined by intersecting lines with designated colors.

grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Grids contain a background color (white: 0) and a line color (azure: 8).
  - Output grids also contain fill colors (red: 2, yellow: 4, magenta: 6, green: 3, blue: 1).

objects:
  - type: lines
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - orientation: horizontal and vertical
      - count: Typically two horizontal and two vertical lines per grid.
      - function: Divide the grid into nine rectangular regions (a 3x3 conceptual grid).
      - structure: Appear as solid lines spanning the grid width/height in the examples.
  - type: regions
    properties:
      - color: white (0) initially.
      - contiguity: Form contiguous areas.
      - location: Exist within the nine areas defined by the azure lines.

actions:
  - Identify the horizontal and vertical azure lines.
  - Identify all contiguous regions of white pixels.
  - For each white region:
      - Determine its relative position within the 3x3 grid defined by the azure lines.
      - Use a representative point (e.g., the top-left pixel of the region) for position checking.
      - Check if the region's position corresponds to one of the five target locations:
          - Top-center (between vertical lines, above top horizontal line)
          - Middle-left (between horizontal lines, left of left vertical line)
          - Center (between both sets of lines)
          - Middle-right (between horizontal lines, right of right vertical line)
          - Bottom-center (between vertical lines, below bottom horizontal line)
      - If it matches a target location, fill all pixels of that white region with the corresponding color:
          - Top-center -> red (2)
          - Middle-left -> yellow (4)
          - Center -> magenta (6)
          - Middle-right -> green (3)
          - Bottom-center -> blue (1)
  - Leave azure lines unchanged.
  - Leave white regions in the four corner positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Grid Structure:** Locate the row indices of the two horizontal lines (color 8) and the column indices of the two vertical lines (color 8). Let these be `h1`, `h2` (with `h1 < h2`) and `v1`, `v2` (with `v1 < v2`). These lines define nine regions.
2.  **Find Target Regions:** Find all distinct contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
3.  **Determine Region Position and Fill:** For each white region found:
    a.  Select a representative coordinate `(r, c)` from the region (e.g., the top-most, left-most pixel).
    b.  Determine the region's relative position based on `(r, c)` compared to `h1`, `h2`, `v1`, `v2`.
    c.  **If** the region is in the **top-center** position (`r < h1` and `v1 < c < v2`), fill all pixels of this region with **red (2)** in the output grid.
    d.  **Else if** the region is in the **middle-left** position (`h1 < r < h2` and `c < v1`), fill all pixels of this region with **yellow (4)**.
    e.  **Else if** the region is in the **center** position (`h1 < r < h2` and `v1 < c < v2`), fill all pixels of this region with **magenta (6)**.
    f.  **Else if** the region is in the **middle-right** position (`h1 < r < h2` and `c > v2`), fill all pixels of this region with **green (3)**.
    g.  **Else if** the region is in the **bottom-center** position (`r > h2` and `v1 < c < v2`), fill all pixels of this region with **blue (1)**.
    h.  **Otherwise** (if the region is in a corner position: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), leave the region's pixels as white (0).
4.  **Preserve Lines:** Ensure all azure (8) pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. (The filling process targets only white regions, preserving the lines implicitly if implemented correctly).
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
