Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the two horizontal and two vertical lines of azure (8) pixels that divide the grid into nine conceptual regions.
2. Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
3. For each white region, determine its relative position within the nine regions defined by the lines (e.g., top-center, middle-left, center, etc.) using a representative pixel from the region.
4. If a white region falls into one of the five 'cross' positions (top-center, middle-left, center, middle-right, bottom-center), fill that entire region with a specific color corresponding to its position:
    - Top-center: red (2)
    - Middle-left: yellow (4)
    - Center: magenta (6)
    - Middle-right: green (3)
    - Bottom-center: blue (1)
5. White regions in the four corner positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) remain unchanged (white).
6. The azure lines remain unchanged.
