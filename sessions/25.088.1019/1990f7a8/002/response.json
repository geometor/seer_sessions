            "text": "The code execution confirms the bounding box top-left corners derived from Hypothesis 2:\n*   TL: Bbox starts at relative (1, 1) -> absolute (1, 1). Correct.\n*   TR: Bbox starts at relative (2, 0) -> absolute (2, 8). Correct.\n*   BL: Bbox starts at relative (4, 3) -> absolute (12, 3). Correct.\n*   BR: Bbox starts at relative (0, 2) -> absolute (8, 10). Correct.\n\nNow, check if extracting the 3x3 pattern from these absolute top-left coordinates produces the expected output for Example 3:\n*   TL: Start (1,1). `input[1:4, 1:4]` -> matches expected.\n*   TR: Start (2,8). `input[2:5, 8:11]` -> matches expected.\n*   BL: Start (12,3). `input[12:15, 3:6]` -> matches expected.\n*   BR: Start (8,10). `input[8:11, 10:13]` -> matches expected.\n\nYes, Hypothesis 2 works for all quadrants in Example 3. It also worked for Examples 1 and 2. This seems to be the correct rule.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code based on the first example successfully identified the core structure of the task: dividing the input into four quadrants, finding a pattern related to red pixels (color 2) in each, and assembling these patterns into a 7x7 output grid with a white cross separator. The code worked for the first two examples.\n\nHowever, the failure on Example 3 revealed that the specific rule for identifying the 3x3 pattern was incorrect. The initial assumption was to find the top-leftmost red pixel in the quadrant and extract the 3x3 block starting *at that pixel*. Example 3 demonstrated cases where the correct 3x3 block was offset from the top-leftmost red pixel.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is to re-evaluate how the 3x3 pattern is identified and located within each quadrant, using all three examples to refine the rule. Comparing the failing quadrants in Example 3 (TL and BR) with the expected output suggested a new hypothesis: the 3x3 pattern is anchored to the top-left corner of the minimal bounding box containing *all* red pixels within that quadrant. Testing this revised hypothesis against all examples confirmed its validity.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's gather metrics for Example 3, focusing on the red pixel locations and bounding boxes within quadrants.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Size: 17x16\n*   Output Size: 7x7\n*   Input Colors: White (0), Red (2)\n*   Output Colors: White (0), Red (2)\n*   Midpoints: row=8, col=8\n\n**Quadrant Analysis (Example 3):**\n"
