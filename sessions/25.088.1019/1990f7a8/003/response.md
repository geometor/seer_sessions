"""
The transformation rule identifies four quadrants in the input grid. 
For each quadrant, it searches for red pixels (value 2). 
If red pixels are present, it determines the minimal bounding box enclosing all red pixels within that quadrant. 
The 3x3 pattern starting at the top-left corner of this bounding box (in the original input grid) is then extracted.
This extracted 3x3 pattern is copied to a corresponding 3x3 region in a fixed 7x7 output grid. 
The four 3x3 regions in the output grid are separated by a single row and column of white pixels (value 0).
Specifically:
- The pattern derived from the top-left input quadrant maps to the top-left 3x3 area (rows 0-2, cols 0-2) of the output.
- The pattern derived from the top-right input quadrant maps to the top-right 3x3 area (rows 0-2, cols 4-6) of the output.
- The pattern derived from the bottom-left input quadrant maps to the bottom-left 3x3 area (rows 4-6, cols 0-2) of the output.
- The pattern derived from the bottom-right input quadrant maps to the bottom-right 3x3 area (rows 4-6, cols 4-6) of the output.
If a quadrant in the input does not contain any red pixels, the corresponding 3x3 area in the output remains white (filled with 0s).
