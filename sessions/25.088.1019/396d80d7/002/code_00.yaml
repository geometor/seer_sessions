task_description: Fill background pixels adjacent to a 'frame' object, but only those outside the object's convex hull.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    description: The color occupying the most pixels in the input grid. Abbreviated as BG.
  - name: non_background_colors
    description: The two colors present in the input grid that are not the background color.
  - name: frame_color
    description: The non_background_color that has the highest number of its pixels orthogonally adjacent to background_color pixels.
  - name: fill_color
    description: The non_background_color that is not the frame_color.
  - name: frame_object
    description: A connected component (using orthogonal adjacency) of pixels all having the frame_color.
  - name: frame_object_coords
    description: The set of (row, column) coordinates belonging to a frame_object.
  - name: convex_hull
    description: The smallest convex polygon containing all frame_object_coords. We need the set of all integer grid coordinates covered by this filled polygon.
  - name: adjacent_background_pixel
    description: A pixel with the background_color that is orthogonally adjacent to any pixel of a frame_object.
  - name: exterior_adjacent_background_pixel
    description: An adjacent_background_pixel whose coordinates are *not* within the filled convex_hull of the associated frame_object.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify background_color, frame_color, and fill_color.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify all distinct frame_objects based on connectivity.
  - step: 3
    action: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 4
    action: For each frame_object:
      - sub_step: 4a
        action: Determine its frame_object_coords.
      - sub_step: 4b
        action: Compute the filled convex_hull coordinates for these coords.
      - sub_step: 4c
        action: Find all adjacent_background_pixels for this frame_object.
      - sub_step: 4d
        action: Filter these pixels to identify the exterior_adjacent_background_pixels (those not inside the convex_hull).
      - sub_step: 4e
        action: For each exterior_adjacent_background_pixel found, change its color in the output grid to the fill_color.
  - step: 5
    action: Return the modified output grid.
