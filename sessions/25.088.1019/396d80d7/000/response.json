            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input examples consist of a large 16x16 grid primarily filled with a background color (orange, 7). Centered within this background is a distinct pattern or \"object\" composed of two other colors.\n2.  **Object Composition:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the object is made of magenta (6) and red (2) pixels. The magenta pixels form interconnected shapes, somewhat resembling 'H's, enclosing or bordering the red pixels.\n    *   In `train_2`, the object is made of yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels. The yellow pixels form a diamond-like shape enclosing a central 2x2 square of blue pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding new pixels to the grid. The color of the added pixels is determined by one of the colors already present within the central object. The placement of these new pixels is dictated by adjacency rules relative to the *other* color in the central object.\n4.  **Color Roles:** It appears the two non-background colors within the object play distinct roles:\n    *   **Frame Color:** This color forms the outer parts of the object, directly touching the background (magenta in train_1, yellow in train_2).\n    *   **Fill Color:** This color is located more towards the interior of the object, primarily bordered by the frame color (red in train_1, blue in train_2).\n5.  **Rule:** The output grid retains the original object structure. Additionally, any background (orange) pixel in the input grid that is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to a \"frame\" color pixel is changed to the \"fill\" color in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the two colors present in the central pattern.\n5.  Identify the 'frame' color: Search within the central pattern pixels for the color(s) that have at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, right) which is the background color.\n6.  Identify the 'fill' color: This is the other color present in the central pattern that is not the 'frame' color.\n7.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.\n8.  For each pixel, check if its color in the input grid is the background color.\n9.  If it is the background color, check its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) in the input grid.\n10. If any of these direct neighbors have the 'frame' color, change the color of the current pixel in the *output* grid to the 'fill' color.\n11. If a pixel is not the background color, or if it is the background color but has no direct 'frame' color neighbors, its color in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid.\n12.
