task_context:
  grid_size: [16, 16] # Common observation for these examples
  background_color: 7 # orange
objects:
  - name: background
    color: 7
  - name: central_pattern
    description: A contiguous group of non-background pixels near the grid center.
    properties:
      colors:
        - name: frame_color # Color adjacent to the background
          example_1: 6 # magenta
          example_2: 4 # yellow
        - name: fill_color # Other color within the pattern
          example_1: 2 # red
          example_2: 1 # blue
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: frame_color_pixels
    to: background_pixels
    direction: horizontal_or_vertical
  - type: association
    from: frame_color
    to: fill_color
    description: The fill_color is associated with the frame_color within the same central_pattern.
actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [background_color, frame_color, fill_color]
    logic: Background is the most frequent color. Frame color is the non-background color adjacent to the background. Fill color is the remaining non-background color.
  - name: add_pixels
    inputs: [input_grid, background_color, frame_color, fill_color]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    logic: Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through each pixel. If a pixel is the background_color and has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, right) with the frame_color, change its color to the fill_color in the output grid. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.
