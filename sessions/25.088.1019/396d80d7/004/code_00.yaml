Context:
  - Grids contain pixels of different colors (0-9).
  - One color is typically the background (most frequent).
  - There are usually two other prominent colors involved in the transformation.

Objects:
  - Background: The most frequent color in the grid.
  - Frame_Color_Pixels: Pixels of the non-background color that have more orthogonal adjacencies to the Background.
  - Fill_Color_Pixels: Pixels of the *other* non-background color.
  - Frame_Objects: Connected components (groups) of Frame_Color_Pixels, using orthogonal adjacency.

Properties:
  - Color: The integer value (0-9) of a pixel.
  - Position: The (row, column) coordinates of a pixel.
  - Size: The number of pixels in a Frame_Object.
  - Adjacency: Whether a pixel touches another pixel orthogonally (up, down, left, right).
  - Convex_Hull: A geometric shape enclosing all pixels of a Frame_Object (calculated for objects with size >= 3).
  - Interior/Exterior: Refers to background pixels relative to the Convex_Hull of a nearby Frame_Object.

Actions:
  - Identify_Colors: Determine Background, Frame, and Fill colors based on frequency and adjacency to Background.
  - Find_Objects: Locate all distinct Frame_Objects using connected components labeling (orthogonal).
  - Calculate_Hull: Compute the set of coordinates covered by the filled convex hull of a Frame_Object (if size >= 3).
  - Find_Adjacent_Background: Identify all Background pixels orthogonally adjacent to a given Frame_Object.
  - Filter_Adjacent_Background:
      - If Frame_Object size < 3: Keep all adjacent Background pixels.
      - If Frame_Object size >= 3: Keep only adjacent Background pixels whose coordinates are *not* inside the Frame_Object's calculated Convex_Hull.
  - Fill_Pixels: Change the color of the filtered adjacent Background pixels to the Fill_Color in the output grid.
  - Copy_Grid: The output grid starts as a copy of the input, and modifications are applied.
