**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 10x10 grids.
2.  **Background:** The background color is consistently white (0).
3.  **Object Identification:** Each input grid contains a single, distinct object. This object is always a 3x3 square with a white center (a hollow square or frame).
4.  **Object Color:** The color of the frame varies between examples: magenta (6), azure (8), and yellow (4).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the object within the grid. The object retains its shape and color.
6.  **Movement Pattern:** The object moves in a straight line (up, down, or right in the examples) until one of its edges aligns perfectly with the corresponding edge of the grid.
7.  **Direction Determination:** The direction of movement appears to be determined solely by the color of the object:
    *   Magenta (6) objects move UP.
    *   Azure (8) objects move RIGHT.
    *   Yellow (4) objects move DOWN.
8.  **Final Position:** The object stops moving once its outermost edge in the direction of travel reaches the boundary of the 10x10 grid.

      - If LEFT, move until left column is 0.
      - If RIGHT, move until right column is 9.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-white object in the input grid. Verify it is a 3x3 hollow square (a 3x3 square of a single color with a white center pixel). Note the object's color and its top-left coordinates (row `r`, column `c`).
2.  Determine the direction of movement based on the object's color:
    *   If the color is magenta (6), the direction is UP.
    *   If the color is azure (8), the direction is RIGHT.
    *   If the color is yellow (4), the direction is DOWN.
3.  Calculate the final top-left position (`final_r`, `final_c`) for the object by moving it in the determined direction until its corresponding edge reaches the grid boundary (assuming a 10x10 grid):
    *   If the direction is UP, the final top row is 0, so `final_r = 0`, `final_c = c`.
    *   If the direction is DOWN, the final bottom row is 9. Since the object is 3 rows high, the final top row is `9 - 2 = 7`, so `final_r = 7`, `final_c = c`.
    *   If the direction is RIGHT, the final right column is 9. Since the object is 3 columns wide, the final left column is `9 - 2 = 7`, so `final_r = r`, `final_c = 7`.
4.  Create the output grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Draw the identified 3x3 hollow square object onto the output grid at the calculated final top-left position (`final_r`, `final_c`), using its original color.
