This object is always a 3x3 square with a white center (a hollow square or frame).\n4.  **Object Color:** The color of the frame varies between examples: magenta (6), azure (8), and yellow (4).\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves moving the object within the grid. The object retains its shape and color.\n6.  **Movement Pattern:** The object moves in a straight line (up, down, or right in the examples) until one of its edges aligns perfectly with the corresponding edge of the grid.\n7.  **Direction Determination:** The direction of movement appears to be determined solely by the color of the object:\n    *   Magenta (6) objects move UP.\n    *   Azure (8) objects move RIGHT.\n    *   Yellow (4) objects move DOWN.\n8.  **Final Position:** The object stops moving once its outermost edge in the direction of travel reaches the boundary of the 10x10 grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Verify it is a 3x3 hollow square (a 3x3 square of a single color with a white center pixel). Note the object's color and its top-left coordinates (row `r`, column `c`).\n2.  Determine the direction of movement based on the object's color:\n    *   If the color is magenta (6), the direction is UP.\n    *   If the color is azure (8), the direction is RIGHT.\n    *   If the color is yellow (4), the direction is DOWN.\n3.  Calculate the final top-left position (`final_r`, `final_c`) for the object by moving it in the determined direction until its corresponding edge reaches the grid boundary (assuming a 10x10 grid):\n    *   If the direction is UP, the final top row is 0, so `final_r = 0`, `final_c = c`.\n    *   If the direction is DOWN, the final bottom row is 9. Since the object is 3 rows high, the final top row is `9 - 2 = 7`, so `final_r = 7`, `final_c = c`.\n    *   If the direction is RIGHT, the final right column is 9. Since the object is 3 columns wide, the final left column is `9 - 2 = 7`, so `final_r = r`, `final_c = 7`.\n4.  Create the output grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n5.  Draw the identified 3x3 hollow square object onto the output grid at the calculated final top-left position (`final_r`, `final_c`), using its original color."
