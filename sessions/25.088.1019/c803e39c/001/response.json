For each output cell (r, c), it maps back to a source coordinate (sr, sc) = (floor(r/D), floor(c/D)) within the DxD area.\nThe output cell color is C4 if the pixel at (sr, sc) within P4's bounding box is C4. Otherwise, it's C3 if the pixel at (sr, sc) within P3's bounding box is C3.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, ignore_colors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous objects of the same color in a grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        ignore_colors (set): A set of color values to ignore (background, separators).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              and contains 'color', 'pixels' (list of (r, c) tuples), and\n              'bbox' (tuple: min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if the pixel belongs to a color to be detected and hasn't been visited yet\n            if color not in ignore_colors and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_pixels = []\n                q = [(r, c)]  # Use a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, min_c = r, c\n                max_r, max_c = r, c\n\n                # Perform BFS to find all connected pixels of the same color\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.pop(0)\n                    obj_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    # Update bounding box coordinates\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Explore neighbors (4-connectivity: up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds, color match, and visited status\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Store the found object's properties\n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'pixels': obj_pixels,\n                    'bbox': (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n                })\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the patterns of the last two objects.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define colors to ignore (background and separators)\n    ignore_colors = {0, 5} \n    \n    # Find all colored objects in the grid\n    objects = find_objects(grid_np, ignore_colors)\n    \n    # Sort objects based on their horizontal position (left-to-right) using the minimum column of their bounding box\n    objects.sort(key=lambda obj: obj['bbox'][1])\n    \n    # We are interested in the last two objects\n    if len(objects) < 2:\n        # Handle cases where fewer than two objects are found, though problem description implies at least two relevant ones.\n        # Returning the input or an empty grid might be options depending on desired error handling.\n        # For now, let's assume the structure is always present as per examples.\n        # Consider raising an error or returning a default grid if needed.\n        print(\"Warning: Less than two objects found.
