            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    The input grids consist of multiple \"panels\" separated by vertical gray lines (color 5). Each panel contains a background of white pixels (color 0) and a single, contiguous object of a specific color. The task focuses on the last two panels (the third and fourth from the left, or penultimate and ultimate). Let's call the object in the third panel P3 with color C3, and the object in the fourth panel P4 with color C4. These objects (P3 and P4) appear to have the same square dimensions (D x D) within their respective panels in all examples (3x3 for train_1/2, 4x4 for train_3).\n\n    The output grid is a larger square grid. Its dimensions seem to be determined by the dimensions of the input objects P3 and P4. Specifically, if P3 and P4 are DxD, the output grid is (D*D) x (D*D). The output grid is composed entirely of the colors C3 and C4.\n\n    The transformation involves scaling up both P3 and P4 based on their dimension D, and then overlaying them according to a specific rule. Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a specific pixel location within the original DxD bounding boxes of P3 and P4. The color of the output pixel is determined by checking the corresponding pixel in P4 first. If that source pixel in P4 has color C4, the output pixel takes color C4. If the source pixel in P4 is *not* C4 (i.e., it's white), the corresponding source pixel in P3 is checked. If that source pixel in P3 has color C3, the output pixel takes color C3. The examples suggest that the combination of shapes P3 and P4 covers their entire DxD bounding box, ensuring the output grid is fully colored with C3 and C4.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
