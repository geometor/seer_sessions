task_description: Identify blue objects and recolor them based on whether they enclose white areas.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_color: blue (1)
  - target_color: green (3)
objects:
  - type: connected components of blue pixels
  - connectivity: 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right)
properties_checked:
  - encloses_white_area:
      definition: A blue object encloses a white area if there exists at least one white pixel adjacent (4-way) to the object that cannot reach the grid boundary by moving only through white pixels (using 4-way adjacency).
      value: boolean (True/False)
action:
  - condition: If a blue object 'encloses_white_area' is True.
  - effect: Recolor all pixels of that blue object to green (3).
  - condition: If a blue object 'encloses_white_area' is False.
  - effect: The blue object remains blue (1).
unchanged_elements:
  - All pixels not part of any blue object remain their original color (typically white background).
