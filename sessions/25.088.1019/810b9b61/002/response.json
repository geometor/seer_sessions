            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified blue objects using 4-way adjacency. The core logic was to recolor blue objects to green if they contained an internal 'hole', defined as a white pixel completely surrounded (4-way adjacency) by pixels of that *same* blue object.\n\n*   Example 1 worked because the blue object that changed color had a single white pixel hole fitting this exact definition.\n*   Examples 2 and 3 failed because the blue objects that changed color enclosed areas of white pixels, but not necessarily single white pixels where *all four* neighbors were part of the same object. For instance, two adjacent white pixels might be enclosed, or a larger area. The previous `has_hole` definition was too strict.\n\nThe failures indicate that the definition of a \"hole\" needs to be broadened. A blue object should be recolored if it encloses *any* region of white pixels, preventing those white pixels from reaching the grid boundary without crossing the blue object.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Keep the `find_objects` function as it correctly identifies the distinct blue objects based on 4-way connectivity.\n2.  Replace the `has_hole` function with a new logic:\n    *   Identify all white pixels connected to the grid boundary (using a flood fill/BFS starting from boundary white pixels). These are \"external\" white pixels.\n    *   For a given blue object, check if any of its pixels are adjacent (4-way) to a white pixel that is *not* marked as \"external\". If such an adjacent \"internal\" white pixel exists, the object contains a hole.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples with the refined \"hole\" definition:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid: 15x15. Colors: white(0), blue(1).\n    *   Output Grid: 15x15. Colors: white(0), blue(1), green(3).\n    *   Blue Objects: 4 distinct objects.\n    *   Object 1 (Rows 3-5, Cols 4-6): This object forms a closed boundary around the white pixel at (4, 5). This white pixel is not connected to the boundary. Therefore, Object 1 encloses a hole. Output: Object 1 becomes green.\n    *   Other Objects (single pixel at (3,10); pixel at (8,4); shape in rows 8-10, cols 9-12): None of these enclose any white pixels. Output: These objects remain blue.\n    *   *Observation:* The initial code worked here because the specific enclosed white pixel met the strict 4-neighbor condition. The new logic also correctly identifies this object.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid: 15x15. Colors: white(0), blue(1).\n    *   Output Grid: 15x15. Colors: white(0), blue(1), green(3).\n    *   Blue Objects: 8 distinct objects.\n    *   Object 1 (Top Left, Rows 2-4, Cols 2-5): Encloses white pixels (3,3), (3,4). These are not reachable from the boundary. Output: Turns green.\n    *   Object 2 (Top Right, Rows 1-3, Cols 10-12): Does not enclose any white pixels. Output: Stays blue.\n    *   Object 3 (Middle Left, Row 7, Col 3): Single pixel, no enclosure. Output: Stays blue.\n    *   Object 4 (Middle Right, Rows 7-10, Cols 6-9): Encloses white pixels (8,7), (8,8), (9,7), (9,8). Output: Turns green.\n    *   Object 5 (Middle Right Edge, Rows 6-7, Cols 12-13): Does not enclose any white pixels. Output: Stays blue.\n    *   Object 6 (Bottom Left, Rows 10-13, Cols 0-2): Encloses white pixels (11,1), (12,1). Output: Turns green.\n    *   Object 7 (Bottom Middle, Row 13, Cols 5-6): Does not enclose any white pixels. Output: Stays blue.\n    *   Object 8 (Bottom Right, Rows 12-14, Cols 10-13): Encloses white pixels (13,11), (13,12). Output: Turns green.\n    *   *Observation:* The previous code failed because the enclosed white pixels didn't meet the strict 4-neighbor rule. The new logic correctly identifies all objects that enclose white regions.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Grid: 9x9. Colors: white(0), blue(1).\n    *   Output Grid: 9x9. Colors: white(0), blue(1), green(3).\n    *   Blue Objects: 3 distinct objects.\n    *   Object 1 (Top, Rows 2-4, Cols 1-5): Encloses white pixels (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Output: Turns green.\n    *   Object 2 (Bottom Left, Row 6, Cols 0-1): Does not enclose any white pixels. Output: Stays blue.\n    *   Object 3 (Bottom Middle, Rows 7-8, Cols 1, 4-5): Does not enclose any white pixels. Output: Stays blue.\n    *   *Observation:* Similar to Example 2, the previous code failed, but the new logic correctly identifies the object enclosing the white region.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
