In the input, these objects are exclusively blue (1).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* of the blue objects to green (3). Other blue objects remain unchanged.\n5.  **Identifying Feature:** Comparing the blue objects that change to green with those that stay blue reveals a consistent pattern: the objects that turn green contain at least one \"hole\" \u2013 a white (0) pixel completely enclosed within the blue (1) pixels of that object. Objects without such enclosed white pixels remain blue.\n6.  **Connectivity:** Objects are defined by contiguous blocks of the same color (blue in this case), considering side-by-side adjacency (not diagonal). The \"hole\" must be surrounded by pixels belonging to the *same* contiguous blue object.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
