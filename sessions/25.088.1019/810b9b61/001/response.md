"""
Identifies distinct blue (1) objects in the input grid.
For each blue object, checks if it contains at least one internal 'hole' 
(a white (0) pixel completely surrounded by pixels of that same object using 4-way adjacency).
If an object contains a hole, all its pixels are recolored to green (3) in the output grid.
Objects without holes remain blue (1). The background (0) remains unchanged.
