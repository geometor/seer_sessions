The four background colors are different from each other in most examples, though sometimes the same color might appear in different quadrants (e.g., blue in top-left and bottom-left in train_3).\n    *   Within these quadrants, there are scattered pixels of a single, different color (the \"scatter color\"). This scatter color is consistent throughout a single input grid but varies between examples.\n    *   The output is always a single integer, representing one of the background colors present in the input grid.\n    *   The output color corresponds to the background color of the quadrant that contains the highest number of scattered pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Divide the input grid into four equal quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.\n    3.  Identify the primary background color of each quadrant.

Identify the background color of the quadrant(s) that have this maximum count of scatter pixels.\n    8.  The output is this background color value.
