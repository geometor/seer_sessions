The output grids show L-shaped lines originating from the positions of the input pixels. Each line segment extends either vertically or horizontally from the original pixel's location towards the nearest edge of the grid. The color of the lines matches the color of the original pixel. If there are multiple colored pixels in the input, the output is the overlay of the corresponding L-shapes.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
