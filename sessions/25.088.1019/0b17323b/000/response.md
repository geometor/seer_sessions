Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and a few blue pixels (1).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, except for the addition of one or more red pixels (2).
3.  **Blue Pixel Pattern:** In both examples, the blue pixels (1) are located exclusively on the main diagonal (where the row index equals the column index). Their positions along this diagonal form an arithmetic sequence.
    *   In `train_1`, the blue pixels are at (0,0), (4,4), (8,8). The sequence of indices is 0, 4, 8... (common difference is 4).
    *   In `train_2`, the blue pixels are at (1,1), (3,3), (5,5). The sequence of indices is 1, 3, 5... (common difference is 2).
4.  **Red Pixel Placement:** The red pixels (2) in the output grid are placed at subsequent positions along the main diagonal, continuing the arithmetic sequence established by the blue pixels. The sequence continues until the next position would fall outside the grid boundaries.
    *   In `train_1`, the sequence 0, 4, 8 continues with 12. Since (12,12) is within the 15x15 grid, a red pixel is placed there. The next term, 16, is outside the grid, so generation stops.
    *   In `train_2`, the sequence 1, 3, 5 continues with 7, 9, 11, 13. All these positions are within the 15x15 grid, so red pixels are placed at (7,7), (9,9), (11,11), and (13,13). The next term, 15, is outside the grid.
5.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to identify the arithmetic sequence formed by the diagonal blue pixels and extrapolate this sequence, marking the subsequent positions on the diagonal with red pixels until the grid boundary is reached.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Extrapolate an arithmetic sequence on the main diagonal.

Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Contains:
    - Background pixels (white, 0).
    - Marker pixels (blue, 1).

Output:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors), same dimensions as input.
  - Contains:
    - Original background pixels.
    - Original marker pixels (blue, 1).
    - Extrapolation pixels (red, 2).

Relationships & Rules:
  - Objects:
    - Blue pixels (1) define an arithmetic sequence.
    - Red pixels (2) represent the continuation of this sequence.
  - Properties:
    - Blue pixels are always located on the main diagonal (row_index == column_index).
    - The row/column indices of the blue pixels form an arithmetic sequence.
  - Actions:
    1. Identify all blue pixels.
    2. Extract their row/column indices.
    3. Determine the first term (a) and common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence. (Requires at least two blue pixels to uniquely determine d).
    4. Start from the last blue pixel's index.
    5. Generate subsequent terms of the sequence (index + d).
    6. For each new term `n`:
       - Check if the position (n, n) is within the grid boundaries.
       - If yes, place a red pixel (2) at (n, n).
       - If no, stop the extrapolation.
  - Constraints:
    - Grid dimensions are preserved.
    - Original pixels (blue and white) are preserved.
    - Extrapolation only happens along the main diagonal.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
3.  Verify that all found blue pixels lie on the main diagonal (row == column). If not, the pattern doesn't match, and the original grid might be returned (or handle as an error/undefined case).
4.  Extract the row indices (which are equal to the column indices) of the blue pixels and sort them in ascending order. Let this list of indices be `indices`.
5.  If there are fewer than two blue pixels, no sequence can be determined, so return the copied input grid without changes.
6.  Calculate the common difference `d` of the arithmetic sequence: `d = indices[1] - indices[0]`. (Verify this difference holds for subsequent elements if more than two blue pixels exist: `indices[i] - indices[i-1] == d`). If the difference is not consistent, the pattern doesn't match; handle appropriately.
7.  Initialize the next term `n` to be the last observed index plus the common difference: `n = indices[-1] + d`.
8.  Get the dimensions (height H, width W) of the grid.
9.  While `n` is less than H and `n` is less than W (i.e., the position (n, n) is within the grid boundaries):
    a.  Set the pixel at coordinate (n, n) in the output grid to red (value 2).
    b.  Update `n` to the next term in the sequence: `n = n + d`.
10. Return the modified output grid.
