Task: Extrapolate an arithmetic sequence on the main diagonal.

Input:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Contains:
    - Background pixels (white, 0).
    - Marker pixels (blue, 1).

Output:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors), same dimensions as input.
  - Contains:
    - Original background pixels.
    - Original marker pixels (blue, 1).
    - Extrapolation pixels (red, 2).

Relationships & Rules:
  - Objects:
    - Blue pixels (1) define an arithmetic sequence.
    - Red pixels (2) represent the continuation of this sequence.
  - Properties:
    - Blue pixels are always located on the main diagonal (row_index == column_index).
    - The row/column indices of the blue pixels form an arithmetic sequence.
  - Actions:
    1. Identify all blue pixels.
    2. Extract their row/column indices.
    3. Determine the first term (a) and common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence. (Requires at least two blue pixels to uniquely determine d).
    4. Start from the last blue pixel's index.
    5. Generate subsequent terms of the sequence (index + d).
    6. For each new term `n`:
       - Check if the position (n, n) is within the grid boundaries.
       - If yes, place a red pixel (2) at (n, n).
       - If no, stop the extrapolation.
  - Constraints:
    - Grid dimensions are preserved.
    - Original pixels (blue and white) are preserved.
    - Extrapolation only happens along the main diagonal.
