task_description: "Draw a rectangular frame based on the spatial extent of all non-background pixels."
elements:
  - object: primary_shape
    description: "A single contiguous block of a non-white (0), non-gray (5) color."
    properties:
      - color: Varies (e.g., green=3, blue=1, yellow=4). Determines the frame color.
      - pixels: Coordinates of the shape's pixels.
  - object: gray_pixels
    description: "Multiple individual pixels of gray (5)."
    properties:
      - color: Always gray (5).
      - pixels: Coordinates of each gray pixel.
  - object: background
    description: "Pixels with white color (0)."
  - object: combined_non_white
    description: "The set of all pixels belonging to the primary_shape and gray_pixels."
    properties:
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle enclosing all these pixels [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col].
  - object: target_frame
    description: "The rectangular frame to be drawn in the output."
    properties:
      - color: Same as the primary_shape color.
      - bounding_box: Derived by shrinking the combined_non_white bounding_box inwards by 1 pixel from each side [(min_row+1), (min_col+1), (max_row-1), (max_col-1)].
      - location: Drawn on the perimeter of its bounding_box.
actions:
  - action: find_all_non_white_pixels
    description: "Identify coordinates of all pixels that are not white (0)."
  - action: identify_primary_color
    description: "Find the color of the contiguous non-white, non-gray shape among the non-white pixels."
  - action: calculate_combined_bounding_box
    description: "Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices for all non-white pixels."
  - action: calculate_shrunk_bounding_box
    description: "Calculate the frame's bounding box by adding 1 to min_row and min_col, and subtracting 1 from max_row and max_col of the combined bounding box."
  - action: draw_frame_perimeter
    description: "Iterate over the coordinates defining the perimeter of the shrunk_bounding_box. If a coordinate corresponds to a white (0) pixel in the input grid, change its color in the output grid to the primary_color. Otherwise, leave it unchanged."
relationships:
  - relationship: "The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid."
  - relationship: "The target_frame's color is determined by the primary_shape's color."
  - relationship: "The target_frame's position and size are derived from the bounding box of *all* non-white pixels (primary_shape + gray_pixels) after an inward shrinking operation."
  - relationship: "The drawing action modifies only background pixels on the target_frame's perimeter."
