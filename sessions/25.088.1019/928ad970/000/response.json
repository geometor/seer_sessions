Specifically, it seems to be derived from the bounding box encompassing all these non-white pixels.\n5.  **Frame Calculation:** Observing the examples, the frame isn't the exact bounding box of all non-white pixels. Instead, it looks like the bounding box of all non-white pixels is determined first, and then this box is shrunk inwards by one pixel from each side (top, bottom, left, right) to define the position of the final frame.\n6.  **Drawing Rule:** The frame is drawn only by changing white pixels (0) to the primary shape's color along the perimeter of the calculated shrunk bounding box. Existing non-white pixels (the original shape, gray pixels) that fall on this perimeter are *not* overwritten; they retain their original color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
