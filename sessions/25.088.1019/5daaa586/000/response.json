The boundaries of the extracted rectangle are defined by the positions of the four lines identified in the input.\n5.  **Boundary Definition:**\n    *   The column indices of the two vertical lines define the left and right boundaries of the output grid.\n    *   The row indices of the two horizontal lines define the top and bottom boundaries of the output grid.\n6.  **Extraction Logic:** The output grid consists of all pixels within the rectangle formed by these four lines, including the lines themselves. The range of rows extracted is from the minimum row index of the horizontal lines to the maximum row index (inclusive). Similarly, the range of columns extracted is from the minimum column index of the vertical lines to the maximum column index (inclusive).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

A line is characterized by a row or column that consists predominantly of a single non-white color and spans the grid's width or height, respectively.\n2.  **Determine Boundaries:** Let the row indices of the horizontal lines be `r1` and `r2`, and the column indices of the vertical lines be `c1` and `c2`. Calculate the top boundary `top_row = min(r1, r2)`, the bottom boundary `bottom_row = max(r1, r2)`, the left boundary `left_col = min(c1, c2)`, and the right boundary `right_col = max(c1, c2)`.\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Construct the output grid by selecting the portion of the input grid starting from `top_row` and ending at `bottom_row` (inclusive), and starting from `left_col` and ending at `right_col` (inclusive)."
