elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors.
  - object: line
    description: A contiguous set of pixels forming a straight line across the grid dimension (horizontal or vertical).
    properties:
      - orientation: vertical | horizontal
      - location: row_index (for horizontal) or column_index (for vertical)
      - color: The dominant non-white color of the line pixels.
      - role: Defines a boundary for extraction.
input_specifics:
  - property: contains_exactly_four_lines
    value: true
    details: Two lines are vertical, and two lines are horizontal.
  - property: line_characteristics
    details: Lines span the full dimension (height for vertical, width for horizontal) and have a dominant non-white color.
output_specifics:
  - property: is_subgrid_of_input
    value: true
  - property: boundaries_defined_by_input_lines
    value: true
transformation:
  - action: identify_lines
    details: Locate the row indices of the two horizontal lines (row1, row2) and the column indices of the two vertical lines (col1, col2) in the input grid.
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    details: Calculate the bounding box coordinates - top_row = min(row1, row2), bottom_row = max(row1, row2), left_col = min(col1, col2), right_col = max(col1, col2).
  - action: extract_subgrid
    details: Create the output grid by copying the pixels from the input grid within the determined bounding box, specifically from top_row to bottom_row (inclusive) and from left_col to right_col (inclusive).
