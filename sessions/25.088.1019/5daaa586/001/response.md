"""
Identify the row indices of the two horizontal lines and the column indices of the two vertical lines in the input grid. 
A line is characterized by a row or column that consists predominantly (>50%) of a single non-white color and spans the grid's dimension.
Determine the bounding box defined by these lines: top_row = min(horizontal_indices), bottom_row = max(horizontal_indices), 
left_col = min(vertical_indices), right_col = max(vertical_indices).
Extract the subgrid from the input grid corresponding to this bounding box (inclusive).
