Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

The core operation appears to be a repetition or tiling of the input grid pattern to create a larger output grid. In each example, the input grid serves as a "tile" that is repeated both horizontally and vertically to form the output.

*   The size of the output grid is related to the size of the input grid.
*   If the input grid has dimensions `H x W`, the output grid has dimensions `(H * H) x (W * W)`.
*   The input grid pattern is repeated `H` times vertically and `W` times horizontally to construct the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
operation: tiling/repetition
input_object:
  type: grid
  description: A grid representing a pattern or tile.
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
output_object:
  type: grid
  description: A larger grid formed by repeating the input grid pattern.
  properties:
    height: H * H
    width: W * W
transformation:
  action: tile
  details: The input grid is treated as a single tile. This tile is repeated to fill the output grid.
  repetition_count:
    vertical: H (input height)
    horizontal: W (input width)
relationship:
  input_to_output: The output grid is composed entirely of copies of the input grid arranged in a larger grid structure. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by squaring the dimensions of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H * H) rows and (W * W) columns.
3.  Fill the output grid by tiling it with the input grid pattern.
4.  To achieve this, repeat the input grid pattern `H` times vertically and `W` times horizontally.
    *   For each tile position `(tile_row, tile_col)` in the output grid layout (where `0 <= tile_row < H` and `0 <= tile_col < W`):
        *   Copy the entire input grid into the output grid, starting at the output grid coordinates `(tile_row * H, tile_col * W)`.
