task_type: transformation
operation: tiling/repetition
input_object:
  type: grid
  description: A grid representing a pattern or tile.
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
output_object:
  type: grid
  description: A larger grid formed by repeating the input grid pattern.
  properties:
    height: H * H
    width: W * W
transformation:
  action: tile
  details: The input grid is treated as a single tile. This tile is repeated to fill the output grid.
  repetition_count:
    vertical: H (input height)
    horizontal: W (input width)
relationship:
  input_to_output: The output grid is composed entirely of copies of the input grid arranged in a larger grid structure. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by squaring the dimensions of the input grid.
