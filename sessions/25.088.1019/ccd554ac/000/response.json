In each example, the input grid serves as a \"tile\" that is repeated both horizontally and vertically to form the output.\n\n*   The size of the output grid is related to the size of the input grid.\n*   If the input grid has dimensions `H x W`, the output grid has dimensions `(H * H) x (W * W)`.\n*   The input grid pattern is repeated `H` times vertically and `W` times horizontally to construct the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
