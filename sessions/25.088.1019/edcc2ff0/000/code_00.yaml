Grid_Structure:
  Dimensions: 20x10
  Sections:
    - Top_Section:
        Rows: 0-6
        Content: Sparse, primarily single pixels in column 0 on white background.
    - Bottom_Section:
        Rows: 7-19
        Content: Dense patterns, background color with embedded objects.
Color_Roles:
  - Indicator_Colors:
      Location: Top_Section, column 0
      Function: Determine which colors persist in the Bottom_Section and control line length in the Top_Section output.
      Excludes: White (0)
  - Background_Color:
      Location: Dominant color in Bottom_Section, specifically at (7, 0).
      Function: Replaces removed object colors in the Bottom_Section output.
  - Object_Colors:
      Location: Embedded within Bottom_Section background.
      Properties: Form distinct contiguous shapes (connected horizontally/vertically).
Relationships_Actions:
  - Bottom_Section_Filtering:
      Input: Bottom_Section pixels, Indicator_Colors, Background_Color
      Action: Iterate through Bottom_Section pixels. If a pixel's color is NOT Background_Color AND NOT in Indicator_Colors, change its color to Background_Color in the output. Otherwise, keep the original color.
      Trigger: Presence/absence of the pixel's color in the Indicator_Colors set.
  - Top_Section_Line_Generation:
      Input: Indicator_Colors from Top_Section (column 0), Objects in Bottom_Section (input grid)
      Action: For each Indicator_Color `C` at row `r` in Top_Section (column 0):
        1. Count the number `N` of distinct contiguous objects of color `C` in the Bottom_Section of the input grid.
        2. In the output grid's Top_Section, draw a horizontal line of color `C` starting at (r, 0) with length `N`.
        3. Fill the rest of row `r` (from column `N` onwards) with White (0).
      Condition: If `N` is 0 (no objects of color `C` found), the entire row `r` in the output Top_Section becomes White (0).
Object_Definition:
  Contiguity: Pixels of the same color connected horizontally or vertically form a single object.
