            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rules.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grids are 20x10. They appear visually divided into two main sections:\n    *   **Top Section (Rows 0-6):** Contains sparse information, primarily single colored pixels in the first column (column 0) on a white background.\n    *   **Bottom Section (Rows 7-19):** Contains denser patterns, often featuring a large background area of a single color with various smaller, distinct objects embedded within it.\n2.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   **Indicator Colors:** The colors appearing in column 0 of the top section seem to act as indicators or keys.\n    *   **Background Color:** The color filling most of the bottom section (specifically, the color at row 7, column 0) acts as the background for that region.\n    *   **Object Colors:** Colors forming distinct shapes within the bottom section's background.\n    *   **White (0):** Primarily acts as a background in the top section.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to happen in two related parts:\n    *   **Bottom Section Modification:** Colors in the bottom section are selectively removed (replaced by the background color) based on whether they match one of the indicator colors from the top section.\n    *   **Top Section Modification:** The single pixels in the top section's first column are transformed into horizontal lines. The length of each line seems determined by properties of objects of the corresponding color in the bottom section of the *input* grid. Specifically, the length corresponds to the *count* of distinct objects of that color. If a color from the top section has no corresponding objects in the bottom section, it's removed (becomes white).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
