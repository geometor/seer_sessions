elements:
  - element: background
    color: azure (8)
    notes: The default color of the grid. Unmodified unless adjacent to magenta or enclosed by magenta.
  - element: shapes
    color: magenta (6)
    notes: Contiguous blocks of magenta pixels forming object frames (often hollow). These shapes are preserved in their original positions in the output.
  - element: border
    color: green (3)
    generation: Created in the output by changing azure pixels that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any magenta pixel in the input.
    position: Surrounds the magenta shapes.
  - element: fill
    color: yellow (4) or green (3)
    generation: Created in the output by changing azure pixels that were enclosed by magenta shapes in the input.
    position: Occupies the space inside the magenta frames.
    condition: Fill color is green (3) if the enclosed azure region is exactly 2x2 pixels; otherwise, it is yellow (4).

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Azure pixels touching magenta pixels (including diagonals) determine the location of the green border.
  - type: enclosure
    description: Magenta pixels can surround regions of azure pixels, preventing them from connecting to the grid edge via other azure pixels. These define the areas to be filled.
  - type: size_dependency
    description: The color used to fill an enclosed region (yellow or green) depends specifically on whether the enclosed azure area is 2x2.

transformation:
  - action: preserve
    target: magenta (6) pixels
    notes: All magenta pixels from the input remain in the output.
  - action: border
    source: azure (8) pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to magenta (6) pixels
    result: These azure pixels are changed to green (3) in the output.
  - action: identify_enclosed
    source: azure (8) pixels
    method: Flood fill from the grid border; azure pixels not reached are enclosed by magenta (6). Group these into connected regions.
  - action: fill
    target: enclosed azure regions
    logic: |
      For each region:
      1. Calculate the height and width of the region (based on the azure pixels within it).
      2. If height is 2 and width is 2, fill with green (3).
      3. Otherwise, fill with yellow (4).
    result: The corresponding azure pixels in the output grid are changed to the calculated fill color.
