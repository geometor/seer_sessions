All others are yellow. Why is this one different?\n\nCould it be the shape of the frame?\n*   T1 TR: 3x3 Square frame\n*   T1 ML: 'C' frame (not fully enclosed rectangle)\n*   T1 BR: 6x6 Square frame\n*   T2 TR: 5x4 Rectangle frame\n*   T2 BL: 4x4 Square frame\n\nFrame shape doesn't seem to correlate (squares give yellow and green fills).\n\nIs there something about the *location* or *content* of the 2x2 interior in T2 BL?\nThe azure pixels are (10,5), (10,6), (11,5), (11,6).\nIn the output, these become green. The surrounding border is also green.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n1. Find `Enclosed` azure regions (flood fill from border).\n2. Find `Adjacent` azure pixels (ortho/diag to magenta).\n3. Output = input.\n4. For p in `Adjacent`: output[p] = green (3).\n5. For region `R` in `Enclosed`:\n    * Find pixels `P_R` = {p in R}.\n    * If `P_R` is a subset of `Adjacent`: fill `R` with green (3).\n    * Else (if there's at least one pixel in `R` that is NOT in `Adjacent`): fill `R` with yellow (4).\n\n*   **Testing Hypothesis 7:**\n    *   T1 TR: Enclosed R = {(5,10)}. Adjacent = border. Is (5,10) in Adjacent? No. Fill R with yellow. Fits.\n    *   T1 ML: Enclosed R = {(4,4), (5,4)}. Adjacent = border. Are (4,4), (5,4) in Adjacent? Yes, they are adjacent to the inner side of the 'C'. Since P_R is subset of Adjacent, fill R with green. BUT OUTPUT IS YELLOW. Fails.\n\nMaybe my definition of `Adjacent` or `Enclosed` is slightly off, or there's another condition.\n\nLet's simplify. We have magenta objects (6). We add a green border (3). We fill the inside. The fill is usually yellow (4), but sometimes green (3).\n\nWhen is the fill green (3)? Only in T2 BL.\nWhat's special about T2 BL?\n- 4x4 magenta frame.\n- 2x2 azure interior.\n- Output fill is green.\n\nAll other cases have yellow fill.\n- 1x1 interior (T1 TR)\n- 2x1 interior (T1 ML)\n- 4x4 interior (T1 BR)\n- 3x2 interior (T2 TR)\n\nIs it the size 2x2? If the enclosed region is exactly 2x2, fill with green, otherwise yellow? Seems arbitrary but fits the examples.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 8 (Size-based Fill):**\n    1. Copy input to output.\n    2. Find all azure pixels `p` adjacent (ortho/diag) to any magenta pixel. Set `output[p] = green (3)`.\n    3. Find all connected components `R` of azure pixels in the original input that are enclosed by magenta pixels (cannot reach border via azure path).\n    4. For each enclosed region `R`:\n        *   Let `H`, `W` be the height and width of the bounding box of `R`.\n        *   If `H == 2` and `W == 2` (i.e., the enclosed region is exactly 2x2 azure pixels): Fill all pixels `p` in `R` with `green (3)` in the output (overwriting if already green from step 2).\n        *   Else: Fill all pixels `p` in `R` with `yellow (4)` in the output (overwriting if already green from step 2).\n\n*   **Testing Hypothesis 8:**\n    *   T1 TR: Enclosed R is 1x1. H=1, W=1. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.\n    *   T1 ML: Enclosed R is 2x1. H=2, W=1. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.\n    *   T1 BR: Enclosed R is 4x4. H=4, W=4. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.\n    *   T2 TR: Enclosed R is 3x2. H=3, W=2. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.\n    *   T2 BL: Enclosed R is 2x2. H=2, W=2. Fill green. Fits.\n\nThis hypothesis seems to fit all examples. The specific condition for the green fill is that the enclosed *azure* region is exactly 2x2 pixels.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n1.  Identify magenta pixels (6).\n2.  Identify azure pixels (8).\n3.  Find azure pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any magenta pixel. These will become green (3).\n4.  Find connected components of azure pixels enclosed by magenta pixels (using flood fill from border).\n5.  For each enclosed component:\n    *   Determine its dimensions (height/width).\n    *   If dimensions are 2x2, the fill color is green (3).\n    *   Otherwise, the fill color is yellow (4).\n6.  Construct the output grid: start with input, apply green border (step 3), apply fill color (step 5) to enclosed regions.\n\n"

Looking at T2 BL, the interior 2x2 is green, and the border around it is green. The pixels are distinct. The interior pixels were *not* adjacent to magenta, so they weren't part of the initial green border calculation. The fill happens *within* the original azure space.)
