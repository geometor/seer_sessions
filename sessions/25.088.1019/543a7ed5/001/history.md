Okay, my coordinates were off. Let's re-evaluate Train 2 Bottom Left.
Input: Magenta at rows 10, 13 (indices 9, 12) for cols 5-8 (indices 4-7). Magenta at cols 5, 8 (indices 4, 7) for rows 11-12 (indices 10-11).
This forms a 4x4 frame of magenta.
Interior azure pixels: rows 11-12 (indices 10, 11), cols 6-7 (indices 5, 6). This is a 2x2 interior region.

Output: Magenta frame is preserved. Green border surrounds it. The 2x2 interior region at (10,5), (10,6), (11,5), (11,6) is filled with GREEN (3).

Now let's re-evaluate all fills:
*   T1 Top Right: 3x3 frame -> 1x1 interior -> filled Yellow (4)
*   T1 Middle Left: 'C' shape -> 2x1 interior -> filled Yellow (4)
*   T1 Bottom Right: 6x4 frame -> 4x2 interior -> filled Yellow (4) - wait, let me check coords again for T1 bottom right.

Okay, Train 1 Bottom Right:
Input: Magenta frame rows 8, 13 (indices 7, 12) for cols 8-13 (indices 7-12). Magenta frame cols 8, 13 (indices 7, 12) for rows 9-12 (indices 8-11).
This is a 6x6 frame.
Interior azure: rows 9-12 (indices 8-11), cols 9-12 (indices 8-11). This is a 4x4 interior region.
Output: Filled with Yellow (4).

*   T2 Top Right: 4x3 frame -> 2x1 interior -> filled Yellow (4). (Checking coords: Input rows 2,6 [indices 1,5] cols 8-11 [indices 7-10]; Input cols 8,11 [indices 7,10] rows 3-5 [indices 2-4]. Interior is rows 3-5 [indices 2-4], cols 9-10 [indices 8-9]. Hmm, wait.
Input:
R2 (idx 1): 8 6 6 6 6 8
R3 (idx 2): 8 6 8 8 6 8
R4 (idx 3): 8 6 8 8 6 8
R5 (idx 4): 8 6 8 8 6 8
R6 (idx 5): 8 6 6 6 6 8
Frame is 5x4. Interior is R3-5 (idx 2-4), C10-11 (idx 9-10). 3x2 interior. -> Yellow(4) fill.

*   T2 Bottom Left: 4x4 frame -> 2x2 interior -> filled Green (3).

Summary of Fills:
*   1x1 interior -> Yellow (4) [T1 TR]
*   2x1 interior -> Yellow (4) [T1 ML]
*   4x4 interior -> Yellow (4) [T1 BR]
*   3x2 interior -> Yellow (4) [T2 TR]
*   2x2 interior -> Green (3) [T2 BL]

The *only* case that results in a green fill is the 2x2 interior in T2 BL. All others are yellow. Why is this one different?

Could it be the shape of the frame?
*   T1 TR: 3x3 Square frame
*   T1 ML: 'C' frame (not fully enclosed rectangle)
*   T1 BR: 6x6 Square frame
*   T2 TR: 5x4 Rectangle frame
*   T2 BL: 4x4 Square frame

Frame shape doesn't seem to correlate (squares give yellow and green fills).

Is there something about the *location* or *content* of the 2x2 interior in T2 BL?
The azure pixels are (10,5), (10,6), (11,5), (11,6).
In the output, these become green. The surrounding border is also green.

What if the rule is:
1. Find `Enclosed` azure regions (flood fill from border).
2. Find `Adjacent` azure pixels (ortho/diag to magenta).
3. Output = input.
4. For p in `Adjacent`: output[p] = green (3).
5. For region `R` in `Enclosed`:
    * Find pixels `P_R` = {p in R}.
    * If `P_R` is a subset of `Adjacent`: fill `R` with green (3).
    * Else (if there's at least one pixel in `R` that is NOT in `Adjacent`): fill `R` with yellow (4).

*   **Testing Hypothesis 7:**
    *   T1 TR: Enclosed R = {(5,10)}. Adjacent = border. Is (5,10) in Adjacent? No. Fill R with yellow. Fits.
    *   T1 ML: Enclosed R = {(4,4), (5,4)}. Adjacent = border. Are (4,4), (5,4) in Adjacent? Yes, they are adjacent to the inner side of the 'C'. Since P_R is subset of Adjacent, fill R with green. BUT OUTPUT IS YELLOW. Fails.

Maybe my definition of `Adjacent` or `Enclosed` is slightly off, or there's another condition.

Let's simplify. We have magenta objects (6). We add a green border (3). We fill the inside. The fill is usually yellow (4), but sometimes green (3).

When is the fill green (3)? Only in T2 BL.
What's special about T2 BL?
- 4x4 magenta frame.
- 2x2 azure interior.
- Output fill is green.

All other cases have yellow fill.
- 1x1 interior (T1 TR)
- 2x1 interior (T1 ML)
- 4x4 interior (T1 BR)
- 3x2 interior (T2 TR)

Is it the size 2x2? If the enclosed region is exactly 2x2, fill with green, otherwise yellow? Seems arbitrary but fits the examples.

*   **Hypothesis 8 (Size-based Fill):**
    1. Copy input to output.
    2. Find all azure pixels `p` adjacent (ortho/diag) to any magenta pixel. Set `output[p] = green (3)`.
    3. Find all connected components `R` of azure pixels in the original input that are enclosed by magenta pixels (cannot reach border via azure path).
    4. For each enclosed region `R`:
        *   Let `H`, `W` be the height and width of the bounding box of `R`.
        *   If `H == 2` and `W == 2` (i.e., the enclosed region is exactly 2x2 azure pixels): Fill all pixels `p` in `R` with `green (3)` in the output (overwriting if already green from step 2).
        *   Else: Fill all pixels `p` in `R` with `yellow (4)` in the output (overwriting if already green from step 2).

*   **Testing Hypothesis 8:**
    *   T1 TR: Enclosed R is 1x1. H=1, W=1. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.
    *   T1 ML: Enclosed R is 2x1. H=2, W=1. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.
    *   T1 BR: Enclosed R is 4x4. H=4, W=4. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.
    *   T2 TR: Enclosed R is 3x2. H=3, W=2. Not 2x2. Fill yellow. Fits.
    *   T2 BL: Enclosed R is 2x2. H=2, W=2. Fill green. Fits.

This hypothesis seems to fit all examples. The specific condition for the green fill is that the enclosed *azure* region is exactly 2x2 pixels.

**Final Plan:**
1.  Identify magenta pixels (6).
2.  Identify azure pixels (8).
3.  Find azure pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any magenta pixel. These will become green (3).
4.  Find connected components of azure pixels enclosed by magenta pixels (using flood fill from border).
5.  For each enclosed component:
    *   Determine its dimensions (height/width).
    *   If dimensions are 2x2, the fill color is green (3).
    *   Otherwise, the fill color is yellow (4).
6.  Construct the output grid: start with input, apply green border (step 3), apply fill color (step 5) to enclosed regions.


```yaml
elements:
  - element: background
    color: azure (8)
    notes: Remains unchanged in the output unless modified by border or fill rules.
  - element: object
    color: magenta (6)
    notes: These are shapes, typically hollow frames (squares, rectangles, C-shape). They are preserved in the output.
  - element: border
    color: green (3)
    notes: Appears in the output. Forms a 1-pixel thick border (including diagonals) around the magenta objects, replacing the original azure background pixels at those locations.
  - element: fill
    color: yellow (4) or green (3)
    notes: Appears in the output. Fills the regions of azure background pixels that were enclosed by the magenta objects in the input. The fill color depends on the size of the enclosed azure region.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: azure pixel (8)
    to: magenta pixel (6)
    relation: Orthogonal or diagonal adjacency. Azure pixels adjacent to magenta pixels become the green (3) border in the output.
  - type: enclosure
    by: magenta pixels (6)
    on: azure pixels (8)
    relation: Azure pixels form connected regions that cannot reach the grid border by moving only through azure pixels, due to being surrounded by magenta pixels. These enclosed regions are filled.
  - type: fill_rule
    based_on: enclosed azure region size
    relation: If the enclosed azure region has dimensions 2x2, it is filled with green (3). Otherwise, it is filled with yellow (4).

transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify_and_Preserve
    target: magenta (6) pixels
    result: Magenta pixels remain in the same position in the output.
  - step: 2
    action: Create_Border
    source: azure (8) pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to magenta (6) pixels
    target_color: green (3)
    result: Replace these adjacent azure pixels with green pixels in the output.
  - step: 3
    action: Identify_Enclosed_Regions
    source: azure (8) pixels
    condition: Cannot reach the grid border via a path of only azure pixels, blocked by magenta (6) pixels.
    result: Identify connected components of enclosed azure pixels.
  - step: 4
    action: Determine_Fill_Color
    based_on: Each enclosed azure region from Step 3
    condition: Check if the bounding box dimensions of the azure region are exactly 2x2.
    result: Assign fill color green (3) if 2x2, otherwise yellow (4).
  - step: 5
    action: Apply_Fill
    target: Enclosed azure regions from Step 3
    color: Determined by Step 4
    result: Replace the azure pixels within each enclosed region with their assigned fill color (green or yellow) in the output. Overwrites any green border pixels from Step 2 that fall within the enclosed region. (Revisiting: Does fill overwrite border? Looking at T2 BL, the interior 2x2 is green, and the border around it is green. The pixels are distinct. The interior pixels were *not* adjacent to magenta, so they weren't part of the initial green border calculation. The fill happens *within* the original azure space.) Let's refine Step 5: Replace the *original azure pixels* within the enclosed region with the fill color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find all azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any magenta (6) pixel. Change the color of these pixels in the output grid to green (3).
3. Identify all connected regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are completely enclosed by magenta (6) pixels (i.e., they cannot reach the border of the grid by moving only through azure pixels).
4. For each such enclosed azure region:
    a. Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the bounding box containing the azure pixels of this region.
    b. If the dimensions are exactly 2 height and 2 width (a 2x2 area of azure pixels): Set the fill color to green (3).
    c. Otherwise: Set the fill color to yellow (4).
    d. Change the color of all azure pixels belonging to this region in the output grid to the determined fill color (green or yellow).
5. The final output grid contains the original magenta pixels, the green border pixels, and the filled enclosed regions, with all other original azure pixels remaining azure.


## Perception

The task involves modifying an input grid containing azure (8) background and magenta (6) shapes. The transformation adds a green (3) border around the magenta shapes and fills the areas enclosed by these shapes with either yellow (4) or green (3). The core elements are the background, the magenta shapes, the generated border, and the generated fill. The key actions are identifying adjacency, identifying enclosed regions, and applying conditional filling based on the size of the enclosed region.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - element: background
    color: azure (8)
    notes: The default color of the grid. Unmodified unless adjacent to magenta or enclosed by magenta.
  - element: shapes
    color: magenta (6)
    notes: Contiguous blocks of magenta pixels forming object frames (often hollow). These shapes are preserved in their original positions in the output.
  - element: border
    color: green (3)
    generation: Created in the output by changing azure pixels that are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any magenta pixel in the input.
    position: Surrounds the magenta shapes.
  - element: fill
    color: yellow (4) or green (3)
    generation: Created in the output by changing azure pixels that were enclosed by magenta shapes in the input.
    position: Occupies the space inside the magenta frames.
    condition: Fill color is green (3) if the enclosed azure region is exactly 2x2 pixels; otherwise, it is yellow (4).

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Azure pixels touching magenta pixels (including diagonals) determine the location of the green border.
  - type: enclosure
    description: Magenta pixels can surround regions of azure pixels, preventing them from connecting to the grid edge via other azure pixels. These define the areas to be filled.
  - type: size_dependency
    description: The color used to fill an enclosed region (yellow or green) depends specifically on whether the enclosed azure area is 2x2.

transformation:
  - action: preserve
    target: magenta (6) pixels
    notes: All magenta pixels from the input remain in the output.
  - action: border
    source: azure (8) pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to magenta (6) pixels
    result: These azure pixels are changed to green (3) in the output.
  - action: identify_enclosed
    source: azure (8) pixels
    method: Flood fill from the grid border; azure pixels not reached are enclosed by magenta (6). Group these into connected regions.
  - action: fill
    target: enclosed azure regions
    logic: |
      For each region:
      1. Calculate the height and width of the region (based on the azure pixels within it).
      2. If height is 2 and width is 2, fill with green (3).
      3. Otherwise, fill with yellow (4).
    result: The corresponding azure pixels in the output grid are changed to the calculated fill color.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is azure (8) and has at least one magenta (6) neighbor (considering both orthogonal and diagonal neighbors), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3).
3.  Identify all connected components of azure (8) pixels in the *input* grid that are enclosed by magenta (6) pixels. An azure pixel is considered enclosed if it cannot reach any pixel on the border of the grid by moving only horizontally or vertically through other azure (8) pixels.
4.  For each identified enclosed component (region) of azure pixels:
    a.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the bounding box of this azure component.
    b.  Check if the height is exactly 2 and the width is exactly 2.
    c.  If the dimensions are 2x2, the fill color for this region is green (3).
    d.  If the dimensions are anything else, the fill color for this region is yellow (4).
    e.  Iterate through all the pixels belonging to this enclosed component and change their color in the output grid to the determined fill color.
5.  Return the final output grid.
