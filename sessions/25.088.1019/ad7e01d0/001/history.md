**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves resizing an input grid based on its own content. Specifically, the output grid's size is determined by multiplying the input grid's dimensions by themselves (height * height, width * width). The content of the output grid is constructed by tiling either copies of the original input grid or blocks of the background color (white). The decision of whether to place a copy of the input or a white block depends on the color of the corresponding pixel in the original input grid. Gray pixels in the input dictate where copies of the input should be placed in the larger output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: The task transforms an input grid into a larger output grid by selectively tiling copies of the input based on its own pixel values.
  input_grid_description: A small grid (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4) containing pixels of various colors, including white (0) and gray (5).
  output_grid_description: A larger grid whose dimensions are the square of the input grid's dimensions (Input HxW -> Output H*H x W*W). The output grid is composed of blocks, each the size of the original input grid.
objects:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Contains various colors.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: H * H
      - width: W * W
      - structure: Composed of an HxW arrangement of smaller blocks.
      - block_size: H x W (same as input grid size)
      - background_color: white (0)
relationships:
  - relationship: mapping_logic
    description: Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a block in the output grid.
    input_pixel_location: (r, c) where 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W
    output_block_location: Top-left corner at (r * H, c * W)
actions:
  - action: create_output_grid
    conditions:
      - input_pixel (r, c) color is gray (5)
    effect: Copy the entire input grid into the corresponding output block at (r * H, c * W).
  - action: create_output_grid
    conditions:
      - input_pixel (r, c) color is NOT gray (5)
    effect: Fill the corresponding output block at (r * H, c * W) with the background color (white, 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H * H) rows and (W * W) columns, initialized with the background color white (0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at row `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column `c` (from 0 to W-1).
4.  Check the color of the input grid pixel at `(r, c)`.
5.  If the color of the input pixel `(r, c)` is gray (5):
    *   Calculate the top-left starting coordinates for the corresponding block in the output grid: `start_row = r * H`, `start_col = c * W`.
    *   Copy the entire HxW input grid into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at `(start_row, start_col)`.
6.  If the color of the input pixel `(r, c)` is *not* gray:
    *   The corresponding HxW block in the output grid, starting at `(r * H, c * W)`, remains filled with the background color white (0) (as initialized in step 2).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
