"""
The transformation creates a larger output grid based on the input grid.
The output grid's dimensions are the square of the input grid's dimensions (Input HxW -> Output H*H x W*W).
The output grid is composed of blocks, each the size of the original input grid.
The content of each block in the output grid is determined by the color of the corresponding pixel in the input grid.
If a pixel in the input grid at position (r, c) is gray (5), then the corresponding block in the output grid, starting at position (r*H, c*W), is filled with a copy of the entire input grid.
If the input pixel is not gray, the corresponding block in the output grid is filled with the background color white (0).
