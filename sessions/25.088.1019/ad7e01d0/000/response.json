Specifically, the output grid's size is determined by multiplying the input grid's dimensions by themselves (height * height, width * width). The content of the output grid is constructed by tiling either copies of the original input grid or blocks of the background color (white). The decision of whether to place a copy of the input or a white block depends on the color of the corresponding pixel in the original input grid. Gray pixels in the input dictate where copies of the input should be placed in the larger output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
