task_context:
  description: The task transforms an input grid into a larger output grid by selectively tiling copies of the input based on its own pixel values.
  input_grid_description: A small grid (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4) containing pixels of various colors, including white (0) and gray (5).
  output_grid_description: A larger grid whose dimensions are the square of the input grid's dimensions (Input HxW -> Output H*H x W*W). The output grid is composed of blocks, each the size of the original input grid.
objects:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - pixels: Contains various colors.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: H * H
      - width: W * W
      - structure: Composed of an HxW arrangement of smaller blocks.
      - block_size: H x W (same as input grid size)
      - background_color: white (0)
relationships:
  - relationship: mapping_logic
    description: Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a block in the output grid.
    input_pixel_location: (r, c) where 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W
    output_block_location: Top-left corner at (r * H, c * W)
actions:
  - action: create_output_grid
    conditions:
      - input_pixel (r, c) color is gray (5)
    effect: Copy the entire input grid into the corresponding output block at (r * H, c * W).
  - action: create_output_grid
    conditions:
      - input_pixel (r, c) color is NOT gray (5)
    effect: Fill the corresponding output block at (r * H, c * W) with the background color (white, 0).
