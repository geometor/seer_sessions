Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids containing pixels of various colors. White (0) pixels often form horizontal and vertical lines, separating the grid into quadrants or sections.
2.  **Key Objects/Pixels:**
    *   **Gray Object:** In each example, there is a contiguous block of gray (5) pixels, sometimes a square, sometimes an L-shape or rectangle.
    *   **Maroon Pixel:** There is always exactly one maroon (9) pixel, located either within or immediately adjacent (including diagonals) to the gray object.
    *   **Magenta Pixel:** There is always exactly one magenta (6) pixel somewhere in the grid, distinct from the gray object and maroon pixel.
    *   **Other Pixels:** Various other colored pixels (orange, red, blue, yellow, azure, green) exist, but they do not appear to participate directly in the core transformation.
3.  **Transformation:** Two distinct changes occur between the input and output grids:
    *   The single magenta (6) pixel consistently changes its color to maroon (9).
    *   The single original maroon (9) pixel swaps its position and color with one of the adjacent gray (5) pixels. The specific gray pixel chosen for the swap seems determined by the relative location of the magenta pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify and modify two specific pixels based on their color and relative positions.
grid_properties:
  - separation_lines: Grids often contain horizontal and vertical lines of white (0) pixels.
  - background: The most common background color is orange (7).
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    count: 1
    location: variable
    action: color_change
    output_color: maroon (9)
  - object_type: pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    location: adjacent (including diagonal) to or inside the gray object
    action: swap_position_and_color
    target: adjacent gray (5) pixel
  - object_type: contiguous_shape
    color: gray (5)
    count: 1
    shape: variable (square, rectangle, L-shape)
    role: provides candidate pixels for swapping with the maroon (9) pixel
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    source: magenta (6) pixel
    target: maroon (9) pixel
    determines: which adjacent gray (5) pixel the maroon (9) pixel swaps with. The direction of the swap (delta_row, delta_col) corresponds to the sign of the difference in coordinates between the magenta and maroon pixels.
persistence:
  - All pixels retain their original color and position unless they are the magenta (6) pixel or the maroon (9)/gray (5) pair involved in the swap.
  - The white (0) separator lines remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Locate the unique pixel with the color magenta (6) in the input grid. Record its coordinates `(r_mag, c_mag)`.
3.  Locate the unique pixel with the color maroon (9) in the input grid. Record its coordinates `(r_mar, c_mar)`.
4.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at coordinates `(r_mag, c_mag)` to maroon (9).
5.  Calculate the direction vector `(dr, dc)` based on the relative positions:
    *   `dr = sign(r_mag - r_mar)` (where sign(x) is -1 if x < 0, 1 if x > 0, and 0 if x = 0).
    *   `dc = sign(c_mag - c_mar)` (using the same sign function).
6.  Determine the target coordinates `(r_swap, c_swap)` for the swap: `r_swap = r_mar + dr`, `c_swap = c_mar + dc`.
7.  Confirm that the pixel at `(r_swap, c_swap)` in the input grid has the color gray (5).
8.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at the target coordinates `(r_swap, c_swap)` to maroon (9).
9.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at the original maroon coordinates `(r_mar, c_mar)` to gray (5).
10. Return the modified output grid.
