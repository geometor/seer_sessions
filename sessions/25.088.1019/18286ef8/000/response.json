White (0) pixels often form horizontal and vertical lines, separating the grid into quadrants or sections.\n2.  **Key Objects/Pixels:**\n    *   **Gray Object:** In each example, there is a contiguous block of gray (5) pixels, sometimes a square, sometimes an L-shape or rectangle.\n    *   **Maroon Pixel:** There is always exactly one maroon (9) pixel, located either within or immediately adjacent (including diagonals) to the gray object.\n    *   **Magenta Pixel:** There is always exactly one magenta (6) pixel somewhere in the grid, distinct from the gray object and maroon pixel.\n    *   **Other Pixels:** Various other colored pixels (orange, red, blue, yellow, azure, green) exist, but they do not appear to participate directly in the core transformation.\n3.  **Transformation:** Two distinct changes occur between the input and output grids:\n    *   The single magenta (6) pixel consistently changes its color to maroon (9).\n    *   The single original maroon (9) pixel swaps its position and color with one of the adjacent gray (5) pixels. The specific gray pixel chosen for the swap seems determined by the relative location of the magenta pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
