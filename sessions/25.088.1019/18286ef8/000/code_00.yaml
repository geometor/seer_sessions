task_description: Identify and modify two specific pixels based on their color and relative positions.
grid_properties:
  - separation_lines: Grids often contain horizontal and vertical lines of white (0) pixels.
  - background: The most common background color is orange (7).
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    count: 1
    location: variable
    action: color_change
    output_color: maroon (9)
  - object_type: pixel
    color: maroon (9)
    count: 1
    location: adjacent (including diagonal) to or inside the gray object
    action: swap_position_and_color
    target: adjacent gray (5) pixel
  - object_type: contiguous_shape
    color: gray (5)
    count: 1
    shape: variable (square, rectangle, L-shape)
    role: provides candidate pixels for swapping with the maroon (9) pixel
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    source: magenta (6) pixel
    target: maroon (9) pixel
    determines: which adjacent gray (5) pixel the maroon (9) pixel swaps with. The direction of the swap (delta_row, delta_col) corresponds to the sign of the difference in coordinates between the magenta and maroon pixels.
persistence:
  - All pixels retain their original color and position unless they are the magenta (6) pixel or the maroon (9)/gray (5) pair involved in the swap.
  - The white (0) separator lines remain unchanged.
