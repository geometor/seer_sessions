Locate the unique Magenta (6) pixel (M) and the unique Maroon (9) pixel (R) in the input grid.\n3. Change the color of the pixel at M's coordinates to Maroon (9) in the output grid. This happens regardless of whether R moves.\n4. Calculate the direction vector (dr, dc) from R towards M using the sign of the difference in coordinates: \n   dr = sign(M_row - R_row)\n   dc = sign(M_col - R_col)\n   (sign(x) is -1 if x < 0, 1 if x > 0, and 0 if x == 0).\n5. Determine the coordinates of the potential target pixel (T), one step from R in the calculated direction: \n   T = (R_row + dr, R_col + dc).\n6. Check if the target coordinates T are within the grid boundaries and if the color of the pixel at T in the *input* grid is Gray (5). This determines if the move is valid.\n7. If the move is valid:\n    a. Change the color of the pixel at T's coordinates to Maroon (9) in the output grid.\n    b. Change the color of the pixel at R's original coordinates to Gray (5) in the output grid.\n8. If the move is invalid (T is out of bounds, the pixel at T is not Gray in the input grid, or R and M are at the same location resulting in dr=0 and dc=0):\n    a. The pixel at R's original coordinates remains Maroon (9) (its value from the initial copy of the input grid).\n9. Return the modified output grid.\n\nNote: This rule successfully explains examples 1 and 3. Example 2's expected output in the problem description appears inconsistent with this rule, as the rule would lead to the Maroon pixel moving to (3,3), not (4,3). However, the rule derived from examples 1 and 3 is implemented here.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixel(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates (row, col) of the first pixel with the given color.\"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    if coords.shape[0] > 0:\n        # Return as (row, col) tuple\n        return tuple(coords[0])\n    return None\n\ndef sign(x):\n    \"\"\"Returns the sign of a number: -1 for negative, 1 for positive, 0 for zero.\"\"\"\n    if x < 0:\n        return -1\n    elif x > 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation and copying\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1.
