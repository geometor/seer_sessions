The grid sizes vary (15x15, 15x15, 7x7).\n*   **Output Grids:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as its corresponding input grid. The background remains white, but now there are multiple pixels of the same color as the single pixel in the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The single input pixel seems to act as a seed or origin point. The output pixels form a distinct pattern related to this origin.\n*   **Pattern:** The colored pixels in the output grids form two diagonal lines intersecting at the position of the original input pixel. This pattern resembles an 'X' shape extending across the grid. The defining characteristic of these pixels appears to be that their row distance from the original pixel is equal to their column distance from the original pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
