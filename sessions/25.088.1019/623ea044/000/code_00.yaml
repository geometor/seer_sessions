task_description: Identify a single colored pixel in the input grid and draw two diagonal lines (an 'X' shape) passing through that pixel's location using the same color in the output grid.

elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    persistence: remains the same in the output, unless overwritten by the pattern.
  - role: seed_pixel
    count: exactly one per input grid
    color: varies (orange, red, azure in examples)
    properties:
      - location (row, column) is crucial.
      - is the origin for the output pattern.
  - role: output_pattern
    color: same as the seed_pixel color.
    shape: two diagonal lines intersecting at the seed_pixel location.
    relationship_to_seed:
      - all pixels in the pattern lie on the two diagonals passing through the seed_pixel's coordinates (r0, c0).
      - specifically, a pixel at (r, c) is part of the pattern if its absolute row difference from the seed (`abs(r - r0)`) is equal to its absolute column difference from the seed (`abs(c - c0)`).
    extent: covers the entire grid along these diagonals.

grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have identical dimensions for each example pair.
  - content: Primarily background color (white), with a single colored pixel in the input transformed into a diagonal pattern of the same color in the output.
