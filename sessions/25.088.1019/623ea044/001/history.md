Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** Each input grid contains a single colored pixel (orange, red, azure) placed somewhere on a white background. The grid sizes vary (15x15, 15x15, 7x7).
*   **Output Grids:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as its corresponding input grid. The background remains white, but now there are multiple pixels of the same color as the single pixel in the input.
*   **Transformation:** The single input pixel seems to act as a seed or origin point. The output pixels form a distinct pattern related to this origin.
*   **Pattern:** The colored pixels in the output grids form two diagonal lines intersecting at the position of the original input pixel. This pattern resembles an 'X' shape extending across the grid. The defining characteristic of these pixels appears to be that their row distance from the original pixel is equal to their column distance from the original pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify a single colored pixel in the input grid and draw two diagonal lines (an 'X' shape) passing through that pixel's location using the same color in the output grid.

elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    persistence: remains the same in the output, unless overwritten by the pattern.
  - role: seed_pixel
    count: exactly one per input grid
    color: varies (orange, red, azure in examples)
    properties:
      - location (row, column) is crucial.
      - is the origin for the output pattern.
  - role: output_pattern
    color: same as the seed_pixel color.
    shape: two diagonal lines intersecting at the seed_pixel location.
    relationship_to_seed:
      - all pixels in the pattern lie on the two diagonals passing through the seed_pixel's coordinates (r0, c0).
      - specifically, a pixel at (r, c) is part of the pattern if its absolute row difference from the seed (`abs(r - r0)`) is equal to its absolute column difference from the seed (`abs(c - c0)`).
    extent: covers the entire grid along these diagonals.

grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have identical dimensions for each example pair.
  - content: Primarily background color (white), with a single colored pixel in the input transformed into a diagonal pattern of the same color in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Seed:** Scan the input grid to find the single non-white pixel. Record its color (C) and its row (r0) and column (c0) coordinates.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  **Generate Pattern:** Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the output grid.
4.  **Check Diagonal Condition:** For each cell (r, c), calculate the absolute difference in rows: `delta_r = abs(r - r0)` and the absolute difference in columns: `delta_c = abs(c - c0)`.
5.  **Color Pixel:** If `delta_r` is equal to `delta_c`, set the color of the output grid cell at (r, c) to the recorded color C.
6.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid after checking all cells is the final output.
