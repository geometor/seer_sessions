Identify the single non-white pixel (seed pixel) in the input grid. 
Determine its color (C) and location (r0, c0).
Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the output grid. 
If the absolute difference between the cell's row and the seed row (abs(r - r0)) 
is equal to the absolute difference between the cell's column and the seed column (abs(c - c0)),

Return the modified output grid.
