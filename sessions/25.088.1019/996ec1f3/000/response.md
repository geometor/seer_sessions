Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids are consistently 19x19.
2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are consistently 3x3.
3.  **Vertical Separator**: Each input grid contains a distinct vertical line composed entirely of white pixels (color 0). This line consistently appears at column index 10.
4.  **Horizontal Separator**: Each input grid also seems to have a horizontal line that acts as a separator. This line is identified as the row that is most dominated by a single color, ignoring the pixel in the vertical separator column. The color of this dominant line varies between examples (green, gray, white).
5.  **Quadrants**: The vertical and horizontal separators divide the input grid into four main quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).
6.  **Transformation Goal**: The task is to summarize the information from the input grid's separators and quadrants into a 3x3 output grid.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size:
    input: 19x19
    output: 3x3
  input_features:
    - type: line
      orientation: vertical
      color: white (0)
      location: fixed column index 10
      role: primary separator (defines left/right regions)
    - type: line
      orientation: horizontal
      color: variable (determined per example)
      location: variable row index (determined by max color frequency in a row, excluding the vertical separator column)
      role: secondary separator (defines top/bottom regions, provides 'background' color)
  output_structure:
    - mapping: grid reduction
    - grid: 3x3
    - central_cross:
        location: middle row (index 1) and middle column (index 1)
        color: derived from the horizontal separator line color
    - corner_cells:
        location: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        color: derived from corresponding input quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR)
  transformation_logic:
    - step: identify vertical separator column (all white)
    - step: identify horizontal separator row (most monochromatic row, ignoring vertical separator column) and its dominant color (`sep_color`)
    - step: determine output grid's central cross color using `sep_color`
    - step: define four input quadrants based on separators
    - step: determine output corner colors by finding the most frequent color within each corresponding quadrant, excluding `sep_color`
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators**:
    *   Find the column index (`sep_col`) where all pixels are white (0).
    *   Find the row index (`sep_row`) that has the highest frequency of a single color, ignoring the pixel at `sep_col`. Record the most frequent color in this row as `sep_color`.
2.  **Initialize Output**: Create a new 3x3 grid.
3.  **Fill Central Cross**: Set all pixels in the middle row (index 1) and the middle column (index 1) of the output grid to `sep_color`.
4.  **Determine Quadrant Colors**:
    *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows less than `sep_row` and columns less than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (0, 0) to this color.
    *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows less than `sep_row` and columns greater than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (0, 2) to this color.
    *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows greater than `sep_row` and columns less than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (2, 0) to this color.
    *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows greater than `sep_row` and columns greater than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (2, 2) to this color.
5.  **Return Output**: The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output.
