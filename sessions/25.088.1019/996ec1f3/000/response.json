This line consistently appears at column index 10.\n4.  **Horizontal Separator**: Each input grid also seems to have a horizontal line that acts as a separator. This line is identified as the row that is most dominated by a single color, ignoring the pixel in the vertical separator column. The color of this dominant line varies between examples (green, gray, white).\n5.  **Quadrants**: The vertical and horizontal separators divide the input grid into four main quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n6.  **Transformation Goal**: The task is to summarize the information from the input grid's separators and quadrants into a 3x3 output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Record the most frequent color in this row as `sep_color`.\n2.  **Initialize Output**: Create a new 3x3 grid.\n3.  **Fill Central Cross**: Set all pixels in the middle row (index 1) and the middle column (index 1) of the output grid to `sep_color`.\n4.  **Determine Quadrant Colors**:\n    *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows less than `sep_row` and columns less than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (0, 0) to this color.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows less than `sep_row` and columns greater than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (0, 2) to this color.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows greater than `sep_row` and columns less than `sep_col`. Find the color that appears most frequently in this quadrant, *excluding* `sep_color`. Set the output grid cell at (2, 0) to this color.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Consider the input grid quadrant defined by rows greater than `sep_row` and columns greater than `sep_col`.
