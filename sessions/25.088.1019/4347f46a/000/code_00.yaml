objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: any non-white color (1-9)
      - fill: solid
      - shape: rectangular
      - location: anywhere on the grid
      - background: surrounded by white (0) pixels, or grid edges.
relationships:
  - between: input_pixel, output_pixel
    rule: If an input pixel is part of the interior of a solid rectangle (not on its border), its corresponding output pixel becomes white (0).
  - between: input_pixel, output_pixel
    rule: If an input pixel is part of the border of a solid rectangle, its corresponding output pixel retains the original color.
  - between: input_pixel, output_pixel
    rule: If an input pixel is white (0), its corresponding output pixel remains white (0).
actions:
  - name: identify_rectangles
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels that form a solid rectangle.
  - name: hollow_rectangle
    description: For each identified rectangle, change the color of its interior pixels to white (0).
    details:
      - The border pixels (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the rectangle keep their original color.
      - Only pixels that are *not* part of the border are changed to white.
