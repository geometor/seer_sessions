            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the background color, located the single non-background object, erased the original object, and shifted a copy to the right. However, it failed because the transformation involves more than just shifting a duplicate. The `Expected Output` in both examples shows that the colors *within* the object itself are altered during the copy/shift process. Specifically, the two non-background colors that constitute the object appear to be swapped in the shifted version.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the transformation logic:\n1.  Identify the background color.\n2.  Identify the single connected non-background object and its constituent pixels.\n3.  Determine the two distinct non-background colors present within this object.\n4.  Create a mapping to swap these two colors.\n5.  Initialize the output grid.\n6.  Erase the original object in the output grid.\n7.  Calculate the shift required to place the copy immediately to the right of the original object's bounding box.\n8.  For each pixel of the original object:\n    *   Apply the color swap mapping to get the transformed color.\n    *   Calculate the destination coordinates for the shifted pixel.\n    *   If the destination is within bounds, place the transformed color pixel in the output grid.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

            "text": "**Correction:** My analysis code for `colors_swapped_in_expected` was flawed for Example 1. Let me rethink that part. The expected output clearly shows white (0) where gray (5) was, and gray (5) where white (0) was, relative to the shifted position. The automated check failed, likely due to an error in comparing pixel values directly or handling the shift. Let's manually re-verify:\n\n*   **Example 1 Input Object Pixel (4, 4) = 0 (white).** Shift = 5. Expected Output Pixel (4, 4+5) = (4, 9) = 5 (gray). Swap: 0 -> 5. Correct.\n*   **Example 1 Input Object Pixel (5, 3) = 0 (white).** Shift = 5. Expected Output Pixel (5, 3+5) = (5, 8) = 5 (gray). Swap: 0 -> 5. Correct.\n*   **Example 1 Input Object Pixel (5, 4) = 5 (gray).** Shift = 5. Expected Output Pixel (5, 4+5) = (5, 9) = 0 (white). Swap: 5 -> 0. Correct.\n*   **Example 1 Input Object Pixel (6, 2) = 0 (white).** Shift = 5. Expected Output Pixel (6, 2+5) = (6, 7) = 5 (gray). Swap: 0 -> 5. Correct.\n*   **Example 1 Input Object Pixel (6, 3) = 5 (gray).** Shift = 5. Expected Output Pixel (6, 3+5) = (6, 8) = 0 (white). Swap: 5 -> 0. Correct.\n\nOkay, the colors *are* swapped in Example 1 as well. The automated check was incorrect. The key finding remains: the two non-background colors making up the object are swapped in the shifted copy.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
