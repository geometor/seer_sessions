            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 16x16.\n2.  **Background:** The predominant color in all examples is azure (8), which serves as the background color.\n3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there is a single contiguous object composed of colors other than the background color.\n    *   Example 1: Object made of white (0) and gray (5).\n    *   Example 2: Object made of blue (1) and red (2).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves several steps consistently observed across examples:\n    *   **Object Identification:** The non-background object is identified.\n    *   **Duplication:** The identified object seems to be duplicated. One copy remains in the original position, and a second, modified copy is created.\n    *   **Color Modification (in Copy):** The colors within the *copied* object are changed based on a rule. It appears that all non-background colors in the object are changed to match the non-background color with the highest numerical value present in the original object.\n        *   Example 1: Original colors are white (0) and gray (5). Highest is 5. In the copy, white (0) becomes gray (5), and gray (5) remains gray (5).\n        *   Example 2: Original colors are blue (1) and red (2). Highest is 2. In the copy, blue (1) becomes red (2), and red (2) remains red (2).\n    *   **Translation (of Copy):** The modified copy is translated horizontally to the right. The position seems determined by placing the left edge of the copied object immediately adjacent to the right edge of the original object.\n        *   Example 1: Original object spans columns 3 to 6. The copy spans columns 6 to 9. The leftmost column of the copy (6) is one column to the right of the original's rightmost column (5, wait index vs coordinate, original rightmost is col index 6). Let's re-evaluate. Original bounding box cols: [3, 6]. Copy bounding box cols: [6, 9]. The shift amount is 3 (6-3 = 3). The copy starts at column index 6. The original ends at column index 6. It looks like the copy *starts* at the column index where the original *ends*. Let's re-check example 2.\n        *   Example 2: Original object spans columns 1 to 5. The copy spans columns 7 to 11. The shift amount is 6 (7-1 = 6). The copy starts at column index 7. The original ends at column index 5. The copy starts one column *after* the original ends (5+1 = 6, copy starts at 7? Hmm).\n        *   Let's refine the translation rule: Calculate the bounding box of the original object. Let the minimum column index be `min_col` and the maximum column index be `max_col`. The horizontal shift distance seems to be `max_col - min_col + 1` (which is the width of the object). The new `min_col` for the copy is `original_min_col + shift`.\n            *   Ex 1: `min_col=3`, `max_col=6`. Width = 6-3+1=4. Shift = 4. New `min_col` = 3+4=7. Output copy starts col 6? No.\n            *   Ex 2: `min_col=1`, `max_col=5`. Width = 5-1+1=5. Shift = 5. New `min_col` = 1+5=6. Output copy starts col 7? No.\n        *   Let's try the simpler adjacency rule again: Place the copy such that its `min_col` is `original_max_col + 1`.\n            *   Ex 1: `original_max_col=6`. Copy `min_col` should be 7. Output copy `min_col` is 6. Doesn't fit.\n            *   Ex 2: `original_max_col=5`. Copy `min_col` should be 6. Output copy `min_col` is 7. Doesn't fit.\n        *   Okay, let's re-examine the shift amounts directly. Ex1 shift = 3. Ex2 shift = 6. What relates the object to these numbers?\n            *   Ex1: Object cols [3, 6]. `min_col=3`. Shift = 3.\n            *   Ex2: Object cols [1, 5]. `min_col=1`. Shift = 6.\n        *   There doesn't seem to be a direct link based *only* on the object's position or size. Could it relate to the *colors*?\n            *   Ex1: Colors 0, 5. Max=5. Target=5. Shift=3.\n            *   Ex2: Colors 1, 2. Max=2. Target=2. Shift=6.\n        *   This doesn't show an obvious pattern either. What if the shift is fixed based on the *target* color? No, that seems unlikely.\n        *   Let's reconsider the relative placement.\n            *   Ex1: Original ends at 6. Copy starts at 6. Overlap? No, looking closely, the pixel at (6,6) is gray(5) in input and azure(8) in output. The pixel at (6,5) is white(0) in input and gray(5) in output. The pixel at (6,7) is azure(8) in input and gray(5) in output. The shapes are:\n                Input: White pixels at (4,4), (5,3), (5,5), (6,2), (6,6), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,2), (9,6), (10,3), (10,5), (11,4). Gray pixels at (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,4), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (10,4).\n                Output: Original object untouched (verified by checking a few points, e.g., (6,3) is gray in both). Copy object: Pixels corresponding to *all* original non-background pixels, now colored gray(5), shifted right by 3 columns. e.g. input (4,4) white -> output (4,7) gray. input (6,3) gray -> output (6,6) gray. Yes, the shift is exactly +3 columns for the copy.\n            *   Ex2: Original ends at col 5. Copy starts at col 7. Shift is +6 columns. Input (4,2) blue -> output (4,8) red. Input (5,2) red -> output (5,8) red. Input (7,5) blue -> output (7,11) red. Yes, the shift is exactly +6 columns for the copy.\n        *   So the shift amounts are 3 for Ex1 and 6 for Ex2. Still need to find the rule for determining the shift amount.\n        *   Let's revisit the bounding box widths: Ex1 width=4. Ex2 width=5.\n        *   Shift vs Width: (Ex1: 3 vs 4), (Ex2: 6 vs 5). No obvious relation.\n        *   Shift vs Min Col: (Ex1: 3 vs 3), (Ex2: 6 vs 1). No obvious relation.\n        *   Shift vs Max Col: (Ex1: 3 vs 6), (Ex2: 6 vs 5). No obvious relation.\n        *   Could the shift relate to the *number of distinct non-background colors*? Ex1 has 2 (0, 5). Ex2 has 2 (1, 2). No.\n        *   Could it relate to the *target color value* itself? Ex1 target=5, shift=3. Ex2 target=2, shift=6. No.\n        *   Could it relate to the *other* color value? Ex1 other=0, shift=3. Ex2 other=1, shift=6. No.\n        *   Is it possible the shift amount is encoded somewhere else? Or is it related to the *shape* in a more complex way?\n        *   What if the shift amount is simply the `min_col` of the object's bounding box? Ex1: `min_col=3`, shift=3. YES. Ex2: `min_col=1`, shift=6. NO.\n        *   What if the shift amount is simply the `max_col` of the object's bounding box? Ex1: `max_col=6`, shift=3. NO. Ex2: `max_col=5`, shift=6. NO.\n        *   Let's reconsider: Ex1 shift=3. Ex2 shift=6. Maybe it's related to grid size? Both are 16x16.\n        *   What if the rule involves coordinates *and* colors?\n        *   Let's look at the full input arrays again. Is there anything *else* changing? No, only the object area seems involved.\n        *   Could the shift be related to the *sum* or *count* of certain pixels?\n            *   Ex1: 14 white(0), 10 gray(5). Total 24. Shift=3.\n            *   Ex2: 13 blue(1), 7 red(2). Total 20. Shift=6.\n        *   Let's assume the primary hypothesis (copy, color change, translate) is correct, but the translation rule is elusive. The most plausible simple geometric rules (adjacency, width-based) didn't fit both. A rule based on `min_col` worked for Ex1 but not Ex2.\n        *   What if the shift amount is related to the target color and the minimum column? Ex1: target=5, min_col=3, shift=3. Ex2: target=2, min_col=1, shift=6. Could shift = target + min_col - k? Ex1: 3 = 5 + 3 - 5. Ex2: 6 = 2 + 1 - (-3). Doesn't look simple. Could shift = target * min_col - k? Ex1: 3 = 5*3 - 12. Ex2: 6 = 2*1 - (-4). No.\n        *   Let's reconsider the adjacency idea: Place copy's `min_col` at `original_max_col + 1`.\n            *   Ex1: `orig_max=6`. Copy should start at 7. It starts at 6. Difference = -1.\n            *   Ex2: `orig_max=5`. Copy should start at 6. It starts at 7. Difference = +1.\n        *   Maybe the shift is `width + (target_color % 2)`? Ex1: width=4, target=5. Shift = 4 + (5%2) = 4+1=5. No (shift=3). Ex2: width=5, target=2. Shift = 5 + (2%2) = 5+0=5. No (shift=6).\n        *   Maybe the shift is `width + (min_color % 2)`? Ex1: width=4, min_color=0. Shift = 4 + (0%2) = 4+0=4. No (shift=3). Ex2: width=5, min_color=1. Shift = 5 + (1%2) = 5+1=6. YES! Let's recheck Ex1 with this rule. Shift=3. Rule gives 4. Still doesn't work for both.\n\nLet's step back and look at the overall action: Create a monochrome copy (using max color) and place it *somewhere* to the right. Keep the original.\nThe placement rule is the difficulty.\n\nRevisit Ex1: Input cols 3-6. Output copy cols 6-9. Shift = 3.\nRevisit Ex2: Input cols 1-5. Output copy cols 7-11. Shift = 6.\n\nIs there *any* pixel whose column index equals the shift amount?\nEx1: Shift=3. Column 3 contains white and gray pixels.\nEx2: Shift=6. No column 6 in the input object.\n\nIs the shift related to the *row* indices?\nEx1: Rows 4-11. min=4, max=11, height=8. Shift=3.\nEx2: Rows 4-11. min=4, max=11, height=8. Shift=6.\nShift does not seem related to rows.\n\nLet's try the `min_col` again.\nEx1: `min_col=3`. Shift=3. Matches.\nEx2: `min_col=1`. Shift=6. Does not match.\n\nWhat if the shift = `max_col - min_color_value`?\nEx1: `max_col=6`. `min_color=0`. Shift = 6-0=6. No (shift=3).\nEx2: `max_col=5`. `min_color=1`. Shift = 5-1=4. No (shift=6).\n\nWhat if the shift = `max_col - target_color_value`?\nEx1: `max_col=6`. `target=5`. Shift = 6-5=1. No (shift=3).\nEx2: `max_col=5`. `target=2`. Shift = 5-2=3. No (shift=6).\n\nThis translation rule is surprisingly tricky. Let's assume the simplest possible explanation that fits *one* example and see if it generalizes later or needs refinement. The `shift = min_col` rule worked for Ex1. Let's tentatively use that and refine if the test case fails.\n\nRule Refined (Tentative):\n1. Find the background color (most frequent color).\n2. Identify the object (contiguous non-background pixels).\n3. Find the bounding box (`min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`).\n4. Find all non-background colors in the object. Determine the target color (the one with the highest numerical value).\n5. Create a copy of the output grid, initially identical to the input.\n6. Determine the horizontal shift amount. Tentative rule: `shift = min_col`.\n7. Iterate through the pixels of the original object (within its bounding box). For each pixel `(r, c)` with a non-background color:\n    a. Keep the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid as it was in the input.\n    b. Calculate the copied position: `(r_copy, c_copy) = (r, c + shift)`.\n    c. If `(r_copy, c_copy)` is within the grid bounds, set the pixel at `(r_copy, c_copy)` in the output grid to the `target_color`.\n\nRe-evaluating Ex2 with `shift = min_col`: `min_col=1`. Shift should be 1. But the actual shift is 6. This rule is incorrect.\n\nLet's reconsider the adjacency rule: place copy's `min_col` at `original_max_col + 1`.\nEx1: `orig_max=6`. Copy starts at 7. Observed copy starts at 6.\nEx2: `orig_max=5`. Copy starts at 6. Observed copy starts at 7.\nThere's an offset: Observed start = `orig_max + 1 + offset`.\nEx1: 6 = 6 + 1 + offset => offset = -1.\nEx2: 7 = 5 + 1 + offset => offset = +1.\nWhat determines the offset? (-1 for Ex1, +1 for Ex2).\nEx1: Target color 5 (odd). Offset -1.\nEx2: Target color 2 (even). Offset +1.\nHypothesis: `offset = -1` if target color is odd, `offset = +1` if target color is even.\nLet's test this combined rule:\nCopy starts at `new_min_col = original_max_col + 1 + (-1 if target_color % 2 != 0 else 1)`.\nEx1: `orig_max=6`, `target=5` (odd). `new_min_col = 6 + 1 + (-1) = 6`. Matches observation.\nEx2: `orig_max=5`, `target=2` (even). `new_min_col = 5 + 1 + (1) = 7`. Matches observation.\nThis looks promising! The shift amount is `shift = new_min_col - original_min_col`.\nEx1: `shift = 6 - 3 = 3`. Correct.\nEx2: `shift = 7 - 1 = 6`. Correct.\n\nFinal refined rule:\n1. Identify background color (most frequent).\n2. Find the single contiguous non-background object.\n3. Determine its bounding box (`min_col`, `max_col`).\n4. Find the non-background colors within it and identify the `target_color` (highest numerical value).\n5. Calculate the starting column for the copy: `new_min_col = max_col + 1 + (-1 if target_color % 2 != 0 else 1)`.\n6. Calculate the shift: `shift = new_min_col - min_col`.\n7. Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n8. Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` of the original object. For each such pixel:\n    a. The pixel `(r, c)` in the output remains unchanged (preserving the original object).\n    b. Calculate the destination coordinate for the copy: `(r_dest, c_dest) = (r, c + shift)`.\n    c. If `(r_dest, c_dest)` is within the grid bounds, set the output grid pixel at `(r_dest, c_dest)` to the `target_color`.\n\nThis covers all aspects: identification, duplication, color change, translation, and preservation of the original.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
