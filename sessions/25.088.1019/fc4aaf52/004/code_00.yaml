task_description: Move a single object horizontally without changing its colors.
background_color_strategy: Most frequent color in the grid.
object_identification: Find the single contiguous group of non-background pixels.
transformations:
  - action: identify_object
    target: the single non-background object
    properties:
      - coordinates
      - bounding_box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - colors (all colors present in the object)
  - action: calculate_shift
    reference_object: input object
    details: The horizontal shift amount (delta_col) is calculated such that the new object's minimum column starts immediately to the right of the original object's maximum column. delta_col = (original_max_col + 1) - original_min_col. The vertical position (delta_row) is 0.
  - action: create_output_grid
    based_on: input_grid
    size: same as input_grid
  - action: erase_object
    target_grid: output_grid
    object_to_erase: original input object
    fill_color: background_color
  - action: copy_object
    target_grid: output_grid
    object_to_copy: original input object (preserving all original colors and relative pixel positions)
    destination: original object coordinates shifted by (delta_row=0, delta_col)
    boundary_handling: If shifted pixels fall outside the grid, they are not drawn.
