## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying a single non-background object, determining its maximum color, erasing the original object, and then drawing a *monochrome* version of the object (using the maximum color) shifted horizontally to the right.

The results show this approach fails because the expected output preserves the *original* colors and internal structure of the object, merely shifting its position. The code incorrectly replaces the object's pixels with a single color (the maximum color found within the original object).

The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the transformation logic:
1.  Correctly identify the background color and the single non-background object.
2.  Determine the bounding box of the object.
3.  Calculate the required horizontal shift (the new object's left edge should be one column to the right of the original object's right edge).
4.  Create the output grid by first copying the input grid.
5.  Erase the original object from the output grid by filling its coordinates with the background color.
6.  Copy the *original* pixels of the object (preserving their colors and relative positions) to the new, shifted location in the output grid. Ensure the copied pixels stay within the grid boundaries.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the examples:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Grid:** 16x16
*   **Background Color:** 8 (azure)
*   **Object Colors:** 0 (white), 5 (gray)
*   **Input Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 2-6
*   **Input Object Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=2, max_c=6)
*   **Expected Output Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 7-11
*   **Expected Output Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=7, max_c=11)
*   **Transformation:**
    *   The object retains its original colors (0 and 5).
    *   The object is shifted horizontally.
    *   Shift Calculation: `new_min_c = old_max_c + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`. Delta_c = `new_min_c - old_min_c = 7 - 2 = 5`.
    *   The original object location is filled with the background color (8).
*   **Code Output Discrepancy:** The output object is monochrome (all 5), not multi-colored (0 and 5).

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Grid:** 16x16
*   **Background Color:** 8 (azure)
*   **Object Colors:** 1 (blue), 2 (red)
*   **Input Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 1-5
*   **Input Object Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=1, max_c=5)
*   **Expected Output Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 6-10
*   **Expected Output Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=6, max_c=10)
*   **Transformation:**
    *   The object retains its original colors (1 and 2).
    *   The object is shifted horizontally.
    *   Shift Calculation: `new_min_c = old_max_c + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`. Delta_c = `new_min_c - old_min_c = 6 - 1 = 5`.
    *   The original object location is filled with the background color (8).
*   **Code Output Discrepancy:** The output object is monochrome (all 2), not multi-colored (1 and 2).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Move a single object horizontally without changing its colors.
background_color_strategy: Most frequent color in the grid.
object_identification: Find the single contiguous group of non-background pixels.
transformations:
  - action: identify_object
    target: the single non-background object
    properties:
      - coordinates
      - bounding_box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
      - colors (all colors present in the object)
  - action: calculate_shift
    reference_object: input object
    details: The horizontal shift amount (delta_col) is calculated such that the new object's minimum column starts immediately to the right of the original object's maximum column. delta_col = (original_max_col + 1) - original_min_col. The vertical position (delta_row) is 0.
  - action: create_output_grid
    based_on: input_grid
    size: same as input_grid
  - action: erase_object
    target_grid: output_grid
    object_to_erase: original input object
    fill_color: background_color
  - action: copy_object
    target_grid: output_grid
    object_to_copy: original input object (preserving all original colors and relative pixel positions)
    destination: original object coordinates shifted by (delta_row=0, delta_col)
    boundary_handling: If shifted pixels fall outside the grid, they are not drawn.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  **Find Object:** Locate the single contiguous object composed of non-background colors. Record the coordinates of all pixels belonging to this object.
3.  **Determine Boundaries:** Calculate the bounding box of the object (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).
4.  **Calculate Shift:** Determine the horizontal shift distance required. The new object's leftmost column should be positioned one column immediately to the right of the original object's rightmost column. The vertical position does not change.
5.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid identical to the input grid.
6.  **Erase Original:** In the new grid, replace all pixels corresponding to the original object's coordinates with the background color.
7.  **Copy Shifted Object:** Iterate through each pixel coordinate (r, c) of the *original* object. Calculate the destination coordinate (r_dest, c_dest) by adding the calculated horizontal shift to the column `c` (i.e., `r_dest = r`, `c_dest = c + shift`). If the destination coordinate (r_dest, c_dest) is within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at (r_dest, c_dest) in the new grid to the *original color* found at (r, c) in the input grid.
