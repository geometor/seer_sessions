            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying a single non-background object, determining its maximum color, erasing the original object, and then drawing a *monochrome* version of the object (using the maximum color) shifted horizontally to the right.\n\nThe results show this approach fails because the expected output preserves the *original* colors and internal structure of the object, merely shifting its position. The code incorrectly replaces the object's pixels with a single color (the maximum color found within the original object).\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the transformation logic:\n1.  Correctly identify the background color and the single non-background object.\n2.  Determine the bounding box of the object.\n3.  Calculate the required horizontal shift (the new object's left edge should be one column to the right of the original object's right edge).\n4.  Create the output grid by first copying the input grid.\n5.  Erase the original object from the output grid by filling its coordinates with the background color.\n6.  Copy the *original* pixels of the object (preserving their colors and relative positions) to the new, shifted location in the output grid. Ensure the copied pixels stay within the grid boundaries.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 16x16\n*   **Background Color:** 8 (azure)\n*   **Object Colors:** 0 (white), 5 (gray)\n*   **Input Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 2-6\n*   **Input Object Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=2, max_c=6)\n*   **Expected Output Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 7-11\n*   **Expected Output Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=7, max_c=11)\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   The object retains its original colors (0 and 5).\n    *   The object is shifted horizontally.\n    *   Shift Calculation: `new_min_c = old_max_c + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`. Delta_c = `new_min_c - old_min_c = 7 - 2 = 5`.\n    *   The original object location is filled with the background color (8).\n*   **Code Output Discrepancy:** The output object is monochrome (all 5), not multi-colored (0 and 5).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 16x16\n*   **Background Color:** 8 (azure)\n*   **Object Colors:** 1 (blue), 2 (red)\n*   **Input Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 1-5\n*   **Input Object Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=1, max_c=5)\n*   **Expected Output Object Coordinates (approx):** Rows 4-11, Columns 6-10\n*   **Expected Output Bounding Box:** (min_r=4, max_r=11, min_c=6, max_c=10)\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   The object retains its original colors (1 and 2).\n    *   The object is shifted horizontally.\n    *   Shift Calculation: `new_min_c = old_max_c + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`. Delta_c = `new_min_c - old_min_c = 6 - 1 = 5`.\n    *   The original object location is filled with the background color (8).\n*   **Code Output Discrepancy:** The output object is monochrome (all 2), not multi-colored (1 and 2).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
