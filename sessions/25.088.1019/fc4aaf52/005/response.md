"""
Identifies the single non-background object in the input grid.
Creates a new grid based on the input grid.
Erases the original object from the new grid by replacing its pixels with the background color.
Copies the original object, preserving its colors and structure, onto the new grid such that its leftmost column is positioned 
one column to the right of the original object's rightmost column.
The vertical position remains unchanged. Pixels shifted outside the grid boundary are discarded.
