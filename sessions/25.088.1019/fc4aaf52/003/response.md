Identifies the single non-background object in the input grid.
Determines the maximum color value within this object.
Creates a new grid based on the input grid.
Erases the original object from the new grid by replacing its pixels with the background color.
Creates a monochrome copy of the object using its maximum color value.
Places this monochrome copy onto the new grid such that its leftmost column is positioned 
one column to the right of the original object's rightmost column.
The vertical position remains unchanged.
