*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input grids contain multiple distinct objects, primarily rectangular or L-shaped, composed of single, non-white colors.
    *   These objects are placed on a white background (color 0).
    *   Objects may be separate, adjacent, or nested (one object completely contained within the bounding box of another, potentially separated by the color of the outer object).
    *   The output grid is always a solid rectangle of a single color.
    *   The color of the output rectangle corresponds to the color of one of the objects in the input grid.
    *   The dimensions of the output rectangle correspond to the dimensions (bounding box) of that same object from the input grid.

*   **Key Observation:** Across all examples, the object whose color and dimensions are used for the output grid is the object with the smallest area (fewest number of pixels) among all non-white objects in the input grid.

*   **YAML Representation of Facts:**

    transformation_rule:
      goal: Extract the smallest non-white object and represent it as a solid block.
      steps:
        - Locate all contiguous groups of non-white pixels (objects) in the input grid.
        - Calculate the area (number of pixels) for each identified object.
        - Identify the object that has the smallest area.
        - Determine the color and the bounding box dimensions (height and width) of this smallest object.
        - Construct the output grid with the determined height and width.
        - Fill the entire output grid with the determined color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) formed by pixels with colors other than white (0). Consider pixels connected orthogonally or diagonally as part of the same object.
    2.  For each identified object, count the total number of pixels it contains (its size or area).
    3.  Compare the sizes of all identified objects and select the object with the smallest size.
    4.  Record the color of this smallest object.
    5.  Determine the bounding box of the smallest object: find the minimum and maximum row indices, and the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by its pixels. Calculate the height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1) of this bounding box.
    6.  Create a new output grid with the calculated height and width.
    7.  Fill every cell of this new output grid with the recorded color of the smallest object.
