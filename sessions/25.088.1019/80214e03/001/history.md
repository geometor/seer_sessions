*   **Perception**: The input grids contain multiple distinct, contiguous blocks ("objects") of non-white colors set against a white background. These objects often resemble noisy or stylized digits or symbols. The objects themselves are arranged within the larger input grid in a pattern that suggests a conceptual grid structure (e.g., 3x3, 2x2, 2x3). The output grid is smaller than the input and its dimensions correspond to the dimensions of this conceptual grid of objects found in the input. Each cell in the output grid contains the color of the corresponding object from the input grid, but with the columns horizontally flipped (mirrored). If an object in the input is wide enough to span multiple columns in the conceptual grid, its color is replicated in the corresponding output cells for those columns.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    Task: Extract colors of spatially arranged objects into a grid, mirroring columns.

    Input:
      - type: grid
      - contains:
          - background: white pixels (0)
          - objects: multiple contiguous blocks of non-white pixels (1-9)
      - properties:
          - objects have a single dominant color.
          - objects are spatially separated, forming a conceptual grid layout (R rows, C columns).
          - object shapes may be noisy or irregular, resembling digits/symbols.
          - an object might horizontally span the area of multiple conceptual columns.

    Output:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: R rows, C columns (matching the conceptual grid of input objects)
      - content: each cell (r, c) contains the color of the input object corresponding to the conceptual position (r, C - 1 - c).

    Transformation:
      - Identification: Locate distinct non-white objects and their colors.
      - Structuring: Determine the R x C conceptual grid layout based on object positions.
      - Mapping:
          - Identify the conceptual row (obj_r) for each object.
          - Determine the conceptual column range (c_start to c_end) spanned by each object horizontally.
          - For each object, populate the output grid cells `output[obj_r, C - 1 - c]` with the object's color for all `c` from `c_start` to `c_end`.
      - Column Reversal: The mapping inherently reverses the order of columns relative to their input positions.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of the same non-white color. Record the color and bounding box for each object.
    2.  Determine the conceptual grid arrangement of these objects. Find the set of unique approximate vertical positions (conceptual rows) and horizontal positions (conceptual columns) occupied by the objects. Let the number of unique conceptual rows be R and the number of unique conceptual columns be C.
    3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions R x C.
    4.  Establish the approximate horizontal boundaries dividing the input grid (or the area containing objects) into C conceptual columns and vertical boundaries dividing it into R conceptual rows.
    5.  For each identified object:
        a.  Determine its primary conceptual row index `obj_r` based on its vertical position relative to the row boundaries.
        b.  Determine the range of conceptual column indices (`c_start` to `c_end`) that the object's bounding box overlaps, based on its horizontal position and width relative to the column boundaries.
        c.  For each conceptual column index `c` from `c_start` to `c_end`:
            i.  Calculate the target column index in the output grid: `output_c = C - 1 - c`.
            ii. Assign the object's color to the output grid cell at `output[obj_r, output_c]`. Handle potential overwrites by prioritizing objects based on a consistent rule if necessary (though examples suggest distinct objects per row-column intersection, except for spanning).
    6.  Return the populated R x C output grid.
