These objects often resemble noisy or stylized digits or symbols. The objects themselves are arranged within the larger input grid in a pattern that suggests a conceptual grid structure (e.g., 3x3, 2x2, 2x3). The output grid is smaller than the input and its dimensions correspond to the dimensions of this conceptual grid of objects found in the input. Each cell in the output grid contains the color of the corresponding object from the input grid, but with the columns horizontally flipped (mirrored). If an object in the input is wide enough to span multiple columns in the conceptual grid, its color is replicated in the corresponding output cells for those columns.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Find the set of unique approximate vertical positions (conceptual rows) and horizontal positions (conceptual columns) occupied by the objects.

For each identified object:\n        a.  Determine its primary conceptual row index `obj_r` based on its vertical position relative to the row boundaries.\n        b.
