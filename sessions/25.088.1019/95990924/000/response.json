For each position `(r, c)`, check if it marks the top-left corner of a 2x2 gray (5) square.

Calculate the position `(r-1, c-1)`. If this position is within the grid boundaries, change the pixel at this position in the output grid to blue (1).\n    b.  Calculate the position `(r-1, c+2)`. If this position is within the grid boundaries, change the pixel at this position in the output grid to red (2).\n    c.  Calculate the position `(r+2, c-1)`.
