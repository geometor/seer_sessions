task_description: "Identify each 2x2 gray square in the input grid and add four colored pixels (blue, red, green, yellow) at specific diagonal positions relative to the corners of each square."
objects:
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - object: primary_shape
    type: square
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      size: 2x2 pixels
      count: variable (one or more per input)
      location: various positions within the grid
  - object: added_pixels
    type: single pixel
    properties:
      color: [blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4)]
      count: 4 per primary_shape instance
      location: fixed relative positions to the corners of a primary_shape
actions:
  - action: detect_shapes
    target: primary_shape (2x2 gray square)
    method: Iterate through the grid, checking for the 2x2 pattern of gray pixels. Record the top-left coordinate (r, c) of each detected square.
  - action: place_pixels
    target: output grid (copy of input grid)
    details: For each detected primary_shape at (r, c):
      - Place blue (1) at (r-1, c-1) if within grid bounds.
      - Place red (2) at (r-1, c+2) if within grid bounds.
      - Place green (3) at (r+2, c-1) if within grid bounds.
      - Place yellow (4) at (r+2, c+2) if within grid bounds.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_relative
    description: The locations of the added_pixels are defined relative to the coordinates of the corners of each primary_shape.
    details:
      - blue is top-left diagonal (-1 row, -1 col from top-left corner)
      - red is top-right diagonal (-1 row, +1 col from top-right corner, or r-1, c+2 from top-left)
      - green is bottom-left diagonal (+1 row, -1 col from bottom-left corner, or r+2, c-1 from top-left)
      - yellow is bottom-right diagonal (+1 row, +1 col from bottom-right corner, or r+2, c+2 from top-left)
