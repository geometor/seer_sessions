Task: Represent the spatial arrangement of colored blocks within a grid structure, then transform the representation.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains separator lines (horizontal and vertical) of a single color (e.g., azure, red).
    - Separator lines define a logical grid structure (N x M cells).
    - Cells of the logical grid contain either only background color or a block of a single non-background, non-separator color.
  Objects:
    - Background: Color 0 (white).
    - Separator Lines: Contiguous lines of a single color (e.g., 8 or 2).
    - Content Blocks: Rectangular areas of a single color (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) located within the cells defined by separators.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions match the logical grid dimensions (N x M) from the input.
    - Contains colors corresponding to the content blocks found in the input, plus the background color (0).

Relationships:
  - Separator lines divide the input grid into N x M regions.
  - Each cell (r, c) in the N x M logical grid corresponds to a specific rectangular region in the input grid.
  - The color placed at position (r, c) in the output grid is derived from the content of the corresponding region in the input grid, after a transformation.

Actions:
  1. Identify the separator color and the N x M logical grid structure it defines.
  2. Create an intermediate N x M 'content grid'.
  3. For each cell (r, c) in the logical grid:
     - Examine the corresponding region in the input grid.
     - Find the unique non-background, non-separator color within that region.
     - If such a color exists, place it at (r, c) in the content grid.
     - Otherwise (region contains only background or separator colors), place 0 at (r, c).
  4. Perform a horizontal flip transformation on the content grid.
  5. The result of the flip is the final output grid.
