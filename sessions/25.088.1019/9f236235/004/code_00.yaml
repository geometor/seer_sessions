task_description: Divide an input grid based on separator lines, extract representative colors from the resulting cells, form a new grid from these colors, and flip the new grid horizontally.

definitions:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  separator_line: A single-pixel-thick horizontal or vertical line that divides the grid.
  separator_color: The single, consistent color used for all separator lines within an input grid. It must be different from the background color.
  logical_cell: A rectangular region in the input grid bounded by separator lines or the grid edges.
  content_color: The single unique color within a logical cell that is neither the background_color nor the separator_color.

examples:
  example_1:
    input_dims: [19, 19]
    expected_output_dims: [4, 4]
    separator_color: 8 (azure)
    h_indices: [4, 9, 14]
    v_indices: [4, 9, 14]
    logical_grid_dims: [4, 4] # Determined by separator indices
    content_colors_found: [red, blue, green] # (2, 1, 3) and background (0)
    action: horizontal_flip
    result: success

  example_2:
    input_dims: [19, 19]
    expected_output_dims: [4, 4]
    separator_color: 2 (red)
    h_indices: [4, 9, 14]
    v_indices: [4, 9, 14] # Correct indices based on visual inspection and task logic
    incorrectly_identified_v_indices: [4, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] # Based on previous code's flawed logic
    logical_grid_dims: [4, 4] # Expected based on correct separator indices
    incorrect_logical_grid_dims: [4, 8] # Calculated by previous code
    content_colors_found: [green] # (3) and background (0)
    action: horizontal_flip
    result: failure (incorrect output dimensions due to faulty separator identification)

  example_3:
    input_dims: [11, 11]
    expected_output_dims: [3, 3]
    separator_color: 2 (red)
    h_indices: [3, 7]
    v_indices: [3, 7]
    logical_grid_dims: [3, 3] # Determined by separator indices
    content_colors_found: [azure, yellow] # (8, 4) and background (0)
    action: horizontal_flip
    result: success

observations:
  - The input grid is divided into a logical grid by horizontal and vertical separator lines of a single, consistent color (separator_color).
  - The separator_color is identified by finding the color that forms lines which are potential candidates for both horizontal and vertical separators.
  - A correct separator line (row or column) must contain only the separator_color and the background_color (0), and must contain at least one pixel of the separator_color. (This corrects the previous interpretation).
  - The output grid's dimensions correspond to the number of logical cells defined by these separators.
  - Each cell in the output grid represents a logical cell from the input grid.
  - The color of an output cell is determined by finding the unique color within the corresponding input logical cell, excluding the background_color and the separator_color.
  - If a logical cell contains no unique content color (only background and/or separator colors), the corresponding output cell is assigned the background_color.
  - The final output grid is a horizontally flipped version of the grid formed by the extracted content colors.
