task_description: |-
  Divide an input grid based on solid separator lines, extract representative colors
  from the resulting cells, form a new grid from these colors, and flip the new grid
  horizontally.

definitions:
  - background_color: 0 (White)
  - separator_line: A horizontal or vertical line composed *entirely* of a single non-background color (the separator_color).
  - separator_color: The single color used to form all separator_lines within an input grid. Determined by finding the color that forms the most solid horizontal and vertical lines.
  - grid_cell: A rectangular region in the input grid bounded by separator lines or the grid edges.
  - cell_content_color: The single unique color within a grid_cell, excluding the background_color and the separator_color. If a cell contains zero or multiple such colors, it has no content color (represented by background_color).

input_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of pixels (0-9).
  - Contains grid_cells separated by horizontal and vertical separator_lines.
  - All separator_lines use the same separator_color.
  - Each grid_cell may contain background pixels, separator_color pixels (if adjacent to lines), and potentially one unique cell_content_color.

output_features:
  - grid: A 2D array, generally smaller than the input.
  - Dimensions correspond to the number of grid_cells horizontally and vertically in the input.
  - Each pixel in the output grid represents the cell_content_color of the corresponding grid_cell in the input. If a cell had no single content color, the output pixel is background_color.
  - The grid is a horizontally flipped representation of the extracted cell content colors.

transformation_steps:
  1. Identify the separator_color by finding the non-background color forming the most solid horizontal and vertical lines.
  2. Identify the indices of all horizontal separator_lines (rows composed solely of separator_color).
  3. Identify the indices of all vertical separator_lines (columns composed solely of separator_color).
  4. Define logical grid boundaries using the separator line indices and the input grid edges.
  5. Determine the dimensions (N rows, M columns) of the logical grid based on these boundaries.
  6. Create an intermediate N x M content grid, initialized with background_color.
  7. For each logical cell (r, c) from (0,0) to (N-1, M-1):
     a. Determine the corresponding region in the input grid based on the boundaries.
     b. Find the set of unique colors within this region, excluding background_color and separator_color.
     c. If the set contains exactly one color, assign this color to the intermediate grid at `content_grid[r, c]`.
  8. Create the final output grid by flipping the intermediate content grid horizontally (left-to-right).
