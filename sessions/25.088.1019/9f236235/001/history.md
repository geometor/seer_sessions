**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large and visually divided into smaller rectangular regions by single-pixel-thick horizontal and vertical lines of a consistent color (the "separator color"). The rest of the grid is primarily composed of a background color (white, 0) and solid blocks of other colors within the defined regions.
2.  **Separator Color:** In `train_1`, the separator is azure (8). In `train_2` and `train_3`, the separator is red (2). This separator color defines the structure but doesn't seem to directly map to the output, except potentially as a content color itself (like azure in `train_3`).
3.  **Content Regions:** The separator lines define a larger logical grid (e.g., 4x4 in `train_1` and `train_2`, 3x3 in `train_3`). Each "cell" of this logical grid corresponds to a rectangular region in the input grid.
4.  **Region Content:** Each region between the separator lines contains either only the background color (white, 0) or a solid block of a single non-background, non-separator color.
5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is much smaller and its dimensions match the dimensions of the logical grid defined by the separator lines in the input (4x4 or 3x3).
6.  **Input-Output Mapping:** The colors appearing in the output grid correspond to the colors of the blocks found within the regions of the input grid. The position of a color in the output grid seems related to the position of the corresponding block in the input's logical grid structure, but not directly. There appears to be a spatial transformation applied.
7.  **Transformation:** By creating an intermediate grid representing the colors found in each cell of the input's logical grid structure (using 0 for background-only cells), and then applying a horizontal flip to this intermediate grid, the result matches the output grid in all examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Represent the spatial arrangement of colored blocks within a grid structure, then transform the representation.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a background color (white, 0).
    - Contains separator lines (horizontal and vertical) of a single color (e.g., azure, red).
    - Separator lines define a logical grid structure (N x M cells).
    - Cells of the logical grid contain either only background color or a block of a single non-background, non-separator color.
  Objects:
    - Background: Color 0 (white).
    - Separator Lines: Contiguous lines of a single color (e.g., 8 or 2).
    - Content Blocks: Rectangular areas of a single color (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) located within the cells defined by separators.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions match the logical grid dimensions (N x M) from the input.
    - Contains colors corresponding to the content blocks found in the input, plus the background color (0).

Relationships:
  - Separator lines divide the input grid into N x M regions.
  - Each cell (r, c) in the N x M logical grid corresponds to a specific rectangular region in the input grid.
  - The color placed at position (r, c) in the output grid is derived from the content of the corresponding region in the input grid, after a transformation.

Actions:
  1. Identify the separator color and the N x M logical grid structure it defines.
  2. Create an intermediate N x M 'content grid'.
  3. For each cell (r, c) in the logical grid:
     - Examine the corresponding region in the input grid.
     - Find the unique non-background, non-separator color within that region.
     - If such a color exists, place it at (r, c) in the content grid.
     - Otherwise (region contains only background or separator colors), place 0 at (r, c).
  4. Perform a horizontal flip transformation on the content grid.
  5. The result of the flip is the final output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the consistent color used for the single-pixel-thick horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid; this is the `separator_color`.
2.  Determine the dimensions (N rows, M columns) of the logical grid formed by these separator lines. The output grid will have dimensions N x M.
3.  Create an intermediate grid, `content_grid`, of size N x M, initialized with the background color (0).
4.  Iterate through each cell of the logical grid structure, from row `r = 0` to `N-1` and column `c = 0` to `M-1`.
5.  For each logical cell (`r`, `c`), identify the corresponding rectangular region of pixels in the input grid located between the separator lines.
6.  Examine the colors of the pixels within this region. Find the unique color present that is *neither* the `separator_color` *nor* the background color (0).
7.  If exactly one such unique color is found, assign this color to the `content_grid` at position (`r`, `c`). If no such color is found (the region contains only background and/or separator colors), leave the value at (`r`, `c`) as the background color (0).
8.  After processing all logical cells, create the final `output_grid` by performing a horizontal flip (reflecting across the vertical axis) on the `content_grid`.
9.  Return the `output_grid`.
