The connections seem selective.\n    *   The red lines connect the centers of the plus shapes. The line segment itself consists only of red pixels and does not overwrite any green pixels, except potentially at the endpoints (centers), although the examples show the centers remain green. It seems the red lines are drawn on the white background *between* the centers.\n    *   Critically, a red line segment is only drawn between two plus-sign centers if the straight path between them (excluding the endpoints) does not contain any green pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
