*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain multiple green (3) plus-shaped objects scattered across a white (0) background.
    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, but with the addition of some red (2) pixels.
    *   The red pixels appear to form straight lines connecting the central pixels of some of the green plus shapes.
    *   Not all pairs of green plus shapes are connected by red lines. The connections seem selective.
    *   The red lines connect the centers of the plus shapes. The line segment itself consists only of red pixels and does not overwrite any green pixels, except potentially at the endpoints (centers), although the examples show the centers remain green. It seems the red lines are drawn on the white background *between* the centers.
    *   Critically, a red line segment is only drawn between two plus-sign centers if the straight path between them (excluding the endpoints) does not contain any green pixels.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_connection
    background_color: 0 # white
    objects:
      - type: plus_sign
        color: 3 # green
        properties:
          - shape: symmetrical plus (+)
          - size: typically 5 pixels (center + 4 arms of length 1)
          - center_pixel: the unique pixel with 4 green neighbors
    added_elements:
      - type: line_segment
        color: 2 # red
        properties:
          - connects: centers of specific pairs of green plus_signs
          - path_constraint: the segment is drawn only if the straight line path between the centers (excluding the centers themselves) consists entirely of background pixels (color 0).
          - pixels: consist only of red color, placed on the background pixels along the path.
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - content: background, multiple green plus_signs, added red line_segments
    transformation:
      - identify all green plus_sign objects.
      - determine the center pixel coordinates for each plus_sign.
      - for every pair of plus_sign centers:
          - determine the straight line path (pixels) between them.
          - check if all pixels on this path (excluding the start and end centers) are background pixels (color 0).
          - if the path is clear (only background pixels), draw the path segment using red pixels (color 2) on the output grid, leaving the original green pixels unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct green (3) plus-shaped objects in the input grid. A plus shape consists of a central pixel and four single-pixel arms extending orthogonally.
    2.  For each identified green plus object, determine the coordinates of its central pixel.
    3.  Consider every possible pair of central pixels found in step 2.
    4.  For each pair of centers, calculate the pixels that form the straight line segment connecting them.
    5.  Examine the pixels on this line segment, *excluding* the two endpoint center pixels themselves.
    6.  If all examined pixels on the segment are the background color (white, 0), then draw this line segment onto the output grid using the red (2) color. The original green pixels (including the centers) remain unchanged.
    7.  If any pixel on the segment (excluding endpoints) is not the background color (i.e., it's green), do not draw the red line for this pair of centers.
    8.  The final output grid contains the original green plus objects and all the red line segments drawn according to the condition in step 6.
