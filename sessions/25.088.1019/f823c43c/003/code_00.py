"""
Identifies the background color (most frequent), noise color (magenta, 6), 
and pattern color(s).
Determines the underlying geometric pattern based on the specific background 
and pattern colors observed in the examples.
Reconstructs the output grid by filling it with the background color and then 
applying the deduced pattern rule using the pattern color(s).
Magenta noise pixels are ignored during pattern deduction and reconstruction.

Pattern Rules Deduced from Examples:
- If background is orange (7) and pattern is azure (8): 
    Pattern color appears at (row, col) where row % 3 == 1 and col % 3 == 1.
- If background is azure (8) and pattern is yellow (4): 
    Pattern color appears in odd rows (row % 2 != 0) at odd columns (col % 2 != 0). 
    Even rows are entirely background color.
