So, 8 is the least frequent, 7 is the most frequent, and 6 is in the middle.\nIn `train_2`, 4 (yellow) has 56 occurrences, 6 (magenta) has 51, and 8 (azure) has 178. So, 6 is the least frequent, 8 is the most frequent, and 4 is in the middle.\n\nThis contradicts the idea that the removed color (6) is always the least frequent or always the middle frequency.\n\nWhat is consistent?\n1.  The most frequent color is the background and remains unchanged.\n2.  The magenta color (6) is always removed and replaced by the background color.\n3.  All other colors remain unchanged.\n\nHypothesis: The rule is simply \"Replace all magenta (6) pixels with the most frequent color in the input grid\".\n\nLet's refine the plan:\n1.  Find the most frequent color in the input grid. This is the background color.\n2.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through the output grid. If a pixel's color is magenta (6), change it to the background color found in step 1.\n\nThis seems robust and matches both examples.Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples show an input grid and a corresponding output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   `train_1`: Uses orange (7), azure (8), and magenta (6). Orange is the dominant color.\n    *   `train_2`: Uses azure (8), yellow (4), and magenta (6). Azure is the dominant color.\n3.  **Transformation Observation:**\n    *   In both examples, the most frequent color in the input grid seems to act as a \"background\" and remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   The magenta pixels (6) present in the input are replaced by the background color in the output.\n    *   All other colors (azure (8) in `train_1`, yellow (4) in `train_2`) remain in their original positions.\n4.  **Inferred Rule:** The transformation identifies the most frequent color in the input grid. It then replaces all occurrences of the magenta color (6) with this most frequent color. All other pixels retain their original colors.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
