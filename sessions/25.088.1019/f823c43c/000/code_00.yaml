task_description: Replace noise pixels (magenta/6) with the background color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_present_input_train_1: [orange (7), azure (8), magenta (6)]
  - colors_present_input_train_2: [azure (8), yellow (4), magenta (6)]
  - colors_present_output_train_1: [orange (7), azure (8)]
  - colors_present_output_train_2: [azure (8), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    definition: The pixel color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color_train_1: orange (7)
      - color_train_2: azure (8)
    actions:
      - Remains unchanged in the output.
      - Used as the replacement color for noise pixels.
  - type: noise_pixel
    definition: Pixels with the color magenta (6).
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
    actions:
      - Are replaced by the background_pixel color in the output.
  - type: signal_pixel
    definition: Any pixel that is neither a background_pixel nor a noise_pixel.
    properties:
      - color_train_1: azure (8)
      - color_train_2: yellow (4)
    actions:
      - Remains unchanged in the output.
relationships:
  - The transformation acts independently on each pixel based on its color.
  - The background color is determined globally by frequency across the entire input grid.
