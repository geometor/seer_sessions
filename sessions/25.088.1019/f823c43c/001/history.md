```
In `train_1`, 6 (magenta) has 23 occurrences, 7 (orange) has 108, and 8 (azure) has 13. So, 8 is the least frequent, 7 is the most frequent, and 6 is in the middle.
In `train_2`, 4 (yellow) has 56 occurrences, 6 (magenta) has 51, and 8 (azure) has 178. So, 6 is the least frequent, 8 is the most frequent, and 4 is in the middle.

This contradicts the idea that the removed color (6) is always the least frequent or always the middle frequency.

What is consistent?
1.  The most frequent color is the background and remains unchanged.
2.  The magenta color (6) is always removed and replaced by the background color.
3.  All other colors remain unchanged.

Hypothesis: The rule is simply "Replace all magenta (6) pixels with the most frequent color in the input grid".

Let's refine the plan:
1.  Find the most frequent color in the input grid. This is the background color.
2.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
3.  Iterate through the output grid. If a pixel's color is magenta (6), change it to the background color found in step 1.

This seems robust and matches both examples.Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples show an input grid and a corresponding output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   `train_1`: Uses orange (7), azure (8), and magenta (6). Orange is the dominant color.
    *   `train_2`: Uses azure (8), yellow (4), and magenta (6). Azure is the dominant color.
3.  **Transformation Observation:**
    *   In both examples, the most frequent color in the input grid seems to act as a "background" and remains unchanged in the output.
    *   The magenta pixels (6) present in the input are replaced by the background color in the output.
    *   All other colors (azure (8) in `train_1`, yellow (4) in `train_2`) remain in their original positions.
4.  **Inferred Rule:** The transformation identifies the most frequent color in the input grid. It then replaces all occurrences of the magenta color (6) with this most frequent color. All other pixels retain their original colors.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Replace noise pixels (magenta/6) with the background color.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - colors_present_input_train_1: [orange (7), azure (8), magenta (6)]
  - colors_present_input_train_2: [azure (8), yellow (4), magenta (6)]
  - colors_present_output_train_1: [orange (7), azure (8)]
  - colors_present_output_train_2: [azure (8), yellow (4)]
objects:
  - type: background_pixel
    definition: The pixel color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color_train_1: orange (7)
      - color_train_2: azure (8)
    actions:
      - Remains unchanged in the output.
      - Used as the replacement color for noise pixels.
  - type: noise_pixel
    definition: Pixels with the color magenta (6).
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
    actions:
      - Are replaced by the background_pixel color in the output.
  - type: signal_pixel
    definition: Any pixel that is neither a background_pixel nor a noise_pixel.
    properties:
      - color_train_1: azure (8)
      - color_train_2: yellow (4)
    actions:
      - Remains unchanged in the output.
relationships:
  - The transformation acts independently on each pixel based on its color.
  - The background color is determined globally by frequency across the entire input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Analyze the input grid to determine the frequency of each color present.
2.  Identify the color with the highest frequency; this is the `background_color`.
3.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's color is magenta (6), set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the `background_color`.
    *   Otherwise (if the pixel's color is *not* magenta (6)), copy the pixel's original color to the corresponding pixel in the new grid.
5.  The new grid is the output.
