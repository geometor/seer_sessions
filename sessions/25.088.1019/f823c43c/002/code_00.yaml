- task_type: reconstruction
- noise_color: magenta (6)
- noise_effect: replaces pixels belonging to the underlying pattern/background
- goal: remove noise and restore the original pattern
- pattern_determination:
    - identify background_color: the most frequent color in the input grid
    - identify pattern_color(s): all colors in the input grid except background_color and noise_color
    - identify pattern_structure: the geometric arrangement of pattern_color(s) on the background_color. This involves ignoring noise_color pixels during analysis.
      - example_1: pattern_color is azure (8). Pattern is azure pixels on an orange (7) background, located at (row, col) where row % 3 == 1 and col % 3 == 1.
      - example_2: pattern_color is yellow (4). Pattern is a checkerboard on an azure (8) background: rows with even indices are all azure; rows with odd indices alternate azure and yellow (starting with azure in column 0).
- reconstruction_process:
    - create output grid of the same dimensions as input
    - fill output grid with background_color
    - place pattern_color(s) onto the output grid according to the identified pattern_structure
