They are contiguous blocks of red pixels. Their form varies slightly but often resembles a 'plus' sign (a central pixel with four orthogonal neighbours).\n3.  **Output Grid:** Largely identical to the input grid, but with additional blue pixels (1) added. The original red shapes remain unchanged.\n4.  **Blue Pixels:** These appear as straight lines (horizontal or vertical) connecting pairs of red shapes. They occupy the white space *between* the shapes.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
