task_description: Shift objects horizontally based on their vertical order.
elements:
  - role: background
    description: A single color filling most of the grid.
    properties:
      - remains_unchanged_in_output
  - role: object
    description: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color, distinct from the background.
    properties:
      - color: preserved during transformation
      - shape: preserved during transformation
      - position: modified by horizontal shift
      - topmost_row: The minimum row index occupied by the object's pixels. Used for ordering.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_order
    description: Objects can be ordered vertically based on their topmost row index.
    attribute: topmost_row
    order: ascending (top to bottom)
actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous pixel groups not matching the background color.
  - name: determine_topmost_row
    description: For each object, find the minimum row index it occupies.
  - name: sort_objects
    description: Order the identified objects based on their topmost row index, ascending.
  - name: apply_alternating_shift
    description: Iterate through the sorted objects, shifting the first left by 1 column, the second right by 1 column, the third left by 1, and so on.
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 1 column
      - directions: alternating [left, right, left, right, ...]
transformation_rule:
  - The grid contains a background color and multiple distinct objects.
  - Identify all objects (contiguous non-background color blocks).
  - Determine the topmost row for each object.
  - Sort the objects based on their topmost row index (top to bottom).
  - Apply a horizontal shift to each object based on its position in the sorted list:
    - Objects at odd positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) shift left by one column.
    - Objects at even positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) shift right by one column.
  - Reconstruct the output grid with the shifted objects on the original background. Pixels shifted off the grid are removed.
