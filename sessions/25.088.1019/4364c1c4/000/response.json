The shapes and colors of the objects themselves are preserved.\n5.  **Shift Logic:** The direction of the shift (left or right) is not determined solely by the object's color or its absolute position. Instead, it depends on the relative vertical position of the objects compared to each other.\n6.  **Sorting and Alternation:** When the objects are ordered based on their topmost row index (from top to bottom), they appear to shift in an alternating pattern: the topmost object shifts left, the next object shifts right, the third shifts left, the fourth shifts right, and so on.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
