Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent color).
2. Find all distinct, contiguous objects (groups of pixels) with colors different from the background.
3. Determine the topmost row index for each object.
4. Sort the objects based on their topmost row index (top to bottom).
5. Create an output grid filled with the background color.
6. Iterate through the sorted objects:
    - If the object is at an odd position (1st, 3rd, ...) in the sorted list, shift it one column to the left.
    - If the object is at an even position (2nd, 4th, ...) in the sorted list, shift it one column to the right.
7. Draw the shifted objects onto the output grid. Pixels shifted off the grid boundaries are discarded.
