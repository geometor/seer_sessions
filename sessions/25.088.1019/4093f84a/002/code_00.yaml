task_description: |
  Modify a grid based on the interaction between 'active' colored pixels (blue, red, green) and a horizontal gray 'band'. Active pixels located vertically outside the band cause gray pixels to be placed adjacent to the band in the corresponding columns. All original active pixels are then removed.
grid_properties:
  - width: 14
  - height: 14
  - colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (gray)
objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (0-9, specifically 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 in this task)
      - location: (row, column)
  - object: gray_band
    definition: A horizontal region defined by the minimum and maximum row indices containing at least one gray (5) pixel.
    properties:
      - band_top_row: Minimum row index with a gray pixel.
      - band_bottom_row: Maximum row index with a gray pixel.
  - object: active_pixel
    definition: A pixel with color blue (1), red (2), or green (3).
    properties:
      - location: (row, column)
      - position_relative_to_band: above (row < band_top_row), below (row > band_bottom_row), or within (band_top_row <= row <= band_bottom_row).
actions:
  - action: find_band_boundaries
    input: input_grid
    output: band_top_row, band_bottom_row
  - action: check_columns_above_band
    input: input_grid, band_top_row
    output: set of column indices containing active_pixels above the band.
  - action: check_columns_below_band
    input: input_grid, band_bottom_row
    output: set of column indices containing active_pixels below the band.
  - action: place_gray_markers_above
    input: output_grid, band_top_row, columns_to_modify_above
    effect: Sets output_grid[band_top_row - 1, c] = 5 for each c in columns_to_modify_above. Only if band_top_row > 0.
  - action: place_gray_markers_below
    input: output_grid, band_bottom_row, columns_to_modify_below
    effect: Sets output_grid[band_bottom_row + 1, c] = 5 for each c in columns_to_modify_below. Only if band_bottom_row < height - 1.
  - action: clear_active_pixels
    input: output_grid
    effect: Iterates through the grid and sets any pixel with color 1, 2, or 3 to 0 (white).
transformation_sequence:
  1. Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  2. Find band_top_row and band_bottom_row.
  3. Find columns_to_modify_above.
  4. Find columns_to_modify_below.
  5. Perform place_gray_markers_above.
  6. Perform place_gray_markers_below.
  7. Perform clear_active_pixels on the modified output grid.
