Identify the horizontal band of gray (5) pixels. Determine the row index of the top edge of this band. The top edge is defined as the first row (from top to bottom) that contains at least one gray pixel.\n3. Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n4. For the current column, scan the rows *above* the top edge of the gray band. Check if any pixel in this upper section of the column has an \"active\" color: blue (1), red (2), or green (3).\n5. If such an active colored pixel is found in the current column above the gray band:\n    a. Locate the pixel in the output grid that is in the same column and in the row immediately *above* the top edge of the gray band (if such a row exists, i.e., if the band doesn't start at row 0).\n    b. Change the color of this specific pixel in the output grid to gray (5).\n6. After checking all columns and potentially modifying pixels above the band, iterate through the entire output grid. Change any pixel that still has an active color (blue (1), red (2), or green (3)) to white (0).\n7. The resulting grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_band_top_row(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first row containing a gray (5) pixel.\n    Returns the row index or -1 if no gray pixel is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == 5:\n                return r\n    return -1 # Should not happen based on examples\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    - Finds the top of the gray band.\n    - Identifies columns with active colors (1, 2, 3) above the band.\n    - Colors the cell immediately above the band gray in those columns.\n    - Replaces all active colors (1, 2, 3) with white (0).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    active_colors = {1, 2, 3} # Blue, Red, Green\n\n    # 1.
