elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: constant (e.g., 14x14)
  - type: color
    values:
      - white: 0
      - blue: 1
      - red: 2
      - green: 3
      - gray: 5
  - type: object
    name: gray_band
    description: A contiguous horizontal band of gray pixels, typically multiple rows thick, located in the middle rows of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: horizontal rectangle/band
      - location: middle rows
      - static: mostly unchanged, forms a boundary
  - type: object
    name: colored_pixels
    description: Individual pixels with colors blue(1), red(2), or green(3).
    properties:
      - color: blue(1), red(2), green(3)
      - location: scattered above and below the gray_band
      - interaction: pixels above the gray_band affect the grid above the band; all colored_pixels are removed in the output.

actions:
  - name: identify_boundary
    input: input_grid
    output: location of the top row of the gray_band
  - name: detect_pixels_above_boundary
    input: input_grid, gray_band_top_row
    output: list of columns containing colored_pixels above the gray_band
  - name: modify_pixels_above_band
    input: input_grid, gray_band_top_row, columns_with_pixels_above
    output: modified_grid (pixels directly above the gray_band in detected columns are changed to gray)
  - name: remove_colored_pixels
    input: input_grid (or modified_grid)
    output: final_grid (all original blue, red, green pixels replaced with white)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Colored pixels exist relative to the gray band (above or below).
  - type: causal
    description: The presence of a colored pixel *above* the gray band in a specific column causes the pixel directly *above* the gray band in that same column to change to gray.
  - type: state_change
    description: Colored pixels are removed (become white). Specific white pixels above the gray band become gray.

constants:
  - name: background_color
    value: white (0)
  - name: band_color
    value: gray (5)
  - name: active_colors
    value: [blue(1), red(2), green(3)]

output_grid_composition:
  - Retains the original gray band.
  - Retains most original white pixels.
  - Replaces all original blue, red, and green pixels with white.
  - Changes specific white pixels directly above the gray band to gray, based on the rule.
