This band seems largely static, although some pixels *above* it change.\n4.  **Dynamic Elements:** The non-white, non-gray pixels (blue, red, green) appear scattered above and below the gray band in the input.\n5.  **Transformation Observation:**\n    *   In the output grid, all the original blue, red, and green pixels disappear (replaced by white).\n    *   Some white pixels located directly *above* the gray band change to gray in the output.\n    *   Comparing input and output, the white pixels that change to gray seem to correspond to the columns where blue, red, or green pixels existed *above* the gray band in the input.\n    *   Pixels below the gray band seem to disappear without affecting the gray band or the pixels above it.\n    *   The transformation appears column-specific.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
