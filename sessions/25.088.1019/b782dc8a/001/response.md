"""
Identify the main structure color (assumed to be the most frequent non-background color).
Identify the two pattern colors present in the input (either blue (1) and yellow (4), or green (3) and red (2)).
Iterate through each background (white, 0) pixel in the input grid.
If a background pixel is adjacent (including diagonals) to a pixel of the structure color:
  Calculate the sum of its row and column index (r + c).
  Determine the color based on the identified pattern and the parity of (r + c):
  - If the pattern colors are blue (1) and yellow (4):
    Change the pixel to blue (1) if (r + c) is even.
    Change the pixel to yellow (4) if (r + c) is odd.
  - If the pattern colors are green (3) and red (2):
    Change the pixel to red (2) if (r + c) is even.
    Change the pixel to green (3) if (r + c) is odd.
Leave all other pixels unchanged.
