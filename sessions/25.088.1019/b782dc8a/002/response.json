The remaining non-background colors (1/4 in Ex1, 2/3 in Ex2) are the pattern/seed colors.\n\n---\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the structure color and the pattern colors (blue/yellow or red/green). It also correctly applied the checkerboard logic based on coordinate parity (r+c). However, it incorrectly applied the pattern to *all* background (white) pixels adjacent to the structure color.\n\nThe analysis of the expected outputs reveals that the checkerboard pattern should only be applied to a subset of these adjacent background pixels. Specifically, the filling seems to originate from the pre-existing pattern-colored pixels in the input grid and spreads outwards like a flood fill or region growing algorithm. The fill only affects background pixels that are adjacent (including diagonals) to both the structure color and a pixel that is already part of the pattern (either an initial seed pixel or a newly filled pixel).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation logic to implement this flood-fill approach, starting from the identified seed pixels.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 13x14\n*   **Output Size:** 13x14\n*   **Structure Color:** Azure (8) (Count: 89)\n*   **Seed Colors:** Blue (1) (Count: 3), Yellow (4) (Count: 1)\n*   **Background Color:** White (0)\n*   **Checkerboard Pattern:** Blue (1) for even (r+c), Yellow (4) for odd (r+c).\n*   **Pixels Off (Previous Code):** 54. The previous code overfilled the background areas.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 11x24\n*   **Output Size:** 11x24\n*   **Structure Color:** Azure (8) (Count: 137)\n*   **Seed Colors:** Red (2) (Count: 1), Green (3) (Count: 4)\n*   **Background Color:** White (0)\n*   **Checkerboard Pattern:** Red (2) for even (r+c), Green (3) for odd (r+c).\n*   **Pixels Off (Previous Code):** 65. The previous code overfilled the background areas.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
