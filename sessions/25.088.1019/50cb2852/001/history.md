*   **Perception:** The task involves processing input grids containing solid rectangular blocks of various colors (red, blue, green) against a white background. The transformation modifies the interior pixels of these rectangular blocks, changing their color to azure while leaving the border pixels unchanged. The size and position of the blocks vary across examples.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: object_modification
    objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: non_white (e.g., red, blue, green)
        properties: solid_fill, axis_aligned
    background_color: white (0)
    transformation:
      action: color_change
      target_pixels: interior_pixels_of_rectangles
      new_color: azure (8)
      condition: pixel_must_be_surrounded_on_all_4_cardinal_directions_by_pixels_of_the_same_original_color
    relationships:
      - pixels_to_object: pixels belong to a specific rectangular object
      - pixels_to_neighbors: checking cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right)
    preservation:
      - grid_dimensions: remain unchanged
      - background_pixels: remain unchanged
      - border_pixels_of_rectangles: remain unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel `P` in the input grid located at `(row, col)`, excluding the outermost border of the grid itself.
    3.  Let the color of pixel `P` be `C`.
    4.  If the color `C` is not white (i.e., `C > 0`):
        a.  Check the colors of the four cardinal neighbors of `P`: the pixel above (`row-1, col`), below (`row+1, col`), left (`row, col-1`), and right (`row, col+1`).
        b.  If all four neighbors exist within the grid boundaries AND all four neighbors have the same color `C` as the pixel `P`, then `P` is an interior pixel.
        c.  If `P` is identified as an interior pixel, change the color of the corresponding pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid to azure (8).
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
