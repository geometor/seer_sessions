The second color forms a series of complete horizontal and vertical lines, effectively partitioning the grid into several rectangular regions of the background color. The intersection points of these lines also take the line color.\n\nThe output grid is always a solid rectangle filled with a single color. This color matches the background color of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid appear related to the number of rectangular regions created by the lines in the input grid. Specifically, the output height corresponds to the number of distinct horizontal regions (rows separated by horizontal lines), and the output width corresponds to the number of distinct vertical regions (columns separated by vertical lines).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
