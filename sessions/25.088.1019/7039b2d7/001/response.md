Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the two colors in the input grid: a 'background_color' and a 'line_color'.
2. The 'line_color' is identified as the color that forms at least one complete horizontal row AND at least one complete vertical column made entirely of that color. The other color is the 'background_color'.
3. Find the indices of all rows that consist entirely of the 'line_color'.
4. Find the indices of all columns that consist entirely of the 'line_color'.
5. Count the number of distinct contiguous regions of rows that are NOT line rows. This count determines the height of the output grid (`output_height`).
6. Count the number of distinct contiguous regions of columns that are NOT line columns. This count determines the width of the output grid (`output_width`).
7. Create a new grid with dimensions `output_height` x `output_width`.
8. Fill this new grid entirely with the 'background_color'.
