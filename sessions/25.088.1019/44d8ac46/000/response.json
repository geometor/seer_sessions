The outputs introduce red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Objects:** The gray pixels form closed or nearly closed loop shapes, typically rectangular or L-shaped outlines, on a white background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white pixels within the boundaries defined by the gray shapes to red pixels.\n5.  **Condition for Change:** The change (white to red) seems to occur *only* within regions of white pixels that are *completely* enclosed by a continuous boundary of gray pixels. If a white area inside a gray shape has any connection (even diagonally) to the white background outside the shape, it is *not* filled with red.\n6.  **Example Breakdown:**\n    *   **train_1:** The second gray shape fully encloses a 2x2 white area, which is filled red. The first shape is not filled.\n    *   **train_2:** Two gray shapes enclose white areas (4x4 and 2x2), which are filled red. The top-left shape has a gap, so its interior white area is not filled.\n    *   **train_3:** None of the gray shapes form a complete enclosure around white pixels; all internal white areas connect to the external background. No filling occurs.\n    *   **train_4:** Two gray shapes enclose white areas (2x2 and 1x1), which are filled red. The other two shapes do not fully enclose their internal white areas.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
