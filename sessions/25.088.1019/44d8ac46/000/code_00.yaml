- task: Fill enclosed areas
- elements:
    - background:
        - color: white (0)
        - role: canvas and potential fill target
    - boundaries:
        - color: gray (5)
        - role: defines shapes and potential enclosures
        - structure: typically closed or near-closed loops
    - fill:
        - color: red (2)
        - role: replaces white pixels in enclosed regions
- relationships:
    - enclosure: A region of white pixels is considered enclosed if every pixel adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel in the region is either another pixel within the same white region or a gray (5) pixel.
- actions:
    - identify: Locate contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
    - check_enclosure: For each white region, determine if it is fully enclosed by gray (5) pixels.
    - fill_enclosed: If a white region is fully enclosed, change the color of all pixels in that region to red (2).
- examples_summary:
    - train_1: One enclosed white region found and filled.
    - train_2: Two enclosed white regions found and filled.
    - train_3: No enclosed white regions found; output is identical to input.
    - train_4: Two enclosed white regions found and filled.
