**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with values representing colors (0=white, 5=gray, 2=red).
2.  **Dominant Colors:** The primary colors present in the inputs are white (0) and gray (5). The outputs introduce red (2) pixels.
3.  **Objects:** The gray pixels form closed or nearly closed loop shapes, typically rectangular or L-shaped outlines, on a white background.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white pixels within the boundaries defined by the gray shapes to red pixels.
5.  **Condition for Change:** The change (white to red) seems to occur *only* within regions of white pixels that are *completely* enclosed by a continuous boundary of gray pixels. If a white area inside a gray shape has any connection (even diagonally) to the white background outside the shape, it is *not* filled with red.
6.  **Example Breakdown:**
    *   **train_1:** The second gray shape fully encloses a 2x2 white area, which is filled red. The first shape is not filled.
    *   **train_2:** Two gray shapes enclose white areas (4x4 and 2x2), which are filled red. The top-left shape has a gap, so its interior white area is not filled.
    *   **train_3:** None of the gray shapes form a complete enclosure around white pixels; all internal white areas connect to the external background. No filling occurs.
    *   **train_4:** Two gray shapes enclose white areas (2x2 and 1x1), which are filled red. The other two shapes do not fully enclose their internal white areas.

**Facts**


```yaml
- task: Fill enclosed areas
- elements:
    - background:
        - color: white (0)
        - role: canvas and potential fill target
    - boundaries:
        - color: gray (5)
        - role: defines shapes and potential enclosures
        - structure: typically closed or near-closed loops
    - fill:
        - color: red (2)
        - role: replaces white pixels in enclosed regions
- relationships:
    - enclosure: A region of white pixels is considered enclosed if every pixel adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel in the region is either another pixel within the same white region or a gray (5) pixel.
- actions:
    - identify: Locate contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
    - check_enclosure: For each white region, determine if it is fully enclosed by gray (5) pixels.
    - fill_enclosed: If a white region is fully enclosed, change the color of all pixels in that region to red (2).
- examples_summary:
    - train_1: One enclosed white region found and filled.
    - train_2: Two enclosed white regions found and filled.
    - train_3: No enclosed white regions found; output is identical to input.
    - train_4: Two enclosed white regions found and filled.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
2.  For each identified white region:
    a.  Examine all pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any pixel within the white region.
    b.  Check if *all* these adjacent pixels are either gray (color 5) or part of the same white region.
    c.  If all adjacent pixels satisfy condition (b), meaning the white region is completely surrounded by gray pixels, then designate this white region for filling.
3.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
4.  For every white region designated for filling in step 2c, change the color of all pixels belonging to that region from white (0) to red (2) in the output grid.
5.  If no white regions are designated for filling, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
