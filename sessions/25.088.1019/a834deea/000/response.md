Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Background/Border:** The grids consistently feature a border or background composed of the color 8 (azure). This border seems largely static.
2.  **Active Regions:** Inside the azure border, there are regions primarily defined by the color 0 (white). These white regions often contain structures or patterns made of color 8 (azure).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between the input and output grids occur *within* these white/azure regions. The external azure border and often the white boundaries remain unchanged.
4.  **Core Mechanism:** The transformation appears to involve identifying specific 3x3 patterns composed *only* of white (0) and azure (8) pixels in the input. When such a pattern is found, certain pixels within or around that 3x3 area are changed to other colors (1-7, 9) in the output, based on the specific 3x3 pattern identified. The original white (0) and azure (8) pixels involved in the pattern might also change or remain the same according to the specific rule for that pattern.
5.  **Pattern Mapping:** Each unique 3x3 input pattern (of white/azure) seems to map to a specific set of pixel modifications in the output, applied relative to the center of the identified 3x3 pattern.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - BackgroundColor: 8 (azure)
  - ActiveRegionColor1: 0 (white)
  - ActiveRegionColor2: 8 (azure)
  - TransformationColors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9] # blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, maroon

Objects:
  - Type: Background/Border
    Color: 8 (azure)
    Location: Typically forms the outer edges, sometimes fills larger areas.
    Persistence: Generally static, does not change during transformation.
  - Type: ActiveRegionBoundary
    Color: 0 (white)
    Location: Encloses areas containing patterns of color 8.
    Persistence: Mostly static, but can be modified if part of a recognized 3x3 pattern.
  - Type: PatternElement
    Color: 8 (azure)
    Location: Forms structures within the ActiveRegionBoundary (color 0).
    Persistence: Can be modified if part of a recognized 3x3 pattern.
  - Type: PatternElement
    Color: 0 (white)
    Location: Fills space within the ActiveRegionBoundary, surrounding color 8 elements.
    Persistence: Can be modified to other colors (1-7, 9) if part of a recognized 3x3 pattern.

Relationships:
  - The ActiveRegionBoundary (0) encloses PatternElements (0 and 8).
  - The Background/Border (8) typically surrounds the ActiveRegionBoundary (0).

Actions:
  - Identify: Scan the input grid for all possible 3x3 subgrids.
  - Filter: Select only those 3x3 subgrids composed entirely of pixels with colors 0 (white) or 8 (azure).
  - Match: Compare each selected 3x3 subgrid (InputPattern) against a predefined set of known patterns.
  - Transform: If an InputPattern matches a known pattern:
      - Retrieve the corresponding output modification rules for that pattern.
      - These rules specify which pixels relative to the center of the 3x3 subgrid should be changed and to which new color.
      - Apply these changes to a copy of the input grid. Pixels outside matched patterns, the background border, and unchanged pixels within patterns remain the same.

Pattern_Map (Derived from examples):
  - Pattern1: Input=[[0,0,0],[0,8,0],[0,0,0]] -> Changes={(-1,-1):1, (-1,0):7, (-1,+1):6, (0,-1):4, (0,0):8, (0,+1):5, (+1,-1):2, (+1,0):9, (+1,+1):3}
  - Pattern2: Input=[[8,0,8],[0,0,0],[8,0,8]] -> Changes={(-1,0):7, (0,-1):4, (0,+1):5, (+1,0):9}
  - Pattern3: Input=[[0,8,8],[0,0,8],[0,8,8]] -> Changes={(-1,-1):1, (0,-1):4, (+1,-1):2}
  - Pattern4: Input=[[8,8,8],[8,8,8],[8,8,8]] -> Changes={(0,-1):4, (0,+1):9, (+1,-1):2, (+1,0):9}
  - Pattern5: Input=[[8,8,8],[0,0,0],[8,0,8]] -> Changes={(0,-1):4, (0,+1):9}
  - Pattern6: Input=[[8,8,0],[0,0,0],[8,8,8]] -> Changes={(-1,+1):6, (0,-1):4, (0,+1):5}
  # Note: Coordinates in Changes are (relative_row, relative_col) from the center of the 3x3 pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define a mapping between specific 3x3 input patterns (composed only of white '0' and azure '8' pixels) and their corresponding output modifications. Each modification rule consists of a set of relative coordinates `(row_offset, col_offset)` from the pattern's center and the `new_color` to place at that relative position.
3.  Iterate through each possible center pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid (excluding the absolute border pixels, i.e., `1 <= r < height-1` and `1 <= c < width-1`).
4.  For each center pixel `(r, c)`, extract the 3x3 neighborhood subgrid centered at `(r, c)`.
5.  Check if all pixels within this 3x3 subgrid are either white (0) or azure (8).
6.  If the subgrid contains only white and azure pixels, compare this 3x3 pattern against the known input patterns in the predefined mapping.
7.  If a match is found:
    a.  Retrieve the set of output modification rules `{(row_offset, col_offset): new_color}` associated with the matched pattern.
    b.  For each rule `(dr, dc): color` in the set, update the pixel in the *output grid* at location `(r + dr, c + dc)` to the specified `color`.
8.  After checking all possible center pixels, return the final modified output grid.
