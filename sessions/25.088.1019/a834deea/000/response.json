            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background/Border:** The grids consistently feature a border or background composed of the color 8 (azure). This border seems largely static.\n2.  **Active Regions:** Inside the azure border, there are regions primarily defined by the color 0 (white). These white regions often contain structures or patterns made of color 8 (azure).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between the input and output grids occur *within* these white/azure regions. The external azure border and often the white boundaries remain unchanged.\n4.  **Core Mechanism:** The transformation appears to involve identifying specific 3x3 patterns composed *only* of white (0) and azure (8) pixels in the input. When such a pattern is found, certain pixels within or around that 3x3 area are changed to other colors (1-7, 9) in the output, based on the specific 3x3 pattern identified. The original white (0) and azure (8) pixels involved in the pattern might also change or remain the same according to the specific rule for that pattern.\n5.  **Pattern Mapping:** Each unique 3x3 input pattern (of white/azure) seems to map to a specific set of pixel modifications in the output, applied relative to the center of the identified 3x3 pattern.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Define a mapping between specific 3x3 input patterns (composed only of white '0' and azure '8' pixels) and their corresponding output modifications. Each modification rule consists of a set of relative coordinates `(row_offset, col_offset)` from the pattern's center and the `new_color` to place at that relative position.\n3.  Iterate through each possible center pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid (excluding the absolute border pixels, i.e., `1 <= r < height-1` and `1 <= c < width-1`).\n4.  For each center pixel `(r, c)`, extract the 3x3 neighborhood subgrid centered at `(r, c)`.\n5.  Check if all pixels within this 3x3 subgrid are either white (0) or azure (8).\n6.  If the subgrid contains only white and azure pixels, compare this 3x3 pattern against the known input patterns in the predefined mapping.\n7.  If a match is found:\n    a.
