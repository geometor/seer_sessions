"""
Identifies the two distinct non-background color objects in the input grid. 
Determines a 'pivot' object (smaller size, or higher color index if sizes are equal) 
and a 'mobile' object. Calculates the bounding box center sum (min_row + max_row, 
min_col + max_col) of the pivot object. Reflects each pixel of the mobile object 
through this center sum (reflected_coord = center_sum - original_coord). 
The output grid contains the original two objects plus the reflected pixels, colored 
the same as the mobile object.
