            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement a transformation rule involving two objects: one \"pivot\" and one \"mobile\". The rule identified was:\n1. Identify the two non-white objects.\n2. Determine the pivot: the smaller object, or if sizes are equal, the one with the higher color index. The other object is mobile.\n3. Calculate the geometric center of the pivot object's bounding box.\n4. Reflect each pixel of the mobile object through this center point using the formula `reflected_coord = 2 * center_coord - original_coord` (or the equivalent `reflected_coord = (min_coord + max_coord) - original_coord`).\n5. Draw the reflected mobile object onto the grid, preserving the original two objects.\n\nAnalysis of the input/output examples confirms that this transformation rule correctly describes the relationship between the input and expected output grids in all three training cases.\n\nHowever, the provided code consistently fails, producing output identical to the input. This indicates that while the *intended logic* (as described in the docstring and derived from Example 1) is correct, the *implementation* failed to modify the output grid. The reflection calculation or the step where pixels are written to the `output_np` array did not execute as expected.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1. Confirm the object properties and reflection coordinates using `tool_code`.\n2. Re-affirm the natural language program based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.\n3. Advise the coder phase to focus on debugging the implementation, specifically the reflection calculation and grid update steps, as the underlying logic appears sound.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the object properties and reflection logic for each example.\n\n"

BBox: (6, 8, 4, 6). Center Sum: (14, 10).\n    *   Mobile: Azure Arrow.\n    *   Mobile pixel (3, 8) reflects to (14-3, 10-8) = (11, 2). (Correct per expected output)\n    *   Mobile pixel (5, 6) reflects to (14-5, 10-6) = (9, 4). (Correct per expected output)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects: Red shape (color 2, size 11), Yellow H (color 4, size 5).\n    *   Pivot: Yellow H (smaller size 5). BBox: (7, 9, 6, 8).

BBox: (6, 8, 4, 6). Center Sum: (14, 10).\n    *   Mobile: Blue shape.\n    *   Mobile pixel (9, 2) reflects to (14-9, 10-2) = (5, 8).
