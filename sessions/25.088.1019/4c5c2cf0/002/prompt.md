"""
Reflects one object through the geometric center of another object.

The transformation identifies the two distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
It determines which object acts as the "pivot" and which is "mobile" based on size and color.
The smaller object is the pivot. If sizes are equal, the object with the higher color index is the pivot.
The geometric center of the pivot object's bounding box is calculated.
The mobile object is then reflected point-by-point through this center.
The reflected points are added to the output grid, preserving the original two objects.
