task_description: Reflects one object through the geometric center of another object's bounding box.

definitions:
  object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color (using 4-way connectivity).
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all pixels of an object (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  geometric_center_sum: A pair of integers (min_row + max_row, min_col + max_col) derived from the bounding box, used for reflection calculation.
  pivot_object: The object used to determine the center of reflection.
  mobile_object: The object that is reflected.

input_grid_properties:
  - contains exactly two distinct non-white objects.

transformation_steps:
  1. Identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
  2. Determine which object is the pivot and which is the mobile:
     - If one object has fewer pixels than the other, it is the pivot.
     - If both objects have the same number of pixels, the object with the higher color index (value) is the pivot.
     - The other object is the mobile object.
  3. Calculate the geometric_center_sum for the pivot object's bounding_box.
  4. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  5. For each pixel (r, c) belonging to the mobile object:
     a. Calculate the reflected coordinates (r_reflected, c_reflected):
        - r_reflected = geometric_center_sum.row - r
        - c_reflected = geometric_center_sum.col - c
     b. If the reflected coordinates are within the grid boundaries:
        - Set the pixel at (r_reflected, c_reflected) in the output grid to the color of the mobile object.

output_grid_properties:
  - Contains the original pivot object.
  - Contains the original mobile object.
  - Contains a third object, which is the reflection of the mobile object through the pivot's bounding box center, potentially overwriting parts of the original objects or background where the reflection lands.
