            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples provided.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** All grids use white (0) as the background color.\n2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly two distinct objects composed of single, non-white colors. The objects are contiguous blocks of pixels.\n3.  **Colors:** The colors used for objects vary across examples (azure, green, red, yellow, blue).\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid contains the original two objects *plus* a new object. This new object is a transformation of one of the original objects.\n5.  **Nature of Transformation:** Observing the positions, the transformation appears to be a point reflection (rotation by 180 degrees). The center of this reflection seems related to the position of the *other* object (the one not being reflected).\n6.  **Pivot Identification:** In each example, one object remains static while the other is reflected. Let's call the static object the \"pivot\" and the other the \"mobile\" object. The reflection of the mobile object appears to be centered on the geometric center of the pivot object.\n7.  **Pivot Selection Rule:** We need to determine which object acts as the pivot. Let's compare the objects in each pair:\n    *   `train_1`: Green (4 pixels) vs Azure (7 pixels). Green is pivot. Smaller object is pivot.\n    *   `train_2`: Yellow (4 pixels) vs Red (10 pixels). Yellow is pivot. Smaller object is pivot.\n    *   `train_3`: Azure (5 pixels) vs Blue (5 pixels). Sizes are equal. Azure (color 8) is pivot, Blue (color 1) is mobile. The object with the higher color index is the pivot in case of a tie in size.\n8.  **Center Calculation:** The center of reflection is the geometric center of the pivot object's bounding box. If the pivot object occupies rows `r_min` to `r_max` and columns `c_min` to `c_max`, the center of reflection is `( (r_min + r_max) / 2 , (c_min + c_max) / 2 )`. The reflection maps a point `(r, c)` to `( (r_min + r_max) - r , (c_min + c_max) - c )`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each object, record its color, its pixel coordinates, its size (number of pixels), and its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices).\n3.  Compare the sizes of the two objects.\n4.  If one object is smaller (has fewer pixels) than the other, designate the smaller object as the \"pivot\" and the larger object as the \"mobile\" object.\n5.  If the two objects have the same size, compare their color indices. Designate the object with the numerically higher color index as the \"pivot\" and the other object as the \"mobile\" object.\n6.  Determine the center of reflection using the pivot object's bounding box: Let `r_min`, `r_max`, `c_min`, `c_max` be the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the pivot object. Calculate `sum_r = r_min + r_max` and `sum_c = c_min + c_max`.\n7.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the mobile object. Let its color be `mobile_color`.\n8.  For each such pixel, calculate its reflected coordinates `(r', c')` using the formula: `r' = sum_r - r` and `c' = sum_c - c`.\n9.  If the calculated coordinates `(r', c')` fall within the bounds of the grid, update the output grid by setting the color of the pixel at `(r', c')` to `mobile_color`.\n10. The final output grid contains the original two objects plus the newly drawn reflected pixels."
