Okay, let's analyze the examples provided.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background:** All grids use white (0) as the background color.
2.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains exactly two distinct objects composed of single, non-white colors. The objects are contiguous blocks of pixels.
3.  **Colors:** The colors used for objects vary across examples (azure, green, red, yellow, blue).
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid contains the original two objects *plus* a new object. This new object is a transformation of one of the original objects.
5.  **Nature of Transformation:** Observing the positions, the transformation appears to be a point reflection (rotation by 180 degrees). The center of this reflection seems related to the position of the *other* object (the one not being reflected).
6.  **Pivot Identification:** In each example, one object remains static while the other is reflected. Let's call the static object the "pivot" and the other the "mobile" object. The reflection of the mobile object appears to be centered on the geometric center of the pivot object.
7.  **Pivot Selection Rule:** We need to determine which object acts as the pivot. Let's compare the objects in each pair:
    *   `train_1`: Green (4 pixels) vs Azure (7 pixels). Green is pivot. Smaller object is pivot.
    *   `train_2`: Yellow (4 pixels) vs Red (10 pixels). Yellow is pivot. Smaller object is pivot.
    *   `train_3`: Azure (5 pixels) vs Blue (5 pixels). Sizes are equal. Azure (color 8) is pivot, Blue (color 1) is mobile. The object with the higher color index is the pivot in case of a tie in size.
8.  **Center Calculation:** The center of reflection is the geometric center of the pivot object's bounding box. If the pivot object occupies rows `r_min` to `r_max` and columns `c_min` to `c_max`, the center of reflection is `( (r_min + r_max) / 2 , (c_min + c_max) / 2 )`. The reflection maps a point `(r, c)` to `( (r_min + r_max) - r , (c_min + c_max) - c )`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect one object through the center of another object based on size and color comparison.

definitions:
  - &object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: The numerical index (1-9) of the object's pixels.
      - pixels: A list of (row, column) coordinates occupied by the object.
      - size: The number of pixels in the object.
      - bounding_box: The minimum and maximum row and column indices (r_min, r_max, c_min, c_max).
      - center_coords: Calculated center based on bounding box: ((r_min + r_max), (c_min + c_max)). Note: These are twice the float center coordinates, used for integer math reflection.

grid_elements:
  - type: background

    count: Exactly two per input grid.

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_two_objects_with_properties
    description: Finds the two distinct non-white objects and calculates their properties (color, pixels, size, bounding_box).
  - name: determine_pivot_and_mobile
    input: list_of_two_objects
    output: 
      - pivot_object: The object acting as the center of reflection.
      - mobile_object: The object that gets reflected.
    logic:
      - Compare the sizes (number of pixels) of the two objects.
      - If sizes differ, the object with the smaller size is the pivot.
      - If sizes are equal, compare the color indices of the two objects. The object with the higher color index is the pivot.
      - The other object is the mobile object.
  - name: calculate_pivot_center
    input: pivot_object
    output: center_coords (sum_r, sum_c)
    logic: Calculate sum_r = r_min + r_max and sum_c = c_min + c_max from the pivot's bounding_box.
  - name: reflect_mobile_object
    input:
      - mobile_object
      - center_coords (sum_r, sum_c)
      - output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    output: modified_output_grid
    logic:
      - For each pixel (r, c) with color `obj_color` in the mobile_object:
        - Calculate reflected coordinates: r' = sum_r - r, c' = sum_c - c.
        - If (r', c') are valid coordinates within the grid bounds:
          - Set the pixel at (r', c') in the output_grid to `obj_color`.

relationships:
  - type: reflection_relationship
    between: [pivot_object, mobile_object]
    description: The mobile_object is reflected through the geometric center of the pivot_object's bounding box to create a new shape in the output grid. The original objects remain.

final_output:
  - The output grid contains the original pivot_object, the original mobile_object, and the newly created reflected version of the mobile_object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create a copy for the output grid.
2.  Identify the two distinct non-white objects in the input grid. For each object, record its color, its pixel coordinates, its size (number of pixels), and its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices).
3.  Compare the sizes of the two objects.
4.  If one object is smaller (has fewer pixels) than the other, designate the smaller object as the "pivot" and the larger object as the "mobile" object.
5.  If the two objects have the same size, compare their color indices. Designate the object with the numerically higher color index as the "pivot" and the other object as the "mobile" object.
6.  Determine the center of reflection using the pivot object's bounding box: Let `r_min`, `r_max`, `c_min`, `c_max` be the minimum/maximum row/column indices of the pivot object. Calculate `sum_r = r_min + r_max` and `sum_c = c_min + c_max`.
7.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the mobile object. Let its color be `mobile_color`.
8.  For each such pixel, calculate its reflected coordinates `(r', c')` using the formula: `r' = sum_r - r` and `c' = sum_c - c`.
9.  If the calculated coordinates `(r', c')` fall within the bounds of the grid, update the output grid by setting the color of the pixel at `(r', c')` to `mobile_color`.
10. The final output grid contains the original two objects plus the newly drawn reflected pixels.
