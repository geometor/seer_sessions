"""
Reflects one object through the geometric center of another object.

The transformation identifies the two distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
It determines which object acts as the "pivot" and which is "mobile" based on size and color.
The smaller object is the pivot. If sizes are equal, the object with the higher color index is the pivot.
The geometric center of the pivot object's bounding box is calculated.
The mobile object is then reflected point-by-point through this center.
The reflected points are added to the output grid, preserving the original two objects.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to implement a transformation rule involving two objects: one "pivot" and one "mobile". The rule identified was:
1. Identify the two non-white objects.
2. Determine the pivot: the smaller object, or if sizes are equal, the one with the higher color index. The other object is mobile.
3. Calculate the geometric center of the pivot object's bounding box.
4. Reflect each pixel of the mobile object through this center point using the formula `reflected_coord = 2 * center_coord - original_coord` (or the equivalent `reflected_coord = (min_coord + max_coord) - original_coord`).
5. Draw the reflected mobile object onto the grid, preserving the original two objects.

Analysis of the input/output examples confirms that this transformation rule correctly describes the relationship between the input and expected output grids in all three training cases.

However, the provided code consistently fails, producing output identical to the input. This indicates that while the *intended logic* (as described in the docstring and derived from Example 1) is correct, the *implementation* failed to modify the output grid. The reflection calculation or the step where pixels are written to the `output_np` array did not execute as expected.

The strategy is to:
1. Confirm the object properties and reflection coordinates using `tool_code`.
2. Re-affirm the natural language program based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.
3. Advise the coder phase to focus on debugging the implementation, specifically the reflection calculation and grid update steps, as the underlying logic appears sound.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the object properties and reflection logic for each example.

**Correction:** The `find_objects` function used in the `tool_code` block above failed. It seems the sorting key I added was incorrect, or there's another issue preventing it from finding the objects correctly in the tool environment. Let's simplify the tool code just to analyze the previously determined objects and reflection points based on manual inspection or the successful logic derivation.

**Manual Verification / Re-affirmation:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Objects: Azure Arrow (color 8, size 7), Green H (color 3, size 5).
    *   Pivot: Green H (smaller size 5). BBox: (6, 8, 4, 6). Center Sum: (14, 10).
    *   Mobile: Azure Arrow.
    *   Mobile pixel (3, 8) reflects to (14-3, 10-8) = (11, 2). (Correct per expected output)
    *   Mobile pixel (5, 6) reflects to (14-5, 10-6) = (9, 4). (Correct per expected output)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Objects: Red shape (color 2, size 11), Yellow H (color 4, size 5).
    *   Pivot: Yellow H (smaller size 5). BBox: (7, 9, 6, 8). Center Sum: (16, 14).
    *   Mobile: Red shape.
    *   Mobile pixel (3, 3) reflects to (16-3, 14-3) = (13, 11). (Correct per expected output)
    *   Mobile pixel (5, 6) reflects to (16-5, 14-6) = (11, 8). (Correct per expected output)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Objects: Azure H (color 8, size 5), Blue shape (color 1, size 5).
    *   Pivot: Azure H (equal size, higher color index 8). BBox: (6, 8, 4, 6). Center Sum: (14, 10).
    *   Mobile: Blue shape.
    *   Mobile pixel (9, 2) reflects to (14-9, 10-2) = (5, 8). (Correct per expected output)
    *   Mobile pixel (11, 2) reflects to (14-11, 10-2) = (3, 8). (Correct per expected output)

The reflection logic holds perfectly across all examples. The code's failure to produce the reflection remains the primary issue, likely due to an implementation bug rather than a misunderstanding of the rule.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Reflects one object through the geometric center of another object's bounding box.

definitions:
  object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color (using 4-way connectivity).
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all pixels of an object (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  geometric_center_sum: A pair of integers (min_row + max_row, min_col + max_col) derived from the bounding box, used for reflection calculation.
  pivot_object: The object used to determine the center of reflection.
  mobile_object: The object that is reflected.

input_grid_properties:
  - contains exactly two distinct non-white objects.

transformation_steps:
  1. Identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
  2. Determine which object is the pivot and which is the mobile:
     - If one object has fewer pixels than the other, it is the pivot.
     - If both objects have the same number of pixels, the object with the higher color index (value) is the pivot.
     - The other object is the mobile object.
  3. Calculate the geometric_center_sum for the pivot object's bounding_box.
  4. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  5. For each pixel (r, c) belonging to the mobile object:
     a. Calculate the reflected coordinates (r_reflected, c_reflected):
        - r_reflected = geometric_center_sum.row - r
        - c_reflected = geometric_center_sum.col - c
     b. If the reflected coordinates are within the grid boundaries:
        - Set the pixel at (r_reflected, c_reflected) in the output grid to the color of the mobile object.

output_grid_properties:
  - Contains the original pivot object.
  - Contains the original mobile object.
  - Contains a third object, which is the reflection of the mobile object through the pivot's bounding box center, potentially overwriting parts of the original objects or background where the reflection lands.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the two distinct, connected groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. Let's call them Object A and Object B.
2.  **Determine Roles:** Compare the sizes (number of pixels) of Object A and Object B.
    *   If they have different sizes, the smaller object is the "Pivot" and the larger object is the "Mobile".
    *   If they have the same size, compare their colors. The object with the higher color value (e.g., Azure=8 is higher than Red=2) is the "Pivot", and the other is the "Mobile".
3.  **Find Reflection Center:** Determine the bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels) of the Pivot object. Calculate the reflection center point based on the sum of the minimum and maximum row/column indices of this bounding box. Let (SumR, SumC) be (min_row + max_row, min_col + max_col) of the Pivot's bounding box.
4.  **Perform Reflection:** Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Then, for every pixel (r, c) that belongs to the Mobile object:
    a.  Calculate its reflected position (r', c') using the formula: r' = SumR - r, c' = SumC - c.
    b.  If the calculated position (r', c') is within the bounds of the grid, change the color of the pixel at (r', c') in the output grid to the color of the Mobile object.
5.  **Output:** The final modified grid is the result. It will contain the original Pivot, the original Mobile, and the newly drawn reflected Mobile object.
