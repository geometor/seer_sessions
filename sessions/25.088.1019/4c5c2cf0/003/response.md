"""
Reflects one object through the geometric center of another object's bounding box.

The transformation identifies the two distinct non-white objects in the input grid.
It determines which object acts as the "pivot" and which is "mobile" based on size and color:
- The smaller object is the pivot.
- If sizes are equal, the object with the higher color index is the pivot.
The geometric center sum (min_row + max_row, min_col + max_col) of the pivot object's bounding box is calculated.
The mobile object is then reflected point-by-point using this center sum: 
reflected_row = (min_row + max_row) - original_row
reflected_col = (min_col + max_col) - original_col
The reflected points are added to the output grid (which initially is a copy of the input), 
preserving the original two objects and adding the reflection.
