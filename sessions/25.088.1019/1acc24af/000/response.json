The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Object Identification:** The grids contain distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-background colors. Specifically, I observe blue (1) objects and gray (5) objects in the input.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The primary change between input and output involves the gray (5) objects. Some gray pixels turn into red (2) pixels in the output.\n4.  **Consistency:** The blue (1) objects appear completely unchanged in position and color across all examples.\n5.  **Selective Change:** Not all gray (5) objects change color. In each example, only one contiguous gray object undergoes a transformation.\n6.  **Size Matters:** Comparing the gray objects within each input grid, the object that changes to red (2) appears to be the *largest* gray object in terms of the number of pixels it occupies. Other, smaller gray objects remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Then, locate all the pixels belonging to the largest gray object (identified in step 3) and change their color from gray (5) to red (2) in the output grid.\n5.  **Preserve Others:** Ensure all other pixels in the output grid, including the background (0), blue (1) objects, and any gray (5) objects that were *not* the largest, remain identical to their corresponding pixels in the input grid."
