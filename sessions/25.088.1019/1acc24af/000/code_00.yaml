task_elements:
  - grid:
      description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
      background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      description: Contiguous areas of the same non-background color.
      types:
        - color: blue (1)
          role: static element, unchanged between input and output.
        - color: gray (5)
          role: dynamic element, potentially transformed.
        - color: red (2)
          role: result of transformation, appears only in output.
  - properties:
      - size:
          description: The number of pixels composing an object.
          relevance: Key factor in determining which gray object is transformed.
      - contiguity:
          description: Pixels are part of the same object if they share an edge (not just a corner). Used to define object boundaries.
  - relationships:
      - comparison: The sizes of all gray objects within an input grid are compared.
  - actions:
      - identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of gray pixels.
      - calculate_size: Determine the pixel count for each identified gray object.
      - find_largest: Select the gray object with the maximum pixel count.
      - recolor: Change the color of the pixels belonging to the largest gray object from gray (5) to red (2).
      - copy: All other pixels (background, blue objects, smaller gray objects) retain their original color and position.
