            "text": "The metric gathering confirms the initial manual analysis and the identification of special pixels by the previous code's logic (least frequent non-background, using top-leftmost instance if multiple exist for the same color). My analysis of why the code failed seems sound. The missing piece is adding internal pixels for the secondary special pixel(s).\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code correctly identifies the background color and the \"special\" pixels (least frequent non-background colors). It handles the case with one special pixel correctly, modifying the furthest boundary and adding internal pixels towards it. However, it fails when there are two special pixels because it doesn't consistently add internal pixels for both.\n\nSpecifically:\n-   When one special pixel has a strictly greater maximum distance to a boundary than the other, the code correctly identifies the \"primary\" (further) and \"secondary\" (closer) pixels. It modifies the furthest boundary for the primary and the closest boundary for the secondary. It adds internal pixels *only* for the primary towards its furthest boundary. **Correction needed:** It should *also* add internal pixels for the secondary pixel towards its *closest* boundary.\n-   When both special pixels have the same maximum distance to a boundary, the code correctly modifies the closest boundary for each. It adds *no* internal pixels. **Correction needed:** It should add internal pixels for *both* pixels towards their respective *closest* boundaries.\n\nThe intersection logic (setting the corner to white) appears correct. The step size of 2 for internal pixels also seems correct.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the code logic for two special pixels to include the addition of internal pixels for the secondary pixel(s) towards their closest boundary.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1 (Failed):**\n-   Input Grid: 12x14\n-   Background Color: Red (2)\n-   Special Pixels (Color, First Loc): [(Blue(1), (3, 9)), (Azure(8), (8, 2))]\n-   Distances (P1: Blue): T=3, B=8, L=9, R=4. Furthest=L(9), Closest=T(3).\n-   Distances (P2: Azure): T=8, B=3, L=2, R=11. Furthest=R(11), Closest=L(2).\n-   Condition: MaxDist2 (11) > MaxDist1 (9). Azure is primary, Blue is secondary.\n-   Expected Actions:\n    -   Azure (Primary): Modify R boundary (Azure), Add internal pixels towards R from (8,2) -> (8,4), (8,6), (8,8), (8,10), (8,12).\n    -   Blue (Secondary): Modify T boundary (Blue), Add internal pixels towards T from (3,9) -> (1,9).\n    -   Intersection: T & R -> (0, 13) becomes White(0).\n-   Code Output Discrepancy: Missing the internal Blue pixel at (1, 9).\n\n**Example 2 (Failed):**\n-   Input Grid: 11x13\n-   Background Color: Blue (1)\n-   Special Pixels (Color, First Loc): [(Red(2), (5, 3)), (Green(3), (3, 9))] (Note: tool output shows Red first due to np.int64 type sorting, logic uses P1=Green, P2=Red based on original code's sorting by color index) -> Re-checking original code: `sorted_colors = sorted(locations.keys())`, so Green (3) is C1/P1, Red (2) is C2/P2. Let's recalculate with C1=Green, C2=Red.\n    - P1 = (3, 9) (Green, C1=3)\n    - P2 = (5, 3) (Red, C2=2)\n-   Distances (P1: Green): T=3, B=7, L=9, R=3. Furthest=L(9), Closest=T(3) (tiebreak T>R).\n-   Distances (P2: Red): T=5, B=5, L=3, R=9. Furthest=R(9), Closest=L(3).\n-   Condition: MaxDist1 (9) == MaxDist2 (9). Both are secondary.\n-   Expected Actions:\n    -   Green (Secondary): Modify closest boundary T (Green), Add internal pixels towards T from (3,9) -> (1,9).\n    -   Red (Secondary): Modify closest boundary L (Red), Add internal pixels towards L from (5,3) -> (5,1).\n    -   Intersection: T & L -> (0, 0) becomes White(0).\n-   Code Output Discrepancy: Missing internal Green pixel at (1, 9) and internal Red pixel at (5, 1).\n\n**Example 3 (Passed):**\n-   Input Grid: 15x12\n-   Background Color: Green (3)\n-   Special Pixels (Color, First Loc): [(Magenta(6), (2, 5))]\n-   Condition: One special pixel.\n-   Expected Actions:\n    -   Magenta: Modify furthest boundary B (Magenta), Add internal pixels towards B from (2,5) -> (4,5), (6,5), (8,5), (10,5), (12,5).\n-   Code Output Discrepancy: None.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
