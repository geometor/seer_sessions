"""
Identifies the background color (most frequent) and "special" pixels (least frequent non-background colors).
Based on the number and location of special pixels, modifies the grid boundaries and potentially adds internal pixels.

Transformation Steps:
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Find the background color (most frequent).
3. Find all non-background colors and their frequencies.
4. Identify the color(s) with the minimum frequency ("special colors"). Record one location for each special color.
5. **If one special color `C` at `P = (r, c)`:**
   a. Calculate distances from `P` to boundaries (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).
   b. Determine the furthest boundary from `P`.
   c. Overwrite this furthest boundary line with color `C`.
   d. Add pixels of color `C` every two steps from `P` towards the furthest boundary (not including `P` or the boundary itself).
6. **If two special colors `C1` at `P1` and `C2` at `P2`:**
   a. Calculate furthest boundary distances for both `P1` (MaxDist1) and `P2` (MaxDist2).
   b. **If MaxDist1 > MaxDist2:**
      i. `C1` is primary: Modify `P1`'s furthest boundary with `C1` and add internal pixels towards it.
      ii. `C2` is secondary: Modify `P2`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C2`.
   c. **If MaxDist2 > MaxDist1:**
      i. `C2` is primary: Modify `P2`'s furthest boundary with `C2` and add internal pixels towards it.
      ii. `C1` is secondary: Modify `P1`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C1`.
   d. **If MaxDist1 == MaxDist2:**
      i. Modify `P1`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C1`.
      ii. Modify `P2`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C2`.
   e. **Intersection Handling:** If the two modified boundaries intersect (one horizontal, one vertical), set the intersection pixel to White (0).
