"""
Identifies the background color (most frequent) and "special" pixels (least frequent non-background colors).
Based on the number and location of special pixels, modifies the grid boundaries and potentially adds internal pixels.

Transformation Steps:
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Find the background color (most frequent).
3. Find all non-background colors and their frequencies.
4. Identify the color(s) with the minimum frequency ("special colors"). Record one location for each special color.
5. **If one special color `C` at `P = (r, c)`:**
   a. Calculate distances from `P` to boundaries (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).
   b. Determine the furthest boundary from `P`.
   c. Overwrite this furthest boundary line with color `C`.
   d. Add pixels of color `C` every two steps from `P` towards the furthest boundary (not including `P` or the boundary itself).
6. **If two special colors `C1` at `P1` and `C2` at `P2`:**
   a. Calculate furthest boundary distances for both `P1` (MaxDist1) and `P2` (MaxDist2).
   b. **If MaxDist1 > MaxDist2:**
      i. `C1` is primary: Modify `P1`'s furthest boundary with `C1` and add internal pixels towards it.
      ii. `C2` is secondary: Modify `P2`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C2`.
   c. **If MaxDist2 > MaxDist1:**
      i. `C2` is primary: Modify `P2`'s furthest boundary with `C2` and add internal pixels towards it.
      ii. `C1` is secondary: Modify `P1`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C1`.
   d. **If MaxDist1 == MaxDist2:**
      i. Modify `P1`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C1`.
      ii. Modify `P2`'s closest boundary (T > B > L > R tiebreak) with `C2`.
   e. **Intersection Handling:** If the two modified boundaries intersect (one horizontal, one vertical), set the intersection pixel to White (0).

```
The metric gathering confirms the initial manual analysis and the identification of special pixels by the previous code's logic (least frequent non-background, using top-leftmost instance if multiple exist for the same color). My analysis of why the code failed seems sound. The missing piece is adding internal pixels for the secondary special pixel(s).

## General Assessment

The provided code correctly identifies the background color and the "special" pixels (least frequent non-background colors). It handles the case with one special pixel correctly, modifying the furthest boundary and adding internal pixels towards it. However, it fails when there are two special pixels because it doesn't consistently add internal pixels for both.

Specifically:
-   When one special pixel has a strictly greater maximum distance to a boundary than the other, the code correctly identifies the "primary" (further) and "secondary" (closer) pixels. It modifies the furthest boundary for the primary and the closest boundary for the secondary. It adds internal pixels *only* for the primary towards its furthest boundary. **Correction needed:** It should *also* add internal pixels for the secondary pixel towards its *closest* boundary.
-   When both special pixels have the same maximum distance to a boundary, the code correctly modifies the closest boundary for each. It adds *no* internal pixels. **Correction needed:** It should add internal pixels for *both* pixels towards their respective *closest* boundaries.

The intersection logic (setting the corner to white) appears correct. The step size of 2 for internal pixels also seems correct.

The strategy is to modify the code logic for two special pixels to include the addition of internal pixels for the secondary pixel(s) towards their closest boundary.

## Metrics

**Example 1 (Failed):**
-   Input Grid: 12x14
-   Background Color: Red (2)
-   Special Pixels (Color, First Loc): [(Blue(1), (3, 9)), (Azure(8), (8, 2))]
-   Distances (P1: Blue): T=3, B=8, L=9, R=4. Furthest=L(9), Closest=T(3).
-   Distances (P2: Azure): T=8, B=3, L=2, R=11. Furthest=R(11), Closest=L(2).
-   Condition: MaxDist2 (11) > MaxDist1 (9). Azure is primary, Blue is secondary.
-   Expected Actions:
    -   Azure (Primary): Modify R boundary (Azure), Add internal pixels towards R from (8,2) -> (8,4), (8,6), (8,8), (8,10), (8,12).
    -   Blue (Secondary): Modify T boundary (Blue), Add internal pixels towards T from (3,9) -> (1,9).
    -   Intersection: T & R -> (0, 13) becomes White(0).
-   Code Output Discrepancy: Missing the internal Blue pixel at (1, 9).

**Example 2 (Failed):**
-   Input Grid: 11x13
-   Background Color: Blue (1)
-   Special Pixels (Color, First Loc): [(Red(2), (5, 3)), (Green(3), (3, 9))] (Note: tool output shows Red first due to np.int64 type sorting, logic uses P1=Green, P2=Red based on original code's sorting by color index) -> Re-checking original code: `sorted_colors = sorted(locations.keys())`, so Green (3) is C1/P1, Red (2) is C2/P2. Let's recalculate with C1=Green, C2=Red.
    - P1 = (3, 9) (Green, C1=3)
    - P2 = (5, 3) (Red, C2=2)
-   Distances (P1: Green): T=3, B=7, L=9, R=3. Furthest=L(9), Closest=T(3) (tiebreak T>R).
-   Distances (P2: Red): T=5, B=5, L=3, R=9. Furthest=R(9), Closest=L(3).
-   Condition: MaxDist1 (9) == MaxDist2 (9). Both are secondary.
-   Expected Actions:
    -   Green (Secondary): Modify closest boundary T (Green), Add internal pixels towards T from (3,9) -> (1,9).
    -   Red (Secondary): Modify closest boundary L (Red), Add internal pixels towards L from (5,3) -> (5,1).
    -   Intersection: T & L -> (0, 0) becomes White(0).
-   Code Output Discrepancy: Missing internal Green pixel at (1, 9) and internal Red pixel at (5, 1).

**Example 3 (Passed):**
-   Input Grid: 15x12
-   Background Color: Green (3)
-   Special Pixels (Color, First Loc): [(Magenta(6), (2, 5))]

    -   Magenta: Modify furthest boundary B (Magenta), Add internal pixels towards B from (2,5) -> (4,5), (6,5), (8,5), (10,5), (12,5).
-   Code Output Discrepancy: None.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Identify sparse 'special' pixels against a background, modify grid boundaries based on these pixels, and add connecting lines of pixels.

definitions:
  - background_color: The color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  - non_background_pixel: Any pixel whose color is not the background color.
  - special_pixel: A non_background_pixel belonging to a color that has the minimum frequency among all non_background_pixel colors. If multiple pixels of a special color exist, the one with the minimum row index, then minimum column index, is chosen as the representative special pixel for that color.
  - boundary: The top row (T), bottom row (B), left column (L), or right column (R) of the grid.
  - distance_to_boundary: The number of steps from a special pixel's location (r, c) to a specific boundary (e.g., distance to T is r, distance to B is height-1-r, etc.).
  - furthest_boundary: The boundary with the maximum distance from a special pixel. Tiebreak: T > B > L > R.
  - closest_boundary: The boundary with the minimum distance from a special pixel. Tiebreak: T > B > L > R.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  **Identify Background:** Find the most frequent color in the grid; this is the background color.
3.  **Identify Special Pixels:**
    *   Find all pixels that are *not* the background color.
    *   Count the occurrences of each non-background color.
    *   Identify the color(s) that have the minimum count. These are the "special" colors.
    *   For each special color, determine its representative location: the pixel with that color having the minimum row index, breaking ties with the minimum column index. Store these as (Color, (Row, Col)) pairs.
4.  **Apply Transformation based on Count:**
    *   **If zero special pixels are found:** Return the grid copy unchanged.
    *   **If one special pixel `P` with color `C` is found:**
        a.  Calculate the distances from `P` to the Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), and Right (R) boundaries.
        b.  Determine the boundary (`FB`) that is furthest from `P` (using tiebreak order T > B > L > R).
        c.  Overwrite all pixels on the `FB` line with color `C`.
        d.  Starting from the pixel two steps away from `P` towards `FB`, place pixels of color `C` every two steps along that row or column, stopping before the boundary line.
    *   **If two (or more, but only consider the first two based on color index) special pixels `P1` (color `C1`) and `P2` (color `C2`) are found:**
        a.  Calculate distances from `P1` to boundaries (T1, B1, L1, R1) and from `P2` to boundaries (T2, B2, L2, R2).
        b.  Determine the furthest boundary (`FB1`, `FB2`) and maximum distance (`MaxD1`, `MaxD2`) for each pixel.
        c.  Determine the closest boundary (`CB1`, `CB2`) for each pixel (using tiebreak order T > B > L > R).
        d.  **Compare `MaxD1` and `MaxD2`:**
            i.  **If `MaxD1 > MaxD2`:** `P1` is primary, `P2` is secondary.
                *   Modify boundary `FB1` with color `C1`. Add internal pixels from `P1` towards `FB1` (every two steps).
                *   Modify boundary `CB2` with color `C2`. Add internal pixels from `P2` towards `CB2` (every two steps).
            ii. **If `MaxD2 > MaxD1`:** `P2` is primary, `P1` is secondary.
                *   Modify boundary `FB2` with color `C2`. Add internal pixels from `P2` towards `FB2` (every two steps).
                *   Modify boundary `CB1` with color `C1`. Add internal pixels from `P1` towards `CB1` (every two steps).
            iii.**If `MaxD1 == MaxD2`:** Both `P1` and `P2` act as secondary.
                *   Modify boundary `CB1` with color `C1`. Add internal pixels from `P1` towards `CB1` (every two steps).
                *   Modify boundary `CB2` with color `C2`. Add internal pixels from `P2` towards `CB2` (every two steps).
        e.  **Intersection Check:** After performing the boundary modifications from step 4.d, check if one modified boundary was horizontal (T or B) and the other was vertical (L or R). If so, change the color of the single pixel at their intersection to White (0).
5.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
