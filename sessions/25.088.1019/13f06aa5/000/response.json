            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Core Operation:** The fundamental operation appears to be copying the input grid to the output grid while adding modifications, primarily around the boundaries and sometimes internally. The grid dimensions remain the same.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant background color (Red, Blue, Green in the examples).\n3.  **Foreground Pixels:** There are scattered foreground pixels or small shapes of various colors, distinct from the background.\n4.  **\"Special\" Pixels:** Certain foreground pixels seem to trigger the modifications. These appear to be the pixels of the least frequent non-background color(s) present in the input.\n5.  **Boundary Modifications:** One or two boundary lines (Top row, Bottom row, Left column, or Right column) are entirely overwritten with a specific color. The color used is one of the \"special\" colors.\n6.  **Internal Pixel Additions:** In some cases (Examples 1 and 3), new pixels are added *inside* the grid. These pixels have the same color as one of the modified boundaries and appear in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) extending from an original \"special\" pixel towards that boundary, placed at intervals (every two steps).\n7.  **Determining Modifications:**\n    *   The choice of which boundary to modify and with which \"special\" color seems dependent on the location(s) of the special pixel(s).\n    *   The concept of distance from a special pixel to the grid boundaries (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) appears crucial.\n    *   Rules involve finding the *furthest* boundary (for internal additions and potentially one boundary modification) and the *closest* boundary (for other boundary modifications).\n8.  **Interaction/Corner Case:** When two boundaries are modified (e.g., Top row and Left column), the pixel at their intersection is set to a specific color (White - 0).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Identify all unique non-background colors and count their occurrences in the input grid.\n4.  Determine the minimum count among these non-background colors.\n5.  Identify the \"special\" color(s) that have this minimum count. Find the location (row `r`, column `c`) of one pixel for each special color (e.g., the first one found in reading order).\n6.  **If there is exactly one special color `C` at location `P = (r, c)`:**\n    a.  Calculate the distances from `P` to the Top (`r`), Bottom (`H-1-r`), Left (`c`), and Right (`W-1-c`) boundaries (where `H` is height, `W` is width).\n    b.  Find the boundary corresponding to the *maximum* distance (the \"furthest\" boundary).\n    c.  Overwrite this entire furthest boundary line (row or column) in the output grid with color `C`.\n    d.  Iterate from `P` towards the furthest boundary: Add pixels of color `C` every two steps along the direct line (horizontally or vertically), stopping before reaching the boundary itself. Place these pixels in the output grid.\n7.  **If there are exactly two special colors, `C1` at `P1 = (r1, c1)` and `C2` at `P2 = (r2, c2)`:**\n    a.  Calculate the furthest boundary distance for `P1` (MaxDist1) and `P2` (MaxDist2).\n    b.  **If MaxDist1 is strictly greater than MaxDist2:**\n        i.  `C1` is the \"primary\" color. Perform step 6b and 6d using `C1` and `P1` (modify `P1`'s furthest boundary and add internal pixels).\n        ii. `C2` is the \"secondary\" color. Find the boundary *closest* to `P2` (minimum distance). Handle ties by preferring Top over Bottom, then Left over Right. Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C2`.\n    c.  **If MaxDist2 is strictly greater than MaxDist1:**\n        i.  `C2` is the \"primary\" color. Perform step 6b and 6d using `C2` and `P2`.\n        ii. `C1` is the \"secondary\" color. Find the boundary *closest* to `P1`. Handle ties (Top > Bottom > Left > Right). Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C1`.\n    d.  **If MaxDist1 equals MaxDist2:**\n        i.  Find the boundary *closest* to `P1`. Handle ties (Top > Bottom > Left > Right). Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C1`.\n        ii. Find the boundary *closest* to `P2`. Handle ties (Top > Bottom > Left > Right). Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C2`.\n    e.  **After modifying two boundaries (in subcases b, c, or d):** If the two modified boundaries intersect (i.e., one is horizontal and one is vertical), set the pixel at the intersection point to White (0)."
