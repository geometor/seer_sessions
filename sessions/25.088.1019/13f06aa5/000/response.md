Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Core Operation:** The fundamental operation appears to be copying the input grid to the output grid while adding modifications, primarily around the boundaries and sometimes internally. The grid dimensions remain the same.
2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant background color (Red, Blue, Green in the examples).
3.  **Foreground Pixels:** There are scattered foreground pixels or small shapes of various colors, distinct from the background.
4.  **"Special" Pixels:** Certain foreground pixels seem to trigger the modifications. These appear to be the pixels of the least frequent non-background color(s) present in the input.
5.  **Boundary Modifications:** One or two boundary lines (Top row, Bottom row, Left column, or Right column) are entirely overwritten with a specific color. The color used is one of the "special" colors.
6.  **Internal Pixel Additions:** In some cases (Examples 1 and 3), new pixels are added *inside* the grid. These pixels have the same color as one of the modified boundaries and appear in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) extending from an original "special" pixel towards that boundary, placed at intervals (every two steps).
7.  **Determining Modifications:**
    *   The choice of which boundary to modify and with which "special" color seems dependent on the location(s) of the special pixel(s).
    *   The concept of distance from a special pixel to the grid boundaries (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) appears crucial.
    *   Rules involve finding the *furthest* boundary (for internal additions and potentially one boundary modification) and the *closest* boundary (for other boundary modifications).
8.  **Interaction/Corner Case:** When two boundaries are modified (e.g., Top row and Left column), the pixel at their intersection is set to a specific color (White - 0).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color: Dominant color in the input grid.
    - foreground_elements: Pixels or small shapes with colors different from the background.
  key_objects:
    - special_pixels:
        definition: Pixels belonging to the least frequent non-background color(s) in the input grid.
        properties:
          - color
          - location: (row, column)
          - frequency: Minimum count among non-background colors.
          - count: Either 1 or 2 unique special colors observed in examples.
    - boundaries:
        definition: The top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, and right-most column of the grid.
        properties:
          - type: [Top, Bottom, Left, Right]
          - relation_to_special_pixel: [closest, furthest]
  actions:
    - copy_grid: Input grid content is the base for the output.
    - identify_special_pixels: Find non-background colors, count frequencies, identify the minimum frequency color(s) and their locations.
    - calculate_distances: For each special pixel, calculate distance to Top, Bottom, Left, Right boundaries.
    - determine_modifications: Based on the number of special colors and their distances to boundaries (closest/furthest), decide which boundaries to modify and which color dictates internal pixel additions.
    - modify_boundary: Overwrite a specific boundary row or column with a special color.
    - add_internal_pixels: If applicable, add pixels of a special color every two steps in a line from the original special pixel towards its furthest boundary.
    - handle_intersection: If two boundaries are modified, set their intersection pixel to White (0).
  relationships:
    - frequency_determines_special: The count of non-background pixels determines which colors are "special".
    - location_determines_boundary: The location of special pixels relative to boundaries (closest/furthest distances) determines which boundaries are modified.
    - furthest_distance_triggers_internal_pixels: The special pixel associated with the overall furthest boundary distance potentially triggers internal pixel additions towards that boundary.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the background color (the most frequent color).
3.  Identify all unique non-background colors and count their occurrences in the input grid.
4.  Determine the minimum count among these non-background colors.
5.  Identify the "special" color(s) that have this minimum count. Find the location (row `r`, column `c`) of one pixel for each special color (e.g., the first one found in reading order).
6.  **If there is exactly one special color `C` at location `P = (r, c)`:**
    a.  Calculate the distances from `P` to the Top (`r`), Bottom (`H-1-r`), Left (`c`), and Right (`W-1-c`) boundaries (where `H` is height, `W` is width).
    b.  Find the boundary corresponding to the *maximum* distance (the "furthest" boundary).
    c.  Overwrite this entire furthest boundary line (row or column) in the output grid with color `C`.
    d.  Iterate from `P` towards the furthest boundary: Add pixels of color `C` every two steps along the direct line (horizontally or vertically), stopping before reaching the boundary itself. Place these pixels in the output grid.
7.  **If there are exactly two special colors, `C1` at `P1 = (r1, c1)` and `C2` at `P2 = (r2, c2)`:**
    a.  Calculate the furthest boundary distance for `P1` (MaxDist1) and `P2` (MaxDist2).
    b.  **If MaxDist1 is strictly greater than MaxDist2:**
        i.  `C1` is the "primary" color. Perform step 6b and 6d using `C1` and `P1` (modify `P1`'s furthest boundary and add internal pixels).
        ii. `C2` is the "secondary" color. Find the boundary *closest* to `P2` (minimum distance). Handle ties by preferring Top over Bottom, then Left over Right. Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C2`.
    c.  **If MaxDist2 is strictly greater than MaxDist1:**
        i.  `C2` is the "primary" color. Perform step 6b and 6d using `C2` and `P2`.
        ii. `C1` is the "secondary" color. Find the boundary *closest* to `P1`. Handle ties (Top > Bottom > Left > Right). Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C1`.
    d.  **If MaxDist1 equals MaxDist2:**
        i.  Find the boundary *closest* to `P1`. Handle ties (Top > Bottom > Left > Right). Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C1`.
        ii. Find the boundary *closest* to `P2`. Handle ties (Top > Bottom > Left > Right). Overwrite this closest boundary with color `C2`.
    e.  **After modifying two boundaries (in subcases b, c, or d):** If the two modified boundaries intersect (i.e., one is horizontal and one is vertical), set the pixel at the intersection point to White (0).
