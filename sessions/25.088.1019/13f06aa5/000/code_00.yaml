task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color: Dominant color in the input grid.
    - foreground_elements: Pixels or small shapes with colors different from the background.
  key_objects:
    - special_pixels:
        definition: Pixels belonging to the least frequent non-background color(s) in the input grid.
        properties:
          - color
          - location: (row, column)
          - frequency: Minimum count among non-background colors.
          - count: Either 1 or 2 unique special colors observed in examples.
    - boundaries:
        definition: The top-most row, bottom-most row, left-most column, and right-most column of the grid.
        properties:
          - type: [Top, Bottom, Left, Right]
          - relation_to_special_pixel: [closest, furthest]
  actions:
    - copy_grid: Input grid content is the base for the output.
    - identify_special_pixels: Find non-background colors, count frequencies, identify the minimum frequency color(s) and their locations.
    - calculate_distances: For each special pixel, calculate distance to Top, Bottom, Left, Right boundaries.
    - determine_modifications: Based on the number of special colors and their distances to boundaries (closest/furthest), decide which boundaries to modify and which color dictates internal pixel additions.
    - modify_boundary: Overwrite a specific boundary row or column with a special color.
    - add_internal_pixels: If applicable, add pixels of a special color every two steps in a line from the original special pixel towards its furthest boundary.
    - handle_intersection: If two boundaries are modified, set their intersection pixel to White (0).
  relationships:
    - frequency_determines_special: The count of non-background pixels determines which colors are "special".
    - location_determines_boundary: The location of special pixels relative to boundaries (closest/furthest distances) determines which boundaries are modified.
    - furthest_distance_triggers_internal_pixels: The special pixel associated with the overall furthest boundary distance potentially triggers internal pixel additions towards that boundary.
