## General Assessment

The initial code correctly identifies the central red '+' cross pattern and the concept of drawing lines radiating outwards. However, the implementation fails to color the pixels immediately adjacent to the cross correctly, specifically the diagonal neighbors which should be blue. Both examples show discrepancies exactly at these diagonally adjacent cells, which remain white (0) in the transformed output instead of becoming blue (1) as required by the expected output.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the line-drawing logic. The current `draw_line` function starts drawing *one step away* from the specified starting pixel in the given direction. The rule appears to require coloring the adjacent pixel *itself* first, and *then* continuing the line from the *next* pixel outwards. This modification should be applied to both diagonal (blue) and orthogonal (patterned) lines, ensuring the pixel immediately neighboring the cross is colored appropriately before the line continues.

## Metrics

Metrics will be gathered for each example to confirm grid properties and object locations.

    output: coordinates (row, col) of the center pixel.

  - action: copy_input
    description: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid (initially identical to input)

  - action: draw_lines
    description: Draw 8 lines radiating from the cross center towards the grid boundaries. Lines only overwrite white (0) pixels. The original red cross remains unchanged.
    details:
      - Lines start from the pixels immediately adjacent (orthogonally and diagonally) to the 3x3 bounding box of the cross.
      - Diagonal Lines:
        - Start Points: Pixels diagonally adjacent to the cross *center* (e.g., if center is C, start at NW, NE, SW, SE neighbors).
        - Color: Blue (1).
        - Direction: Extend diagonally outwards (NW, NE, SW, SE).
        - Rule: Color the starting white pixel blue, then continue drawing blue pixels in the same direction until the boundary is reached, overwriting only white pixels.
      - Orthogonal Lines:
        - Start Points: Pixels orthogonally adjacent to the cross *center* (e.g., if center is C, start at N, S, E, W neighbors).
        - Color Pattern: Repeating sequence Azure (8), Azure (8), Yellow (4).
        - Direction: Extend orthogonally outwards (N, S, E, W).
        - Rule: Color the starting white pixel with the first color of the pattern (Azure), then continue drawing pixels using the repeating pattern in the same direction until the boundary is reached, overwriting only white pixels. The pattern counter increments only when a white pixel is overwritten.

output_grid: The final grid after drawing all lines, preserving the original red cross.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Find Cross Center:** Locate the central pixel of the red '+' shape (the red pixel with four red neighbors). Let its coordinates be `(center_r, center_c)`. If no such cross exists, return the original input grid.
3.  **Draw Radiating Lines:** For each of the 8 directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest):
    a.  **Determine Start Point:** Identify the pixel immediately adjacent to the cross center in the current direction. Let this be `(start_r, start_c)`.
    b.  **Determine Color/Pattern:**
        *   If the direction is diagonal (NE, SE, SW, NW), the color is blue (1).
        *   If the direction is orthogonal (N, S, E, W), the color follows a repeating pattern: Azure (8), Azure (8), Yellow (4).
    c.  **Color Starting Pixel:** If the pixel at `(start_r, start_c)` in the output grid is white (0):
        *   For diagonal directions, change its color to blue (1).
        *   For orthogonal directions, change its color to the *first* color in the pattern (Azure, 8). Initialize a pattern counter `k=1`.
    d.  **Extend Line:** Move one step further in the current direction from `(start_r, start_c)`. Let the current position be `(r, c)`.
    e.  **Draw Loop:** While `(r, c)` is within the grid boundaries:
        i.  **Check Background:** If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid is white (0):
            *   For diagonal directions, change its color to blue (1).
            *   For orthogonal directions, increment the pattern counter `k`. Determine the color based on the pattern (`pattern[(k - 1) % 3]`) and change the pixel's color.
        ii. **Move:** Update `(r, c)` by taking another step in the current direction.
4.  **Return:** Output the modified grid.
