task_description: Identify a red '+' shape and draw lines radiating outwards from it to the grid boundaries, overwriting only white pixels.

grid_properties:
  - size: Variable height and width (observed 7x16 and 12x10).
  - background_color: white (0).

objects:
  - object: cross
    description: A 3x3 plus shape (+) composed of 5 red (2) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: plus sign (+)
      - size: 5 pixels (3x3 bounding box)
    location: Variable, but centered within the overall structure.
    identification: Find the single red pixel with 4 adjacent red neighbors.

actions:
  - action: find_center
    description: Locate the central pixel of the red cross.
    input: input_grid
    output: coordinates (row, col) of the center pixel.

  - action: copy_input
    description: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid (initially identical to input)

  - action: draw_lines
    description: Draw 8 lines radiating from the cross center towards the grid boundaries. Lines only overwrite white (0) pixels. The original red cross remains unchanged.
    details:
      - Lines start from the pixels immediately adjacent (orthogonally and diagonally) to the 3x3 bounding box of the cross.
      - Diagonal Lines:
        - Start Points: Pixels diagonally adjacent to the cross *center* (e.g., if center is C, start at NW, NE, SW, SE neighbors).
        - Color: Blue (1).
        - Direction: Extend diagonally outwards (NW, NE, SW, SE).
        - Rule: Color the starting white pixel blue, then continue drawing blue pixels in the same direction until the boundary is reached, overwriting only white pixels.
      - Orthogonal Lines:
        - Start Points: Pixels orthogonally adjacent to the cross *center* (e.g., if center is C, start at N, S, E, W neighbors).
        - Color Pattern: Repeating sequence Azure (8), Azure (8), Yellow (4).
        - Direction: Extend orthogonally outwards (N, S, E, W).
        - Rule: Color the starting white pixel with the first color of the pattern (Azure), then continue drawing pixels using the repeating pattern in the same direction until the boundary is reached, overwriting only white pixels. The pattern counter increments only when a white pixel is overwritten.

output_grid: The final grid after drawing all lines, preserving the original red cross.
