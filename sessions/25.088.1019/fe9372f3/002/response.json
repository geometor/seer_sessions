            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the central red '+' cross pattern and the concept of drawing lines radiating outwards. However, the implementation fails to color the pixels immediately adjacent to the cross correctly, specifically the diagonal neighbors which should be blue. Both examples show discrepancies exactly at these diagonally adjacent cells, which remain white (0) in the transformed output instead of becoming blue (1) as required by the expected output.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to adjust the line-drawing logic. The current `draw_line` function starts drawing *one step away* from the specified starting pixel in the given direction. The rule appears to require coloring the adjacent pixel *itself* first, and *then* continuing the line from the *next* pixel outwards. This modification should be applied to both diagonal (blue) and orthogonal (patterned) lines, ensuring the pixel immediately neighboring the cross is colored appropriately before the line continues.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics will be gathered for each example to confirm grid properties and object locations.\n\n"
