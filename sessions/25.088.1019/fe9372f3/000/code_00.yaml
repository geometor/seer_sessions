Task: Draw patterned lines radiating from a central cross object.

Input:
  - Grid: Contains a single object on a white background.
  - Object:
    - Shape: '+' (cross)
    - Color: Red (2)
    - Size: 5 pixels
    - Structure: Central pixel with 4 orthogonal neighbors.
  - Background: White (0)

Output:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Contains:
    - Original red cross object preserved in its input position.
    - New line patterns radiating outwards from the cross.

Transformation:
  - Identify: Locate the red cross object and its center pixel.
  - Define_Region: Determine the 3x3 bounding box centered on the cross.
  - Actions:
    - Draw_Diagonal_Lines:
      - Color: Blue (1)
      - Origin: Corners of the 3x3 bounding box.
      - Direction: Diagonally outwards towards the grid edges.
      - Condition: Only paint white (0) background pixels.
    - Draw_Orthogonal_Lines:
      - Colors: Azure (8) and Yellow (4)
      - Origin: Center pixels of the edges of the 3x3 bounding box (excluding corners).
      - Direction: Horizontally or vertically outwards towards the grid edges.
      - Pattern: Repeating sequence [Azure, Azure, Yellow] starting from the pixel adjacent to the bounding box.
      - Condition: Only paint white (0) background pixels.
  - Relationships:
    - The lines originate relative to the position of the input red cross.
    - The lines extend until they hit the grid boundary.
    - The pattern of azure/yellow depends on the distance from the cross along the orthogonal lines.
