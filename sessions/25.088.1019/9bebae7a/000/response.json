The output grid contains only yellow objects, derived from the input objects. The magenta object seems to act as an instruction or modifier for the yellow object. The shape of the magenta object ('L' shape or '+' shape) and its horizontal position relative to the yellow object determine the transformation. The background is white (color 0) and remains unchanged except where new yellow pixels are placed.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
