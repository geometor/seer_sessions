The shape of the magenta object ('L' or '+', identified by having 4 or 5 \n   pixels respectively based on the training examples).\n2. The horizontal position of the magenta object relative to the yellow object\n   ('left', 'right', or 'centered' based on bounding box overlap).\n\nThe specific transformation rules derived from the examples are:\n- If the Magenta object has 4 pixels ('L' shape) and is to the 'left' of the \n  Yellow object: The output grid contains only the shape of the Magenta object, \n  mirrored horizontally, colored Yellow, and positioned where the Yellow \n  object's bounding box started. The original Yellow object is removed.\n- If the Magenta object has 4 pixels ('L' shape) and is to the 'right' of the \n  Yellow object: The output grid contains the original Yellow object plus a \n  copy of it translated horizontally to the right by its bounding box width.\n- If the Magenta object has 5 pixels ('+' shape) and is to the 'right' of the \n  Yellow object: The output grid contains the original Yellow object plus a \n  copy of it translated vertically upwards by its bounding box height.\n- If the Magenta object is 'centered' horizontally relative to the Yellow object \n  (regardless of Magenta shape): The output grid contains the original Yellow \n  object plus a copy of it translated vertically downwards by its bounding \n  box height.\n\nThe magenta object is not present in the output grid. The background remains \nwhite (color 0). If the input configuration doesn't match any of these rules,\nan empty grid is returned.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- Helper Functions ---\n\ndef find_contiguous_object(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates {(r, c), ...} of the first contiguous object\n    of the specified color using BFS.
