"""
This module solves an ARC task where a yellow object (color 4) is transformed 
based on instructions provided by a magenta object (color 6).

The transformation depends on two factors:
1. The shape of the magenta object ('L' or '+', identified by having 4 or 5 
   pixels respectively based on the training examples).
2. The horizontal position of the magenta object relative to the yellow object
   ('left', 'right', or 'centered' based on bounding box overlap).

The specific transformation rules derived from the examples are:
- If the Magenta object has 4 pixels ('L' shape) and is to the 'left' of the 
  Yellow object: The output grid contains only the shape of the Magenta object, 
  mirrored horizontally, colored Yellow, and positioned where the Yellow 
  object's bounding box started. The original Yellow object is removed.
- If the Magenta object has 4 pixels ('L' shape) and is to the 'right' of the 
  Yellow object: The output grid contains the original Yellow object plus a 
  copy of it translated horizontally to the right by its bounding box width.
- If the Magenta object has 5 pixels ('+' shape) and is to the 'right' of the 
  Yellow object: The output grid contains the original Yellow object plus a 
  copy of it translated vertically upwards by its bounding box height.
- If the Magenta object is 'centered' horizontally relative to the Yellow object 
  (regardless of Magenta shape): The output grid contains the original Yellow 
  object plus a copy of it translated vertically downwards by its bounding 
  box height.

The magenta object is not present in the output grid. The background remains 
white (color 0). If the input configuration doesn't match any of these rules,
an empty grid is returned.
