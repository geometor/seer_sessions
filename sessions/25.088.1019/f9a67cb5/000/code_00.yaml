    properties: immutable
relationships:
  - relationship_type: adjacency
    connectivity: orthogonal (4-way)
    relevant_for: fill_spread
actions:
  - action_type: flood_fill
    start_condition: single red pixel location
    fill_area_condition: white pixels orthogonally connected to the start or already filled pixels
    boundary_condition: azure pixels or grid edges stop the fill
    result: filled white pixels change color to red
invariants:
  - azure pixel locations and color
  - location of the original red pixel (its color remains red)
  - white pixels not reachable by the flood fill remain white
