There is always exactly one red pixel in the input.\n    *   **Azure (8):** Acts as fixed barriers or walls. These pixels remain unchanged between input and output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the red color spreading from its initial position. This spread fills adjacent white areas.\n4.  **Boundaries:** The spread of the red color is stopped by the azure pixels and the edges of the grid. It does not cross or replace azure pixels.\n5.  **Connectivity:** The red color spreads to orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels. It appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" type operation.\n6.  **Initial State:** The input always contains static azure barriers, a background of white, and a single red starting pixel.\n7.  **Final State:** The output retains the azure barriers and the original red pixel. White pixels reachable from the initial red pixel via a path of white pixels (without crossing azure pixels or grid boundaries) are changed to red. White pixels not reachable remain white.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single red (2) pixel in the input grid. This is the starting point.\n3.  Create a list or queue for processing, initially containing only the starting point coordinates.\n4.  Create a set to keep track of visited coordinates to avoid redundant processing, initially containing the starting point.\n5.  While the processing list/queue is not empty:\n    a.  Remove a coordinate (r, c) from the list/queue.\n    b.  Examine the four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the current coordinate (r, c).\n    c.  For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n        i.   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii.  Check if the neighbor has not already been visited.\n        iii. Check if the color of the neighbor pixel in the *input* grid is white (0).\n        iv.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii) are true:\n            1.  Change the color of the pixel at (nr, nc) in the *output* grid to red (2).\n            2.  Add the neighbor coordinate (nr, nc) to the visited set.\n            3.  Add the neighbor coordinate (nr, nc) to the processing list/queue.\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
