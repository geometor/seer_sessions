Identify the single red pixel (color 2) in the input grid; this is the starting point for the transformation.\n2.  Perform a flood fill operation (using Breadth-First Search) starting from this red pixel.\n3.  The flood fill spreads only to orthogonally adjacent white pixels (color 0).\n4.  The flood fill is blocked by azure pixels (color 8), other non-white pixels, and the boundaries of the grid. These blocking pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  All white pixels reachable by the flood fill from the starting red pixel, by moving only through white pixels, change their color to red (2).\n6.  The original starting red pixel remains red.\n7.  White pixels that are not reachable by the flood fill remain white.\n8.  The final output grid contains the original non-white pixels (like azure), the original red pixel, the newly filled red pixels, and the remaining unreachable white pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# Helper function to find the starting pixel\ndef find_start_pixel(grid: np.ndarray, color: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates (row, col) of the first pixel with the specified color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color:\n                return (r, c)\n    return None # Return None if the color is not found\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a flood fill transformation starting from the red pixel (2),\n    filling adjacent white pixels (0) until blocked by azure pixels (8),\n    other non-white pixels, or grid boundaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    # The transformation will be applied to this copy.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Define the colors involved in the transformation\n    fill_color = 2       # Red: The color to fill with and the start pixel color\n    background_color = 0 # White: The color of pixels eligible to be filled\n    # Barrier colors (like azure=8) are handled implicitly by not being background_color\n\n    # 1.
