    description: Starting from the start_coordinate, change the color of orthogonally connected target_color pixels to fill_color. The fill cannot cross barrier_color pixels or grid boundaries.
output:
  grid: The input grid after the flood_fill action is applied. Pixels retain their original color unless they were white and reachable by the flood fill from the starting red pixel, in which case they become red.
