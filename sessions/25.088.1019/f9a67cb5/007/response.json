Then, it performs a flood fill starting from the Red pixel, changing only White (0) pixels within that specific component to Red (2). Azure pixels act as barriers defining the component boundaries. Pixels outside this component remain unchanged.\n\n1.  Find the coordinates of the single Red (2) pixel. If none is found, return the input grid unchanged.\n2.  Identify the connected component of pixels reachable from the Red start pixel by moving orthogonally through non-Azure (8) pixels. Store the coordinates of pixels in this component.\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) flood fill starting from the Red pixel:\n    a. Initialize a queue with the start coordinate.\n    b. Initialize a set `visited_fill` to track pixels visited during *this fill step*, adding the start coordinate.\n    c. While the queue is not empty:\n        i. Dequeue the current pixel coordinate `(r, c)`.\n        ii. Examine its orthogonal neighbours `(nr, nc)`.\n        iii. For a neighbour to be filled and added to the queue, it must satisfy all the following conditions:\n            - Be within the grid boundaries.\n            - Be part of the connected component identified in step 2.\n            - Have not been visited yet in *this fill step* (not in `visited_fill`).\n            - Be originally White (0) in the `input_grid`.\n        iv. If all conditions are met for neighbour `(nr, nc)`:\n            - Set `output_grid[nr, nc]` to Red (2).\n            - Add `(nr, nc)` to `visited_fill`.\n            - Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.\n5.
