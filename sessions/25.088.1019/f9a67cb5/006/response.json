            "text": "Okay, each input grid indeed has exactly one red (2) pixel. The description \"single red pixel\" holds.\n\nLet's reconsider the discrepancy between the BFS flood fill (fills all reachable white) and the expected output (leaves some reachable white areas unfilled).\n\n**What distinguishes the filled white areas from the unfilled white areas in the Expected Output?**\n\n*   **Example 1 Expected:** Red starts at (3,0). White at (0,0) is reachable via (1,0), (2,0). (0,0) remains white. White at (0,3) is reachable via (1,3) <- (2,3) <- ... many paths back to the start. (0,3) remains white. White at (0,8) is filled red. It's reachable via (1,8) <- (2,8) <- (3,8) <- (3,7) <- ... many paths. Why is (0,8) filled but (0,0) and (0,3) are not?\n*   Look at the azure (8) walls. They form channels or rooms.\n*   Maybe the rule is related to these \"rooms\"?\n*   Let's define a \"room\" as a connected component of white pixels bounded by non-white pixels or grid edges.\n*   **Example 1:** The red pixel (3,0) starts in a \"room\". Let's call it Room A. The pixels (0,0) and (0,3) are in a different \"room\" (Room B) separated by azure walls like the one at column 2. The pixel (0,8) is in *another* room (Room C) separated by the azure wall at column 5.\n*   Wait, the expected output fills Room A *and* Room C, but not Room B. Why?\n*   What connects Room A and Room C?\n    *   Room A contains (3,4). Room C contains (2,8). Path: (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (2,8). This path is entirely within white pixels in the input grid. It crosses the conceptual boundary between the rooms defined by the column 5 azure wall *where there's a gap*.\n*   What separates Room A and Room B?\n    *   Room A contains (2,1). Room B contains (2,3). Path: (2,1) -> ??? -> (2,3). Need to go around azure wall at col 2. Path: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) ??? No, (0,2) is 8. Path: (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3). This path seems valid and stays within white pixels.\n    *   So, Room A *is* connected to Room B via white pixels. My previous assumption about separation was wrong.\n*   Why is Room B not filled? Why is (0,0) not filled? Why is (0,3) not filled?\n\n**Let's rethink the core transformation.**\nIs it really a flood fill?\nWhat if the red pixel \"shoots rays\" or something? No, doesn't fit the filled shapes.\nWhat if the azure walls have a property we missed?\nWhat if only *some* white pixels adjacent to the current red area get filled?\n\nConsider the difference between the filled white pixels and unfilled white pixels.\n*   **Example 1:** Start (3,0). Filled: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ... (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8). Unfilled: (0,0), (1,0), (0,3), (1,3), (0,4), (1,4), (0,6), (1,6), (0,7), (1,7), (0,10), (1,10), (0,11), (1,11), (2,3), (2,4), ...\n\nLet's look at the *boundaries* between the final red areas and the remaining white areas in the `Expected Output`.\n*   **Example 1:** Boundary between red (2,8) and white (2,7). Boundary between red (4,4) and white (4,3). Boundary between red (2,1) and white (1,0). Boundary between red (4,1) and white (5,0).\n*   These boundaries occur *within* originally white areas. The flood fill should have crossed them.\n\n**Could the definition of \"adjacency\" be different?**\nThe code uses orthogonal adjacency `directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`. What if diagonal matters? Usually, ARC tasks stick to orthogonal unless specified. If diagonal neighbours were allowed, the fill would be even more extensive, which is the opposite of what's needed.\n\n**Could the \"barrier\" definition be different?**\n\"blocked by azure pixels (color 8), other non-white pixels, and the boundaries\". This seems comprehensive.\n\n**Is there a property of the *path*?**\nLike, the path from the start red pixel to the target white pixel must not pass \"too close\" to an azure pixel? Seems unlikely and hard to define.\n\n**Let's reconsider the \"rooms\" idea with a stricter definition.**\nMaybe the fill only propagates *out* of the initial room containing the red pixel, but doesn't fill *other* rooms it connects to?\n*   **Example 1:** Red at (3,0). Initial room includes (e.g.) (3,1). The fill propagates. It reaches the \"gap\" around row 3, col 5/6/7. It enters the \"room\" containing (3,8). It fills that room too. It reaches the gap near row 5, col 2/3/4. It enters the \"room\" containing (5,0). But it *doesn't* fill that room (pixels like (0,0) remain white).\n*   This is inconsistent.\n\n**What if the starting red pixel has a special role beyond just starting the fill?**\nWhat if only white cells that have a \"line of sight\" (orthogonal or diagonal) to the *original* red pixel, without being blocked by azure, get filled? No, that would produce lines/crosses, not filled areas.\n\n**Let's look at the shapes again.**\nInput: White areas separated by Azure walls. One Red pixel.\nOutput: Some white areas connected to the Red pixel are filled Red. Other connected white areas remain White. Azure walls remain Azure.\n\n**Could it be related to the *size* or *shape* of the white areas?**\nNo obvious pattern.\n\n**Could the *relative position* of the Red pixel matter?**\n*   Ex 1: Red on left edge. Fills parts to the right.\n*   Ex 2: Red near top middle. Fills areas below and around.\n*   Ex 3: Red on right edge. Fills parts to the left.\n\n**Let's focus on the boundary between filled-red and stays-white.**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input[1,0]=0, Output[1,0]=0. Adjacent to Input[2,0]=0 -> Output[2,0]=2.\n    *   Input[0,0]=0, Output[0,0]=0. Adjacent to Input[1,0]=0 -> Output[1,0]=0. And Input[0,1]=0 -> Output[0,1]=2.\n    *   Why does the fill stop at the boundary between (1,0) and (2,0)? Why does it stop between (0,0) and (0,1)?\n*   This looks like the fill propagates from the *initial* red pixel, but maybe only through white pixels that are *also* adjacent to the *growing red area*? No, that's just standard flood fill.\n\n**What if the azure walls (8) exert some \"influence\"?**\nMaybe white pixels adjacent to azure walls cannot be filled?\n*   Check Example 1 Expected Output:\n    *   Pixel (0,1) is filled red. It's adjacent to azure (0,2).\n    *   Pixel (3,1) is filled red. It's adjacent to azure (2,2) and (4,2) diagonally, and azure (3,2) orthogonally.\n    *   So, adjacency to azure doesn't prevent filling.\n\n**What if the fill rule depends on the *neighbors* of the white cell being considered?**\nStandard flood fill: If neighbor `(nr, nc)` is white and not visited, fill it.\nMaybe: If neighbor `(nr, nc)` is white, not visited, AND some *other* condition holds?\n\n*   What condition could distinguish `(1,0)` [stays white] from `(2,0)` [gets red]? Both are originally white. `(2,0)` is adjacent to the initial red `(3,0)`. `(1,0)` is adjacent to `(2,0)`.\n*   What condition could distinguish `(0,0)` [stays white] from `(0,1)` [gets red]? Both are originally white. `(0,1)` is adjacent to `(1,1)` [gets red]. `(0,0)` is adjacent to `(1,0)` [stays white] and `(0,1)` [gets red].\n\n**This is perplexing. The standard flood fill algorithm implemented seems to match the initial description but produces the wrong output. The expected output implies a more constrained fill.**\n\nLet's reconsider the relationship between the `Transformed Output` (fills everything reachable) and the `Expected Output`.\n*   The `Expected Output` seems to be a *subset* of the pixels filled by the `Transformed Output`.\n*   What rule could *remove* some red pixels after the full flood fill?\n*   Or, what rule could *prevent* the fill from entering certain areas?\n\n**Could it be that the fill only proceeds if the white pixel has *more than one* connection to the already filled area?** No, doesn't seem right.\n\n**Look at the failed pixels:**\n*   Ex 1: `Pixels Off: 74`. The code filled 74 white pixels that should have remained white.\n*   Ex 2: `Pixels Off: 97`.\n*   Ex 3: `Pixels Off: 79`.\n\n**Let's assume the flood fill part is fundamentally correct, but there's a missing constraint.** Where does the constraint apply?\n1.  Constraint on the starting pixel? (No, seems standard).\n2.  Constraint on which neighbours to explore? (Maybe).\n3.  Constraint on when to color a white neighbour red? (Maybe).\n4.  Post-processing step to remove some red? (Possible but less common).\n\n**Revisit Example 1:**\nStart: (3,0). Neighbors (2,0), (4,0). Both white. Fill them.\nFrom (2,0): Neighbors (1,0), (3,0), (2,1). (1,0) is white. (2,1) is white. Fill them?\nFrom (4,0): Neighbors (3,0), (5,0), (4,1). (5,0) is white. (4,1) is white. Fill them?\nQueue now contains (potential): (1,0), (2,1), (5,0), (4,1). All these are filled red in the expected output *except (1,0) and (5,0)*.\n\n*   Why are (1,0) and (5,0) not filled red?\n*   Input:\n    "

It's adjacent to (4,0) which was filled because it's adjacent to the start (3,0). Why doesn't (5,0) get filled?\n\n**Is it related to corners?**\nIf a white cell is in a \"concave\" corner relative to the fill direction? Doesn't seem consistent.\n\n**Let's look at the Azure (8) boundaries again.**\nMaybe the fill cannot happen if the white pixel is adjacent (orthogonally) to an Azure pixel *and* also adjacent (orthogonally) to an *unfilled* white pixel?\n\n*   Consider (1,0) [stays white]. Neighbours: (0,0)[white], (2,0)[gets red], (1,1)[gets red]. No adjacent azure.\n*   Consider (5,0) [stays white]. Neighbours: (4,0)[gets red], (6,0)[white], (5,1)[gets red]. No adjacent azure.\n*   This idea doesn't work.\n\n**What if the fill requires a certain \"thickness\" or number of connections?**\nFlood fill typically only requires one connection.\n\n**Could the *color* 'Azure' (8) be significant beyond being just a barrier?**\nDoes it modify the behaviour of adjacent white cells?\n\n**Final Hypothesis Attempt:**\nThe transformation seems to identify the connected component of non-Azure pixels that contains the initial Red pixel. Within this component, it performs a flood fill starting from the Red pixel, but *only filling White pixels*. Azure pixels act as barriers *and remain unchanged*. Other non-White, non-Azure pixels (if any existed) would also be barriers.\n\nThis still leads back to the original flood fill algorithm which failed. The failure suggests that the definition of \"reachable\" or the fill condition is different.\n\nLet's re-examine the boundary between red and white in the expected output.\n*   Ex 1: Boundary between Red(2,1) and White(1,0). Input[2,1]=0, Input[1,0]=0.\n*   Ex 1: Boundary between Red(4,1) and White(5,0). Input[4,1]=0, Input[5,0]=0.\n*   Ex 1: Boundary between Red(5,4) and White(6,4). Input[5,4]=0, Input[6,4]=0.\n*   Ex 1: Boundary between Red(4,4) and White(4,3). Input[4,4]=0, Input[4,3]=0.\n\nWhat is systematically different about the white pixel that stays white versus the adjacent red pixel (that was originally white)?\n\nCould it be related to the number of *non-barrier* neighbours?\n*   (1,0) [stays white]: Neighbours (0,0)[W], (2,0)[R], (1,1)[R]. 3 non-barrier neighbours (originally white).\n*   (2,0) [gets red]: Neighbours (1,0)[W], (3,0)[Start R], (2,1)[R]. 3 non-barrier neighbours (originally white or start).\n*   (5,0) [stays white]: Neighbours (4,0)[R], (6,0)[W], (5,1)[R]. 3 non-barrier neighbours (originally white).\n*   (4,0) [gets red]: Neighbours (3,0)[Start R], (5,0)[W], (4,1)[R]. 3 non-barrier neighbours (originally white or start).\n*   (4,3) [stays white]: Neighbours (3,3)[W], (5,3)[W], (4,2)=8, (4,4)[R]. 3 non-barrier neighbours.\n*   (4,4) [gets red]: Neighbours (3,4)[R], (5,4)[R], (4,3)[W], (4,5)[R]. 4 non-barrier neighbours.\n\nThis looks potentially promising! Maybe a white cell `(nr, nc)` adjacent to a filled cell `(r, c)` only gets filled if `(nr, nc)` has more than X non-barrier neighbours? Or specifically, more than Y neighbours that are *already* red or the starting red?\n\nLet's refine this: A white pixel `N` adjacent to a newly filled red pixel `P` gets filled *only if* `N` is adjacent to at least one *other* pixel that is either the original start pixel or has already been filled red.\n\nLet's test this rule on Example 1:\n1.  Start: `S = (3,0)` (Red)\n2.  Neighbours of S: `(2,0)` [W], `(4,0)` [W].\n3.  Consider `N = (2,0)`. Adjacent to `S`. Are any *other* neighbours of `N` already red? Neighbours of `N` are `(1,0)` [W], `S`, `(2,1)` [W]. Only `S` is red. Rule fails? Needs >= 1 *other* red neighbour? Let's try >= 1 red neighbour (including the one P that triggered the check).\n    *   Test Rule 1: Fill `N` (white) adjacent to `P` (red) if `N` has at least 1 red neighbour (which will always be `P`). This is just normal flood fill. Fails.\n    *   Test Rule 2: Fill `N` (white) adjacent to `P` (red) if `N` has at least **2** neighbours that are already red (including `P`).\n        *   Start S=(3,0).\n        *   Neighbours (2,0)[W], (4,0)[W].\n        *   Consider N=(2,0). Adjacent to S (red). Other neighbours (1,0)[W], (2,1)[W]. Only 1 red neighbour (S). Don't fill (2,0).\n        *   Consider N=(4,0). Adjacent to S (red). Other neighbours (5,0)[W], (4,1)[W]. Only 1 red neighbour (S). Don't fill (4,0).\n        *   This rule fills nothing! Fails.\n\nOkay, maybe the condition relates to the *source* pixel `P` from which we are expanding.\n*   Test Rule 3: When expanding from `P` (red) to `N` (white), fill `N` *only if* `P` itself has at least 2 red neighbours?\n    *   Start S=(3,0). Neighbours of S are (2,0)[W], (4,0)[W]. S has 0 red neighbours. Don't fill anything. Fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the connectivity and the Azure walls (8).\nThe Azure walls define regions. Maybe the fill behaves differently based on whether a white pixel is adjacent to a wall?\n\nLet's go back to the simplest description: Flood fill from Red(2), through White(0), blocked by Azure(8) and others. The code implements this. The `Transformed Output` shows the result of this. The `Expected Output` is different.\n\n**What if the `Expected Output` is the result of *two* processes?**\n1. Process A: Flood fill (like the code does).\n2. Process B: Remove some of the newly filled red pixels based on a condition.\n\nWhat condition could remove red pixels?\n*   Remove red pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel? No, that would erode everything.\n*   Remove red pixels that are only adjacent to 1 other red pixel (i.e., dead ends)?\n    *   Let's try on the `Transformed Output` of Ex 1.\n    *   Pixel (0,0)[R]. Neighbours: (1,0)[R], (0,1)[R]. Has 2 red neighbours. Keep.\n    *   Pixel (0,3)[R]. Neighbours: (1,3)[R], (0,4)[R]. Has 2 red neighbours. Keep.\n    *   Pixel (1,0)[R]. Neighbours: (0,0)[R], (2,0)[R], (1,1)[R]. Has 3 red neighbours. Keep.\n    *   This doesn't seem to remove the correct pixels to match the `Expected Output`.\n\n**Is it possible the interpretation of \"barrier\" is wrong?**\nDoes Azure block fill, but maybe White cells adjacent to Azure behave differently?\n\nWhat if White cells adjacent to Azure can *receive* fill, but cannot *propagate* fill?\n*   Let's trace Ex 1 with this rule.\n    *   Start S=(3,0). Fill neighbours (2,0), (4,0). Mark them Red. Add to queue.\n    *   Pop (2,0). Neighbours: (1,0)[W], S[R], (2,1)[W].\n        *   Consider N=(1,0). Is (1,0) adjacent to Azure? No. Fill (1,0). Add to queue.\n        *   Consider N=(2,1). Is (2,1) adjacent to Azure? Yes, at (2,2). Fill (2,1). Add to queue? *Rule modification*: Since (2,1) is adjacent to Azure, fill it but DON'T add it to the queue (cannot propagate).\n    *   Pop (4,0). Neighbours: S[R], (5,0)[W], (4,1)[W].\n        *   Consider N=(5,0). Adjacent to Azure? No. Fill (5,0). Add to queue.\n        *   Consider N=(4,1). Adjacent to Azure? Yes, at (4,2). Fill (4,1). Don't add to queue.\n    *   Pop (1,0) (if added). Neighbours: (0,0)[W], (2,0)[R], (1,1)[W].\n        *   Consider N=(0,0). Adjacent to Azure? No. Fill (0,0). Add to queue.\n        *   Consider N=(1,1). Adjacent to Azure? Yes, at (1,2). Fill (1,1). Don't add to queue.\n    *   ... This seems complicated and still fills pixels like (0,0) which should remain white.\n\n**Let's revisit the simplest case: The code's flood fill *is* the transformation, but my understanding of the BFS implementation or state is wrong.**\n"

Identify the connected component of non-Azure pixels containing the Red(2) start pixel.\n        2. Within this component, perform a flood fill starting from the Red(2) pixel, changing only White(0) pixels to Red(2). Other pixels (like original Red or any other colors within the component, though none seem to exist in examples) remain unchanged. Pixels outside this component (including Azure barriers and white pixels in other components) remain unchanged.\n\n    - Let's test this on Example 1:\n        - Component containing (3,0) includes (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), ..., (3,4), ..., (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), ... and also (0,3), (0,4), ... (I need to be more rigorous here).\n        - Let's find the connected component containing (3,0) using non-Azure as traversable.\n"
