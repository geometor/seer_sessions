Additionally, new red (2) pixels appear in the columns corresponding to the original red pixels in the last row.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to involve \"projecting\" or \"painting\" upwards from the red pixels located in the last row of the input. For each red pixel in the last row, a vertical line of red pixels is drawn upwards in the output grid. This line consists of the original red pixel and any white (0) pixels directly above it.\n6.  **Blocking Mechanism:** The upward painting process in a column stops immediately *below* the first non-white pixel encountered in that column when tracing upwards from the bottom row's red pixel. In these examples, the blocking pixels are always gray (5). If there are no non-white pixels above the source red pixel in a column, the red paint extends all the way to the top row.\n7.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels that were originally gray (5) remain gray (5). White (0) pixels that are not on the upward path from a source red pixel, or are located above a blocking gray pixel in an affected column, remain white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
