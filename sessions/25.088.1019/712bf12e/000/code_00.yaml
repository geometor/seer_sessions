grid_properties:
  - dimension_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Represents empty space, can be painted over.
  - type: obstacle
    color: gray (5)
    role: Blocks the upward painting process. Persists from input to output.
    location: Scattered throughout the grid.
  - type: source
    color: red (2)
    role: Initiates the painting process upwards in its column. Persists from input to output.
    location: Found only in the last row of the input grid.
  - type: paint
    color: red (2)
    role: Result of the painting process initiated by a source.
    location: Appears in the output grid in columns containing a source, occupying cells that were originally white background, located between the source and the first obstacle above it (or the top edge).

actions:
  - name: paint_upwards
    actor: source (red pixel in last row)
    target: background (white pixels directly above the source)
    effect: Changes target background pixels to paint (red).
    condition: Stops when an obstacle (gray pixel) or the grid top edge is reached (just below the obstacle).

relationships:
  - type: blocking
    subject: obstacle (gray pixel)
    object: paint_upwards action
    description: An obstacle pixel prevents the paint_upwards action from continuing further up in the same column.
  - type: column_containment
    subject: source (red pixel in last row)
    object: paint_upwards action
    description: The paint_upwards action only occurs within the same column as the source pixel.
