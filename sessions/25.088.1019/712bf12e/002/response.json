            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core mechanic of painting upwards with red (2) over white (0) pixels until an obstacle (non-white) is encountered. However, it incorrectly assumed that this process only originates from red pixels located in the *last row* of the input grid. The results clearly show that *all* red pixels present in the initial input grid serve as starting points for this upward painting process in their respective columns. The task involves modifying the output grid based on these starting points and obstacles found in the input grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the code to iterate through *all* cells of the input grid, not just the last row.\n2.  Identify *all* red (2) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  For each identified red pixel, initiate the upward painting process in its column, starting from the cell directly above it.\n4.  The painting should modify the *output* grid, using the *input* grid to check for obstacles (non-white pixels).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's gather coordinates for initial red pixels and obstacles (non-white, non-red) for each example.\n\n"
