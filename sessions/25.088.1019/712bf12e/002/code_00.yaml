task_description: Fill upwards from red pixels.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9
  value_meaning: color
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      location: (row, column)
  - type: source_pixel
    definition: A pixel with red color (value 2) in the input grid.
  - type: empty_pixel
    definition: A pixel with white color (value 0).
  - type: obstacle_pixel
    definition: Any pixel that is not white (value > 0). Note that red pixels (2) also act as obstacles for painting originating *below* them.
actions:
  - name: paint_upwards
    actor: system
    target: empty_pixels (value 0)
    trigger: presence of a source_pixel (value 2) in the input grid
    effect: Changes the color of empty_pixels (0) to red (2) in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Painting occurs only in the same column as the source_pixel.
      - Painting starts from the row directly above the source_pixel and proceeds upwards (decreasing row index).
      - Painting stops in a column upon encountering an obstacle_pixel (any non-white pixel) in the input grid for that column, or upon reaching the top row (row 0).
      - Source_pixels retain their red color in the output grid.
      - Obstacle_pixels retain their original color in the output grid.
      - Empty_pixels not painted red retain their white color.
