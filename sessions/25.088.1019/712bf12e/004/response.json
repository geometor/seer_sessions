            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Assessment:** The previous code failed because it misinterpreted the painting rule. It started painting one cell *above* the source red pixel, whereas the examples clearly show the painting effect starts *from* the source red pixel's location and extends upwards. The code also correctly identified that only white pixels are painted and that non-white pixels act as blockers, but the incorrect starting position caused the significant discrepancies. The `transformed_output` presented in the initial prompt was inconsistent with the provided code description; I have regenerated the `transformed_output` based on the code's logic for accurate comparison in the metrics above (`corrected_transformed_output`).\n2.  **Strategy:** The strategy is to correct the painting logic. The transformation should iterate through each red pixel in the input grid. For each red pixel at `(r, c)`, it should iterate upwards from `r` to `0`. At each position `(i, c)` during this upward scan (where `i` goes from `r` down to `0`), check the color of the pixel `(i, c)` in the *input* grid. If it is white (0), change the corresponding pixel `(i, c)` in the *output* grid to red (2). If it is non-white (including the original source red pixel), stop the upward painting process for that specific source pixel `(r, c)`. Note: An output grid initialized as a copy of the input already handles the source pixel remaining red. The core change is to start the *check* for painting from the row *above* the source pixel but ensure the loop continues upwards correctly, painting only white cells found in the input grid.\n\n**Metrics Analysis:**\n\n*   **Shapes:** All input, expected output, and (corrected) transformed output grids maintain the same dimensions for each example, confirming no resizing is needed.\n*   **Color Palette:** The colors used remain consistent (0, 2, 5). No new colors are introduced. The number of gray (5) pixels remains constant between input and output in all examples, confirming they act only as blockers and are never painted over.\n*   **Color Counts (Red - 2):**\n    *   Example 1: Input=3, Expected=36, Transformed=8. Incorrectly low.\n    *   Example 2: Input=3, Expected=37, Transformed=17. Incorrectly low.\n    *   Example 3: Input=3, Expected=46, Transformed=8. Incorrectly low.\n*   **Color Counts (White - 0):** The number of white pixels decreases significantly from input to expected output, corresponding to the increase in red pixels. The transformed outputs have far too many white pixels remaining.\n\nThis confirms the primary issue: the painting process is incomplete due to the incorrect starting logic and potentially how the blocking is handled relative to the start. The refined logic should address this by correctly painting white cells above the source red cell until a non-white cell (in the input grid) blocks it.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Decrement `current_row` by 1 to move to the next cell upwards.\n4.  After processing all source pixels, return the final output grid.**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempted to implement a rule where red pixels cause an upward painting effect, changing white pixels to red. However, the execution results show that the code consistently fails to produce the expected output across all three examples.\n\n*   **Assessment:** The core issue lies in the implementation of the \"painting\" logic. The previous code started painting from the cell *above* the initiating red pixel. Comparing the `expected_output` with the `input`, it's evident that the painting effect should start *from* the row of the red pixel itself and extend upwards. Specifically, any white (0) pixel *above* a red (2) pixel in the same column becomes red (2) in the output, unless the path is blocked by a non-white pixel (like gray(5) or another red(2)) in the *input* grid. The original red pixel remains red. The number of red pixels in the transformed output is significantly lower than expected, indicating the painting stops prematurely or doesn't cover the correct area. The gray pixels (5) act as static obstacles, never changing color and blocking the upward paint.\n*   **Strategy:** The correction involves modifying the painting process:\n    1.  Identify all red pixels (sources) in the input.\n    2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.\n    3.  For each source red pixel at `(r_source, c)`:\n        *   Iterate upwards from the row directly *above* the source pixel (`r = r_source - 1`) towards the top edge (`r = 0`).\n        *   At each row `r` in this upward scan, check the pixel `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.\n        *   If `input_grid[r, c]` is white (0), set `output_grid[r, c]` to red (2).\n        *   If `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* white (i.e., it's an obstacle: gray, red, or any other non-white color), stop the upward painting for this specific source pixel `(r_source, c)` and move to the next source pixel.\n        *   If the top edge (`r = 0`) is reached and painted, the process for this source pixel also stops.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
