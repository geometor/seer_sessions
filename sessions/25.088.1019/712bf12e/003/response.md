```python
"""
Identifies all red (2) pixels in the input grid. 
For each identified red pixel, it 'paints' upwards in the same column, starting from the cell directly above the red pixel. 
Painting changes white (0) pixels in the output grid to red (2).
This painting process stops for a given column (initiated by a specific red pixel) when a non-white pixel (value > 0) is encountered in the input grid in that column, or when the top edge of the grid (row 0) is reached and painted.
Pixels that are not red sources and are not painted remain their original color. Obstacle pixels block the painting process but retain their original color.
