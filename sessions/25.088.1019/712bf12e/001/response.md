"""
Identifies red (2) pixels in the last row of the input grid. 
For each such red pixel, it 'paints' upwards in the same column, changing white (0) pixels to red (2). 
This painting stops when a non-white pixel (e.g., gray 5) is encountered in the column, or when the top edge of the grid is reached. 
All other pixels retain their original colors.
