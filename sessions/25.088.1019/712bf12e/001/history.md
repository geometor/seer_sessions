Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same dimensions in each example.
2.  **Colors:** The grids contain white (0) pixels serving as the background, gray (5) pixels forming scattered patterns (often appearing as single pixels or small L-shapes/rectangles), and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Input State:** In the input grids, red (2) pixels appear *only* in the bottom-most row.
4.  **Output State:** In the output grids, the original gray (5) pixels and the original red (2) pixels from the input's last row remain in their positions. Additionally, new red (2) pixels appear in the columns corresponding to the original red pixels in the last row.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to involve "projecting" or "painting" upwards from the red pixels located in the last row of the input. For each red pixel in the last row, a vertical line of red pixels is drawn upwards in the output grid. This line consists of the original red pixel and any white (0) pixels directly above it.
6.  **Blocking Mechanism:** The upward painting process in a column stops immediately *below* the first non-white pixel encountered in that column when tracing upwards from the bottom row's red pixel. In these examples, the blocking pixels are always gray (5). If there are no non-white pixels above the source red pixel in a column, the red paint extends all the way to the top row.
7.  **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels that were originally gray (5) remain gray (5). White (0) pixels that are not on the upward path from a source red pixel, or are located above a blocking gray pixel in an affected column, remain white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  - dimension_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Represents empty space, can be painted over.
  - type: obstacle
    color: gray (5)
    role: Blocks the upward painting process. Persists from input to output.
    location: Scattered throughout the grid.
  - type: source
    color: red (2)
    role: Initiates the painting process upwards in its column. Persists from input to output.
    location: Found only in the last row of the input grid.
  - type: paint
    color: red (2)
    role: Result of the painting process initiated by a source.
    location: Appears in the output grid in columns containing a source, occupying cells that were originally white background, located between the source and the first obstacle above it (or the top edge).

actions:
  - name: paint_upwards
    actor: source (red pixel in last row)
    target: background (white pixels directly above the source)
    effect: Changes target background pixels to paint (red).
    condition: Stops when an obstacle (gray pixel) or the grid top edge is reached (just below the obstacle).

relationships:
  - type: blocking
    subject: obstacle (gray pixel)
    object: paint_upwards action
    description: An obstacle pixel prevents the paint_upwards action from continuing further up in the same column.
  - type: column_containment
    subject: source (red pixel in last row)
    object: paint_upwards action
    description: The paint_upwards action only occurs within the same column as the source pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Identify the row index of the last row of the grid.
3.  Iterate through each column of the input grid.
4.  Check the color of the pixel in the last row of the current column.
5.  If the pixel in the last row is red (2):
    a.  Start checking pixels upwards from the second-to-last row in the same column.
    b.  For each pixel checked:
        i.  If the pixel is white (0), change its color to red (2) in the output grid copy.
        ii. If the pixel is *not* white (0) (e.g., gray (5)), stop checking upwards for this column.
        iii. If the top row (row 0) is reached and it's white, change it to red (2) and stop checking upwards for this column.
6.  If the pixel in the last row is *not* red (2), make no changes to that column (other than copying the original values).
7.  The modified grid copy is the final output grid.
