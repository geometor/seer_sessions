**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids consist of a white (0) background with scattered blue (1) pixels. The output grids are largely the same as the inputs, but with the addition of azure (8) pixels. These azure pixels appear to form straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, connecting certain pairs of the original blue pixels. The original blue pixels that serve as endpoints for these lines remain blue in the output. Not all blue pixels are connected; some remain isolated if they don't have a suitable partner.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - color: 0
    name: white
    role: background
  - color: 1
    name: blue
    role: object_marker, endpoint
  - color: 8
    name: azure
    role: connector, path_filler
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      location: scattered coordinates
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pairs of blue pixels can be aligned horizontally or vertically.
  - type: path
    description: The path between aligned blue pixels can consist entirely of white pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify_pairs
    actor: system
    input: input grid
    output: pairs of blue pixels (1) located on the same row or same column.
  - action: check_path
    actor: system
    input: identified pair of blue pixels, input grid
    condition: All pixels strictly between the pair must be white (0).
    output: boolean (valid path or not)
  - action: fill_path
    actor: system
    input: valid pair of blue pixels, input grid coordinates
    output: modified grid where intermediate white pixels (0) on the path are changed to azure (8).
    effect: Creates azure lines connecting blue endpoints.
transformation:
  goal: Connect aligned pairs of blue pixels with azure lines if the path between them is clear (only white).
  preserves:
    - Original blue pixels (1).
    - White pixels (0) not on a connecting path.
  modifies:
    - White pixels (0) on a valid path between a pair of blue pixels are changed to azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all locations of blue pixels (color 1) in the input grid.
3.  Iterate through all unique pairs of these blue pixel locations.
4.  For each pair:
    a.  Check if the two pixels are in the same row (horizontal alignment).
    b.  If they are in the same row, check if all pixels *strictly between* them in that row are white (color 0) in the *input* grid.
    c.  If the path between them is clear (all white), change the color of those intermediate pixels to azure (color 8) in the *output* grid.
    d.  Check if the two pixels are in the same column (vertical alignment).
    e.  If they are in the same column, check if all pixels *strictly between* them in that column are white (color 0) in the *input* grid.
    f.  If the path between them is clear (all white), change the color of those intermediate pixels to azure (color 8) in the *output* grid.
5.  Return the final output grid.
