The output grids are largely the same as the inputs, but with the addition of azure (8) pixels. These azure pixels appear to form straight lines, either horizontally or vertically, connecting certain pairs of the original blue pixels. The original blue pixels that serve as endpoints for these lines remain blue in the output. Not all blue pixels are connected; some remain isolated if they don't have a suitable partner.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
