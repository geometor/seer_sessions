objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      location: scattered coordinates
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pairs of blue pixels can be aligned horizontally or vertically.
  - type: path
    description: The path between aligned blue pixels can consist entirely of white pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify_pairs
    actor: system
    input: input grid
    output: pairs of blue pixels (1) located on the same row or same column.
  - action: check_path
    actor: system
    input: identified pair of blue pixels, input grid
    condition: All pixels strictly between the pair must be white (0).
    output: boolean (valid path or not)
  - action: fill_path
    actor: system
    input: valid pair of blue pixels, input grid coordinates
    output: modified grid where intermediate white pixels (0) on the path are changed to azure (8).
    effect: Creates azure lines connecting blue endpoints.
transformation:
  goal: Connect aligned pairs of blue pixels with azure lines if the path between them is clear (only white).
  preserves:
    - Original blue pixels (1).
    - White pixels (0) not on a connecting path.
  modifies:
    - White pixels (0) on a valid path between a pair of blue pixels are changed to azure (8).
