- task: Scale grid based on unique non-white colors and replace white pixels with a pattern.
- input: 2D grid of integers (colors).
- output: 2D grid of integers (colors).
- objects:
    - pixels: Individual cells in the grid with a color value.
    - colors: Integers 0-9. White (0) is treated specially.
    - grid: The 2D array structure.
    - blocks: S x S areas in the output grid corresponding to single input pixels.
- properties:
    - scale_factor (S): The count of unique non-white (non-zero) colors in the input grid. If no non-white colors exist, S=1.
    - input_dimensions: (height_in, width_in).
    - output_dimensions: (height_in * S, width_in * S).
    - parity_of_S: Whether S is odd or even. This determines the diagonal type for white pixel replacement.
- actions:
    - count_unique_colors: Determine S from the input grid (excluding white).
    - scale_grid: Create an output grid with dimensions scaled by S.
    - replace_pixels: Iterate through each input pixel (r_in, c_in) with value V.
        - calculate_block_coords: Determine the top-left corner (r_out_start, c_out_start) = (r_in * S, c_in * S) of the corresponding S x S block in the output.
        - if V is non-white:
            - fill_block: Set all pixels in the output block [r_out_start:r_out_start+S, c_out_start:c_out_start+S] to V.
        - if V is white (0):
            - fill_block_white: Set all pixels in the output block to white (0).
            - draw_diagonal:
                - if S is odd: Draw a single red (2) anti-diagonal across the S x S block (pixels where local_row + local_col == S - 1).
                - if S is even: Draw a single red (2) main diagonal across the S x S block (pixels where local_row == local_col).
- observations_from_failed_code:
    - Scale factor calculation is correct.
    - Output grid dimensions are correct.
    - Non-white pixel expansion is correct.
    - White pixel expansion inserts *too many* red pixels. It seems to apply the diagonal rule within each cell of the expanded block, instead of drawing one diagonal across the entire block.
    - The check `expected_red_pixels_match_pattern: False` confirms the expected red pixels do *not* align with the pattern generated by the current faulty code logic, further pointing to the error in diagonal generation. The number of red pixels in the transformed output is `S` times the expected number for each white block.
