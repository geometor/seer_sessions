Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of blue (1) pixels.\n    3.  For each blue object identified:\n        a.  Determine if the object forms a hollow square shape, meaning it completely encloses a single contiguous area of non-blue pixels.\n        b.  Verify that the enclosed area (the hole) consists entirely of the background color, azure (8).\n        c.  If the object is a hollow blue square with an azure hole:\n            i.  Find the bounding box of the azure hole.\n            ii. Calculate the row index of the horizontal center line of the hole's bounding box (e.g., `center_row = (min_row + max_row) // 2`).\n            iii. Calculate the column index of the vertical center line of the hole's bounding box (e.g., `center_col = (min_col + max_col) // 2`).\n            iv. Iterate through each cell in the `center_row` of the grid. If the cell in the *input* grid at `(center_row, col)` contains the background color (azure, 8), change the color of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to magenta (6).\n            v.  Iterate through each cell in the `center_col` of the grid. If the cell in the *input* grid at `(row, center_col)` contains the background color (azure, 8), change the color of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to magenta (6).\n    4.
