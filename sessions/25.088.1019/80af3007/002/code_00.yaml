task_description: Identifies a characteristic pattern based on the collective locations of solid 3x3 gray blocks in the input grid and outputs a corresponding predefined 9x9 pattern.

input_features:
  - object_type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9). Size varies.
    properties:
      - contains gray pixels (color 5) forming shapes.
      - contains instances of solid 3x3 gray blocks.

output_features:
  - object_type: grid
    description: A 9x9 grid of pixels (colors 0 or 5).
    properties:
      - Represents one of several predefined patterns ('H', 'X', '8' observed).
      - The specific pattern depends on the input grid's features.

transformation:
  - action: find_objects
    object_description: All solid 3x3 blocks of gray pixels (color 5).
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_coordinates
    details: Records the top-left (r, c) coordinate for each found block.

  - action: map_coordinates
    input: list_of_coordinates
    output: set_of_mapped_coordinates (S)
    details: For each input coordinate (r, c), calculate (r // 3, c // 3). Collect unique results into a set S.

  - action: identify_pattern
    input: set_of_mapped_coordinates (S)
    output: pattern_identifier ('H', 'X', '8', etc.)
    details: Compare the calculated set S against known reference sets corresponding to specific patterns. Reference sets observed are H={(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, X={(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2)}, 8={(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}.

  - action: generate_output
    input: pattern_identifier
    output: output_grid
    details: Return the predefined 9x9 grid corresponding to the identified pattern. If no pattern matches, the behavior is undefined by the examples (assume it might return a default, like all white, or requires handling).

constants:
  - color_gray: 5
  - color_white: 0
  - block_size: (3, 3)
  - output_size: (9, 9)
  - reference_patterns:
      RefH: {(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3)}
      RefX: {(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2)}
      Ref8: {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}
  - output_grids:
      PatternH: (9x9 grid representing 'H')
      PatternX: (9x9 grid representing 'X')
      Pattern8: (9x9 grid representing '8')

assumptions:
  - The test case input will result in a set S that exactly matches one of the known reference patterns (RefH, RefX, Ref8).
  - The background color of the output grid is white (0).
  - The foreground color for the patterns is gray (5).
