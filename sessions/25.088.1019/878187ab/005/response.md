"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid with a fixed height (16) and width matching the input.
The output grid is initially filled with the background color (orange/7).
If the input grid contains any pixels other than the background color, a specific predefined pattern is placed onto the output grid starting at row 11, column 0.
The pattern selected depends on the maximum color value found among the non-background pixels in the input grid.
Known patterns exist for max color 8 (a 5x10 pattern using red/2 and yellow/4) and max color 5 (a 5x7 pattern using red/2 and yellow/4).
If the input grid contains only the background color, the output grid remains entirely filled with the background color.
