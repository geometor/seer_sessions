task_context:
  description: Transforms an input grid based on the presence and maximum value of non-background pixels, placing a corresponding pattern onto a fixed-height output grid.
  background_color: 7 (Orange)
  output_height: 16
input_grid:
  properties:
    - variable_height
    - variable_width
    - may contain pixels other than the background color
output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 16 (fixed)
    - width: same as input grid width
    - background: initially filled with background_color (7)
transformation:
  condition: Check if the input grid contains any pixels with a color different from the background_color (7).
  action_if_true:
    - Determine the maximum color value among all non-background pixels in the input grid.
    - Select a predefined pattern associated with this maximum color value.
      - Known patterns:
        - max_color 8 (Azure): A specific 5x10 pattern using Red (2) and Yellow (4).
        - max_color 5 (Gray): A specific 5x7 pattern using Red (2) and Yellow (4).
    - Place the selected pattern onto the output grid.
    - Placement_location: Starts at row index 11, column index 0.
  action_if_false:
    - The output grid remains entirely filled with the background_color (7).
