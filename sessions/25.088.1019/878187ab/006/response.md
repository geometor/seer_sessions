## General Assessment

The initial code correctly identified the core logic for Example 1: detecting non-background pixels, finding the maximum color value among them, and placing a corresponding predefined pattern at a specific location (row 11, col 0) in an output grid filled with the background color (orange/7).

However, the code failed on Example 2 because it assumed the output grid's width should match the input grid's width. The results show that Example 2's input width is 15, but the expected output width is 16. Example 1 had an input width of 16 and an output width of 16. This suggests the output grid size is fixed at 16x16, regardless of the input size.

The strategy is to:
1. Confirm the fixed output size (16x16) by examining both examples.
2. Verify the background color (orange/7).
3. Confirm the condition for placing a pattern (presence of any non-background color in the input).
4. Confirm the method for selecting the pattern (maximum value of non-background colors in the input).
5. Confirm the placement location (starting at row 11, column 0).
6. Update the natural language program to reflect the fixed 16x16 output size.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid with a fixed size of 16 rows and 16 columns.
2.  Fill the entire output grid with the background color, which is orange (7).
3.  Examine the input grid to see if it contains any pixels with a color other than the background color (orange/7).
4.  **If** the input grid contains pixels other than the background color:
    a.  Identify all non-background pixels.
    b.  Find the maximum color value among these non-background pixels.
    c.  Select a predefined pattern based on this maximum color value:
        *   If the maximum color is 8 (azure), use the 5x10 red (2) and yellow (4) pattern.
        *   If the maximum color is 5 (gray), use the 5x7 red (2) and yellow (4) pattern.
        *   (Assume other patterns might exist for other maximum colors if more examples were provided).
    d.  Place the selected pattern onto the output grid, starting with the top-left corner of the pattern at row index 11 and column index 0. The pattern overwrites the background color in that area.
5.  **Else** (if the input grid *only* contains the background color):
    a.  Make no changes to the output grid; it remains entirely filled with the background color.
6.  Return the final output grid.
