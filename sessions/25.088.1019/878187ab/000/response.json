Copy this 5x10 pattern onto the output grid, placing its top-left corner at row index 11, column index 0.

If there are no non-background pixels in the input grid (assumption based on absence of counter-examples): The behavior is undefined by the examples, but a likely outcome would be to either return the input grid unchanged or follow steps 3a-3c (create a 16xW grid filled with the background color). *Focus on the defined case where non-background pixels exist.*\n5.
