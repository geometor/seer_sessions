- grid_properties:
    - background_color: 7  # orange
    - output_height: 16
    - output_width: matches_input_width
- objects:
    - type: scattered_pixels
      colors: [8, 6, 4, 5] # azure, magenta, yellow, gray (colors other than background)
      location: various positions in the input grid
      role: trigger

      location: fixed position in the output grid (top-left at row 11, col 0)
      role: output_element
- actions:
    - identify_background_color: find the most frequent color (orange/7)
    - detect_trigger: check if any non-background pixels exist in the input grid
    - create_output_grid: initialize a grid with 16 rows and the same width as the input, filled with the background color
    - place_pattern: if the trigger condition is met, overwrite the relevant section (rows 11-15, cols 0-9) of the output grid with the fixed pattern
- relationships:
    - trigger_condition: the transformation (creating the output grid with the pattern) occurs if, and only if, at least one non-background pixel exists in the input. (Based on provided examples).
    - size_relationship: output width is identical to input width; output height is fixed at 16.
    - content_relationship: input pixel values and locations (other than their mere existence as non-background) do not influence the output pattern or its location.
