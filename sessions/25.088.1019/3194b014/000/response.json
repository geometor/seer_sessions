            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids are large (20x20) and contain a mix of different colors (pixels). They appear somewhat noisy or random, but within the noise, there are several distinct, larger contiguous areas (objects) composed of a single color. The background color, white (0), seems to act as a separator or empty space.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are small (3x3) and consist of a single, solid color.\n3.  **Color Correspondence**: In each example pair, the solid color used in the output grid corresponds to the color of one of the larger contiguous blocks found in the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input has several blocks (gray, maroon, green, yellow). The largest appears to be the green (3) block. The output is a solid green (3) 3x3 grid.\n    *   Example 2: Input has blocks (red, maroon, yellow). The largest appears to be the yellow (4) block. The output is a solid yellow (4) 3x3 grid.\n    *   Example 3: Input has blocks (azure, magenta, yellow). The largest appears to be the azure (8) block. The output is a solid azure (8) 3x3 grid.\n4.  **Transformation Goal**: The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific property of the colored blocks in the input and using that property (specifically, the color) to generate the output. The most salient property differentiating the blocks is their size (number of connected pixels). The task selects the color of the *largest* contiguous block of non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Identify the block that has the largest size.\n4.  **Determine Output Color**: Note the color of the block identified as the largest.
