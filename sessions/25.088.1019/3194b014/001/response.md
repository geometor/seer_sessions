"""
Identify the largest contiguous block of a single non-white color in the input grid.
A block is defined by pixels of the same color connected horizontally or vertically.
Create a 3x3 output grid filled entirely with the color of the identified largest block.
If there are no non-white blocks, the output grid should be filled with white (0).
If there's a tie for the largest block size, the color of the first one found during the scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) can be used.
