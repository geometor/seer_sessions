            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code assumed the transformation involved copying the *entire* input grid onto a fixed-size background at two predetermined locations. The results clearly show this assumption is incorrect. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs, particularly in the content and size of the patterns placed onto the background.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors involves:\n1.  Re-analyzing all training examples to identify the common transformation logic.\n2.  Focusing on how the pattern placed in the output is *derived* from the input, rather than assuming a direct copy.\n3.  Identifying distinct elements within the input (background, frame, core objects) and their roles in constructing the output pattern.\n4.  Determining the rules for constructing the placed pattern's border and size based on the input elements.\n5.  Confirming the placement locations and output grid size remain consistent across examples.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n**Common Properties:**\n*   Output Grid Size: Consistently 15x15 across all examples.\n*   Output Background Color: Consistently Orange (7) across all examples. This appears to be derived from the input grid's corner/most frequent color.\n*   Placement Locations: The derived pattern is placed twice in the output grid, starting at fixed top-left coordinates (2, 2) and (8, 8).\n*   Pattern Construction: The pattern placed is *not* a direct copy of the input. It's constructed based on elements identified within the input.\n\n**Example-Specific Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x7\n    *   Input Background Color: Orange (7)\n    *   Input Frame Color: Yellow (4)\n    *   Input Core Object Bounding Box: Rows 5-7, Cols 3-5 (3x3 area containing Maroon(9) and Blue(1))\n    *   Core Pattern: `[[9, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1]]` (extracted from input at core bbox)\n    *   Constructed Pattern Size: 5x5 (Core size + 2)\n    *   Constructed Pattern: 3x3 core centered, Orange(7) corners, Yellow(4) sides border.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x8\n    *   Input Background Color: Orange (7)\n    *   Input Frame Color: Green (3)\n    *   Input Core Object Bounding Box: Row 3, Col 4 (1x1 area containing Green(3))\n    *   Core Pattern: `[[3]]`\n    *   Constructed Pattern Size: 3x3 (Core size + 2)\n    *   Constructed Pattern: 1x1 core centered, Orange(7) corners, Green(3) sides border.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Input Background Color: Orange (7)\n    *   Input Frame Color: Maroon (9)\n    *   Input Core Object Bounding Box: Rows 2-4, Cols 2-4 (3x3 area containing inner Maroon(9) pixels)\n    *   Core Pattern: `[[7, 9, 7], [9, 7, 9], [7, 9, 7]]`\n    *   Constructed Pattern Size: 5x5 (Core size + 2)\n    *   Constructed Pattern: 3x3 core centered, Orange(7) corners, Maroon(9) sides border.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 6x7\n    *   Input Background Color: Orange (7)\n    *   Input Frame Color: Magenta (6)\n    *   Input Core Object Bounding Box: Rows 1-3, Cols 2-4 (3x3 area containing Azure(8) and Red(2))\n    *   Core Pattern: `[[7, 8, 7], [2, 7, 2], [2, 8, 2]]`\n    *   Constructed Pattern Size: 5x5 (Core size + 2)\n    *   Constructed Pattern: 3x3 core centered, Orange(7) corners, Magenta(6) sides border.\n\n## YAML Fact Block\n\n"

This is the `core_pattern`.\n4.  **Construct Placed Pattern:**\n    *   Calculate the dimensions of the `placed_pattern`: height = `core_pattern` height + 2, width = `core_pattern` width + 2.\n    *   Create a new grid with these dimensions.\n    *   Copy the `core_pattern` into the center of this new grid.\n    *   Fill the 4 corner cells of the new grid's border with the `background_color`.\n    *   Fill the remaining border cells (the sides) with the `frame_color`.\n5.  **Place Constructed Pattern onto Output:**\n    *   Copy the `placed_pattern` onto the output grid such that its top-left corner is at row 2, column 2.\n    *   Copy the `placed_pattern` onto the output grid such that its top-left corner is at row 8, column 8.
