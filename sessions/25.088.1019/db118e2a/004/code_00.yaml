task_description: "Construct a pattern based on input elements (background, frame, core objects) and place it twice onto a fixed-size background grid."

grid_properties:
  output_grid_size: [15, 15]
  output_background_color: 7 # Orange - seems derived from input corners/most frequent color.

input_elements:
  - element_type: background
    identifier: "Color at corners and/or most frequent color (e.g., Orange 7)."
  - element_type: frame
    identifier: "Contiguous color forming a rectangle just inside the background border (e.g., Yellow 4, Green 3, Maroon 9, Magenta 6)."
    properties:
      color: "Determined per example."
  - element_type: core_objects
    identifier: "All pixels that are not background and not frame."
    properties:
      bounding_box: "Smallest rectangle containing all core_objects."
  - element_type: core_pattern
    identifier: "The subgrid extracted from the input using the core_objects bounding_box."
    properties:
      size: "Variable [h, w]"

pattern_construction:
  - step: "Determine the size of the pattern to be placed: [core_pattern_h + 2, core_pattern_w + 2]."
  - step: "Create a new grid (placed_pattern) with the determined size."
  - step: "Place the core_pattern in the center of the placed_pattern grid."
  - step: "Define the border cells of the placed_pattern grid (1 pixel thick)."
  - step: "Fill the corners of the border with the background color."
  - step: "Fill the sides (non-corner cells) of the border with the frame color."

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      size: [15, 15]
      fill_color: background_color # Orange (7)
  - action: place_pattern
    source: constructed_placed_pattern
    target: output_grid
    location_1:
      top_left_corner: [2, 2] # 0-indexed row, col
    location_2:
      top_left_corner: [8, 8] # 0-indexed row, col
    behavior: "Second placement overwrites overlapping pixels (though no overlap occurs in examples)."
