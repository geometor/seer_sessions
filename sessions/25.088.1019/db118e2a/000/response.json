The edges of the border also contain another specific color which varies between examples (yellow, green, maroon, magenta).\n    *   The output grid is consistently larger (15x15) than the input grid.\n    *   The output grid is initialized with orange (7) pixels.\n    *   The central pattern from the input grid (excluding the border) is copied into the output grid twice.\n    *   The first copy is placed near the top-left quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   The second copy is placed near the center/bottom-right quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   The specific locations for the copies seem fixed across all examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
