*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input grids feature a central pattern surrounded by a border.
    *   The border consists primarily of orange (7) pixels, especially at the corners. The edges of the border also contain another specific color which varies between examples (yellow, green, maroon, magenta).
    *   The output grid is consistently larger (15x15) than the input grid.
    *   The output grid is initialized with orange (7) pixels.
    *   The central pattern from the input grid (excluding the border) is copied into the output grid twice.
    *   The first copy is placed near the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The second copy is placed near the center/bottom-right quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The specific locations for the copies seem fixed across all examples.

```yaml
    task_description: Copy the inner pattern of the input grid (excluding the 1-pixel border) twice onto a 15x15 orange background grid at fixed positions.
    
    elements:
      - element: input_grid
        description: A grid containing a central pattern surrounded by a 1-pixel border.
      - element: output_grid
        description: A 15x15 grid.
      - element: border
        description: The outermost single layer of pixels in the input grid. It primarily uses orange (7), especially at the corners, and one other color along the edges.
      - element: core_pattern
        description: The content of the input grid excluding the 1-pixel border.
      - element: background_color
        value: 7 (orange)
        description: The color used to fill the output grid initially.
      - element: output_dimensions
        value: [15, 15]
        description: The fixed height and width of the output grid.
      - element: placement_location_1
        value: [row=2, col=2] # 0-indexed row and column for top-left corner
        description: The starting position for the first copy of the core_pattern in the output_grid.
      - element: placement_location_2
        value: [row=8, col=8] # 0-indexed row and column for top-left corner
        description: The starting position for the second copy of the core_pattern in the output_grid.

    transformations:
      - action: initialize_output
        origin: N/A
        target: output_grid
        details: Create a 15x15 grid filled entirely with the background_color (orange/7).
      - action: extract_pattern
        origin: input_grid
        target: core_pattern
        details: Remove the 1-pixel border from all sides of the input_grid to obtain the core_pattern.
      - action: copy_pattern_1
        origin: core_pattern
        target: output_grid
        details: Copy the core_pattern onto the output_grid such that its top-left pixel aligns with placement_location_1 (row=2, col=2).
      - action: copy_pattern_2
        origin: core_pattern
        target: output_grid
        details: Copy the core_pattern onto the output_grid such that its top-left pixel aligns with placement_location_2 (row=8, col=8).

    relationships:
      - type: composition
        entity1: input_grid
        entity2: border
        entity3: core_pattern
        details: The input_grid is composed of the border surrounding the core_pattern.
      - type: placement
        entity1: core_pattern
        entity2: output_grid
        details: The core_pattern is placed twice onto the output_grid at specific, fixed coordinates.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 15x15.
    2.  Fill the entire output grid with the color orange (7).
    3.  Identify the core pattern within the input grid by removing the single outermost layer of pixels (the border) from all four sides.
    4.  Copy the extracted core pattern onto the output grid, placing its top-left corner at row index 2, column index 2.
    5.  Copy the same extracted core pattern again onto the output grid, this time placing its top-left corner at row index 8, column index 8.
    6.  The resulting output grid is the final result.
