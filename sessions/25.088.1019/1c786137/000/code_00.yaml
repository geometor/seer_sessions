task_type: extraction
description: Extract the rectangular region enclosed within the largest single-color rectangular frame found in the input grid.

input_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - type: object
    name: frame
    description: A rectangular border, one pixel thick, composed of a single non-white color (C). It surrounds an inner rectangular area.
    properties:
      - color (C): The uniform color of the frame pixels. Must be non-white (not 0).
      - location: Defined by the top-left (r1, c1) and bottom-right (r2, c2) coordinates of the outer boundary of the frame.
      - dimensions: Outer height (r2 - r1 + 1), Outer width (c2 - c1 + 1). Must be at least 3x3.
      - interior: The rectangular area defined by top-left (r1+1, c1+1) and bottom-right (r2-1, c2-1).
      - interior_pixels: All pixels within the interior region. Crucially, these pixels must *not* have the same color as the frame (color C).
      - interior_area: (r2 - r1 - 1) * (c2 - c1 - 1).

selection_criteria:
  - target: frame
  - rule: Select the frame object with the largest 'interior_area'. Assume a unique largest frame exists in valid inputs.

transformation:
  - action: find_largest_frame
    description: Identify the frame object in the input grid that satisfies the 'selection_criteria'.
  - action: extract_interior
    description: Extract the subgrid corresponding to the 'interior' of the selected frame.

output_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: The extracted subgrid representing the 'interior_pixels' of the largest identified frame.
    relationship_to_input: It is a subgrid located at rows r1+1 to r2-1 and columns c1+1 to c2-1 relative to the input grid, where (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are the bounds of the largest frame.
