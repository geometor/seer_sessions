In all examples, there's a prominent rectangular \"frame\" or \"border\" made of a single, non-white color.\n    *   Example 1: Yellow (4) frame.\n    *   Example 2: Red (2) frame.\n    *   Example 3: Azure (8) frame.\n3.  **Frame Structure:** This frame encloses a rectangular area containing different colors. The frame itself appears to be exactly one pixel thick on all four sides.\n4.  **Extraction Logic:** The output grid is precisely the content *inside* this frame, excluding the frame pixels themselves.\n5.  **Identifying the Correct Frame:** In each input, there might be multiple shapes or blocks of color. The transformation consistently selects the *largest* such rectangular frame, where \"largest\" refers to the area of the region *enclosed* by the frame.\n6.  **Frame Color:** The specific color of the frame (yellow, red, azure) changes between examples but doesn't seem to affect the *content* of the output, only its location and dimensions within the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
