"""
Transforms the input grid based on vertical red lines and associated fill colors.

1. Find unique 'fill colors' (not white=0, red=2, yellow=4) in scan order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
2. Find all distinct, contiguous, vertical segments composed only of red (2) pixels. Record each segment's column index, start row, and end row.
3. Sort the red segments first by their start row index (ascending) and then by their column index (ascending).
4. Associate the sorted red segments with the identified fill colors sequentially. The i-th segment corresponds to the i-th fill color.
5. For each associated (segment, fill_color) pair:
   a. Determine the fill side (left or right of the red segment). Count the number of fillable pixels (white=0 only) in the *original input grid* immediately to the left (in column segment_col - 1) and immediately to the right (in column segment_col + 1) of the segment, but only considering rows spanned by the segment (from start_row to end_row).
   b. If the count on the right is greater than the count on the left, the fill direction is RIGHT.
   c. If the count on the left is greater than the count on the right, the fill direction is LEFT.
   d. If the counts are equal and non-zero, the fill direction is RIGHT (tie-breaker).
   e. If both counts are zero, or the chosen fill side is outside the grid, no fill operation is performed for this segment.
6. Perform a flood fill operation on the chosen side:
   a. Identify the initial "seed" pixels for the flood fill. These are the pixels in the column immediately adjacent to the red segment on the determined fill side (column segment_col + direction), within the segment's row bounds (start_row to end_row). Only include seeds that are initially fillable (white=0) in the *current state* of the output grid.
   b. If there are no valid seed pixels, skip the fill operation for this segment.
   c. Starting from the seed pixels, perform a flood fill on the `output_grid`:
      i. Use a queue and a set to track visited pixels for this specific fill operation.
      ii. Change the color of fillable pixels (white=0 only) encountered during the fill to the associated `fill_color`.
      iii. The flood fill propagates horizontally and vertically (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels.
      iv. The fill is constrained: it only affects pixels whose row index is within the original red segment's row bounds (start_row to end_row).
      v. The fill stops at pixels that are not fillable (i.e., not white=0), including yellow=4, red=2, and other fill colors, or pixels outside the vertical bounds.
7. Return the modified grid.
