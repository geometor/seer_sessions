Sort these red line segments first by their start row index (ascending) and then by their column index (ascending).
Iterate through the sorted red line segments and the 'fill_colors' list simultaneously. For the i-th segment, use the i-th fill color.
For each red segment, change the color of the pixels immediately to its right (in the column col+1) for all rows spanned by the segment, using the corresponding fill color. All other pixels remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the "fill colors" and the vertical red segments, including their sorting order. However, the core transformation logic was flawed. It assumed the fill color should only be applied to the single column immediately to the right of each red segment. The results clearly show this is incorrect.

The expected outputs demonstrate a more complex fill operation:
1.  The fill area is adjacent to the red segment but can be either to the left or right.
2.  The fill area's vertical extent is limited to the rows spanned by the red segment.
3.  The fill operation replaces not only white (0) pixels but also yellow (4) pixels within the target area.
4.  The fill seems to propagate outwards from the red segment's side, potentially bounded by other colors or grid edges. It behaves like a flood fill confined to specific rows and one side of the red line.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to refine the understanding of how the fill area is determined and how the fill is applied. Key aspects to determine are:
1.  **Side Determination:** How is the decision made whether to fill to the left or right of the red segment?
2.  **Fill Initiation:** Where does the fill start?
3.  **Fill Propagation:** What pixels are affected (color-wise), and what are the boundaries?

Based on preliminary analysis (detailed in thought block), a promising hypothesis involves using the original position of the fill color relative to the red segment's column to determine the side, and then performing a flood fill starting from the pixels immediately adjacent to the segment on that side, restricted to the segment's rows, and only affecting white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's gather precise data for each example using the provided results and potentially code execution for verification.
