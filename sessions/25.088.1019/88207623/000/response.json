            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The grid background is white (0).\n2.  **Key Structures:** The input grids contain distinct structures primarily composed of vertical red (2) lines adjacent to yellow (4) areas. These red/yellow structures appear to be the main targets for modification.\n3.  **Trigger/Fill Pixels:** Each input grid also contains one or more isolated pixels of colors other than white (0), red (2), or yellow (4). In `train_1`, these are gray (5) and orange (7). In `train_2`, these are azure (8) and green (3). These pixels seem to determine the *color* used for modification.\n4.  **Modification Area:** The transformation modifies pixels located immediately to the right of the vertical red lines. Specifically, white pixels (0) in the column adjacent to the red line are changed.\n5.  **Association:** There's a clear association between a specific red line structure and a specific \"fill\" color pixel. The Nth red line structure encountered (when scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) seems to be associated with the Nth unique fill color encountered (using the same scanning order).\n6.  **Extent of Modification:** The modification (color filling) next to a red line only occurs on the rows spanned by that specific vertical red line segment.\n7.  **Consistency:** All other pixels (the red lines themselves, the yellow areas, the original fill pixels, and other background pixels) remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Find all unique pixels in the input grid whose colors are *not* white (0), red (2), or yellow (4). Record these colors in a list (`fill_colors`) in the order they are first encountered when scanning the grid row by row, from top to bottom, and left to right within each row.\n3.  Identify all distinct, contiguous, vertical segments composed only of red (2) pixels. For each segment, store its column index, the starting row index, and the ending row index.\n4.  Sort these identified red line segments based on their position. The primary sort key is the starting row index (ascending), and the secondary sort key is the column index (ascending).\n5.  Iterate through the sorted list of red line segments, keeping track of the index (`i`) of the current segment (starting from 0).\n6.  For the `i`-th red line segment:\n    a.  Retrieve the `i`-th color from the `fill_colors` list. If `i` is out of bounds for `fill_colors`, stop processing (this handles cases where there are more red lines than fill colors, though not observed in examples).\n    b.  Let `col` be the column index of the red line segment, and let `start_row` and `end_row` be its starting and ending row indices.\n    c.  For each row index `r` from `start_row` to `end_row` (inclusive):\n        i.  Check if the column `col + 1` is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. If it is, update the pixel at `(r, col + 1)` in the output grid to the fill color retrieved in step 6a.\n7.  Return the final modified output grid."
