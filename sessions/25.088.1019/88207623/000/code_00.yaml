Input_Elements:
  - Type: Background
    Color: white (0)
  - Type: Structure
    Components:
      - Element: Vertical Line
        Color: red (2)
        Property: Contiguous in a column
      - Element: Area
        Color: yellow (4)
        Relationship: Often adjacent to the red line (but adjacency seems non-essential for the core rule)
  - Type: Fill_Pixel
    Color: Any color except white (0), red (2), yellow (4)
    Property: Typically isolated single pixels
    Role: Determine the color for output modification

Output_Elements:
  - Identical to Input_Elements, except for specific modifications.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify
    Target: Vertical red (2) line segments.
    Output: List of segments, each defined by (column_index, start_row, end_row).
    Ordering: By top-most pixel (row, then column).
  - Action: Identify
    Target: Fill_Pixels (non-0, non-2, non-4 colors).
    Output: Ordered list of unique fill colors encountered during a grid scan (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
  - Action: Associate
    Source: Nth ordered red line segment.
    Target: Nth ordered unique fill color.
  - Action: Modify_Grid
    Condition: For each associated (red_segment, fill_color) pair.
    Location: Pixels at (row, red_segment.column_index + 1) for all rows between red_segment.start_row and red_segment.end_row.
    Change: Set pixel color to the associated fill_color.
  - Action: Copy
    Target: All pixels not modified in the previous step.
    Source: Input grid.
    Destination: Output grid.
