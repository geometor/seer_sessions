**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted to implement a flood fill operation originating from vertical red lines. The core idea seems directionally correct, but the execution results reveal significant deviations from the expected outputs. The primary issues appear to be:

1.  **Incorrect Fillable Color Identification:** The code incorrectly identified yellow (4) as a fillable color alongside white (0). The expected outputs clearly show that yellow pixels act as boundaries and are not replaced by the fill color. Only white (0) pixels should be filled.
2.  **Incorrect Side Determination Logic:** The logic for deciding whether to fill left or right of the red segment likely used the wrong criteria. It counted both white (0) and yellow (4) pixels as "fillable" for this decision. It should likely count only adjacent *white* (0) pixels in the initial grid state.
3.  **Overly Aggressive Flood Fill:** Consequently, the flood fill replaced yellow pixels and potentially extended further than intended because yellow pixels were not treated as boundaries.

The strategy for resolving these errors is to refine the understanding of:
*   What constitutes a "fillable" pixel (only white=0).
*   How the fill direction (left/right) is determined (count adjacent white=0 pixels).
*   What boundaries constrain the flood fill (non-white pixels and the vertical extent of the red segment).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's re-examine the side determination using only adjacent white (0) pixels in the *initial* grid, within the vertical bounds of each segment.
