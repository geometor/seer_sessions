Input Grid Structure:
  - Row 0: Contains palette information.
    - Starts with a sequence of non-white colors (main_palette).
    - May contain a white (0) pixel acting as a separator.
    - May contain another non-white color after the separator (special_color) at a specific column index (special_col).
  - Row 1: Separator row, consists entirely of gray (5) pixels.
  - Rows 2 to N: Contains the drawing area, initially mostly white (0) except for one single non-white pixel (target_pixel).

Objects:
  - main_palette: List of colors derived from the start of Row 0.
  - special_color: A single optional color from Row 0, appearing after a white separator. Identified by its color value and its column index (special_col).
  - target_pixel: The single non-white pixel below Row 1. Characterized by its row, column, and color.
  - pattern: A set of concentric squares drawn around the target_pixel in the output grid.

Properties:
  - target_color: The color of the target_pixel.
  - target_coords: The (row, column) of the target_pixel.
  - target_idx: The index of the target_color within the main_palette.
  - max_dist_main_palette: The maximum distance from the center (target_pixel) for which colors are directly determined by the main_palette (calculated as `len(main_palette) - 1 - target_idx`).
  - special_distance: The specific distance from the center at which the special_color should be drawn (calculated as `special_col - target_idx`). This only applies if a special_color exists.
  - overall_max_dist: The maximum distance from the center that defines the bounding box of the drawn pattern (calculated as `max(palette_max_idx, special_col if exists) - target_idx`).

Actions/Transformations:
  - Identify: Locate the main_palette, special_color (if any), special_col (if any), and the target_pixel (color and coordinates).
  - Calculate: Determine target_idx, max_dist_main_palette, special_distance (if applicable), and overall_max_dist.
  - Modify Palette Row: If a special_color exists, change the pixel at `(0, special_col)` in the output grid to gray (5).
  - Draw Pattern:
    - Iterate through pixels within a square region defined by `overall_max_dist` centered at `target_coords`.
    - For each pixel `(r, c)` within grid bounds:
      - Calculate Chebyshev distance `d = max(abs(r - target_row), abs(c - target_col))`.
      - If `d <= overall_max_dist`:
        - Determine color:
          - If `d == special_distance` (and special_color exists), use `special_color`.
          - Else if `d <= max_dist_main_palette`, use `main_palette[target_idx + d]`.
          - Else (if `d > max_dist_main_palette` and `d != special_distance`), use white (0).
        - Set the output grid pixel `(r, c)` to the determined color.
    - Pixels outside the `overall_max_dist` remain unchanged from the input (typically white 0 below row 1).
  - Output: Return the modified grid.
