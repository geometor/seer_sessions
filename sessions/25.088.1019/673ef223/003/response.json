For each row, check if a red (2) pixel exists at the beginning (column 0).\n4. If a red pixel is found at the beginning:\n    a. Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, starting from column 1 up to the end of the row.\n    b. If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index 'stopper_col':\n        i. Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column 1 up to (but not including) 'stopper_col' with azure (8).\n        ii. Change the pixel at 'stopper_col' in the output grid to yellow (4).\n    c. If no azure (8) pixel is found in the rest of the row, make no changes to this row (it remains as copied).\n    d. Proceed to the next row (do not check the right side if the left side had a red pixel).\n5. If no red pixel was found at the beginning of the row (column 0), check if a red (2) pixel exists at the end (last column).\n6. If a red pixel is found at the end:\n    a. Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, scanning backwards from the second-to-last column down to column 0.\n    b. If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index 'stopper_col':\n        i. Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from 'stopper_col + 1' up to (but not including) the last column with azure (8).\n        ii. Change the pixel at 'stopper_col' in the output grid to yellow (4).\n    c. If no azure (8) pixel is found in the rest of the row (scanning backwards), make no changes to this row (it remains as copied).\n7.
