            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented the core logic for rows containing both a red (2) pixel at an edge and an azure (8) \"stopper\" pixel within the row. The transformation involved filling the segment between the edge and the stopper with azure (8) and changing the stopper to yellow (4).\n\nHowever, the code failed on examples where a row started or ended with red (2) but did *not* contain any azure (8) pixels elsewhere in the row. The analysis of the failing examples reveals that in these specific cases, the expected behavior is to fill the *entire* row (excluding the initiating red pixel) with azure (8). The previous code incorrectly left these rows unchanged.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the transformation logic to explicitly handle the case where no azure (8) stopper is found. If a row starts/ends with red (2) and no azure (8) exists in the rest of the row, the appropriate segment (from the column adjacent to the red pixel up to the opposite edge) should be filled with azure (8).\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the specific rows where the transformation differs from the expectation, focusing on the presence or absence of the azure (8) stopper.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 20x10\n*   Rows starting with Red (2): Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n    *   Row 2: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]`. Stopper (8) found at col 7. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0]`. Code Output: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0]`. (Correct)\n    *   Row 4: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Stopper (8) found at col 5. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Code Output: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. (Correct)\n    *   Rows 1, 3, 5: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change (since stopper not found, *and* red is on left). Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic, but need re-evaluation based on failing rows below).\n*   Rows ending with Red (2): Rows 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (Indices 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)\n    *   Row 12: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 8->0. Expected Fill: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. **(Mismatch)**\n    *   Row 14: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 8->0. Expected Fill: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. **(Mismatch)**\n    *   Rows 11, 13, 15: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 19x8\n*   Rows starting with Red (2): Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (Indices 1, 2, 3, 4)\n    *   Row 3: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]`. Stopper (8) found at col 4. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]`. Code Output: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]`. (Correct)\n    *   Rows 1, 2, 4: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).\n*   Rows ending with Red (2): Rows 11, 12, 13, 14 (Indices 11, 12, 13, 14)\n    *   Row 13: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 6->0. Expected Fill: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. **(Mismatch)**\n    *   Rows 11, 12, 14: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input Grid Size: 20x10\n*   Rows starting with Red (2): Rows 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (Indices 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18)\n    *   Row 14: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 1->9. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Code Output: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. **(Mismatch)**\n    *   Row 15: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 1->9. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Code Output: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. **(Mismatch)**\n    *   Row 17: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 1->9. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Code Output: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. **(Mismatch)**\n    *   Rows 13, 16, 18: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).\n*   Rows ending with Red (2): Rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Indices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\n    *   Row 4: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2]`. Stopper (8) found at col 6. Expected Fill: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 2]`. (Correct)\n    *   Row 5: Input `[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. Stopper (8) found at col 2. Expected Fill: `[0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. (Correct)\n    *   Row 7: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. Stopper (8) found at col 4. Expected Fill: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. (Correct)\n    *   Rows 3, 6, 8: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).\n\n**Summary of Mismatches:** The mismatches occur *only* when a row starts or ends with red (2) AND contains no azure (8) pixels. In these cases, the expected output fills the row (excluding the red edge pixel) with azure (8), while the code left it unchanged.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
