The errors consistently occur in rows where the triggering red pixel exists, but *no* azure stopper is found in the search path. The current code fills the rest of the row with azure in this \"no stopper\" scenario, while the expected outputs show that these rows should remain unchanged (except for the potential stopper change, which doesn't happen if no stopper exists).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the natural language program and subsequent code to *only* perform the azure fill and yellow replacement *if* an azure stopper is actually found. If no stopper is found, the row segment should not be modified.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"
