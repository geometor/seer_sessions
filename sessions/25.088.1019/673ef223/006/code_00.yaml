GridProperties:
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
  - Input grids contain primarily white (0), some red (2) trigger pixels, and occasional azure (8) stopper pixels.
  - Output grids contain the same colors plus yellow (4) where stoppers were modified, and additional azure (8) pixels where fills occurred.

Objects:
  - TriggerPixel: A red (2) pixel located at either the leftmost column (col 0) or the rightmost column (col N-1) of a row.
  - StopperPixel: An azure (8) pixel located within the same row as a TriggerPixel, but not in the same column as the trigger.
  - FillPixel: An azure (8) pixel used to fill segments of a row.
  - ModifiedStopperPixel: A yellow (4) pixel that replaces an original StopperPixel after a fill operation.
  - PathSegment: The sequence of pixels between a TriggerPixel (exclusive) and a StopperPixel (exclusive), or between a TriggerPixel (exclusive) and the opposite edge of the grid (exclusive) if no StopperPixel exists.

Actions:
  - RowIteration: Process the grid row by row.
  - EdgeCheck: For each row, check if the leftmost pixel is red. If not, check if the rightmost pixel is red. Give priority to the left edge check.
  - StopperSearch:
      - If the left edge is red, search from the column *after* the red pixel towards the right edge for the first azure pixel.
      - If the right edge is red (and the left was not), search from the column *before* the red pixel towards the left edge for the first azure pixel.
  - ConditionalFill:
      - **If** a StopperPixel is found during the search:
          - Fill the PathSegment between the TriggerPixel and the StopperPixel with FillPixels (azure, 8).
          - Change the StopperPixel to a ModifiedStopperPixel (yellow, 4).
      - **Else** (if no StopperPixel is found):
          - Make no changes to the PathSegment.
  - OutputInitialization: Start with the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid. Modifications are applied directly to this copy.
