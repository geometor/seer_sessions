Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core logic of identifying rows starting or ending with red (2), searching inwards for an azure (8) stopper, filling the path with azure (8), and changing the stopper to yellow (4) seems mostly correct. The errors consistently occur in rows where the triggering red pixel exists, but *no* azure stopper is found in the search path. The current code fills the rest of the row with azure in this "no stopper" scenario, while the expected outputs show that these rows should remain unchanged (except for the potential stopper change, which doesn't happen if no stopper exists).

The strategy is to modify the natural language program and subsequent code to *only* perform the azure fill and yellow replacement *if* an azure stopper is actually found. If no stopper is found, the row segment should not be modified.

# Let's check the original code's output for these rows specifically

# Conclusion: The "stopper found" logic seems correct in the code. The error is solely in the "stopper not found" logic.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
GridProperties:
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
  - Input grids contain primarily white (0), some red (2) trigger pixels, and occasional azure (8) stopper pixels.
  - Output grids contain the same colors plus yellow (4) where stoppers were modified, and additional azure (8) pixels where fills occurred.

Objects:
  - TriggerPixel: A red (2) pixel located at either the leftmost column (col 0) or the rightmost column (col N-1) of a row.
  - StopperPixel: An azure (8) pixel located within the same row as a TriggerPixel, but not in the same column as the trigger.
  - FillPixel: An azure (8) pixel used to fill segments of a row.
  - ModifiedStopperPixel: A yellow (4) pixel that replaces an original StopperPixel after a fill operation.
  - PathSegment: The sequence of pixels between a TriggerPixel (exclusive) and a StopperPixel (exclusive), or between a TriggerPixel (exclusive) and the opposite edge of the grid (exclusive) if no StopperPixel exists.

Actions:
  - RowIteration: Process the grid row by row.
  - EdgeCheck: For each row, check if the leftmost pixel is red. If not, check if the rightmost pixel is red. Give priority to the left edge check.
  - StopperSearch:
      - If the left edge is red, search from the column *after* the red pixel towards the right edge for the first azure pixel.
      - If the right edge is red (and the left was not), search from the column *before* the red pixel towards the left edge for the first azure pixel.
  - ConditionalFill:
      - **If** a StopperPixel is found during the search:
          - Fill the PathSegment between the TriggerPixel and the StopperPixel with FillPixels (azure, 8).
          - Change the StopperPixel to a ModifiedStopperPixel (yellow, 4).
      - **Else** (if no StopperPixel is found):
          - Make no changes to the PathSegment.
  - OutputInitialization: Start with the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid. Modifications are applied directly to this copy.

```


**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the grid. Let the number of columns be `num_cols`.
3.  **Check Left Edge:** For the current row, check if the pixel at column 0 is red (2).
4.  **Process Left Edge Trigger:** If the pixel at column 0 is red (2):
    a. Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, scanning from column 1 up to `num_cols - 1`.
    b. **Stopper Found (Left):** If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index `stopper_col`:
        i. Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column 1 up to (but not including) `stopper_col` with azure (8).
        ii. Change the pixel at `stopper_col` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c. **Stopper Not Found (Left):** If no azure (8) pixel is found in the row (from column 1 onwards), make no changes to this row segment (columns 1 to `num_cols - 1`).
    d. Proceed to the next row (do not check the right edge for this row).
5.  **Check Right Edge:** If the pixel at column 0 was *not* red (2), check if the pixel at the last column (`num_cols - 1`) is red (2).
6.  **Process Right Edge Trigger:** If the pixel at the last column (`num_cols - 1`) is red (2):
    a. Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, scanning backwards from column `num_cols - 2` down to column 0.
    b. **Stopper Found (Right):** If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index `stopper_col`:
        i. Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column `stopper_col + 1` up to (but not including) `num_cols - 1` with azure (8).
        ii. Change the pixel at `stopper_col` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c. **Stopper Not Found (Right):** If no azure (8) pixel is found in the row (scanning backwards from `num_cols - 2` down to 0), make no changes to this row segment (columns 0 to `num_cols - 2`).
7.  After checking and potentially modifying all rows, return the final output grid.
