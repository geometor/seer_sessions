These red lines persist in the output.\n    *   Azure (8): Appears as scattered single pixels in the input. In the output, azure pixels form horizontal lines, and sometimes replace the original azure input pixels.\n    *   Yellow (4): Appears only in the output, replacing the original position of some azure (8) input pixels.\n    *   White (0): The background color, largely unchanged except where azure lines are drawn.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves drawing horizontal azure (8) lines in specific rows. The presence and location of red (2) and azure (8) pixels in the input determine where these lines are drawn and where they stop.\n5.  **Line Generation:**\n    *   Lines are generated only in rows containing a red (2) pixel.\n    *   The line originates from the side with the red pixel and extends horizontally towards the opposite side.\n    *   The line color is azure (8).\n    *   If the line encounters an azure (8) pixel from the input *within the same row*, the line stops just before that pixel, and the encountered azure pixel is replaced with yellow (4).\n    *   If no azure (8) pixel is encountered in the row (between the starting red pixel and the opposite edge), the azure line extends all the way across the row, stopping just before the opposite edge.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
