Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Consistent between input and output.
    - BackgroundColor: White (0).
Objects:
  - Type: VerticalLine
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Always at column 0 or the last column.
    Persistence: Retained in the output.
    Role: Defines rows where horizontal lines are generated ('active rows').
  - Type: Point
    Color: Azure (8)
    Location: Scattered in the input grid.
    Role: Acts as a 'stopper' or 'terminator' for the horizontal lines drawn in its row. Replaced by Yellow (4) in the output if it stops a line.
  - Type: HorizontalLine (Generated)
    Color: Azure (8)
    Location: Generated in 'active rows' in the output grid.
    Origin: Adjacent to the Red (2) pixel in the row.
    Termination:
      - Stops one cell before an input Azure (8) pixel in the same row.
      - Stops one cell before the opposite grid edge if no input Azure (8) pixel is encountered in the row.
  - Type: Point (Generated)
    Color: Yellow (4)
    Location: Appears in the output grid at the position of an input Azure (8) pixel that acted as a stopper.
Relationships:
  - A Red (2) pixel in a row triggers the potential generation of a HorizontalLine (Azure, 8) in that row.
  - An input Azure (8) pixel in an active row determines the endpoint of the generated HorizontalLine and is replaced by Yellow (4).
  - The direction of the HorizontalLine generation depends on whether the Red (2) pixel is on the left or right edge.
