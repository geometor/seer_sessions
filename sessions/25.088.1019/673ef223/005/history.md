Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the grid.
3. For each row, check if a red (2) pixel exists at the beginning (column 0).
4. If a red pixel is found at the beginning:
    a. Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, starting from column 1 up to the end of the row.
    b. If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index 'stopper_col':
        i. Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column 1 up to (but not including) 'stopper_col' with azure (8).
        ii. Change the pixel at 'stopper_col' in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c. If no azure (8) pixel is found in the rest of the row, make no changes to this row (it remains as copied).
    d. Proceed to the next row (do not check the right side if the left side had a red pixel).
5. If no red pixel was found at the beginning of the row (column 0), check if a red (2) pixel exists at the end (last column).
6. If a red pixel is found at the end:
    a. Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, scanning backwards from the second-to-last column down to column 0.
    b. If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index 'stopper_col':
        i. Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from 'stopper_col + 1' up to (but not including) the last column with azure (8).
        ii. Change the pixel at 'stopper_col' in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c. If no azure (8) pixel is found in the rest of the row (scanning backwards), make no changes to this row (it remains as copied).
7. After checking all rows, return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully implemented the core logic for rows containing both a red (2) pixel at an edge and an azure (8) "stopper" pixel within the row. The transformation involved filling the segment between the edge and the stopper with azure (8) and changing the stopper to yellow (4).

However, the code failed on examples where a row started or ended with red (2) but did *not* contain any azure (8) pixels elsewhere in the row. The analysis of the failing examples reveals that in these specific cases, the expected behavior is to fill the *entire* row (excluding the initiating red pixel) with azure (8). The previous code incorrectly left these rows unchanged.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the transformation logic to explicitly handle the case where no azure (8) stopper is found. If a row starts/ends with red (2) and no azure (8) exists in the rest of the row, the appropriate segment (from the column adjacent to the red pixel up to the opposite edge) should be filled with azure (8).

## Metrics

Let's analyze the specific rows where the transformation differs from the expectation, focusing on the presence or absence of the azure (8) stopper.

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid Size: 20x10
*   Rows starting with Red (2): Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    *   Row 2: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]`. Stopper (8) found at col 7. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0]`. Code Output: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0]`. (Correct)
    *   Row 4: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Stopper (8) found at col 5. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Code Output: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. (Correct)
    *   Rows 1, 3, 5: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change (since stopper not found, *and* red is on left). Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic, but need re-evaluation based on failing rows below).
*   Rows ending with Red (2): Rows 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (Indices 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
    *   Row 12: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 8->0. Expected Fill: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. **(Mismatch)**
    *   Row 14: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 8->0. Expected Fill: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. **(Mismatch)**
    *   Rows 11, 13, 15: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid Size: 19x8
*   Rows starting with Red (2): Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (Indices 1, 2, 3, 4)
    *   Row 3: Input `[2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]`. Stopper (8) found at col 4. Expected Fill: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]`. Code Output: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]`. (Correct)
    *   Rows 1, 2, 4: No stopper (8) found. Expected Output: No change. Code Output: No change. (Correct based on original logic).
*   Rows ending with Red (2): Rows 11, 12, 13, 14 (Indices 11, 12, 13, 14)
    *   Row 13: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. No stopper (8) found scanning cols 6->0. Expected Fill: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]`. Code Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. **(Mismatch)**

**Summary of Mismatches:** The mismatches occur *only* when a row starts or ends with red (2) AND contains no azure (8) pixels. In these cases, the expected output fills the row (excluding the red edge pixel) with azure (8), while the code left it unchanged.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Process rows in a grid based on the presence of red pixels at the edges and azure pixels within the row.
colors:
  RED: 2
  AZURE: 8
  YELLOW: 4
  BACKGROUND: 0 # Assuming white/0 is the background
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D array (rows, columns)
  size: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
row_processing_logic:
  trigger: Presence of a RED (2) pixel at either the start (column 0) or the end (column num_cols - 1) of a row.
  priority: Process based on the left edge (column 0) first. If a red pixel is found and processed there, skip checking the right edge for that row.
  action_left_edge: # If row[0] == RED
    scan_direction: Left-to-right (from column 1 to num_cols - 1).
    scan_target: First AZURE (8) pixel.
    result_if_target_found:
      - fill_color: AZURE (8)
      - fill_range: From column 1 up to (but not including) the target's column.
      - target_change: Change the found AZURE (8) pixel to YELLOW (4).
    result_if_target_not_found:
      - fill_color: AZURE (8)
      - fill_range: From column 1 up to (and including) the last column (num_cols - 1).
      - target_change: None.
  action_right_edge: # If row[0] != RED AND row[num_cols - 1] == RED
    scan_direction: Right-to-left (from column num_cols - 2 down to 0).
    scan_target: First AZURE (8) pixel.
    result_if_target_found:
      - fill_color: AZURE (8)
      - fill_range: From the column after the target (target_col + 1) up to (but not including) the last column (num_cols - 1).
      - target_change: Change the found AZURE (8) pixel to YELLOW (4).
    result_if_target_not_found:
      - fill_color: AZURE (8)
      - fill_range: From the first column (0) up to (but not including) the second-to-last column (num_cols - 2).
      - target_change: None.
output_grid: Initialized as a copy of the input grid, modified in place based on row processing.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the grid. Let the number of columns be `num_cols`.
3.  **Check Left Edge:** For the current row, check if the pixel at column 0 is red (2).
4.  **Process Left Edge Trigger:** If the pixel at column 0 is red (2):
    a.  Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, scanning from column 1 up to `num_cols - 1`.
    b.  **Stopper Found (Left):** If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index `stopper_col`:
        i.  Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column 1 up to (but not including) `stopper_col` with azure (8).
        ii. Change the pixel at `stopper_col` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c.  **Stopper Not Found (Left):** If no azure (8) pixel is found in the row (from column 1 onwards):
        i.  Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column 1 up to `num_cols - 1` (inclusive) with azure (8).
    d.  Proceed to the next row (do not check the right edge for this row).
5.  **Check Right Edge:** If the pixel at column 0 was *not* red (2), check if the pixel at the last column (`num_cols - 1`) is red (2).
6.  **Process Right Edge Trigger:** If the pixel at the last column (`num_cols - 1`) is red (2):
    a.  Search for the first azure (8) pixel in that row, scanning backwards from column `num_cols - 2` down to column 0.
    b.  **Stopper Found (Right):** If an azure (8) pixel is found at column index `stopper_col`:
        i.  Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column `stopper_col + 1` up to (but not including) `num_cols - 1` with azure (8).
        ii. Change the pixel at `stopper_col` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    c.  **Stopper Not Found (Right):** If no azure (8) pixel is found in the row (scanning backwards from `num_cols - 2` down to 0):
        i.  Fill the cells in the output grid for the current row from column 0 up to (but not including) `num_cols - 1` with azure (8).
7.  After checking and potentially modifying all rows, return the final output grid.
