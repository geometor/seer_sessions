**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** All input grids are 4x4. All output grids are 16x16. The output dimensions are the square of the input dimensions (4*4 = 16).
2.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid appears to be composed of a 4x4 arrangement of smaller 4x4 blocks.
3.  **Block Content:** Each 4x4 block within the output grid is either:
    *   An exact copy of the original 4x4 input grid.
    *   A 4x4 grid filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  **Pattern Correspondence:** The arrangement of these blocks (input copy vs. white block) in the 4x4 block grid corresponds directly to the pattern of pixels in the original 4x4 input grid.
5.  **Rule:** If a pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid is *not* white (i.e., has a color value > 0), then the corresponding block at block-position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid is a copy of the entire input grid. If the input pixel at (`r`, `c`) *is* white (value 0), then the corresponding block at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid is a 4x4 block filled with white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size_relationship: The output grid dimensions (H_out, W_out) are the square of the input grid dimensions (H_in, W_in). H_out = H_in * H_in, W_out = W_in * W_in.
  output_structure: The output grid is a tiling of smaller blocks.
  block_grid_dimensions: The output grid can be viewed as an H_in x W_in grid of blocks.
  block_size: Each block within the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (H_in x W_in).
  background_color: White (0) acts as the background or default fill color.

transformation_logic:
  mapping_rule: The content of each block in the output grid is determined by the color of the corresponding pixel in the input grid.
  conditions:
    - condition: Input pixel at (r, c) is non-white (value > 0).
      action: The output block at block coordinates (r, c) is an identical copy of the entire input grid.
    - condition: Input pixel at (r, c) is white (value == 0).
      action: The output block at block coordinates (r, c) is filled entirely with the white (0) color.
  pixel_coordinates_mapping:
    - input_pixel: (r, c)
    - output_block_top_left_corner: (r * H_in, c * W_in)
    - output_block_bottom_right_corner: ((r + 1) * H_in - 1, (c + 1) * W_in - 1)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height `H * H` and width `W * W`. Initialize all its pixels to white (0).
3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the **input** grid.
4.  Examine the pixel value `P` at `input[r][c]`.
5.  **If** the pixel value `P` is **not** white (0):
    *   Calculate the top-left corner coordinates for the corresponding block in the output grid: `output_row_start = r * H`, `output_col_start = c * W`.
    *   Copy the **entire** original `H x W` input grid into the output grid, starting at `(output_row_start, output_col_start)`.
6.  **Else** (if the pixel value `P` is white (0)):
    *   The corresponding `H x W` block in the output grid (starting at `r * H`, `c * W`) remains filled with white (0) as initialized.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
