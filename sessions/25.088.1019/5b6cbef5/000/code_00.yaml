task_context:
  grid_size_relationship: The output grid dimensions (H_out, W_out) are the square of the input grid dimensions (H_in, W_in). H_out = H_in * H_in, W_out = W_in * W_in.
  output_structure: The output grid is a tiling of smaller blocks.
  block_grid_dimensions: The output grid can be viewed as an H_in x W_in grid of blocks.
  block_size: Each block within the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (H_in x W_in).
  background_color: White (0) acts as the background or default fill color.

transformation_logic:
  mapping_rule: The content of each block in the output grid is determined by the color of the corresponding pixel in the input grid.
  conditions:
    - condition: Input pixel at (r, c) is non-white (value > 0).
      action: The output block at block coordinates (r, c) is an identical copy of the entire input grid.
    - condition: Input pixel at (r, c) is white (value == 0).
      action: The output block at block coordinates (r, c) is filled entirely with the white (0) color.
  pixel_coordinates_mapping:
    - input_pixel: (r, c)
    - output_block_top_left_corner: (r * H_in, c * W_in)
    - output_block_bottom_right_corner: ((r + 1) * H_in - 1, (c + 1) * W_in - 1)
