The output dimensions are the square of the input dimensions (4*4 = 16).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid appears to be composed of a 4x4 arrangement of smaller 4x4 blocks.\n3.  **Block Content:** Each 4x4 block within the output grid is either:\n    *   An exact copy of the original 4x4 input grid.\n    *   A 4x4 grid filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  **Pattern Correspondence:** The arrangement of these blocks (input copy vs. white block) in the 4x4 block grid corresponds directly to the pattern of pixels in the original 4x4 input grid.\n5.  **Rule:** If a pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid is *not* white (i.e., has a color value > 0), then the corresponding block at block-position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid is a copy of the entire input grid. If the input pixel at (`r`, `c`) *is* white (value 0), then the corresponding block at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid is a 4x4 block filled with white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
