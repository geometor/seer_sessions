task_description: Filter composite objects based on the count of a specific marker color within them.
background_color: white (0)
object_colors: [blue (1), azure (8)]
marker_color: azure (8)
connectivity: orthogonal (no diagonals)

input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
  - objects:
      - definition: Contiguous areas of non-background pixels (connected orthogonally).
      - composition: Composed of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
      - property: count_of_azure_pixels (number of azure (8) pixels within the object).

transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    - parameters: Use orthogonal connectivity.
  - action: analyze_objects
    - determine: Count of azure (8) pixels within each object.
  - action: filter_objects
    - condition: Keep objects where the count of azure pixels is 0 or 1.
    - condition: Remove objects where the count of azure pixels is 2 or more.
  - action: generate_output_grid
    - Create a grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    - For each kept object, copy its pixels (both blue and azure) from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

output_features:
  - grid: 2D array containing only the filtered objects on a white background.
