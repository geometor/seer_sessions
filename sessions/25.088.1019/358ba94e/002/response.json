            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the primary non-white color and extracted a 5x5 subgrid. However, the core logic, selecting the 5x5 subgrid with the *maximum count* of the primary color, was only correct for one out of the four examples (Example 3). In the other three examples, while the code did find a subgrid with a high density (often the maximum possible density) of the primary color, it was not the *correct* subgrid as defined by the expected output.\n\nThis indicates that the selection criterion is more complex than simply maximizing the count of the primary color. The failure cases (1, 2, 4) show that the expected output grid often has *fewer* primary color pixels than the grid selected by the previous code.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Patterns:** Re-examine the input grids and the corresponding *expected* 5x5 output grids. Identify the characteristics of the correct output grids beyond just pixel count. Look for structural patterns, frequency of occurrence within the input, or specific positional relationships.\n2.  **Compare Subgrids:** Compare the *expected* output subgrids with the *incorrectly generated* subgrids for the failed examples. Note the differences in structure and pixel counts.\n3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a new hypothesis for the selection criteria. Possibilities include:\n    *   Selecting the *most frequent* 5x5 pattern containing the primary color.\n    *   Selecting the pattern based on its location (e.g., the top-leftmost complete pattern).\n    *   Selecting based on a combination of frequency and density, or some other structural property.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the revised understanding of the selection process.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the counts and occurrences of the relevant 5x5 patterns.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\n1.  **Primary Color Count:** The previous code *did* correctly find the 5x5 subgrid containing the absolute maximum number of primary color pixels in all examples.\n2.  **Correctness:** Despite finding the maximum count, this subgrid was only the *correct* output for Example 3.\n3.  **Pattern Occurrences:**\n    *   The *Expected Output* pattern appears exactly once in the input grid for every example (Examples 1, 2, 3, 4).\n    *   The *Transformed Output* pattern (the one with the max count) appears once in Examples 1, 2, 3 and twice in Example 4.\n4.  **Location:** The location of the *Expected Output* pattern is different from the location of the *Maximum Count* pattern in Examples 1, 2, and 4. In Example 3, they are the same.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe simple \"maximum count\" rule is incorrect. The input grids contain several distinct 5x5 patterns formed using the primary color. The task seems to be selecting *one specific* 5x5 pattern from the input grid as the output.\n\nSince the *Expected Output* pattern occurs only once in each input grid, frequency doesn't seem to be the deciding factor (as the max-count pattern sometimes occurs more often, e.g., Example 4).\n\nWhat distinguishes the correct pattern? Let's reconsider the structure. The input grids seem composed of multiple, potentially overlapping, instances of these 5x5 patterns.\n\nCould the rule be to find *all* unique 5x5 patterns that contain the primary color, and then select one based on a specific criterion?\n\n*   Example 1: Expected pattern at (1, 12), Max-count pattern at (1, 1).\n*   Example 2: Expected pattern at (9, 3), Max-count pattern at (0, 14).\n*   Example 3: Expected/Max-count pattern at (10, 9).\n*   Example 4: Expected pattern at (8, 12), Max-count patterns at (1, 2) and (8, 3).\n\nThere isn't an obvious positional rule (like top-leftmost).\n\nLet's consider the *number* of distinct 5x5 patterns involving the primary color.\n\nHypothesis Refinement:\nPerhaps the task is to identify all distinct 5x5 subgrids present in the input. From these distinct subgrids, select the one that appears *most frequently* within the input grid. If there's a tie in frequency, apply a tie-breaking rule (e.g., the one with the highest count of the primary color, or the one appearing first in reading order).\n\nLet's test this:\n*   Example 1: Expected (count 22, freq 1) vs Transformed (count 23, freq 1). Tie in frequency. Tie-breaker? Max count -> Transformed. Incorrect.\n*   Example 2: Expected (count 21, freq 1) vs Transformed (count 22, freq 1). Tie in frequency. Tie-breaker? Max count -> Transformed. Incorrect.\n*   Example 3: Only one relevant pattern (count 24, freq 1). Correct.\n*   Example 4: Expected (count 22, freq 1) vs Transformed (count 23, freq 2). Most frequent -> Transformed. Incorrect.\n\nThis \"most frequent pattern\" hypothesis also seems incorrect.\n\nLet's look again at the *expected* patterns. They seem less \"dense\" than the maximum-density patterns found by the previous code. What if the rule involves finding a pattern that *repeats* but selecting the instance that *isn't* the most dense? This seems overly complex.\n\n**Alternative Idea: Pattern Prototyping**\n\nMaybe the input contains several variations of a core 5x5 pattern. The goal is to extract *the* canonical or most representative pattern. How is \"representative\" defined?\n\nConsider all 5x5 subgrids containing the primary color. Group them by their unique pattern. Count the frequency of each unique pattern. Select the pattern with the highest frequency. If there's a tie, choose the one that appears *first* (top-leftmost) in the input grid scanning order.\n\nLet's re-evaluate with this:\n1.  Find all unique 5x5 patterns containing the primary color.\n2.  Count frequency of each unique pattern.\n3.  Identify the pattern(s) with the highest frequency.\n4.  If only one pattern has the highest frequency, output it.\n5.  If multiple patterns tie for the highest frequency, find the first occurrence (top-leftmost corner) of *any* of these tied patterns in the input grid. Output the pattern found at that first location.\n\n*   Example 1: Expected (freq 1) at (1,12). Transformed (freq 1) at (1,1). Tie frequency = 1. First occurrence is the Transformed pattern at (1,1). Incorrect.\n*   Example 2: Expected (freq 1) at (9,3). Transformed (freq 1) at (0,14). Tie frequency = 1. First occurrence is the Transformed pattern at (0,14). Incorrect.\n*   Example 3: Only one pattern (freq 1) at (10,9). Correct.\n*   Example 4: Expected (freq 1) at (8,12). Transformed (freq 2) at (1,2) and (8,3). Highest frequency is 2 (Transformed pattern). Output Transformed pattern. Incorrect.\n\nThis refined frequency-based hypothesis still fails. The core logic is missing. The selection of the *correct* 5x5 pattern does not seem to be based solely on maximizing pixel count, overall frequency, or simple positional rules like top-leftmost. There must be another characteristic of the target pattern.\n\nLet's step back. The input contains multiple \"attempts\" at drawing a 5x5 pattern. The output is one specific instance of these patterns. Maybe the \"correct\" one is the *last* complete pattern found?\n\n*   Example 1: Expected at (1, 12). Max-count at (1, 1). Which is last? Need full scan.\n*   Example 2: Expected at (9, 3). Max-count at (0, 14). Which is last? Need full scan.\n*   Example 3: Only one at (10, 9). Last. Correct.\n*   Example 4: Expected at (8, 12). Max-count at (1, 2), (8, 3). Which is last? Expected is last.\n\nThis \"last pattern\" idea seems promising for Example 4, but needs checking on 1 & 2. Let's assume \"last\" means the pattern whose top-left corner has the largest row index, then the largest column index.\n\n*   Example 1: Expected (1, 12). Max-count (1, 1). Expected is last among these two. Potential Match.\n*   Example 2: Expected (9, 3). Max-count (0, 14). Expected is last among these two. Potential Match.\n*   Example 3: Only one (10, 9). Last. Match.\n*   Example 4: Expected (8, 12). Max-count (1, 2), (8, 3). Expected (8, 12) has the largest row (tie) and largest col index. Potential Match.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis 2: Last Occurring Pattern**\n\nThe transformation identifies *all* distinct 5x5 patterns present in the input grid that contain the primary color. It then selects the pattern corresponding to the instance whose top-left corner appears *last* in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid.\n\nThis seems plausible and fits the available data points better than previous hypotheses.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
