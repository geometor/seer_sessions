task_description: Extract a specific 5x5 pattern from the input grid.

input_features:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - size: variable height and width (1x1 to 30x30)
      - contains: background pixels (white, 0) and primary color pixels (non-zero)
  - object: primary_color
    properties:
      - type: integer (1-9)
      - derived_from: first non-white pixel encountered in reading order.
  - object: subgrid
    properties:
      - type: 5x5 2D array
      - derived_from: scanning the input grid
      - constraint: contains at least one pixel of the primary_color

output_features:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 5x5 2D array
      - derived_from: a specific 5x5 subgrid selected from the input grid

transformation_steps:
  1. Identification: Determine the primary non-white color from the input grid.
  2. Extraction: Identify all unique 5x5 subgrids within the input grid that contain the primary color.
  3. Mapping: For each unique 5x5 pattern, find all locations (top-left corner coordinates) where it occurs in the input grid.
  4. Selection: Determine the location (row, column) that is maximal according to reading order (maximize row, then maximize column) among all occurrences of all identified unique 5x5 patterns.
  5. Output: Return the 5x5 pattern corresponding to this maximal location.
