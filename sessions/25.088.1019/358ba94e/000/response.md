*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a large grid containing multiple instances of 5x5 patterns composed of white pixels (0) and one other primary color (magenta, azure, red, or orange in the examples).
    *   These 5x5 patterns appear scattered throughout the input grid.
    *   The patterns themselves vary slightly in the arrangement of their white and non-white pixels.
    *   The output is always a single 5x5 grid.
    *   The output grid corresponds to one of the 5x5 patterns present in the input grid.
    *   The specific 5x5 pattern chosen for the output seems to be the one that contains the highest number of non-white pixels compared to the other 5x5 patterns in the input.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Grid_Properties:
      - Input grid dimensions vary.
      - Output grid dimensions are consistently 5x5.
      - Grids contain pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
      - Input grids feature a background color (white, 0) and one primary non-white color.
    Objects:
      - Input_Grid: The source grid containing patterns.
      - Output_Grid: The target 5x5 grid.
      - Patterns: Multiple potential 5x5 subgrids within the Input_Grid. Each pattern consists of white and the primary non-white color.
      - Pixels: Individual cells within the grids, characterized by their color value.
    Properties_of_Patterns:
      - Size: 5x5.
      - Location: Defined by top-left corner coordinates within the Input_Grid.
      - Composition: Mix of white pixels and the primary non-white color.
      - Density: The count of non-white pixels within the 5x5 area.
    Transformation:
      - Action: Selection and Extraction.
      - Criterion: Identify the 5x5 subgrid (pattern) within the Input_Grid that has the maximum count of the primary non-white color pixels.
      - Result: The selected 5x5 subgrid becomes the Output_Grid.
    Relationships:
      - Containment: The Input_Grid contains multiple 5x5 Patterns.
      - Identity: The Output_Grid is identical to one specific Pattern from the Input_Grid.
      - Selection_Basis: The Pattern chosen for the Output_Grid is determined by maximizing the non-white pixel count within its 5x5 boundary.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the primary non-white color present in the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through all possible 5x5 subgrids within the input grid by considering every possible top-left starting position `(row, col)` such that `row + 5 <= height` and `col + 5 <= width`.
    3.  For each 5x5 subgrid extracted:
        a.  Count the number of pixels within that subgrid that match the identified primary non-white color.
    4.  Keep track of the 5x5 subgrid that has the highest count of the primary non-white color encountered so far. Store both the subgrid and its count. If multiple subgrids share the same maximum count, the first one encountered during the iteration is selected.
    5.  After checking all possible 5x5 subgrids, output the stored subgrid that corresponds to the maximum count found.
