preprocessing:
  - identify_objects: find contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - classify_objects:
      - type: shape_object (more than one pixel)
      - type: seed_pixel (exactly one pixel)
  - identify_template:
      - description: Find the shape_object whose color is not present among any seed_pixel colors.
      - properties:
          - color
          - relative_coordinates (shape pattern relative to top-left)
          - top_left_position
  - identify_seeds:
      - description: Find all seed_pixels.
      - properties:
          - color
          - position (row, col)

transformation:
  - operation: copy_paste_recolor
  - source_grid: input
  - target_grid: output (initialized as copy of input)
  - steps:
      - for each seed_pixel identified:
          - get seed_color from seed_pixel.color
          - get seed_position from seed_pixel.position
          - get template_shape from template.relative_coordinates
          - for each relative_coord in template_shape:
              - calculate target_coord = seed_position + relative_coord
              - if target_coord is within grid bounds:
                  - set pixel at target_coord in target_grid to seed_color

output_generation:
  - result: The target_grid after all copy_paste_recolor operations are completed.
