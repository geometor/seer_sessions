The output grid generally preserves the elements of the input grid but adds new colored shapes.\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain distinct objects, which are contiguous blocks of the same non-white color.\n3.  **Seed Pixels:** In each input grid, there are one or more isolated single pixels of a non-white color. These seem to act as \"seeds\" or \"anchors\".\n4.  **Template Shapes:** There is also at least one larger object in each input grid which seems to serve as a \"template\" shape. In the examples provided, this template shape is always blue (color 1).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves copying the template shape. For each seed pixel found in the input:\n    *   The template shape is replicated.\n    *   The replicated shape is colored using the color of the *seed* pixel.\n    *   The replicated, colored shape is placed onto the grid such that its top-left corner aligns with the location of the *seed* pixel.\n6.  **Identification Rule:** The template shape appears to be the non-white object whose color does *not* correspond to the color of any of the single seed pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Analyze the input grid to find all separate objects (contiguous areas of the same non-white color).\n3.  Distinguish between objects that are single pixels (\"seed pixels\") and objects that consist of multiple pixels (\"shape objects\").\n4.  Collect the colors of all identified seed pixels.\n5.  Identify the \"template shape\" by finding the shape object whose color is *not* among the collected seed pixel colors. Determine the pattern of this template shape (the positions of its pixels relative to its top-left corner).\n6.  Iterate through each identified seed pixel:\n    a.  Note the color and position (row, column) of the current seed pixel.\n    b.  Use the pattern of the template shape identified in step 5.\n    c.  For each pixel position in the template shape's pattern, calculate the corresponding position on the output grid by adding the relative coordinates of the template pixel to the seed pixel's position.\n    d.  Change the color of the pixel at this calculated position on the output grid to the color of the current seed pixel. Ensure this operation stays within the grid boundaries.\n7.  The final modified grid is the result."
