"""
1. Start with the output grid being an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Analyze the input grid to find all separate objects (contiguous areas of the same non-white color). An object is defined by its color and the set of coordinates it occupies.
3. Distinguish between objects that are single pixels ("seed pixels") and objects that consist of multiple pixels ("shape objects").
4. Collect the colors of all identified seed pixels.
5. Identify the "template shape" by finding the shape object whose color is *not* among the collected seed pixel colors. Determine the pattern of this template shape (the positions of its pixels relative to its top-left corner).
6. Iterate through each identified seed pixel:
    a. Note the color and position (row, column) of the current seed pixel.
    b. Use the pattern of the template shape identified in step 5.
    c. For each pixel position in the template shape's pattern, calculate the corresponding position on the output grid by adding the relative coordinates of the template pixel to the seed pixel's position.
    d. Change the color of the pixel at this calculated position on the output grid to the color of the current seed pixel. Ensure this operation stays within the grid boundaries.
7. The final modified grid is the result.
