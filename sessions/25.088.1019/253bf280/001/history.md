*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain a white background (0) and one or more azure pixels (8).
    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels (0) might be changed to green pixels (3).
    *   The green pixels appear exclusively on the straight-line paths *between* pairs of azure pixels.
    *   This filling only occurs when two azure pixels share the same row (horizontal alignment) or the same column (vertical alignment).
    *   If an azure pixel doesn't have a partner in the same row or column, or if there's only one azure pixel, no green pixels are added.
    *   The original azure pixels remain unchanged in the output.
    *   Multiple pairs can exist (both horizontal and vertical), and the filling happens for each identified pair independently.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - object: pixel
        properties:
          - color: white (0), azure (8), green (3)
          - location: (row, column) coordinates
    
    objects:
      - object: background
        type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: white (0)
      - object: marker
        type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: azure (8)
          - role: defines endpoints for paths
      - object: path_fill
        type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: green (3)
          - role: fills the space between marker pairs

    relationships:
      - type: alignment
        conditions:
          - two markers share the same row index (horizontal alignment)
          - two markers share the same column index (vertical alignment)
      - type: betweenness
        description: Applies to white pixels located on the straight-line segment connecting an aligned pair of markers.

    actions:
      - action: identify_pairs
        description: Find all pairs of azure (8) markers that are horizontally or vertically aligned.
      - action: fill_path
        description: For each identified pair, change the color of all white (0) pixels located strictly between the pair members on the line segment connecting them to green (3).
        target: white pixels between aligned azure pairs
        result: target pixels become green (3)
      - action: preserve
        description: All other pixels (azure markers, white background pixels not on a fill path) retain their original color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all locations of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through all unique pairs of azure pixels.
    3.  For each pair, check if they are aligned horizontally (same row index) or vertically (same column index).
    4.  If a pair is aligned horizontally:
        *   Identify the range of columns strictly between the two azure pixels in that row.
        *   For each column in this range, change the color of the pixel at that row and column from white (0) to green (3).
    5.  If a pair is aligned vertically:
        *   Identify the range of rows strictly between the two azure pixels in that column.
        *   For each row in this range, change the color of the pixel at that row and column from white (0) to green (3).
    6.  Ensure that original azure (8) pixels are never changed. Only white (0) pixels are changed to green (3).
    7.  The final grid contains the original azure pixels and the newly added green pixels on a white background.
