            "text": "Okay, the code execution reveals several things:\n\n1.  **Prompt Error**: The `Expected Output` grid displayed *inline* within the prompt for Example 2 was **different** from the `Expected Output` text block below it (which I used for my analysis initially). The calculation `num_diff_prompt=14` confirms that the code output differs from the text block by 14 pixels, matching the prompt's report.\n2.  **Actual Discrepancy**: The code output `Transformed` differs from the *inline* `Expected Output` (`expected_output_ex2` in the tool code) by 21 pixels.\n3.  **Nature of Difference**:\n    *   **Row 6**:\n        *   Expected (inline): `[2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   Transformed: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]`\n        *   The `Transformed` row IS the correct pattern row `dr=+2` relative to the green pixel at (4, 11). `r=4+2=6`. `c=11+(-4)=7` to `c=11+(+5)=16`. So cols 7-15.\n        *   The `Expected (inline)` row IS the correct pattern row `dr=+2` relative to the green pixel at (10, 3). `r=10+2=12`. `c=3+(-3)=0` to `c=3+(+5)=8`. So cols 0-8. **Wait**, the expected row 6 is identical to the pattern's `dr=+2` row relative to the *second* green pixel (10, 3), not the first one (4, 11)? That seems very strange. Why would the pattern from (4, 11) produce the row expected from (10, 3)? This suggests the pattern placement isn't solely based on the green pixel location, or the pattern itself changes.\n    *   **Row 12**:\n        *   Expected (inline): `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n        *   Transformed: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   The `Transformed` row IS the correct pattern row `dr=+2` relative to the green pixel at (10, 3), but clipped at the right edge (col 8). `r=10+2=12`. `c=3+(-3)=0` to `c=3+(+5)=8`. So cols 0-8.\n        *   The `Expected (inline)` row IS the correct pattern row `dr=+2` relative to the green pixel at (4, 11), shifted down? `r=4+2=6`. `c=11+(-4)=7` to `c=11+(+5)=16`. This row `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` doesn't match *any* simple placement of the pattern.\n\n4.  **Revisiting the Prompt's \"Expected Output\" Text Block**: Let's assume the text block `expected_output_ex2_prompt` *was* the correct target, despite the inline grid differing.\n    *   Row 6:\n        *   Prompt Exp: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]`\n        *   Transformed: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]`\n        *   Difference: The first 7 `2`s in the Prompt Expected are `0`s in Transformed. These correspond to columns 0-6. Are these influenced by the *other* pattern? Pattern 2 (center 10, 3) has its `dr=+2` row at row 12. It doesn't directly affect row 6. This `Prompt Exp` row 6 looks like a *combination* or modification.\n    *   Row 12:\n        *   Prompt Exp: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`\n        *   Transformed: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   Difference: The last 7 `2`s in the Prompt Expected (cols 9-15) are `0`s in Transformed. These correspond to columns 9-15. Are these influenced by Pattern 1 (center 4, 11)? Pattern 1 has its `dr=+2` row at row 6. It doesn't directly affect row 12. This `Prompt Exp` row 12 also looks like a combination/modification.\n\n**Hypothesis based on `expected_output_ex2_prompt` (14 errors):**\n\nIt seems like when patterns overlap, or perhaps just always, the `dr=+2` row (the bottom row with Azure) gets modified.\n*   For the pattern centered at (4, 11), its `dr=+2` row is Row 6. In `Prompt Exp`, Row 6 is `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]`. Compared to the standard `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]`, the first 7 `0`s have become `2`s.\n*   For the pattern centered at (10, 3), its `dr=+2` row is Row 12. In `Prompt Exp`, Row 12 is `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. Compared to the standard `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the last 7 `0`s have become `2`s.\n\nIt looks like the `dr=+2` row pattern: `2 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2` (relative columns -4 to +5) is being **extended** with Red (2) pixels to fill the entire width of the grid *on that specific row*.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n*   Grid width = 16.\n*   Pattern 1 (center 4, 11), `dr=+2` -> Row 6. Standard pattern covers columns 7 to 15 (`c=11+dc`). If we extend with Red(2) to fill cols 0-15: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2]` -> This matches `Prompt Exp` Row 6!\n*   Pattern 2 (center 10, 3), `dr=+2` -> Row 12. Standard pattern covers columns 0 to 8 (`c=3+dc`). If we extend with Red(2) to fill cols 0-15: `[2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` -> This matches `Prompt Exp` Row 12!\n\nThis looks like the correct rule. The overwrite logic still applies, but the pattern itself is slightly different for the `dr=+2` row; it extends horizontally with Red pixels.\n\n**Revised Strategy**: Modify the pattern application logic. For the `dr=+2` row specifically, after placing the standard pattern elements (`2`s and `8`s from dc=-4 to +5), fill the rest of that row (within grid bounds) with Red (2), potentially overwriting background (0) but not overwriting parts of *other* patterns placed later. A simpler way might be to fill the entire row with Red(2) *first*, then draw the `2 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2` part on top.\n\nLet's refine the plan:\n1.  **General Assessment**: The core logic of finding green pixels and placing a pattern is correct. The issue lies in the exact definition/application of the pattern's bottom row (`dr=+2`), which seems to extend horizontally with Red pixels across the grid width. The simple overwrite logic appears correct, assuming the pattern modification is applied correctly.\n2.  **Gather Metrics**: Confirmed grid dimensions and green pixel locations. The key finding is the difference between the simple overlay output and the target output, specifically on rows `r_center + 2`.\n3.  **YAML Facts**: Update the pattern description to include the extension rule for the `dr=+2` row.\n4.  **Natural Language Program**: Clearly state the pattern placement rule, including the modification for the bottom row.Okay, let's refine our understanding based on the analysis.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the green pixels and applied a fixed pattern centered on them. Example 1, with a single green pixel, was solved correctly. Example 2, with two green pixels, revealed an issue. The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output` (specifically, the version shown in the text block, which resulted in 14 errors as reported) indicates that the patterns don't just simply overwrite each other based on a fixed, static pattern definition.\n\nThe analysis using `tool_code` suggests that the bottom row of the pattern (at relative row `dr=+2`) behaves differently. Instead of just placing the sequence `Red Red Azure Azure Azure Azure Azure Red Red Red` (from `dc=-4` to `dc=+5`), this row appears to be extended with Red (2) pixels across the entire width of the grid *on that specific row*, while still containing the original Azure segment. The simple overwrite mechanism then applies when multiple patterns affect the same row.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the pattern application step: for the specific case of the pattern's bottom row (`dr=+2`), first fill the entire row with Red (2), and then draw the standard `2 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2` sequence over it at the correct relative columns.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
