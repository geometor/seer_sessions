The object's shape and color remain identical in the output grid. The transformation involves moving the object horizontally to the left. The amount of the shift varies between examples and seems dependent on the object's position and possibly its shape, specifically how its pixels occupy the top-left corner of its bounding box.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Determine the minimum row (`min_row`) and minimum column (`min_col`) occupied by any pixel of the object. This defines the top-left corner of the object's bounding box: (`min_row`, `min_col`).\n    3.  Identify the coordinates of the top-leftmost pixel that belongs to the object: Find the minimum row (`top_pixel_row`) that contains any object pixel, and then find the minimum column (`top_pixel_col`) among pixels in that `top_pixel_row`. The coordinates are (`top_pixel_row`, `top_pixel_col`). Note that `min_row` will always equal `top_pixel_row`.\n    4.  Compare the bounding box corner (`min_row`, `min_col`) with the top-leftmost pixel coordinates (`top_pixel_row`, `top_pixel_col`).\n    5.  If `min_col` is equal to `top_pixel_col` (meaning the top-left corner of the bounding box contains an object pixel), set the horizontal shift distance (`delta_c`) to be equal to `min_col`.\n    6.  Otherwise (if `min_col` is less than `top_pixel_col`, meaning the top-left corner of the bounding box is empty space relative to the object's shape), set the horizontal shift distance (`delta_c`) to be equal to `min_row`.\n    7.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid but with the object removed (all its pixels set to white).\n    8.  For each pixel of the original object located at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid, place a pixel of the same color at position (`r`, `c - delta_c`) in the output grid."
