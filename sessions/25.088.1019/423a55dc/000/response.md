*   **Perception:** Each input grid contains a single connected object of a uniform color (red, magenta, green, or azure) against a white background. The object's shape and color remain identical in the output grid. The transformation involves moving the object horizontally to the left. The amount of the shift varies between examples and seems dependent on the object's position and possibly its shape, specifically how its pixels occupy the top-left corner of its bounding box.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Move a single colored object horizontally to the left.
    elements:
      - element: background
        color: white (0)
        role: static canvas
      - element: object
        count: 1 per example
        property: single connected component of non-white color
        shape: variable (C-like, hollow square, S-like, rectangle, hollow rectangle)
        color: variable (red, magenta, green, azure)
        role: primary subject undergoing transformation
    transformation:
      action: horizontal translation (shift left)
      target: the single non-white object
      details:
        - The object's shape, color, and vertical position are preserved.
        - The amount of leftward shift (`delta_c`) is determined by the object's position and structure.
        - Find the object's bounding box top-left corner (min_row, min_col).
        - Find the actual top-leftmost pixel of the object (top_pixel_row, top_pixel_col).
        - condition: If (min_row == top_pixel_row) AND (min_col == top_pixel_col)
          shift_amount: `delta_c = min_col`
        - condition: Else
          shift_amount: `delta_c = min_row`
        - The final position is achieved by subtracting `delta_c` from the column index of every pixel belonging to the object.
    relationships:
      - The shift amount depends on the relationship between the bounding box's top-left corner and the actual top-leftmost pixel of the object.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single connected non-white object in the input grid. Note its color and the coordinates of all its pixels.
    2.  Determine the minimum row (`min_row`) and minimum column (`min_col`) occupied by any pixel of the object. This defines the top-left corner of the object's bounding box: (`min_row`, `min_col`).
    3.  Identify the coordinates of the top-leftmost pixel that belongs to the object: Find the minimum row (`top_pixel_row`) that contains any object pixel, and then find the minimum column (`top_pixel_col`) among pixels in that `top_pixel_row`. The coordinates are (`top_pixel_row`, `top_pixel_col`). Note that `min_row` will always equal `top_pixel_row`.
    4.  Compare the bounding box corner (`min_row`, `min_col`) with the top-leftmost pixel coordinates (`top_pixel_row`, `top_pixel_col`).
    5.  If `min_col` is equal to `top_pixel_col` (meaning the top-left corner of the bounding box contains an object pixel), set the horizontal shift distance (`delta_c`) to be equal to `min_col`.
    6.  Otherwise (if `min_col` is less than `top_pixel_col`, meaning the top-left corner of the bounding box is empty space relative to the object's shape), set the horizontal shift distance (`delta_c`) to be equal to `min_row`.
    7.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid but with the object removed (all its pixels set to white).
    8.  For each pixel of the original object located at (`r`, `c`) in the input grid, place a pixel of the same color at position (`r`, `c - delta_c`) in the output grid.
