task_description: Horizontally shift the single colored object to the left based on its position relative to its bounding box.

definitions:
  - object: A single connected group of pixels with the same non-white color.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all pixels of the object.
    properties:
      - min_row: The row index of the top edge.
      - min_col: The column index of the left edge.
  - top_leftmost_pixel: The pixel of the object with the minimum row index, and the minimum column index among those in the minimum row.
    properties:
      - top_pixel_row: The row index (always equals min_row).
      - top_pixel_col: The column index.

transformation_steps:
  - Step 1: Identify the single connected non-white object and its color.
  - Step 2: Determine the object's bounding box properties (min_row, min_col).
  - Step 3: Determine the object's top-leftmost pixel properties (top_pixel_row, top_pixel_col). Note: top_pixel_row is equivalent to min_row.
  - Step 4: Calculate the horizontal shift amount `delta_c`:
      - condition: If the top-left corner of the bounding box is occupied by an object pixel (i.e., `min_col == top_pixel_col`).
        action: Set `delta_c = min_col`.
      - condition: If the top-left corner of the bounding box is empty (i.e., `min_col < top_pixel_col`).
        action: Set `delta_c = min_row + (top_pixel_col - min_col)`.
  - Step 5: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
  - Step 6: For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the identified object:
      - Calculate the new position: `new_r = r`, `new_c = c - delta_c`.
      - If `new_c` is within the grid boundaries (>= 0), place the object's color at `(new_r, new_c)` in the output grid.

input_output_properties:
  - grid_size: Remains the same.
  - background_color: Remains the same (white, 0).
  - object_pixels:
      - count: Remains the same.
      - color: Remains the same.
      - relative_shape: Remains the same.
      - absolute_position: Shifted horizontally left by `delta_c`. Vertical position is unchanged.
