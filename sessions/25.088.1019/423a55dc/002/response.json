            "text": "The code execution confirms the properties and the calculated shift amount based on the revised hypothesis for Examples 1 and 3. It seems solid. Now I can confidently write the final response.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt failed because the logic for calculating the horizontal shift (`delta_c`) was incorrect for cases where the top-left corner of the object's bounding box was not occupied by an object pixel. The code correctly identified the object and its basic properties (bounding box, top-left pixel) but misapplied the rule in one specific scenario (observed in Example 3).\n\nThe analysis revealed two distinct cases for determining the horizontal shift:\n1.  When the object's top-leftmost pixel coincides with the bounding box's top-left corner.\n2.  When the object's top-leftmost pixel is to the right of the bounding box's top-left corner.\n\nBy examining all examples, a revised rule for calculating the shift was formulated that accounts for both cases and matches the expected output transformation across all provided examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered and confirmed through code execution and manual analysis for each example:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Object Color | Bbox (min_row, min_col) | Top Pixel (row, col) | Case (`min_col == top_pixel_col`) | Required Shift `delta_c` | Calculated `delta_c` |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------- |\n| 1       | (11, 13)    | (11, 13)     | Red (2)      | (3, 4)                  | (3, 4)               | True                                | 4                        | `min_col` = 4          |\n| 2       | (10, 11)    | (10, 11)     | Magenta (6)  | (3, 4)                  | (3, 4)               | True                                | 4                        | `min_col` = 4          |\n| 3       | (10, 13)    | (10, 13)     | Green (3)    | (3, 6)                  | (3, 7)               | False                               | 4                        | `min_row + (top_pixel_col - min_col)` = 3 + (7-6) = 4 |\n| 4       | (7, 7)      | (7, 7)       | Azure (8)    | (1, 1)                  | (1, 1)               | True                                | 1                        | `min_col` = 1          |\n| 5       | (10, 11)    | (10, 11)     | Azure (8)    | (2, 2)                  | (2, 2)               | True                                | 2                        | `min_col` = 2          |\n\n**Observations:**\n*   All examples contain a single connected object of a non-background color (white).\n*   The transformation involves shifting this object horizontally to the left. The vertical position remains unchanged.\n*   The amount of the horizontal shift (`delta_c`) depends on the object's position relative to its bounding box and potentially the row index of the top of the bounding box (`min_row`).\n*   The revised calculation for `delta_c` correctly predicts the shift required for all examples:\n    *   If `min_col == top_pixel_col`, `delta_c = min_col`.\n    *   If `min_col < top_pixel_col`, `delta_c = min_row + (top_pixel_col - min_col)`.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

If the object occupies the top-left corner of its bounding box (i.e., if `min_col` is equal to `top_pixel_col`), then the shift amount `delta_c` is equal to `min_col`.\n    b.  Otherwise (if `min_col` is less than `top_pixel_col`), the shift amount `delta_c` is calculated as `min_row + (top_pixel_col - min_col)`.\n5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Copy the object onto the output grid by taking each pixel `(r, c)` of the object from the input grid and placing its color at the coordinates `(r, c - delta_c)` in the output grid. Ensure that the destination column `c - delta_c` is not less than 0."
