*   **Perception:**
    *   Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0).
    *   There are exactly two non-white pixels in each input grid: one red pixel (2) and one green pixel (3).
    *   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of several azure pixels (8).
    *   The azure pixels form an 'L' shaped path.
    *   This path connects the row of the red pixel and the column of the green pixel.
    *   The path consists of a horizontal segment and a vertical segment meeting at a corner.
    *   The horizontal segment lies on the same row as the red pixel.
    *   The vertical segment lies on the same column as the green pixel.
    *   The path fills the grid cells between the red and green pixels along these two segments, excluding the cells occupied by the red and green pixels themselves. The cell at the intersection of the red pixel's row and the green pixel's column is also filled with azure.

```yaml
    Initial_State:
      grid_dimensions: variable (height, width <= 30)

            - type: corner_pixel

          relationship: connects the row of the red pixel and the column of the green pixel.
    Transformation_Rule:
      action: draw_path
      color: azure (8)
      path_definition:
        based_on: locations of red and green pixels
        steps:
          1: Identify coordinates (r_row, r_col) of the red pixel.
          2: Identify coordinates (g_row, g_col) of the green pixel.
          3: Determine the path coordinates:
             - Vertical segment: all cells (row, g_col) where row is strictly between r_row and g_row.
             - Horizontal segment: all cells (r_row, col) where col is strictly between r_col and g_col.
             - Corner point: the cell at (r_row, g_col).
          4: Change the color of the identified path cells in the grid to azure (8).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Locate the coordinates of the single red pixel (color 2); let its position be (red\_row, red\_col).
    3.  Locate the coordinates of the single green pixel (color 3); let its position be (green\_row, green\_col).
    4.  Draw a vertical line segment of azure pixels (color 8) in the column `green_col`. This segment starts from the row immediately below the topmost row of the two pixels (`min(red_row, green_row) + 1`) and ends at the row immediately above the bottommost row of the two pixels (`max(red_row, green_row) - 1`). Iterate through rows `r` from `min(red_row, green_row) + 1` to `max(red_row, green_row) - 1` and set the pixel at `(r, green_col)` to azure (8).
    5.  Draw a horizontal line segment of azure pixels (color 8) in the row `red_row`. This segment starts from the column immediately right of the leftmost column of the two pixels (`min(red_col, green_col) + 1`) and ends at the column immediately left of the rightmost column of the two pixels (`max(red_col, green_col) - 1`). Iterate through columns `c` from `min(red_col, green_col) + 1` to `max(red_col, green_col) - 1` and set the pixel at `(red_row, c)` to azure (8).
    6.  Set the pixel at the intersection point (`red_row`, `green_col`) to azure (8).
    7.  Return the modified grid.
