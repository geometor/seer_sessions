Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Each example involves a rectangular grid with a distinct border and an interior area.
2.  **Border:** The border is one pixel thick on all four sides. Each side (top, bottom, left, right, excluding corners) consists of a single, solid color. The border colors vary between examples but remain unchanged from input to output within each example.
3.  **Interior:** The interior of the grid (the area inside the border) initially contains mostly white pixels (0) and several scattered pixels of various other colors.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation happens within the interior of the grid. The border pixels are static.
5.  **Colored Pixels (Objects):** The non-white pixels within the interior can be considered individual objects.
6.  **Movement/Change:** In the output grid, some of these interior colored pixels appear to have moved to positions adjacent to the border, while others have disappeared (turned white).
7.  **Color Correlation:** The destination of a moved pixel seems correlated with its color and the color of the border sides. Pixels move towards the border side that matches their own color.
8.  **Movement Path:** The movement is orthogonal (straight up, down, left, or right) towards the matching border.
9.  **Disappearing Pixels:** Pixels whose color does not match any of the four border side colors disappear (become white).
10. **Final Position:** Moved pixels end up in the row or column immediately adjacent to the matching border edge, specifically within the same column (for vertical movement) or row (for horizontal movement) as their original position.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  - bordered: True
  - border_thickness: 1
  - border_composition: solid_color_sides (excluding corners)
  - border_static: True
objects:
  - type: individual_pixels
  - location: interior_only (initially)
  - property: color
actions:
  - action: move_pixel
    trigger: interior pixel color matches a border side color
    direction: orthogonal towards the matching border side
    destination: cell adjacent to the matching border side, in the original pixel's row (for horizontal move) or column (for vertical move)
    effect: original pixel location becomes white (0)
  - action: remove_pixel
    trigger: interior pixel color does not match any border side color
    effect: pixel location becomes white (0)
relationships:
  - pixel_color_matches_border_color: determines movement or removal
border_colors:
  - Top: Determined by input[0, 1]
  - Bottom: Determined by input[-1, 1]
  - Left: Determined by input[1, 0]
  - Right: Determined by input[1, -1]
output_grid_generation:
  - start_with: copy of input grid border
  - interior_initialization: all white (0)
  - populate_interior: place moved pixels at their destination adjacent to the border
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Copy the 1-pixel thick border from the input grid to the new grid.
3.  Initialize all interior cells (cells not part of the border) of the new grid to white (color 0).
4.  Identify the color of the top border (excluding corners), bottom border, left border, and right border from the input grid. Let these be `top_color`, `bottom_color`, `left_color`, and `right_color`.
5.  Iterate through each interior cell `(row, column)` of the *input* grid (from row 1 to height-2 and column 1 to width-2).
6.  Get the color of the current interior pixel from the input grid, let it be `pixel_color`.
7.  If `pixel_color` is not white (0):
    a.  If `pixel_color` is equal to `top_color`, set the pixel at `(1, column)` in the *new* grid to `pixel_color`.
    b.  Else if `pixel_color` is equal to `bottom_color`, set the pixel at `(height-2, column)` in the *new* grid to `pixel_color`.
    c.  Else if `pixel_color` is equal to `left_color`, set the pixel at `(row, 1)` in the *new* grid to `pixel_color`.
    d.  Else if `pixel_color` is equal to `right_color`, set the pixel at `(row, width-2)` in the *new* grid to `pixel_color`.
    e.  If `pixel_color` does not match any of the border colors, do nothing (the corresponding cell in the new grid remains white).
8.  The final state of the new grid is the output.
