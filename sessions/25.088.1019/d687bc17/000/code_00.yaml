task_type: object_transformation
grid_properties:
  - bordered: True
  - border_thickness: 1
  - border_composition: solid_color_sides (excluding corners)
  - border_static: True
objects:
  - type: individual_pixels
  - location: interior_only (initially)
  - property: color
actions:
  - action: move_pixel
    trigger: interior pixel color matches a border side color
    direction: orthogonal towards the matching border side
    destination: cell adjacent to the matching border side, in the original pixel's row (for horizontal move) or column (for vertical move)
    effect: original pixel location becomes white (0)
  - action: remove_pixel
    trigger: interior pixel color does not match any border side color
    effect: pixel location becomes white (0)
relationships:
  - pixel_color_matches_border_color: determines movement or removal
border_colors:
  - Top: Determined by input[0, 1]
  - Bottom: Determined by input[-1, 1]
  - Left: Determined by input[1, 0]
  - Right: Determined by input[1, -1]
output_grid_generation:
  - start_with: copy of input grid border
  - interior_initialization: all white (0)
  - populate_interior: place moved pixels at their destination adjacent to the border
