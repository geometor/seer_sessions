The output grids are filled with patterns corresponding to these seed colors. The patterns seem to expand outwards from the seed locations, filling the grid based on proximity. Where regions associated with different seeds meet, there appears to be a boundary condition. Pixels equidistant from two or more different colored seeds remain white. The transformation involves calculating distances from each grid cell to the initial seeds and assigning the color of the uniquely closest seed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
