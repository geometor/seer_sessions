            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects) of various colors, scattered across a background color. The background color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids and appear to be a composite image formed by overlaying the objects from the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the non-background objects, determining a central point or pixel, aligning all objects relative to this center, and then overlaying them onto a new grid. The background color of the input fills the empty spaces in the output.\n4.  **Centering Mechanism:** There seems to be a specific rule for determining the center:\n    *   If there is a single pixel of a unique color (different from the background and appearing only once in the input), that pixel's location defines the center point for alignment, and its color becomes the color of the central pixel in the output grid (overwriting any color from overlaid shapes at that position). Examples are the white (0) pixel in `train_1` and the magenta (6) pixel in `train_3`.\n    *   If no such unique single pixel exists (as in `train_2`), the center point for alignment is the geometric center of the 'plus' shaped object. The central pixel of the output then retains the color determined by the overlay process (in `train_2`, the center of the green 'plus' shape).\n5.  **Overlay Process:** Objects are layered onto the output grid based on their relative positions to the determined center point in the input. It appears that non-background colors overwrite the background color and potentially other non-background colors during the overlay. The order of overlay doesn't seem explicitly defined but results in a consistent final image.\n6.  **Output Grid Size:** The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the bounding box of the composite shape formed after overlaying all non-background objects relative to the center point.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find if there is exactly one pixel whose color is unique (appears only once) and is not the background color.\n    b.  If such a \"center pixel\" is found, record its color and coordinates. This is the alignment center.\n    c.  If no \"center pixel\" is found, locate the object shaped like a 'plus' sign. Record the coordinates of the central pixel of this 'plus' shape. This is the alignment center.\n4.  **Perform Overlay:**\n    a.  Imagine an infinite canvas centered at (0,0).\n    b.  For each non-background object identified in step 2:\n        i.  For each pixel within that object, calculate its coordinates relative to the alignment center found in step 3 (input\\_pixel\\_coord - alignment\\_center\\_coord).\n        ii. Place this pixel (with its original color) onto the canvas at these relative coordinates. If a pixel already exists at that location on the canvas, overwrite it.\n5.  **Determine Output Bounds:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column coordinates among all pixels placed on the canvas. This defines the bounding box of the composite shape. Calculate the height and width of this bounding box.\n6.  **Create Output Grid:**\n    a.  Create a new grid with the calculated height and width.\n    b.  Fill this grid entirely with the background color identified in step 1.\n    c.  Copy the pixels from the canvas that fall within the bounding box onto the output grid, adjusting their coordinates so the top-left pixel of the bounding box corresponds to the top-left (0,0) of the output grid.\n7.  **Set Center Color (if applicable):** If a \"center pixel\" was identified in step 3a, calculate the coordinates in the output grid that correspond to the canvas origin (0,0). Set the color of the pixel at these output coordinates to the color of the \"center pixel\" recorded in step 3b. (If alignment was based on the 'plus' shape's center, this step is skipped, and the center pixel retains the color assigned during the overlay).\n8.  **Return Output Grid:** The resulting grid is the final output."
