  - type: grid_layout
    description: Input and output grids are 16x11, structured as a 3x2 array of 5x5 pixel blocks separated by single white (0) pixel borders.
    block_coordinates: # Top-left corner (row, col), 0-indexed

  - type: object
    name: shape_block
    description: A 5x5 region of the grid potentially containing a pattern.
    properties:
      - position: The location of the block within the 3x2 layout (e.g., top-left, middle-right).
      - content_color: Primarily red (2) in the input.
      - background_color: White (0).
      - internal_pattern: The specific arrangement of red pixels within the 5x5 area.
      - connected_components: The number of distinct groups of connected red pixels (using 4-way adjacency) within the 5x5 block.
      - is_frame: A boolean property indicating if the pattern is a specific 5x5 frame shape (16 red pixels, 1 connected component, 1 central 3x3 hole).
actions:
  - name: change_color
    input_object: shape_block containing red (2) pixels.
    output_object: shape_block with original red pixels potentially changed to azure (8) or green (3).
    conditions: The change depends on the block's position, its internal pattern (specifically if it's a 'frame'), and the number of connected red components.
relationships:
  - type: positional_dependency
    description: The transformation rule applied to a shape_block depends on its specific position within the 3x2 grid layout, combined with its internal properties.
    rules:
      - IF shape_block is a 'frame' THEN change red(2) to azure(8).
      - IF position is (1,1) AND components=1 AND NOT 'frame' THEN change red(2) to green(3).
      - IF position is (6,1) AND components=1 AND NOT 'frame' THEN change red(2) to azure(8).
      - IF position is (6,6) AND components=1 AND NOT 'frame' THEN change red(2) to green(3).
      - IF position is (6,6) AND components=3 THEN change red(2) to azure(8).
      - IF position is (11,6) AND components=3 THEN change red(2) to green(3).
      - OTHERWISE, keep red(2).
