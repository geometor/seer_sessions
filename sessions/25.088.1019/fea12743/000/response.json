            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 16 rows by 11 columns. They appear to be structured as a 3x2 arrangement of 5x5 pixel \"blocks\", separated by single rows and columns of white pixels (color 0). The top-left corners of these blocks are at grid indices (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6), (11,1), and (11,6).\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain patterns primarily made of red pixels (color 2) within these 5x5 blocks, set against a white background. Each 5x5 block contains a distinct shape or pattern formed by the red pixels.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are modifications of the input grids. The white background and the overall 3x2 block structure remain unchanged. The transformation involves changing the color of the red pixels within *some* of the 5x5 blocks.\n4.  **Color Transformation:** Red pixels (2) are selectively changed to either azure (8) or green (3). Some red blocks remain unchanged.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The decision to change a block's color, and which color to change it to (azure or green), depends on both the internal pattern of the red pixels within the 5x5 block and the block's position within the 3x2 grid layout. Key properties seem to be the specific shape (e.g., a \"frame\" shape) and the number of connected components formed by the red pixels within the block.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n3.  For each of the six identified block locations:\n    a.  Extract the 5x5 subgrid corresponding to the current block location.\n    b.  Analyze the pattern of red (2) pixels within this 5x5 subgrid.\n    c.  Determine if the pattern constitutes a \"frame\" shape (a 5x5 square of red pixels with a 3x3 white center).\n    d.  Count the number of connected components formed by the red pixels within the 5x5 subgrid (using 4-way adjacency: up, down, left, right).\n    e.  Apply the following transformation rules based on the block's location (using 0-based row/column index of the top-left corner) and the analyzed properties. If a rule matches, change all red (2) pixels within that 5x5 block in the output grid to the specified new color and proceed to the next block:\n        i.  **General Frame Rule:** If the block is a \"frame\", change red (2) to azure (8).\n        ii. **Position (1, 1) Rule:** If the block is at (1, 1), has 1 connected component, and is NOT a \"frame\", change red (2) to green (3).\n        iii. **Position (6, 1) Rule:** If the block is at (6, 1), has 1 connected component, and is NOT a \"frame\", change red (2) to azure (8).\n        iv. **Position (6, 6) Rule 1:** If the block is at (6, 6), has 1 connected component, and is NOT a \"frame\", change red (2) to green (3).\n        v.  **Position (6, 6) Rule 2:** If the block is at (6, 6) and has 3 connected components, change red (2) to azure (8).\n        vi. **Position (11, 6) Rule:** If the block is at (11, 6) and has 3 connected components, change red (2) to green (3).\n    f.
