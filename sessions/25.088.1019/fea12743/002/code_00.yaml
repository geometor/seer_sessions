objects:
  - type: block
    description: 5x5 subgrids located at specific coordinates.
    pixels: Can contain white (0) and red (2) pixels initially.
properties:
  - name: position
    description: The 0-indexed (row, col) position of the block in the 3x2 layout.
    values: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)] corresponding to coords above.
  - name: pattern
    description: The specific configuration of red (2) pixels within the 5x5 block.
  - name: component_count
    description: Number of 4-connected components of red (2) pixels within the block.
actions:
  - name: recolor
    input: block (with red pixels)
    output: block (with red pixels changed to green or azure, or unchanged)
    conditions:
      - The decision to recolor and the target color depend on both the block's 'position' and its 'pattern'.
      - If the 'component_count' > 1, the block is never recolored (remains red).
    target_colors:
      - green: 3
      - azure: 8
      - red: 2 # Unchanged state
