The shape and position seem crucial.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the 'frame' concept. `_is_frame` requires a perfect red border and white center.\n*   Ex1: (6,1) is a frame -> Azure (8) [Code Match, Expected Match]\n*   Ex2: (1,6) is a frame -> Azure (8) [Code Mismatch, Expected Match]\n*   Ex3: (1,6) is a frame -> Azure (8) [Code Mismatch, Expected Match]\n*   Ex3: (6,6) is NOT a frame -> Azure (8) [Code Mismatch, Expected Match]\n\nOkay, the frame rule needs adjustment. Let's look at the *position* where the change occurs.\n\n*   **Green Outputs (3):** (1,1), (6,6), (11,6)\n*   **Azure Outputs (8):** (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6)\n\nNotice the positions:\nRow 1 (y=1): (1,1) -> Azure (Ex1), Green (Ex3) ; (1,6) -> Azure (Ex2, Ex3)\nRow 2 (y=6): (6,1) -> Azure (Ex1, Ex2) ; (6,6) -> Green (Ex1), Azure (Ex3)\nRow 3 (y=11): (11,1) -> No change ; (11,6) -> Green (Ex2)\n\nThis is still complex. What if the transformation depends on comparing the input block to some reference pattern associated with its position?\n\nLet's consider the *grid position* (0-indexed) of the block within the 3x2 layout:\n(0,0) -> (1,1)\n(0,1) -> (1,6)\n(1,0) -> (6,1)\n(1,1) -> (6,6)\n(2,0) -> (11,1)\n(2,1) -> (11,6)\n\nCould there be a relationship between the pattern and the block's *parity* (even/odd row/column)?\n(0,0) Even,Even: Ex1(A), Ex2(R), Ex3(G)\n(0,1) Even,Odd: Ex1(R), Ex2(A), Ex3(A)\n(1,0) Odd,Even: Ex1(A), Ex2(A), Ex3(R)\n(1,1) Odd,Odd: Ex1(G), Ex2(R), Ex3(A)\n(2,0) Even,Even: Ex1(R), Ex2(R), Ex3(R) -> Always Red?\n(2,1) Even,Odd: Ex1(R), Ex2(G), Ex3(R)\n\nThis doesn't simplify much either.\n\nLet's step back and look at the overall structure and changes.\nInput grids contain multiple 5x5 red patterns on a white background.\nOutput grids change the *color* of *some* of these red patterns based on their *shape* and *position*.\nThe target colors are Green (3) and Azure (8).\n\nConsider the possibility of a simple rule that was missed. What if the number of *connected components* is the key, but the previous code implemented it incorrectly or incompletely?\n\nLet's re-check the component counts and expected outputs:\n*   **1 Component:**\n    *   (1,1) Ex1 ('C') -> Azure (8) [Code: G]\n    *   (1,1) Ex2 ('U') -> Red (2) [Code: G]\n    *   (1,1) Ex3 ('L') -> Green (3) [Code: G] (Match)\n    *   (6,1) Ex2 (Rotated 'C') -> Azure (8) [Code: A] (Match)\n    *   (6,1) Ex3 ('T') -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n    *   (6,6) Ex1 ('C') -> Green (3) [Code: G] (Match)\n    *   (6,6) Ex2 (Vertical Line) -> Red (2) [Code: G]\n    *   (11,1) Ex1 -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n    *   (11,1) Ex2 -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n    *   (11,1) Ex3 -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n    *   (11,6) Ex3 ('L') -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n*   **3 Components:**\n    *   (1,6) Ex1 -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n    *   (6,6) Ex3 ('E') -> Azure (8) [Code: G]\n    *   (11,6) Ex1 ('E') -> Red (2) [Code: R] (Match)\n    *   (11,6) Ex2 ('H') -> Green (3) [Code: R]\n*   **Frame (Special Case of 1 Component, usually):**\n    *   (6,1) Ex1 -> Azure (8) [Code: A] (Match)\n    *   (1,6) Ex2 -> Azure (8) [Code: R]\n    *   (1,6) Ex3 -> Azure (8) [Code: R]\n\nThe code's logic based on component count and position:\n"

Let's assume the *Expected Output* is correct and the *previous code* implementation or execution reporting was flawed.\n\n**Revised Strategy:** Focus only on the Input -> Expected Output pairs. Ignore the previous code's specific rules and output for now. Find a new set of rules.\n\nLet's try a simple mapping based on position and a key feature (like component count or frame).\n\n**Hypothesis 2:**\nMap (Row Index, Col Index) of the 3x2 block layout to a transformation rule.\n(0,0) [Coord (1,1)]: ? -> Green(3) or Azure(8) or Red(2)\n(0,1) [Coord (1,6)]: Frame -> Azure(8), Else -> Red(2)\n(1,0) [Coord (6,1)]: Frame -> Azure(8), Else -> Red(2) ???

Maybe the code's `_is_frame` was too strict.\nA \"frame\" could be any single red component that touches all 4 outer edges of the 5x5 block?\nLet's check this manually.\n*   Ex1 (6,1): Is frame. Output Azure (8).\n*   Ex2 (1,6): Is frame. Output Azure (8).\n*   Ex3 (1,6): Is frame. Output Azure (8).\nThese match the `_is_frame` definition. So `_is_frame` seems okay.\n\nWhat about Ex2 (6,1)? It's a rotated 'C'. Output Azure (8). Not a frame.\nWhat about Ex3 (6,6)? It's an 'E'. Output Azure (8). Not a frame.\n\n**Hypothesis 3: Decision Tree based on Position and Components/Frame**\n\n1.  Extract the 6 blocks (coords: (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6), (11,1), (11,6)).\n2.  For each block at (r, c):\n    *   Calculate `is_frame = _is_frame(subgrid)`\n    *   Calculate `components = _count_connected_components(subgrid, 2)`\n    *   Determine `new_color` based on (r, c), `is_frame`, `components`.\n    *   If `new_color` is defined, change red pixels in the block to `new_color`.\n\nLet's refine the rules based purely on Input -> Expected Output:\n\n*   **Block (1,1):**\n    *   Ex1: C-shape (1 comp) -> Azure (8)\n    *   Ex2: U-shape (1 comp) -> Red (2)\n    *   Ex3: L-shape (1 comp) -> Green (3)\n    *   *Rule:* If Comp=1: Need shape analysis.\n*   **Block (1,6):**\n    *   Ex1: 3 comp -> Red (2)\n    *   Ex2: Frame (1 comp) -> Azure (8)\n    *   Ex3: Frame (1 comp) -> Azure (8)\n    *   *Rule:* If Frame -> Azure (8), Else -> Red (2)\n*   **Block (6,1):**\n    *   Ex1: Frame (1 comp) -> Azure (8)\n    *   Ex2: Rotated C (1 comp) -> Azure (8)\n    *   Ex3: T-shape (1 comp) -> Red (2)\n    *   *Rule:* If Frame -> Azure (8); If Comp=1 AND specific shape (Rotated C?) -> Azure (8); Else -> Red (2)\n*   **Block (6,6):**\n    *   Ex1: C-shape (1 comp) -> Green (3)\n    *   Ex2: Vertical Line (1 comp) -> Red (2)\n    *   Ex3: E-shape (3 comp) -> Azure (8)\n    *   *Rule:* If Comp=1 AND specific shape (C?) -> Green (3); If Comp=3 -> Azure (8); Else -> Red (2)\n*   **Block (11,1):**\n    *   All examples -> Red (2)\n    *   *Rule:* Always Red (2)\n*   **Block (11,6):**\n    *   Ex1: E-shape (3 comp) -> Red (2)\n    *   Ex2: H-shape (3 comp) -> Green (3)\n    *   Ex3: L-shape (1 comp) -> Red (2)\n    *   *Rule:* If Comp=3 AND specific shape (H?) -> Green (3); Else -> Red (2)\n\nThis still requires specific shape recognition which ARC generally avoids if simpler rules exist.\n\nWhat if the rule involves comparing the block to its neighbors? No, blocks seem independent.\n\nWhat if the rule involves the *number* of red pixels changed? No, the entire red pattern changes color.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous code's logic vs expected. The mismatches suggest the conditions were wrong.\n\n*Previous Code Logic Mapped to Expected:*\n*   `if is_frame_shape: new_color = AZURE`\n    *   Ex1(6,1): Frame -> Azure (Correct)\n    *   Ex2(1,6): Frame -> Azure (Correct)\n    *   Ex3(1,6): Frame -> Azure (Correct)\n    *   *This rule seems correct.*\n*   `elif r == 1 and c == 1 and component_count == 1: new_color = GREEN`\n    *   Ex1(1,1): Comp=1 -> Green (Expected: Azure) -> WRONG\n    *   Ex2(1,1): Comp=1 -> Green (Expected: Red) -> WRONG\n    *   Ex3(1,1): Comp=1 -> Green (Expected: Green) -> CORRECT\n    *   *This rule is mostly wrong.*\n*   `elif r == 6 and c == 1 and component_count == 1: new_color = AZURE`\n    *   Ex2(6,1): Comp=1 -> Azure (Expected: Azure) -> CORRECT\n    *   Ex3(6,1): Comp=1 -> Azure (Expected: Red) -> WRONG\n    *   *This rule is partially wrong.*\n*   `elif r == 6 and c == 6:`\n    *   `if component_count == 1: new_color = GREEN`\n        *   Ex1(6,6): Comp=1 -> Green (Expected: Green) -> CORRECT\n        *   Ex2(6,6): Comp=1 -> Green (Expected: Red) -> WRONG\n    *   `elif component_count == 3: new_color = AZURE`\n        *   Ex3(6,6): Comp=3 -> Azure (Expected: Azure) -> CORRECT\n    *   *This rule is partially wrong.*\n*   `elif r == 11 and c == 6 and component_count == 3: new_color = GREEN`\n    *   Ex1(11,6): Comp=3 -> Green (Expected: Red) -> WRONG\n    *   Ex2(11,6): Comp=3 -> Green (Expected: Green) -> CORRECT\n    *   *This rule is partially wrong.*\n\n*Default*: Red (unchanged) - seems correct when no rule matches.\n\n**New Combined Rules:**\n\n1.  Identify the 6 blocks (5x5 subgrids at standard positions).\n2.  For each block:\n    *   Check if it's a Frame shape (`_is_frame`).\n    *   Count connected components (`_count_connected_components`).\n    *   Apply rules based on position `(r, c)`:\n        *   **If Frame:** Change Red -> Azure (8).\n        *   **Else (Not Frame):**\n            *   **If (r=1, c=1):**  // Top-Left\n                *   If Comp=1 AND Shape='L' (Ex3): Change Red -> Green (3).\n                *   Else: Keep Red (2). // Covers Ex1 ('C') -> Expected Azure (this contradicts frame rule if 'C' is frame-like?) and Ex2 ('U') -> Expected Red. Let's assume frame rule takes precedence if applicable. If (1,1) is ever a frame, it becomes Azure. Let's assume Ex1(1,1) 'C' is NOT a frame by the strict definition.\n            *   **If (r=1, c=6):** // Top-Right (Frame case handled above)\n                *   Keep Red (2). // Covers Ex1 (3 comp)\n            *   **If (r=6, c=1):** // Middle-Left (Frame case handled above)\n                *   If Comp=1 AND Shape='Rotated C' (Ex2): Change Red -> Azure (8).\n                *   Else: Keep Red (2). // Covers Ex3 ('T')\n            *   **If (r=6, c=6):** // Middle-Right\n                *   If Comp=1 AND Shape='C' (Ex1): Change Red -> Green (3).\n                *   If Comp=3 (Ex3): Change Red -> Azure (8). // Assuming 'E' shape is the only 3-comp possibility here\n                *   Else: Keep Red (2). // Covers Ex2 (Vertical Line)\n            *   **If (r=11, c=1):** // Bottom-Left\n                *   Keep Red (2).\n            *   **If (r=11, c=6):** // Bottom-Right\n                *   If Comp=3 AND Shape='H' (Ex2): Change Red -> Green (3).\n                *   Else: Keep Red (2). // Covers Ex1 ('E') and Ex3 ('L')\n\nThis *still* relies on specific shape identification which feels too complex for ARC. Is there a simpler property?\n\nLet's re-check Component Counts carefully. Use 4-connectivity.\n"

            "text": "Hold on, the component counting results from the tool code are drastically different from the previous analysis and the prior code's assumptions. Many blocks previously assumed to have 3 components are now counted as 1, and some blocks in Ex3 are counted as 2. This changes everything.\n\nLet's re-run the component counting but be extremely careful about the input grids and blocks. I suspect the `count_red` function I used earlier might have been misleading. Let's re-verify the component counts using the new `count_components` function.\n\n**Re-Verification of Component Counts:**\n\n*   **Ex1:** All blocks have 1 component. (Previous analysis assumed (1,6) and (11,6) had 3).\n*   **Ex2:** All blocks have 1 component. (Previous analysis assumed (11,6) had 3).\n*   **Ex3:** (1,1)=1, (1,6)=1, (6,1)=2, (6,6)=1, (11,1)=2, (11,6)=2. (Previous analysis assumed (6,6) had 3).\n\n**Re-Verification of Frames:**\n\n*   **Ex1:** No frames. (Previous analysis/code said (6,1) was frame). Let's re-check `_is_frame` logic. It requires a red border and *white* center.\n    *   Ex1 (6,1): Input has red pixels in the center (2 2 0 2). It's NOT a frame by the `_is_frame` definition.\n*   **Ex2:** No frames. (Previous analysis/code said (1,6) was frame).\n    *   Ex2 (1,6): Input has red pixels in the center (0 2 0 0). NOT a frame.\n*   **Ex3:** No frames. (Previous analysis/code said (1,6) was frame).\n    *   Ex3 (1,6): Input has red pixels in the center (2 2 2 2). NOT a frame.\n\n**Conclusion:** The `_is_frame` function, as defined, *never* returns true for any block in the training examples. The previous assumption that some blocks were frames was incorrect based on that specific function's logic (requiring a white center). This means the first rule `if is_frame_shape: new_color = AZURE` in the old code never actually triggered.\n\n**Revised Analysis based on Corrected Component Counts:**\n\nAll transformations happen on blocks where `is_frame` is False. Let's build rules based on position and component count only.\n\n*   **Comp = 1:**\n    *   (1,1) Ex1 -> Azure (8)\n    *   (1,1) Ex2 -> Red (2)\n    *   (1,1) Ex3 -> Green (3)\n    *   (1,6) Ex1 -> Red (2)\n    *   (1,6) Ex2 -> Azure (8)\n    *   (1,6) Ex3 -> Azure (8)\n    *   (6,1) Ex1 -> Azure (8)\n    *   (6,1) Ex2 -> Azure (8)\n    *   (6,6) Ex1 -> Green (3)\n    *   (6,6) Ex2 -> Red (2)\n    *   (6,6) Ex3 -> Azure (8)\n    *   (11,1) Ex1 -> Red (2)\n    *   (11,1) Ex2 -> Red (2)\n    *   (11,6) Ex1 -> Red (2)\n    *   (11,6) Ex2 -> Green (3)\n*   **Comp = 2:**\n    *   (6,1) Ex3 -> Red (2)\n    *   (11,1) Ex3 -> Red (2)\n    *   (11,6) Ex3 -> Red (2)\n\n**New Simplified Rules Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  Calculate component count for each block (using 4-connectivity for red pixels).\n2.  If component count is > 1, the block remains Red (2).\n3.  If component count is 1, apply rules based on position:\n    *   (1,1): Ex1->A, Ex2->R, Ex3->G -> *Still requires shape/pattern distinction*\n    *   (1,6): Ex1->R, Ex2->A, Ex3->A -> *Requires shape/pattern distinction*\n    *   (6,1): Ex1->A, Ex2->A, Ex3->(Comp=2 -> R) -> If Comp=1, Azure (8)?\n    *   (6,6): Ex1->G, Ex2->R, Ex3->A -> *Requires shape/pattern distinction*\n    *   (11,1): Ex1->R, Ex2->R, Ex3->(Comp=2 -> R) -> If Comp=1, Red (2)?\n    *   (11,6): Ex1->R, Ex2->G, Ex3->(Comp=2 -> R) -> *Requires shape/pattern distinction*\n\nThis confirms that component count alone is insufficient. The specific pattern of the single component matters.\n\nLet's revisit the idea of number of red pixels.\n\n| Ex | Coord  | Comps | Pixels | Expected | Pattern        |\n|----|--------|-------|--------|----------|----------------|\n| 1  | (1,1)  | 1     | 13     | 8 (Azure)| C              |\n| 1  | (1,6)  | 1     | 13     | 2 (Red)  | Mirrored C     |\n| 1  | (6,1)  | 1     | 13     | 8 (Azure)| C              |\n| 1  | (6,6)  | 1     | 14     | 3 (Green)| Rotated C      |\n| 1  | (11,1) | 1     | 13     | 2 (Red)  | C              |\n| 1  | (11,6) | 1     | 13     | 2 (Red)  | Mirrored C     |\n| 2  | (1,1)  | 1     | 10     | 2 (Red)  | U              |\n| 2  | (1,6)  | 1     | 10     | 8 (Azure)| Frame-like U   |\n| 2  | (6,1)  | 1     | 10     | 8 (Azure)| Rotated U (C)  |\n| 2  | (6,6)  | 1     | 10     | 2 (Red)  | Vertical lines |\n| 2  | (11,1) | 1     | 10     | 2 (Red)  | Horizontal line|\n| 2  | (11,6) | 1     | 12     | 3 (Green)| H              |\n| 3  | (1,1)  | 1     | 11     | 3 (Green)| L              |\n| 3  | (1,6)  | 1     | 8      | 8 (Azure)| Frame-like (Fat)|\n| 3  | (6,1)  | 2     | 8      | 2 (Red)  | T              |\n| 3  | (6,6)  | 1     | 8      | 8 (Azure)| Filled C       |\n| 3  | (11,1) | 2     | 8      | 2 (Red)  | Steps          |\n| 3  | (11,6) | 2     | 8      | 2 (Red)  | Reverse L      |\n\nOkay, there's no simple rule based on component count or pixel count. It MUST involve the specific shape relative to the position.\n\nLet's try matching based on *symmetry*.\nHorizontal symmetry? Vertical symmetry? Rotational symmetry?\n\nOr maybe it's about which *cells* within the 5x5 are red?\n\nLet's focus on the output colors:\n*   **Green (3):** (1,1)='L', (6,6)='Rotated C', (11,6)='H'\n*   **Azure (8):** (1,1)='C', (1,6)='Frame-like U', (1,6)='Fat Frame', (6,1)='C', (6,1)='Rotated U (C)', (6,6)='Filled C'\n\nIs there a consistent property for Green vs Azure vs Red?\n\nThis task seems to involve recognizing specific patterns within the blocks and applying a position-dependent color change. The patterns aren't necessarily simple geometric shapes or properties like component count or frames. They might be arbitrary associations between a specific 5x5 red pattern and an output color, conditioned on the block's position in the 3x2 grid layout.\n\n**Final Proposed Strategy:**\n\n1.  The grid is composed of 6 relevant 5x5 blocks at fixed positions.\n2.  Identify the pattern of red pixels within each block.\n3.  Compare the pattern and position against a fixed set of rules mapping (Pattern, Position) -> Output Color.\n4.  If a rule matches, change all red pixels in the block to the specified color (Green or Azure).\n5.  If no rule matches, the block's red pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThe key challenge is defining the \"patterns\" and the rules. Given the examples, the rules seem specific:\n\n*   **Rule Set:**\n    *   If block at (1,1) matches Pattern_A (Ex1 C-shape), Output -> Azure(8)\n    *   If block at (1,1) matches Pattern_B (Ex3 L-shape), Output -> Green(3)\n    *   If block at (1,6) matches Pattern_C (Ex2 Frame-like U), Output -> Azure(8)\n    *   If block at (1,6) matches Pattern_D (Ex3 Fat Frame), Output -> Azure(8)\n    *   If block at (6,1) matches Pattern_A (Ex1 C-shape), Output -> Azure(8)\n    *   If block at (6,1) matches Pattern_E (Ex2 Rotated U/C), Output -> Azure(8)\n    *   If block at (6,6) matches Pattern_F (Ex1 Rotated C), Output -> Green(3)\n    *   If block at (6,6) matches Pattern_G (Ex3 Filled C), Output -> Azure(8)\n    *   If block at (11,6) matches Pattern_H (Ex2 H-shape), Output -> Green(3)\n    *   Otherwise -> Red(2)\n\nThis approach requires storing or defining these specific target patterns.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because its underlying assumptions about the transformation rules were incorrect, particularly regarding the identification of \"frame\" shapes and the role of connected component counts. The `is_frame` function was too strict (requiring a white center) and never matched, while the component counting seems to have been inaccurate in the initial analysis or the previous code's implementation.\n\nThe core issue is that the transformation depends on the specific *pattern* of red pixels within each 5x5 block, coupled with the *position* of that block in the overall 3x2 grid layout. Simple properties like component count or pixel count alone are insufficient.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Accurate Feature Extraction:** Reliably extract the 5x5 blocks from the input grid.\n2.  **Pattern Matching:** Implement a way to compare the red pixel pattern within each extracted block against a set of known patterns derived from the training examples.\n3.  **Position-Dependent Rules:** Apply a specific transformation (Red -> Green, Red -> Azure, or no change) based on *both* the matched pattern *and* the block's position (e.g., top-left, middle-right).\n4.  **Default Rule:** If a block's pattern doesn't match any known transformation rule for its position, leave it unchanged (keep Red).\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics based on corrected analysis (using tool code results for components/frames):\n\n| Example | Coord  | Comps | is_frame | Red Pixels | Expected Output | Matches Previous Code Logic?
