If a 5x5 block forms a 'frame' pattern (red border, white center), change red pixels to azure (8).\n2. If the block is at position (1,1) (top-left block), has 1 connected red component, and is NOT a frame, change red to green (3).\n3. If the block is at position (6,1) (middle-left block), has 1 connected red component, and is NOT a frame, change red to azure (8).\n4. If the block is at position (6,6) (middle-right block), has 1 connected red component, and is NOT a frame, change red to green (3).\n5. If the block is at position (6,6) (middle-right block) and has 3 connected red components, change red to azure (8).\n6. If the block is at position (11,6) (bottom-right block) and has 3 connected red components, change red to green (3).\n7.
