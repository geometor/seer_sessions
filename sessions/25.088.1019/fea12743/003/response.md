"""
Transforms the input grid by changing the color of red (2) pixels within specific 5x5 blocks based on the block's position and its exact red pixel pattern.

The grid is treated as a 3x2 layout of 5x5 blocks separated by white (0) borders.
The transformation rules are derived from matching specific patterns observed in the training examples at specific block coordinates:

1. Identify the 6 relevant 5x5 blocks at coordinates (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6), (11,1), (11,6).
2. For each block:
   a. Count the 4-connected components of red (2) pixels.
   b. If the count is greater than 1, the block remains unchanged (red).
   c. If the count is exactly 1, compare the block's pattern of red pixels against a known set of patterns associated with transformations:
      - At (1,1): If pattern matches Example 1 (C-like), change red to azure (8). If pattern matches Example 3 (L-like), change red to green (3).
      - At (1,6): If pattern matches Example 2 (Frame-like U) OR Example 3 (Fat Frame), change red to azure (8).
      - At (6,1): If pattern matches Example 1 (C-like) OR Example 2 (Rotated U/C), change red to azure (8).
      - At (6,6): If pattern matches Example 1 (Rotated C), change red to green (3). If pattern matches Example 3 (Filled C), change red to azure (8).
      - At (11,6): If pattern matches Example 2 (H-shape), change red to green (3).
   d. If a block has 1 component but does not match any specific transformation rule for its position, it remains unchanged (red).
3. Construct the output grid with the applied color changes.
