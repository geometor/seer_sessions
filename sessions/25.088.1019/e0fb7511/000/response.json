The output grids introduce a new color, azure (8), while retaining white (0) and blue (1).\n3.  **Constancy:** Blue pixels in the input remain blue pixels in the output at the same positions.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels in the input to azure (8) pixels in the output. Other white pixels remain white.\n5.  **Identifying the Changed Pixels:** The white pixels that change to azure appear to be those that are \"enclosed\" or \"surrounded\" by blue pixels.\n6.  **Defining Enclosure:** A white pixel seems to be considered \"enclosed\" if it belongs to a contiguous region of white pixels (connected cardinally) that does not touch any edge of the grid. Conversely, white pixels belonging to a region that touches any part of the grid's border remain white.\n7.  **Mechanism:** This suggests a \"flood fill\" or reachability analysis. Starting from all white pixels on the border, we can find all other white pixels reachable from them by moving cardinally through white pixels. Any white pixel *not* reached by this process is considered enclosed and changes color to azure (8).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
