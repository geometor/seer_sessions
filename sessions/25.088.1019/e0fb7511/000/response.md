## Perception

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples (13x13).
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grids introduce a new color, azure (8), while retaining white (0) and blue (1).
3.  **Constancy:** Blue pixels in the input remain blue pixels in the output at the same positions.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels in the input to azure (8) pixels in the output. Other white pixels remain white.
5.  **Identifying the Changed Pixels:** The white pixels that change to azure appear to be those that are "enclosed" or "surrounded" by blue pixels.
6.  **Defining Enclosure:** A white pixel seems to be considered "enclosed" if it belongs to a contiguous region of white pixels (connected cardinally) that does not touch any edge of the grid. Conversely, white pixels belonging to a region that touches any part of the grid's border remain white.
7.  **Mechanism:** This suggests a "flood fill" or reachability analysis. Starting from all white pixels on the border, we can find all other white pixels reachable from them by moving cardinally through white pixels. Any white pixel *not* reached by this process is considered enclosed and changes color to azure (8).

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Color enclosed white regions
Input_Colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), blue (1), azure (8)]
Grid_Properties:
  - Size remains constant between input and output.
Pixel_Transformations:
  - Blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels can either remain white (0) or change to azure (8).
Condition_for_Change:
  - A white (0) pixel changes to azure (8) if it is part of a contiguous area (cardinal adjacency) of white pixels that does not have any cell touching the border of the grid.
  - A white (0) pixel remains white (0) if it is part of a contiguous area (cardinal adjacency) of white pixels where at least one cell touches the border of the grid.
Implicit_Objects:
  - Contiguous regions of white pixels.
  - The grid border.
Relationships:
  - Reachability: Determining if a white pixel region can reach the grid border.
  - Adjacency: Cardinal neighbours are used to define regions and reachability.
Process:
  - Identify border white pixels.
  - Perform reachability analysis (e.g., flood fill, BFS, DFS) starting from border white pixels, moving only through white pixels.
  - Mark all reachable white pixels.
  - Change unmarked white pixels to azure (8).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a boolean grid `reachable_from_border` of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized to `False`.
3.  Create a queue or stack for performing a search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search).
4.  Iterate through all cells on the border (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, rightmost column) of the input grid.
5.  If a border cell `(r, c)` contains a white pixel (0) and `reachable_from_border[r][c]` is `False`:
    a.  Mark `reachable_from_border[r][c]` as `True`.
    b.  Add the cell coordinates `(r, c)` to the search queue/stack.
6.  While the search queue/stack is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue/pop a cell `(r, c)`.
    b.  Examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right): `(nr, nc)`.
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` that is within the grid boundaries:
        i.  If the neighbor cell `input[nr][nc]` contains a white pixel (0) and `reachable_from_border[nr][nc]` is `False`:
            1. Mark `reachable_from_border[nr][nc]` as `True`.
            2. Add the neighbor coordinates `(nr, nc)` to the search queue/stack.
7.  After the search is complete, iterate through every cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
8.  If the input cell `input[r][c]` contains a white pixel (0) and `reachable_from_border[r][c]` is `False`, change the corresponding cell in the output grid `output[r][c]` to azure (8).
9.  Return the final output grid.
