Task: Color enclosed white regions
Input_Colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
Output_Colors: [white (0), blue (1), azure (8)]
Grid_Properties:
  - Size remains constant between input and output.
Pixel_Transformations:
  - Blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
  - White (0) pixels can either remain white (0) or change to azure (8).
Condition_for_Change:
  - A white (0) pixel changes to azure (8) if it is part of a contiguous area (cardinal adjacency) of white pixels that does not have any cell touching the border of the grid.
  - A white (0) pixel remains white (0) if it is part of a contiguous area (cardinal adjacency) of white pixels where at least one cell touches the border of the grid.
Implicit_Objects:
  - Contiguous regions of white pixels.
  - The grid border.
Relationships:
  - Reachability: Determining if a white pixel region can reach the grid border.
  - Adjacency: Cardinal neighbours are used to define regions and reachability.
Process:
  - Identify border white pixels.
  - Perform reachability analysis (e.g., flood fill, BFS, DFS) starting from border white pixels, moving only through white pixels.
  - Mark all reachable white pixels.
  - Change unmarked white pixels to azure (8).
