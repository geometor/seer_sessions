Identify the cluster of red (2) pixels and the cluster of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Treat the background color as orange (7).\n2.  Calculate the center (centroid) of the red and gray clusters.\n3.  Determine the axis (row or column) with the largest absolute difference between the centroids. If the differences are equal, prioritize the vertical axis (row difference).\n4.  Determine the movement vector (dr, dc) for the red cluster. It moves 2 steps along the determined axis, in a direction that increases the distance from the gray cluster centroid.\n    - If vertical axis is chosen (abs(red_row - gray_row) >= abs(red_col - gray_col)):\n        - If red is above gray (red_row < gray_row), move DOWN (dr=2, dc=0).\n        - If red is below gray (red_row > gray_row), move UP (dr=-2, dc=0).\n    - If horizontal axis is chosen (abs(red_col - gray_col) > abs(red_row - gray_row)):\n        - If red is left of gray (red_col < gray_col), move RIGHT (dr=0, dc=2).\n        - If red is right of gray (red_col > gray_col), move LEFT (dr=0, dc=-2).\n5.  Create the output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.\n6.  Clear the original positions of the red pixels in the output grid (set to background color 7).\n7.  Draw the red pixels at their new positions (original position + movement vector) in the output grid.\n8.  Determine a specific source gray pixel coordinate (sr, sc) based *only* on the red movement vector:\n    - Red moved Right (0, 2): source is (6, 5).\n    - Red moved Down (2, 0): source is (7, 5).\n    - Red moved Up (-2, 0): source is (7, 5).\n    - (Assume a rule for Left (0, -2) if needed, though not in examples).\n9.  Determine a specific target coordinate (tr, tc) for the gray pixel, also based *only* on the red movement vector:\n    - Red moved Right (0, 2): target is (5, 5).\n    - Red moved Down (2, 0): target is (8, 4).\n    - Red moved Up (-2, 0): target is (5, 3).\n    - (Assume a rule for Left (0, -2) if needed).\n10. Check if the input grid actually contains a gray pixel at the determined source coordinate (sr, sc).\n11. If it does:\n    a. Remove the gray pixel from the source coordinate (sr, sc) in the output grid (set to background color 7).\n    b. Add a gray pixel at the target coordinate (tr, tc) in the output grid (ensure within bounds).\n12. All other pixels (background, other gray pixels not involved in the specific move) remain unchanged from their input positions.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous objects of a given color using BFS.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros"
