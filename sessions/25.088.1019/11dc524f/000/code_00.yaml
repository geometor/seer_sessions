Grid:
  Size: Constant between input and output (e.g., 13x13).
  Background: Color orange (7), remains unchanged.
Objects:
  - Name: Red Object
    Color: 2 (Red)
    Property: Contiguous group of pixels.
    Action: Moves 2 steps relative to the grid.
    Relationship: Its movement direction is determined by the relative position of the Gray Object. It moves away from the Gray Object along the axis (row or column) of greatest separation between their centroids.
  - Name: Gray Object
    Color: 5 (Gray)
    Property: Contiguous group of pixels (initially).
    Action: 
      - Most pixels remain stationary relative to the grid.
      - Special handling for the pixel at input coordinates (row=6, col=5):
        - If a gray pixel exists at (6, 5) in the input:
          - This pixel is removed from (6, 5) in the output.
          - A new gray pixel is added at a target location dependent on the Red Object's movement direction:
            - If Red moved Right (+2 cols): target is (5, 5).
            - If Red moved Down (+2 rows): target is (8, 4).
            - If Red moved Up (-2 rows): target is (5, 3).
        - If no gray pixel exists at (6, 5) in the input, no special action occurs for this coordinate.
    Relationship: Influences the movement direction of the Red Object. Undergoes a partial transformation dependent on the Red Object's movement.
