            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same size (13x13 in all examples).\n2.  **Colors:** The dominant color is orange (7), acting as the background. There are two other colors present: red (2) and gray (5).\n3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there are two distinct objects: one composed of red pixels and one composed of gray pixels. The shapes of these objects vary between examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, both the red and gray objects change position, and sometimes the gray object appears to change shape or have pixels added/removed/moved individually. The background remains static.\n5.  **Red Object Movement:** The red object undergoes a clear translation (shift). In example 1, it moves right. In example 2, it moves down. In example 3, it moves up. The magnitude of the shift seems to be 2 pixels. The direction appears related to the relative position of the gray object: the red object moves *away* from the gray object along the axis (horizontal or vertical) where they are most separated.\n6.  **Gray Object Transformation:** The gray object's transformation is less straightforward. Most of its pixels seem to stay in place relative to the grid, but specific pixels change. Notably, the pixel at grid coordinates (row 6, column 5) seems to play a special role. If a gray pixel exists at this input coordinate, it is moved to a new location in the output, and this new location depends on the direction the *red* object moved. In example 2, the input gray object has a pixel at (6,5), but the output gray object does not; instead, a new gray pixel appears elsewhere.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Calculate the center (e.g., centroid) of the red cluster and the gray cluster.\n3.  Determine the difference in row coordinates and column coordinates between the centers.\n4.  Identify the axis (row or column) with the larger absolute difference. This is the primary axis of interaction.\n5.  Determine the direction of movement for the red cluster: it moves 2 steps along the primary axis, in the direction that increases the distance from the gray cluster. For example, if the gray cluster is primarily below the red cluster (larger row difference, gray row > red row), the red cluster moves 2 steps up (row coordinate decreases by 2). If the gray cluster is primarily to the right (larger column difference, gray col > red col), the red cluster moves 2 steps left (column coordinate decreases by 2). Record this movement vector (e.g., `(-2, 0)` for up, `(0, 2)` for right).\n6.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n7.  Relocate the red cluster: Remove all red pixels from their original positions in the output grid and redraw them at their new positions, shifted by the movement vector calculated in step 5.\n8.  Check the input grid for a gray pixel at the specific coordinate (row 6, column 5).\n9.  If a gray pixel exists at input coordinate (6, 5):\n    a.  Remove the gray pixel from coordinate (6, 5) in the output grid.\n    b.  Determine the target coordinate based on the red cluster's movement:\n        *   If the red cluster moved right (vector `(0, 2)`), the target is (5, 5).\n        *   If the red cluster moved down (vector `(2, 0)`), the target is (8, 4).\n        *   If the red cluster moved up (vector `(-2, 0)`), the target is (5, 3).\n        *   (Note: Movement left was not observed in examples, but would need a rule if possible).\n    c.  Add a gray pixel to the determined target coordinate in the output grid.\n10. All other gray pixels from the input grid remain in their original positions in the output grid. The orange background remains unchanged."
