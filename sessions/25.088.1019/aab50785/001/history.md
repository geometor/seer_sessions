Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a grid of varying dimensions containing pixels of different colors (0-9).
2.  **Key Objects:** The most salient objects consistently present in the inputs are 2x2 squares composed entirely of the gray color (value 8).
3.  **Object Relationships:** These gray squares appear in pairs. Crucially, the squares within each pair always occupy the exact same set of rows. For instance, if one square of a pair is at rows `r` and `r+1`, the other square of that pair will also be at rows `r` and `r+1`. One square in the pair is always located horizontally to the left of the other.
4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. It seems to be constructed from pieces of the input grid.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve locating these pairs of gray squares and extracting the rectangular region of the input grid that lies horizontally *between* the two squares of each pair. If multiple such pairs exist, the extracted regions are stacked vertically in the output, ordered by the row position of the pairs in the input grid (topmost pair's region comes first).

**Facts (YAML):**

```

task_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - Variable dimensions (height, width)
      - Contains pixels with colors 0-9
  - type: Object
    identifier: Gray Square Marker
    properties:
      - Shape: 2x2 square
      - Color: Gray (8)
      - Role: Delimiter / Boundary marker
relationships:
  - type: Pairing
    description: Gray Square Markers are grouped into pairs.
    condition: Both markers in a pair occupy the exact same row indices in the input grid.
  - type: Spatial Relationship (within pair)
    description: One marker is always horizontally to the left of the other marker in the same pair.
  - type: Spatial Relationship (between pairs)
    description: Pairs can occur at different row positions within the input grid.
transformation:
  - action: Identify
    target: All 2x2 squares of Gray (8) pixels.
  - action: Group
    target: Identified Gray Square Markers.
    rule: Group into pairs based on shared row indices.
  - action: Define Region
    target: For each pair of Gray Square Markers.
    rule: The region consists of the pixels located in the same rows as the markers, but in the columns strictly between the right edge of the left marker and the left edge of the right marker.
  - action: Extract
    target: Defined regions from the input grid.
  - action: Order
    target: Extracted regions.
    rule: Sort based on the top row index of the originating pair in the input grid (ascending order).
  - action: Assemble
    target: Ordered extracted regions.
    rule: Concatenate vertically to form the final output grid.
