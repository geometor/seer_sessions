"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all 2x2 squares composed entirely of gray pixels (color 8) in the input grid.
2. Group these gray squares into pairs where both squares in a pair share the exact same starting row index. Within each pair, one square is to the left of the other.
3. For each identified pair of gray squares located at top-left corners (r, c_left) and (r, c_right), extract the rectangular region from the input grid. This region spans the same two rows as the squares (rows r and r+1) and the columns strictly between the right edge of the left square and the left edge of the right square (columns c_left + 2 to c_right - 1).
4. Sort these pairs based on their row index 'r' in ascending order.
5. Vertically stack the extracted regions corresponding to the sorted pairs to form the final output grid.
