Crucially, the squares within each pair always occupy the exact same set of rows. For instance, if one square of a pair is at rows `r` and `r+1`, the other square of that pair will also be at rows `r` and `r+1`. One square in the pair is always located horizontally to the left of the other.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. It seems to be constructed from pieces of the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve locating these pairs of gray squares and extracting the rectangular region of the input grid that lies horizontally *between* the two squares of each pair. If multiple such pairs exist, the extracted regions are stacked vertically in the output, ordered by the row position of the pairs in the input grid (topmost pair's region comes first).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n```"
