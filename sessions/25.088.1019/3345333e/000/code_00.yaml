task_description: Identify and remove a solid rectangular object, revealing the underlying persistent object and background.

elements:
  - element: background
    color_name: white
    color_value: 0
    properties: Fills the grid where no other objects are present.

  - element: object_1
    in_example_train_2:
      color_name: magenta
      color_value: 6
      description: A complex shape with internal spaces, not forming a solid rectangle.
      role: persistent_object
    properties:
      - shape: non-rectangular
      - persistence: remains in the output grid

  - element: object_2
    in_example_train_2:
      color_name: blue

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The masking_object (blue square) overlaps parts of the persistent_object (magenta shape) and the background.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous non-background colored objects in the input grid.
  - action: classify_objects
    description: Determine which object is a solid rectangle (masking_object) and which is not (persistent_object).
  - action: filter_grid
    description: Create the output grid containing only the pixels belonging to the persistent_object, placed on the background color.
