The blue square is completely absent.\n4.  **Transformation:** The blue square object has been removed. Where the blue square previously overlapped the magenta object, the magenta color is now visible in the output. Where the blue square was on the white background, the output now shows the white background.\n5.  **Inferred Rule:** The transformation identifies the object that is a solid rectangle (the blue square in this example) and removes it, revealing whatever was underneath (either the other colored object or the background). The non-rectangular object (magenta) remains unchanged. This suggests a process of finding a \"mask\" object (the solid rectangle) and deleting it, keeping only the \"persistent\" object (the non-rectangle) and the background.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.\n3.  For each unique color, find all connected components (objects) of that color.\n4.  Analyze the shape of each identified object: determine its bounding box and check if the object perfectly fills that bounding box (i.e., it's a solid rectangle).\n5.  Identify the object that is a solid rectangle; this is the `masking_object`.\n6.  Identify the other non-background object(s); these are the `persistent_object`(s). Let the color of the primary persistent object be `persistent_color`. (Assuming only one persistent object based on examples).\n7.  Iterate through every cell `(row, col)` of the input grid.\n8.  If the color of the input cell `input[row][col]` is equal to `persistent_color`, set the corresponding cell `output[row][col]` in the output grid to `persistent_color`.\n9.
