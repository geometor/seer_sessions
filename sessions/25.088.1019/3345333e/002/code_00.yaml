task_description: Remove a masking object (defined as a color forming a single, solid rectangular component) to reveal the underlying object(s).

examples:
  - id: 1
    input_colors: [Red(2), Green(3)]
    objects:
      - color: Red(2)
        components:
          - shape: solid_rectangle (1x1) # Single pixel component
            pixels: 1
          - shape: complex
            pixels: 30
        is_mask: false
      - color: Green(3)
        components:
          - shape: solid_rectangle (4x4)
            pixels: 16
        is_mask: true # Only one component, and it's a solid rectangle
    action: Remove Green(3) pixels.
    output_content: Pixels of Red(2) from the input.

  - id: 2
    input_colors: [Blue(1), Magenta(6)]
    objects:
      - color: Blue(1)
        components:
          - shape: solid_rectangle (4x3)
            pixels: 12
        is_mask: true # Only one component, and it's a solid rectangle
      - color: Magenta(6)
        components:
          - shape: complex
            pixels: 21
          - shape: solid_rectangle (1x2)
            pixels: 2
        is_mask: false # Multiple components
    action: Remove Blue(1) pixels.
    output_content: Pixels of Magenta(6) from the input.

observations:
  - Background color is always White(0).
  - Inputs contain exactly two non-background colors.
  - One color (the 'mask') forms exactly one connected component, which is a solid rectangle.
  - The other color (the 'persistent object') may form one or more components, at least one of which is not a solid rectangle (or it may have multiple components even if some are rectangles).
  - The transformation removes all pixels of the 'mask' color.
  - The output grid retains all pixels of the 'persistent object' color(s) in their original positions, with the rest being the background color.
