task_description: Processes grids containing a background color (White 0) and exactly two other object colors. One object acts as a mask, the other as a persistent object. The mask removes parts of the persistent object it overlaps.

definitions:
  - background_color: White(0)
  - object_colors: Two distinct colors present in the input grid, other than the background color.
  - mask_object:
      color: One of the two object_colors.
      property: Forms exactly one connected component (using 4-way adjacency).
      property: This single component must be a solid rectangle (no holes).
      coordinates: The set of (row, column) coordinates occupied by the mask object.
  - persistent_object:
      color: The object_color that is not the mask_color.
      pixels: The set of (row, column) coordinates occupied by the persistent object's color in the input grid.

transformation:
  - identify: The background_color, mask_object (by its properties and color), and persistent_object (by elimination).
  - determine_mask_coords: Find all coordinates covered by the mask_object.
  - filter_persistent_pixels: Identify the coordinates of the persistent_object pixels in the input grid. Create a subset of these coordinates that do *not* overlap with the mask_coords.
  - generate_output: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background_color.
  - populate_output: For each coordinate in the filtered subset of persistent pixel coordinates, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the persistent_object's color.

examples_summary:
  - example_1:
      mask_color: Green(3)
      persistent_color: Red(2)
      overlap: The Green mask covered 0 Red pixels.
      output: All Red pixels from input remain.
  - example_2:
      mask_color: Blue(1)
      persistent_color: Magenta(6)
      overlap: The Blue mask covered 5 Magenta pixels.
      output: The 5 overlapping Magenta pixels are removed; all other Magenta pixels remain.
