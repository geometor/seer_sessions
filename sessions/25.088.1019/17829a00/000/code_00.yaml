task_type: pixel_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: preserved (input and output grids have the same height and width)
  - background_color: orange (7) - appears to act as empty space, most frequent color excluding boundaries.
boundaries:
  - type: fixed_rows
  - location: top row (index 0) and bottom row (index height-1)
  - behavior: remain unchanged between input and output.
objects:
  - type: falling_pixels
  - identification: pixels with colors other than the background color, located between the top and bottom boundary rows.
  - colors_observed: maroon (9), azure (8), red (2), gray (5)
actions:
  - name: gravity_simulation
  - target: falling_pixels
  - constraints:
      - movement: strictly vertical (downwards) within the original column.
      - stopping_conditions:
          - encounter another non-background pixel below it in the same column.
          - reach the row directly above the bottom boundary row (index height-2).
  - interaction: falling pixels stack vertically within their column upon settling.
  - independence: gravity acts independently in each column.
