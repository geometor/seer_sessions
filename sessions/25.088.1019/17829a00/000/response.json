The input and output grids have the same dimensions. There are fixed boundary rows at the top and bottom which remain unchanged. A dominant background color (orange=7 in both examples) seems to represent empty space. Pixels of other colors (maroon=9, azure=8 in the first example; red=2, gray=5 in the second example), located between the top and bottom boundaries, 'fall' downwards within their respective columns. They fall through the background-colored cells until they either land on top of another non-background pixel in the same column or reach the row immediately above the fixed bottom boundary row. The process occurs independently within each column.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the top boundary row (row 0) and the bottom boundary row (row `height - 1`). These rows will not be modified further.\n4.  For each column index `c` from 0 to `width - 1`:\n    a.  Create an empty temporary list called `column_pixels`.\n    b.  Iterate through the rows `r` of the input grid for the current column `c`, starting from row 1 up to row `height - 2` (inclusive).\n    c.  If the color of the pixel `input[r][c]` is *not* the background color, add this color value to the `column_pixels` list.\n    d.  In the output grid, set the color of all pixels `output[r][c]` to the background color for rows `r` from 1 to `height - 2` (inclusive). This clears the area for the falling pixels.\n    e.  Determine the starting row for placing the fallen pixels, which is `current_row = height - 2`.\n    f.  While the `column_pixels` list is not empty:\n        i.  Remove the *last* color added to `column_pixels` (simulating the lowest pixels falling first and landing at the bottom).\n        ii. Place this removed color into the output grid at `output[current_row][c]`.\n        iii. Decrement `current_row` by 1 to move to the row above for the next pixel."
