            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are Azure (8) as the background, Magenta (6) and Blue (1) in the input, and Orange (7) appearing only in the output. Blue (1) pixels persist from input to output in the same locations. Magenta (6) pixels disappear in the output. Orange (7) pixels appear in the output at new locations.\n2.  **Objects:** Magenta, Blue, and Orange pixels appear as single, isolated points within the Azure background.\n3.  **Relationships & Transformations:** There seems to be a direct relationship between each Magenta pixel and a specific Blue pixel in the input, which determines the location of a new Orange pixel in the output.\n    *   Each Magenta pixel seems to \"target\" the Blue pixel closest to it (using Manhattan distance).\n    *   The Magenta pixel is then removed (changed to Azure).\n    *   An Orange pixel is placed relative to the *targeted* Blue pixel.\n    *   The relative placement follows a specific rotation rule based on the vector connecting the Magenta pixel to its closest Blue pixel.\n    *   Let M be the coordinates of a Magenta pixel and B be the coordinates of the closest Blue pixel. Define the vector V = B - M.\n    *   If V is horizontal (change in row = 0, change in column != 0), the vector seems to be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to get the offset V' from B where the Orange pixel is placed (O = B + V'). For V = (dx, 0), V' = (0, dx).\n    *   If V is vertical (change in column = 0, change in row != 0), the vector seems to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise to get the offset V' from B where the Orange pixel is placed (O = B + V'). For V = (0, dy), V' = (dy, 0).\n    *   If the calculated position for the Orange pixel falls outside the grid boundaries, no Orange pixel is placed for that specific Magenta-Blue interaction (as seen in train_3 example 1).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
