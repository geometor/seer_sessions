            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have varying dimensions but maintain a consistent structure within each example pair.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant background color is white (0).\n3.  **Border Elements:** Each input grid features two distinct, single-colored lines acting as borders.\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) top border, Yellow (4) bottom border.\n    *   Example 2: Azure (8) top border, Green (3) bottom border.\n    *   Example 3: Green (3) left border, Yellow (4) right border.\n    These border elements remain unchanged in the output grid.\n4.  **Active Elements:** Blue (1) pixels are present within the main area of the grid (excluding the borders). These blue pixels also remain unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Transformation:** The key change is the appearance of new pixels in the output grid. The colors of these new pixels match the colors of the border lines. Their positions seem directly related to the positions of the blue (1) pixels.\n6.  **Positional Relationship:**\n    *   In examples 1 and 2 (top/bottom borders), new pixels appear directly above and below the blue pixels, matching the color of the respective border (top border color appears above, bottom border color appears below).\n    *   In example 3 (left/right borders), new pixels appear directly to the left and right of the blue pixels, matching the color of the respective border (left border color appears to the left, right border color appears to the right).\n7.  **Condition for Change:** New colored pixels only appear if the target adjacent cell (above/below or left/right) was originally white (0) in the input grid. If the adjacent cell was already colored (e.g., another blue pixel or a border), no new pixel is placed there.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
