Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids have varying dimensions but maintain a consistent structure within each example pair.
2.  **Background Color:** The predominant background color is white (0).
3.  **Border Elements:** Each input grid features two distinct, single-colored lines acting as borders.
    *   Example 1: Red (2) top border, Yellow (4) bottom border.
    *   Example 2: Azure (8) top border, Green (3) bottom border.
    *   Example 3: Green (3) left border, Yellow (4) right border.
    These border elements remain unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **Active Elements:** Blue (1) pixels are present within the main area of the grid (excluding the borders). These blue pixels also remain unchanged in the output.
5.  **Transformation:** The key change is the appearance of new pixels in the output grid. The colors of these new pixels match the colors of the border lines. Their positions seem directly related to the positions of the blue (1) pixels.
6.  **Positional Relationship:**
    *   In examples 1 and 2 (top/bottom borders), new pixels appear directly above and below the blue pixels, matching the color of the respective border (top border color appears above, bottom border color appears below).
    *   In example 3 (left/right borders), new pixels appear directly to the left and right of the blue pixels, matching the color of the respective border (left border color appears to the left, right border color appears to the right).
7.  **Condition for Change:** New colored pixels only appear if the target adjacent cell (above/below or left/right) was originally white (0) in the input grid. If the adjacent cell was already colored (e.g., another blue pixel or a border), no new pixel is placed there.

**YAML Fact Document:**

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Generated pixels are placed orthogonally adjacent (up/down or left/right) to blue pixels."
  - type: color_matching
    description: "The color of a generated pixel matches the color of the border in the direction of placement relative to the blue pixel."
  - type: conditional_placement
    description: "Placement of a generated pixel occurs only if the target adjacent cell is white (0)."

actions:
  - identify_borders: Determine the location (Top/Bottom or Left/Right) and color of the two border lines.
  - scan_grid: Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
  - check_for_blue: If a cell contains a blue (1) pixel.
  - check_adjacency: Examine the orthogonally adjacent cells in the directions of the identified borders.
  - place_pixel: If an adjacent cell in a border's direction is white (0), place a pixel of that border's color in that cell in the output grid.
  - copy_unchanged: All other pixels (borders, original blue pixels, background white pixels not adjacent to blue) are copied directly from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the two border lines in the input grid. Determine their locations (e.g., top row, bottom row, left column, right column) and their respective colors (`color1`, `color2`). Also, determine the corresponding directions relative to any internal pixel (e.g., UP for the top border, DOWN for the bottom border, LEFT for the left border, RIGHT for the right border) - let's call these `direction1` and `direction2`.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, excluding the border cells themselves.
4.  If the color of the input cell `input[r][c]` is blue (1):
    a.  Calculate the coordinates `(r1, c1)` of the cell adjacent to `(r, c)` in `direction1`.
    b.  Check if `(r1, c1)` is within the grid boundaries and if the color of the input cell `input[r1][c1]` is white (0).
    c.  If both conditions in step 4b are true, set the color of the output cell `output[r1][c1]` to `color1`.
    d.  Calculate the coordinates `(r2, c2)` of the cell adjacent to `(r, c)` in `direction2`.
    e.  Check if `(r2, c2)` is within the grid boundaries and if the color of the input cell `input[r2][c2]` is white (0).
    f.  If both conditions in step 4e are true, set the color of the output cell `output[r2][c2]` to `color2`.
5.  Return the final output grid.
