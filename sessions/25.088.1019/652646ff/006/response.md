Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment**

The provided code consistently fails to produce the correct output grids for all training examples. The primary discrepancies are in the output grid dimensions and the way shapes are rendered. The previous code attempted to extract shapes based on connected components of "relevant" pixels (treating different relevant colors as connectable), determined a representative color from the top-left pixel of the component, sorted them, and then tried to reconstruct the shapes in the output using their original pixel positions relative to their bounding box, colored with the representative color.

The results show this approach is flawed. The output dimensions are often incorrect, and the rendered shapes in the transformed output bear little resemblance to the solid blocks seen in the expected outputs.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Re-evaluate Shape Definition and Properties:** Confirm that shapes are connected components of pixels that are *not* the background color and *not* specific ignored colors (Gray, Orange, Maroon, plus Red if the background is Azure). Confirm that components can span multiple relevant colors if they are adjacent. Determine how the key properties used for output construction (height `h`, representative color) are derived from these components.
2.  **Re-evaluate Output Construction:** Analyze the structure of the expected outputs. They appear to consist of solid, colored, square blocks stacked vertically. Determine how the size (`h`x`h`?) and color of these blocks relate to the input components. Confirm the vertical stacking order and horizontal centering logic.
3.  **Refine Algorithm:** Based on the re-evaluation, update the steps for identifying components, extracting their properties, calculating output dimensions, sorting, and rendering the final shapes. Hypothesis 3, developed during internal thought, seems promising: shapes are connected components of *any* relevant color, their height `h` is determined by their bounding box, the output uses solid `h`x`h` squares colored by the component's top-left pixel's original color, and the output width is the maximum `h`.
