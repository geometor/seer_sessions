Task: Tile row and column based on object's maximal projections, with conditional cyclic shift.

Example_1:
  Input:
    GridSize: [15, 14]
    Objects:
      - ID: 1
        Pixels: [[4,8,yellow],[5,8,azure],[6,7,red],[6,8,green],[6,9,azure],[6,10,yellow],[7,8,red]]
        IsContiguous: true
  Analysis:
    - Find row with max object pixels: Row 6 (4 pixels: red, green, azure, yellow) -> r = 6
    - Find col with max object pixels: Col 8 (4 pixels: yellow, azure, green, red) -> c = 8
    - Horizontal sequence (H_sequence) from row 6: [red, green, azure, yellow] # [2, 3, 8, 4]
    - Vertical sequence (V_sequence) from col 8: [yellow, azure, green, red] # [4, 8, 3, 2]
    - Comparison: H_sequence != V_sequence
  Transformation:
    - Condition: Sequences differ.
    - Horizontal Pattern (H_tiled): Cyclically shift H_sequence left by 1 -> [green, azure, yellow, red] # [3, 8, 4, 2]
    - Vertical Pattern (V_tiled): Use V_sequence directly -> [yellow, azure, green, red] # [4, 8, 3, 2]
    - Action_1: Tile row r=6 with H_tiled horizontally.
    - Action_2: Tile col c=8 with V_tiled vertically.
  Output: Grid with row 6 tiled with [3, 8, 4, 2] and col 8 tiled with [4, 8, 3, 2].

Example_2:
  Input:
    GridSize: [12, 11]
    Objects:
      - ID: 1
        Pixels: [[2,2,azure],[3,2,green],[4,0,azure],[4,1,green],[4,2,red]]
        IsContiguous: true
  Analysis:
    - Find row with max object pixels: Row 4 (3 pixels: azure, green, red) -> r = 4
    - Find col with max object pixels: Col 2 (3 pixels: azure, green, red) -> c = 2
    - Horizontal sequence (H_sequence) from row 4: [azure, green, red] # [8, 3, 2]
    - Vertical sequence (V_sequence) from col 2: [azure, green, red] # [8, 3, 2]
    - Comparison: H_sequence == V_sequence
  Transformation:
    - Condition: Sequences are identical.
    - Horizontal Pattern (H_tiled): Use H_sequence directly -> [azure, green, red] # [8, 3, 2]
    - Vertical Pattern (V_tiled): Cyclically shift V_sequence left by 1 -> [green, red, azure] # [3, 2, 8]
    - Action_1: Tile row r=4 with H_tiled horizontally.
    - Action_2: Tile col c=2 with V_tiled vertically.
  Output: Grid with row 4 tiled with [8, 3, 2] and col 2 tiled with [3, 2, 8].
