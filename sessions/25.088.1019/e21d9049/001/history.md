Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Both inputs contain a single, connected object composed of non-white pixels against a white background. The objects have both horizontal and vertical components, resembling 'L' or 'cross' shapes.
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs also have a white background. The original object is removed. Two lines of repeating color patterns are present: one horizontal line filling a specific row entirely, and one vertical line filling a specific column entirely.
3.  **Transformation Core Idea:** The transformation identifies the primary horizontal and vertical "arms" of the input object. It extracts the color sequences from these arms. These sequences (or a modified version) are then used to tile a specific row and column in the output grid.
4.  **Identifying Arms:** The row containing the most non-white pixels of the object determines the horizontal sequence (H). The column containing the most non-white pixels determines the vertical sequence (V). The row index (`r`) and column index (`c`) of these maximal lines are key.
5.  **Tiling Pattern Generation:**
    *   The sequence extracted from the maximal row (`H_sequence`) and the sequence extracted from the maximal column (`V_sequence`) are compared.
    *   If `H_sequence` and `V_sequence` are identical (like in train_2), the horizontal tiling pattern (`H_tiled`) is `H_sequence` itself, and the vertical tiling pattern (`V_tiled`) is `V_sequence` cyclically shifted left by one position.
    *   If `H_sequence` and `V_sequence` are different (like in train_1), the horizontal tiling pattern (`H_tiled`) is `H_sequence` cyclically shifted left by one position, and the vertical tiling pattern (`V_tiled`) is `V_sequence` itself.
6.  **Output Construction:** An empty grid (all white) of the same size as the input is created. Row `r` is filled by repeating `H_tiled` horizontally. Column `c` is filled by repeating `V_tiled` vertically.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Tile row and column based on object's maximal projections, with conditional cyclic shift.

Example_1:
  Input:
    GridSize: [15, 14]
    Objects:
      - ID: 1
        Pixels: [[4,8,yellow],[5,8,azure],[6,7,red],[6,8,green],[6,9,azure],[6,10,yellow],[7,8,red]]
        IsContiguous: true
  Analysis:
    - Find row with max object pixels: Row 6 (4 pixels: red, green, azure, yellow) -> r = 6
    - Find col with max object pixels: Col 8 (4 pixels: yellow, azure, green, red) -> c = 8
    - Horizontal sequence (H_sequence) from row 6: [red, green, azure, yellow] # [2, 3, 8, 4]
    - Vertical sequence (V_sequence) from col 8: [yellow, azure, green, red] # [4, 8, 3, 2]
    - Comparison: H_sequence != V_sequence
  Transformation:
    - Condition: Sequences differ.
    - Horizontal Pattern (H_tiled): Cyclically shift H_sequence left by 1 -> [green, azure, yellow, red] # [3, 8, 4, 2]
    - Vertical Pattern (V_tiled): Use V_sequence directly -> [yellow, azure, green, red] # [4, 8, 3, 2]
    - Action_1: Tile row r=6 with H_tiled horizontally.
    - Action_2: Tile col c=8 with V_tiled vertically.
  Output: Grid with row 6 tiled with [3, 8, 4, 2] and col 8 tiled with [4, 8, 3, 2].

Example_2:
  Input:
    GridSize: [12, 11]
    Objects:
      - ID: 1
        Pixels: [[2,2,azure],[3,2,green],[4,0,azure],[4,1,green],[4,2,red]]
        IsContiguous: true
  Analysis:
    - Find row with max object pixels: Row 4 (3 pixels: azure, green, red) -> r = 4
    - Find col with max object pixels: Col 2 (3 pixels: azure, green, red) -> c = 2
    - Horizontal sequence (H_sequence) from row 4: [azure, green, red] # [8, 3, 2]
    - Vertical sequence (V_sequence) from col 2: [azure, green, red] # [8, 3, 2]
    - Comparison: H_sequence == V_sequence
  Transformation:
    - Condition: Sequences are identical.
    - Horizontal Pattern (H_tiled): Use H_sequence directly -> [azure, green, red] # [8, 3, 2]
    - Vertical Pattern (V_tiled): Cyclically shift V_sequence left by 1 -> [green, red, azure] # [3, 2, 8]
    - Action_1: Tile row r=4 with H_tiled horizontally.
    - Action_2: Tile col c=2 with V_tiled vertically.
  Output: Grid with row 4 tiled with [8, 3, 2] and col 2 tiled with [3, 2, 8].

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the single contiguous object composed of non-background (non-white) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Determine the row index (`r`) that contains the maximum number of pixels belonging to this object.
4.  Determine the column index (`c`) that contains the maximum number of pixels belonging to this object.
5.  Extract the sequence of colors (`H_sequence`) from the object's pixels located in row `r`, maintaining their left-to-right order.
6.  Extract the sequence of colors (`V_sequence`) from the object's pixels located in column `c`, maintaining their top-to-bottom order.
7.  Compare `H_sequence` and `V_sequence`.
8.  If `H_sequence` is identical to `V_sequence`:
    a. Set the horizontal tiling pattern (`H_tiled`) to be `H_sequence`.
    b. Set the vertical tiling pattern (`V_tiled`) by performing a cyclic shift to the left by one position on `V_sequence`.
9.  If `H_sequence` is different from `V_sequence`:
    a. Set the horizontal tiling pattern (`H_tiled`) by performing a cyclic shift to the left by one position on `H_sequence`.
    b. Set the vertical tiling pattern (`V_tiled`) to be `V_sequence`.
10. Fill the entire row `r` of the output grid by repeating the `H_tiled` sequence horizontally, starting from column 0.
11. Fill the entire column `c` of the output grid by repeating the `V_tiled` sequence vertically, starting from row 0.
12. Return the modified output grid.
