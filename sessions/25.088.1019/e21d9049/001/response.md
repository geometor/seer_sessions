"""
Identifies the single contiguous non-background object in the input grid.
Determines the row (r) and column (c) containing the maximum number of pixels belonging to this object.
Extracts the sequence of colors (H_sequence) from the object's pixels in row r (left-to-right) and 
the sequence of colors (V_sequence) from the object's pixels in column c (top-to-bottom).
Compares H_sequence and V_sequence.
If they are identical:
  - The horizontal tiling pattern (H_tiled) is H_sequence.
  - The vertical tiling pattern (V_tiled) is V_sequence cyclically shifted left by one position.
If they are different:
  - The horizontal tiling pattern (H_tiled) is H_sequence cyclically shifted left by one position.
  - The vertical tiling pattern (V_tiled) is V_sequence.
Initializes an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
Fills the entire row r of the output grid by repeating H_tiled horizontally.
Fills the entire column c of the output grid by repeating V_tiled vertically.
Returns the modified output grid.
