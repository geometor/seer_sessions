Other objects remain unchanged.\n    *   In each example, there is one pixel whose color is unique in the grid (excluding the background orange and the target white). In `train_1`, this is a green (3) pixel. In `train_2`, this is a maroon (9) pixel.\n    *   The white object that gets modified appears to be the one \"closest\" to this unique pixel.\n    *   The modification involves changing the color of one edge column of the target white object to magenta (6).\n    *   If the unique pixel is horizontally to the right of the closest white object, the rightmost column of that white object changes color.\n    *   If the unique pixel is horizontally to the left of the closest white object, the leftmost column of that white object changes color.\n    *   The unique pixel's vertical position relative to the target white object does not seem to prevent the interaction, but proximity seems to select which white object is affected when multiple are present.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
