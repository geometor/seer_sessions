Determine the background color (most frequent color in the grid).\n2. Find all \"activator pixels\": pixels that are:\n    a. Not the background color.\n    b. Not white (color 0).\n    c. Isolated (have no neighbors of the same color, checking all 8 adjacent cells including diagonals).\n3. Find all white objects (contiguous areas of white pixels, using 8-way connectivity).\n4. If no activators or no white objects are found, return the original grid.\n5. Select the 'primary' activator pixel:\n    a. If only one activator exists, it is the primary activator.\n    b. If multiple activators exist, calculate the minimum Manhattan distance from each activator\n       to its nearest white object. The primary activator is the one with the smallest minimum distance.\n    c. If there's a tie in minimum distances, choose the activator that is topmost.\n    d. If there's still a tie (same row), choose the leftmost one.\n6. Identify the 'target' white object:\n    a. Calculate the Manhattan distance from the primary activator to the nearest point of each white object.\n    b. The target object is the white object with the minimum distance to the primary activator.\n    c. If there's a tie in distances, choose the white object whose top-left corner (minimum row, then minimum column)\n       is most top-left.\n7. Determine the horizontal relationship between the primary activator and the target white object's bounding box.\n8. Modify the target white object in the output grid:\n    a. If the activator's column index is greater than the maximum column index of the target object's bounding box\n       (activator is strictly to the right), change all pixels in the"
