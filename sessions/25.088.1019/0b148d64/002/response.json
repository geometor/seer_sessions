            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous transformation attempt correctly identified the concept of a \"bottom-most block\" separated by white rows. However, it extracted the entire bounding box of *all* non-white pixels within that block. The results clearly show that the expected output is a sub-region of that block, specifically the bounding box containing only *certain* colors within that block.\n\nThe key insight missed was how to select the relevant color(s) whose bounding box should be extracted from the bottom block. Analysis of the three examples suggests a relationship between the colors in the block *above* the separator row and the colors in the block *below* it. The target color for extraction appears to be the color(s) present in the bottom block but *absent* from the block immediately above the separator.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Precisely define and locate the \"bottom block\" and the \"block above\" based on the last all-white separator row.\n2.  Identify the unique non-white colors in each of these two blocks.\n3.  Determine the \"target color(s)\" by finding colors unique to the bottom block compared to the block above.\n4.  Calculate the minimal bounding box enclosing only the pixels of the target color(s) within the vertical extent of the bottom block.\n5.  Extract this specific bounding box from the input grid.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the separator rows, block definitions, and color sets for each example. We define white = 0.\n\n"
