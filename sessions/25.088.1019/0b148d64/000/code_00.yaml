task_context:
  description: Extract the bottom-most non-background region from the input grid.
  input_features:
    - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - background_color: white (0)
    - regions: Multiple contiguous areas of non-background colors.
    - separators: Horizontal rows consisting entirely of the background color separate the regions.
  output_features:
    - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - content: Represents the bottom-most region identified in the input.
    - size: Determined by the bounding box of the bottom-most region.

transformation:
  steps:
    - Identify all rows in the input grid composed entirely of the background color (white, 0).
    - Use these all-white rows as delimiters to segment the input grid vertically into blocks of rows.
    - The last block (starting after the final all-white row, or the entire grid if no all-white rows exist) contains the target region.
    - Identify all rows within this last block that contain at least one non-background pixel. These rows constitute the target region's rows.
    - Determine the minimum and maximum column indices containing non-background pixels across all identified target rows. This defines the horizontal bounds.
    - Extract the subgrid defined by the identified target rows and the calculated horizontal bounds.
  input_elements:
    - Input grid
    - Background color (implicitly white, 0)
  output_elements:
    - Subgrid containing the bottom-most non-background region.

examples_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    input_regions:
      - color: red (2) - top region
      - color: green (3) - bottom region
    separator: Rows 6-10 (indices) are all white (0).
    selected_region: Green (3) region below row 10.
    output: The bounding box of the green region.
  - example: train_2
    input_regions:
      - color: azure (8) - top region
      - color: red (2) - bottom region
    separator: Rows 9-10 (indices) are all white (0).
    selected_region: Red (2) region below row 10.
    output: The bounding box of the red region.
  - example: train_3
    input_regions:
      - color: blue (1) - top region
      - color: yellow (4) - bottom region
    separator: Rows 7-9 (indices) are all white (0).
    selected_region: Yellow (4) region below row 9.
    output: The bounding box of the yellow region.
