*   **Perception:** The input grids consist of two colors. One color forms a background or fills regions, while the other color forms complete horizontal and vertical lines that act as separators or dividers across the grid. The output grid's size corresponds to the number of regions created by these dividing lines, and the output grid is filled entirely with the background/region color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Determine the number of regions created by separator lines and create an output grid of that size filled with the region color.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        properties:
          - contains two distinct colors
      - element: separator_lines
        properties:
          - formed by one of the two colors
          - consist of complete horizontal lines spanning the grid width
          - consist of complete vertical lines spanning the grid height
          - divide the grid into distinct rectangular regions
      - element: regions
        properties:
          - areas between the separator lines
          - filled with the second color (non-separator color)
      - element: output_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions determined by the number of regions
          - height = (number of horizontal separator lines) + 1
          - width = (number of vertical separator lines) + 1
          - filled entirely with the region color
    
    relationships:
      - The separator lines define the boundaries of the regions.
      - The number of horizontal regions determines the output height.
      - The number of vertical regions determines the output width.
      - The color of the regions determines the color of the output grid.
    
    actions:
      - Identify the separator color (the one forming full lines/columns).
      - Identify the region color (the other color).
      - Count the number of horizontal separator lines.
      - Count the number of vertical separator lines.
      - Construct the output grid based on counts and region color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input grid to identify the two distinct pixel colors present.
    2.  Identify the 'separator color' by finding the color that forms complete horizontal rows AND complete vertical columns spanning the grid.
    3.  Identify the 'region color' as the other color present in the grid.
    4.  Count the number of unique rows that are composed entirely of the 'separator color'. Let this count be `H`.
    5.  Count the number of unique columns that are composed entirely of the 'separator color'. Let this count be `V`.
    6.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid: the height will be `H + 1`, and the width will be `V + 1`.
    7.  Create a new grid with these calculated dimensions (`H + 1` rows, `V + 1` columns).
    8.  Fill every cell of this new output grid with the 'region color'.
