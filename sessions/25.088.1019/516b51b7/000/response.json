These objects are typically rectangular or have simple shapes.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the white background. The blue objects from the input are modified internally. The original blue pixels forming the outer border of the objects remain blue. The interior pixels of the objects are changed to red (color 2) and green (color 3).\n3.  **Color Transformation Logic:** The coloring pattern within the objects appears layered. The outermost layer (the original border) is blue (1). The next layer inwards is red (2). The layer inside that is green (3). If the object is thick enough for another layer, it becomes red (2) again, and so on, alternating between red and green for increasing \"depth\" from the outside border.\n4.  **Depth Calculation:** This layering suggests a transformation based on the distance of each blue pixel from the nearest non-blue (white) pixel. Pixels directly adjacent (including diagonals) to a white pixel remain blue. Pixels whose nearest white pixel is two steps away become red. Pixels whose nearest white pixel is three steps away become green. Pixels four steps away become red, and so forth. The distance metric appears to be the Chebyshev distance (maximum of horizontal and vertical distance).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
