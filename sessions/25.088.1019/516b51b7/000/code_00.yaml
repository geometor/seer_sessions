Grid:
  Properties:
    - width: varies
    - height: varies
    - background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  Type: Contiguous regions of non-background pixels
  Input_Instances:
    - Color: blue (1)
    - Shape: Rectangular or L-shaped blocks
  Output_Instances:
    - Original blue objects are modified internally.
    - Properties:
      - Pixels maintain their position.
      - Pixel color changes based on depth within the object.
Pixel_Transformation_Rule:
  Condition: Input pixel is blue (1).
  Action: Determine the color of the corresponding output pixel based on its distance to the nearest white (0) pixel in the input grid.
  Distance_Metric: Chebyshev distance (max(|dx|, |dy|)).
  Color_Mapping:
    - If min_distance_to_white == 1: output_color = blue (1)
    - If min_distance_to_white > 1:
      - Calculate depth = min_distance_to_white - 1
      - If depth is odd (1, 3, 5...): output_color = red (2)
      - If depth is even (2, 4, 6...): output_color = green (3)
  Condition: Input pixel is white (0).
  Action: Output pixel remains white (0).
