Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify the locations of all white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n3. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.\n4. If the pixel at (r, c) is blue (1):\n   a. Calculate the minimum Chebyshev distance from (r, c) to any white pixel.\n   b. If the minimum distance is 1, the corresponding output pixel remains blue (1).\n   c. If the minimum distance (min_dist) is greater than 1:\n      i. Calculate the depth: depth = min_dist - 1.\n      ii. If the depth is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), set the output pixel at (r, c) to red (2).\n      iii. If the depth is even (2, 4, 6, ...), set the output pixel at (r, c) to green (3).\n5. If the input pixel is not blue (1), the corresponding output pixel remains unchanged (it keeps the original color, which is typically white (0) in the background).\n6.
