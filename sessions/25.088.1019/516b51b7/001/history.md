Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist of a white background (color 0) and one or more distinct objects made of blue pixels (color 1). These objects are typically rectangular or have simple shapes.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the white background. The blue objects from the input are modified internally. The original blue pixels forming the outer border of the objects remain blue. The interior pixels of the objects are changed to red (color 2) and green (color 3).
3.  **Color Transformation Logic:** The coloring pattern within the objects appears layered. The outermost layer (the original border) is blue (1). The next layer inwards is red (2). The layer inside that is green (3). If the object is thick enough for another layer, it becomes red (2) again, and so on, alternating between red and green for increasing "depth" from the outside border.
4.  **Depth Calculation:** This layering suggests a transformation based on the distance of each blue pixel from the nearest non-blue (white) pixel. Pixels directly adjacent (including diagonals) to a white pixel remain blue. Pixels whose nearest white pixel is two steps away become red. Pixels whose nearest white pixel is three steps away become green. Pixels four steps away become red, and so forth. The distance metric appears to be the Chebyshev distance (maximum of horizontal and vertical distance).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    - width: varies
    - height: varies
    - background_color: white (0)
Objects:
  Type: Contiguous regions of non-background pixels
  Input_Instances:
    - Color: blue (1)
    - Shape: Rectangular or L-shaped blocks
  Output_Instances:
    - Original blue objects are modified internally.
    - Properties:
      - Pixels maintain their position.
      - Pixel color changes based on depth within the object.
Pixel_Transformation_Rule:
  Condition: Input pixel is blue (1).
  Action: Determine the color of the corresponding output pixel based on its distance to the nearest white (0) pixel in the input grid.
  Distance_Metric: Chebyshev distance (max(|dx|, |dy|)).
  Color_Mapping:
    - If min_distance_to_white == 1: output_color = blue (1)
    - If min_distance_to_white > 1:
      - Calculate depth = min_distance_to_white - 1
      - If depth is odd (1, 3, 5...): output_color = red (2)
      - If depth is even (2, 4, 6...): output_color = green (3)
  Condition: Input pixel is white (0).
  Action: Output pixel remains white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid.
3.  If the current input pixel is white (0), keep the corresponding output pixel white (0) and proceed to the next pixel.
4.  If the current input pixel is blue (1):
    a.  Calculate the minimum Chebyshev distance from this blue pixel's coordinates to the coordinates of *any* white (0) pixel in the input grid. The Chebyshev distance between (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is `max(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2))`.
    b.  Let the calculated minimum distance be `min_dist`.
    c.  If `min_dist` is 1, the corresponding output pixel remains blue (1).
    d.  If `min_dist` is greater than 1:
        i.  Calculate the "depth" of the pixel as `depth = min_dist - 1`.
        ii. If `depth` is an odd number (1, 3, 5, ...), set the corresponding output pixel's color to red (2).
        iii.If `depth` is an even number (2, 4, 6, ...), set the corresponding output pixel's color to green (3).
5.  After iterating through all input pixels, the modified grid is the final output.
