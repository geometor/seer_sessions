            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the need to change some 'azure' pixels to 'blue', it didn't accurately capture the *conditions* under which this change should occur. The code changes *all* azure pixels that has *any* non-azure neighbor. The examples demonstrate that the transformation rule is more specific: only azure pixels at the \"edge\" of a contiguous azure block, and only on a specific side facing a different color, change to blue. The concept of adjacency and connected components is crucial, but the implementation needs to be more precise, and only considers immediate neighbors rather than whether or not a pixel is on the outer boundary of a contiguous region.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Edge Condition:** The current code uses a very simple neighbor check that incorrectly classifies interior azure pixels. We need to distinguish between azure pixels that are completely surrounded by other azure pixels and those that are on the \"edge\" of an azure block. We also need to determine the direction of the \"edge\", so, that, only azure pixels facing a different color change to blue.\n\n2.  **Consider Connectivity:** The rule seems to apply to *contiguous* blocks of azure. The code doesn't explicitly treat connected azure pixels as a single object.\n\n3.  **Directional Changes:** It appears changes might happen only on edges of the connected block of azure that face a specific direction (but not all directions)\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Two separate azure regions.\n    *   Expected Output: Only specific \"end\" pixels of azure regions change to blue.\n    *   Actual Output: Almost every pixel of the azure region has been changed. The program incorrectly considers neighbors on both sides, whereas only one side should change.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Three separate azure regions.\n    *   Expected output: Again, only end of regions change to blue.\n    *   Actual Output: the changes are made for all azure pixels adjacent to a different color.\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Change azure pixels to blue under specific conditions.\"\n  - objects:\n    - name: azure_regions\n      description: \"Contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.\"\n      properties:\n        - shape: \"Irregular, defined by connectivity.\"\n        - color: \"Azure (8).\"\n    - name: edge_pixels\n      description: \"Azure pixels at the boundary of an azure_region.\"\n      properties:\n        - color: \"Azure (8).\"\n        - location: \"Adjacent to non-azure pixels, at the 'ends' of a region\"\n\n  - actions:\n    - name: change_color\n      description: \"Change the color of edge pixels.\"\n      preconditions:\n        - \"Pixel is part of an azure_region.\"\n        - \"Pixel is an edge_pixel (adjacent to a non-azure pixel).\"\n      postconditions:\n        - \"edge_pixel color changes from azure (8) to blue (1).\"\n      constraints:\n        - \"only certain edge_pixels change, based on the side of the region\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Contiguous Azure Regions:** Group connected azure (8) pixels into distinct regions.\n\n2.  **Locate Edge Pixels:** Within each azure region, identify the \"edge\" pixels. An edge pixel is an azure pixel that is directly adjacent (up, down, left or right) to at least one non-azure pixel.\n\n3.  **Determine Change Condition**: Check each identified edge pixel within each identified azure region.\n\n4. **Conditional Color Change**: Of the identified azure pixels, if the pixel is at on a specific \"edge\" or \"end\" of a connected block of azure pixels, change the pixel color from azure (8) to blue (1).\n\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (non-azure, and interior azure pixels) remain unchanged.\n"
