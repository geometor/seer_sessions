Okay, here's a breakdown of my perception of the task, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a simple grid transformation. The input grid contains single-digit integers, and the output grid appears to be a direct mapping or modification of these integers. The spatial structure (3x3 grid) is maintained. The core operation seems to be an increment operation, and the specific constant added is consistent across the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
    relations:
      - to: output_grid
        type: transformed

  - type: cell
    properties:
      value: integer
    relations:
      - to: grid
        type: member_of

actions:
  - type: increment
    properties:
      operand: integer
      magnitude: +1 on each input value, respectively
    relations:
      - to: input_cell
        type: operates_on
      - from: output_cell
        type: results_in

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Add 1 to every integer in the input grid.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the results of the operation of each original integer + 1.
