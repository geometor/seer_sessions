# Example

**input:**
```
9 4 2
9 4 2
9 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C40174A30>

**output:**
```
8 3 6
8 3 6
8 3 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C40174040>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the digits 9, 4, and 2, while the output grid contains 8, 3, and 6. The spatial arrangement of the grid is preserved (3x3). It appears each number in the input maps to a different number on the output. The transformation is consistent across all cells.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [9, 4, 2]
    output_values: [8, 3, 6]
    transformation:
      type: element-wise
      mapping:
        9: 8
        4: 3
        2: 6
    spatial_relation: preserved
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program performs a one-to-one mapping of pixel values in a 3x3 grid.  Each input value is replaced by a corresponding output value according to the following rule:

1.  If the input pixel is 9, replace it with 8.
2.  If the input pixel is 4, replace it with 3.
3.  If the input pixel is 2, replace it with 6.

The spatial structure of the grid remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
