The input grid seems to contain isolated single-pixel objects of various colors. The output grid introduces new colored pixels adjacent to some of the existing pixels, forming crosses or partial crosses. The original pixels seem to remain unchanged. The colors of the new pixels can be different from the original source.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
