The input grid contains two distinct colored pixels: red (2) and blue (1), with the rest being white (0). The output grid retains the original red (2) and blue (1) pixels in their original positions. However, new pixels are added: yellow (4) and orange (7). The yellow pixels appear to be related to the red pixel, while the orange pixels are related to the blue pixel. The added pixels form specific shapes around the original pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
