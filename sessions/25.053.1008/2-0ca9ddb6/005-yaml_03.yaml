    description: Contains isolated single-pixel objects.
  - observation: output_grid
    description:  Adds pixels around certain input pixels, forming crosses or partial crosses.
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: New pixels are added adjacent to existing pixels (up, down, left, right).
  - action: add_pixel
    parameters:
      - color: The color of the new pixel.
      - position: The position of the new pixel, relative to an existing pixel.
