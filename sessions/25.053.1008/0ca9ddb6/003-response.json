The input grid contains several distinct colored pixels (blue, red, azure) against a background of white (value 0). The output grid introduces new colors (orange, yellow) and expands or modifies the existing colored areas. There appears to be a relationship between the original colored pixels and the newly introduced colors and shapes. The azure (8) pixel in the input seems unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Adjacency includes diagonals. If an orange pixel can be placed adjacent to both a blue and red pixel, perform this fill.\n3.  **Extend** yellow (4) cross shapes (one pixel wide extending vertically and horizontally by one unit) from orange(7). For each orange pixel created on step 2, a yellow cross is extended from it, unless:\n * It overlaps with an already existing pixel.\n * It goes beyond the border of the grid.\n4.  **Preserve** the azure (8) pixel from the input grid; copy it to the output grid in the same location.\n\nEssentially, the blue and red pixels act as \"seeds\" for generating orange regions, which in turn generate the yellow crosses. The azure pixel is an unchanging landmark.\n"
