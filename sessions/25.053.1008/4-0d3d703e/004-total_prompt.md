# Example

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C44BF5C00>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C44C29F30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a single digit representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a consistent change in the numerical value (and thus color) of each pixel. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - spatial_arrangement: constant

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: mapped_to_value
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: value_transformation
    description: Each pixel's value is modified according to a consistent rule.

relationships:
  - element_of: (pixel, grid)
  - mapping: (pixel.value, pixel.color)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by adding 4 to the value of each pixel. If resulting value is more than 9, take the modulo 10 of the value. The structure of the grid and the position of the pixels do not change.

*   **Red (2)** becomes **Magenta (6)**: 2 + 4 = 6
*   **Green (3)** becomes **Yellow (7)**: 3 + 4 = 7
*   **Azure (8)** becomes **Maroon (2)**. 8 + 4 = 12. 12 mod 10 = 2

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
