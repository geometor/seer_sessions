# Example

**input:**
```
5 8 6
5 8 6
5 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C44C29F30>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C44BF7BE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a single digit integer value representing a specific color. The transformation seems to involve a consistent change in the color of each pixel, suggesting a mapping or substitution rule. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer (0-9)
    element_property: color
  - observation: input_grid
    values: [[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]
  - observation: output_grid
    values: [[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]
  - relationship: transformation
    type: color_mapping
    mapping:
      5: 1
      8: 9
      6: 2
  - spatial_property: constant_grid_dimensions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color substitution.  Each pixel's color in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding color in the output grid according to the following mapping:

1.  Gray (5) is replaced by Blue (1).
2.  Azure (8) is replaced by Maroon (9).
3.  Magenta (6) is replaced by Red (2).

The grid dimensions (3x3) remain unchanged. Every instance of a particular color in the input is replaced by its mapped color in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
