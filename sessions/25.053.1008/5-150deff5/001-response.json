Cells contain single-digit integers representing colors.\n*   **Color Change:** The primary transformation seems to involve changing the color of specific regions. Gray (5) in the input is replaced by azure (8) and red (2) in the output. The overall shape made by the gray pixels looks maintained.\n*    It appears the inside color (5) switches to (8)\n*    It appears that the outline color remains the same color, but becomes color (2)\n*   **Background:** The background color (0, white) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
