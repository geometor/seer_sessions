Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains the colors blue (1), white (0), and gray (5), while the output grid contains white (0) and red (2). It seems that a specific color in the input grid triggers a transformation in output.  The transformation looks to be reducing a section to single value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x7
    elements: [0, 1, 5]
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2]

properties:
  - object: input_grid
    property: color_map
    values: {0: white, 1: blue, 5: gray}
  - object: output_grid
    property: color_map
    values: {0: white, 2: red}

actions:
  - name: transformation
    type: map_section
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    from: input_grid.element(5) #Gray
    to: output_grid.element(2)  #Red
  - type: size_reduction
     from: input_grid
     to: output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Trigger:** Locate all occurrences of gray (5) in the input grid.
2.  **Define Region:** Consider a vertical stripe defined by the column of each gray pixel.
3.  **Map to Output:** In the output grid, the corresponding column where the gray pixel was, set it to red (2).
4. **All Other Columns are White:** All other columns in output are set to White (0). In essence, the 3x7 input grid is reduced to a 3x3 output grid where each gray column in the input becomes a red column in the output, and all other colors columns are reduced to white.
