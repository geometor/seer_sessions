# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x762C44BF7E50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). There's a noticeable change with the introduction of blue (1) pixels in the output. These blue pixels seem to be related to the positioning of the azure pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [0, 8, 1]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        azure: 8
        blue: 1
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: modification
    description: Change pixel color from white (0) to blue (1).
    condition: specific positions related to azure(8) pixels

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Blue (1) pixels appear adjacent to azure (8) pixels. Specifically, one space to the left or above.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) within the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Modification:** For each azure pixel:
  *   **Check Left:** If the cell is not in the first column and there is an empty (white, color = 0) pixel immediately to its left, change that empty cell to color blue (color = 1).
  *   **Check Above:** If the cell is not at the first row, and there is an empty pixel directly above it, and it has *not* already modified to blue by a previous operation, change that empty pixel to a blue (1) pixel.
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels that were *not* modified retain their original values.

In essence, the transformation "marks" white cells adjacent and to the left or top of azure colored cells with a blue color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
