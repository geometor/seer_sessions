The input grid appears to be larger and more complex than the output grid. Colors present include white (0), blue (1), and grey (5). The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2). There's a noticeable reduction in size and a change in color composition. The grey (5) pixels seem to be completely removed, and blue(1) pixels seem to be the key of changing to red(2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
