# Example

**input:**
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x762C40177FD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C40176E60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a larger size and includes several colors (white, blue, gray), while the output grid is smaller (3x3) and features only white and red colors. The central pixel in the output grid appears to be red (value 2), while all other pixels are white (value 0). There's a prominent vertical gray stripe (value 5) in the input. The blue and white pixels seem to form a repeating, alternating pattern, which is discarded in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3 x 7
      - colors: white, blue, gray
      - pattern: alternating blue and white, vertical gray stripe
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3 x 3
      - colors: white, red
      - pattern: red center, white surround
  - type: object
    description: gray stripe
    properties:
      - color: gray
      - shape: vertical
      - location: center column of input
  - type: transformation
    description: grid reduction and color change
    actions:
      - select_center: Extracts a 3x3 subgrid centered on the input.
      - recolor: Changes a specific input color to red in output center.
      - discard_pattern: Removes blue/white alternating pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Center:** Find the central 3x3 subgrid within the input grid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract this 3x3 subgrid.
3. **Recolor Center:** Change the center of the output grid to red.
4. **Set Surroundings** Set all pixels not changed by the prior rule to be white.
5. output the smaller grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
