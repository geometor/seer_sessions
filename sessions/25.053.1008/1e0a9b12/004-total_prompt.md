# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x762C44BF7BE0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x762C40175EA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both 6x6 grids.  Most cells are filled with '0' (white). There are some isolated non-zero colored pixels, and some vertically and horizontally adjacent non-zero colored pixels. The non-zero pixels appear to move, specifically it looks like the maroon '9' is moving.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 6x6 grids.
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        description: Background
      - value: 9
        color: maroon
        description:  moves to the bottom row.
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        description:  moves with the 7
      - value: 7
        color: orange
        description: moves with the 8
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        description: static object, does not move.

  - observation: "Non-zero pixels besides the yellow '4' move."
  - observation: "The azure '8' and orange '7' move together as a unit and maintain relative position, but their final row aligns with the initial row of the maroon '9'."
  - observation: "The maroon '9' moves to the last row."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Static Objects:** The yellow '4' pixels form a static object and do not change position.
2.  **Identify Moving Object 9:** The maroon '9' pixel is a moving object
3.  **Identify Coupled Object 7 and 8:** The orange '7' and azure '8' form a coupled object.
4.  **Move Object 9**: Move object 9 to the last row of the grid, maintaining the column.
5.  **Move Coupled Object 7 and 8**: move the couple object to the initial row index of Object 9.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
