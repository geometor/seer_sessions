facts:
  - entity: grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    description: input and output grids containing colored pixels

  - entity: pixel
    type: individual cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9) # white, blue, red, green, magenta
      position: (row, column) coordinates

  - action: move_color_block
    description: Certain color blocks seem to maintain relative positioning to one another and move.

  - observation: selective_preservation
    description: Only specific colors (3, 6, 1, and 2) and their relative positions are preserved in the output. The 1 and 2 maintain position relative to each other in the bottom right.

  - observation: positional_shift
    description: The position of each color section shifts down and possibly across. The bottom row and right column are involved.

  - observation: relative positioning
    description: Green pixels appear to move down, maintaining a vertical stack
