# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 1 2
6 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x762C40FDE200>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 1 0
6 3 0 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x762C40FDDDB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 5x5 grids.  Pixels can be various colors, represented by the digits 0-9. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and magenta (6). There's a noticeable shift or movement of certain colored pixels between the input and output grids. It seems that only specific colors from the input are preserved or moved in the output, and empty cells between colors of interest might also change.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - entity: grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    description: input and output grids containing colored pixels

  - entity: pixel
    type: individual cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9) # white, blue, red, green, magenta
      position: (row, column) coordinates

  - action: move_color_block
    description: Certain color blocks seem to maintain relative positioning to one another and move.

  - observation: selective_preservation
    description: Only specific colors (3, 6, 1, and 2) and their relative positions are preserved in the output. The 1 and 2 maintain position relative to each other in the bottom right.

  - observation: positional_shift
    description: The position of each color section shifts down and possibly across. The bottom row and right column are involved.

  - observation: relative positioning
    description: Green pixels appear to move down, maintaining a vertical stack
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on pixels with colors 3 (green), 6 (magenta), 1 (blue), and 2 (red).

2.  **Green (3) Movement:** Move any green (3) pixels down to the row directly above any other present color (6, 1 or 2). If other color pixels occupy all the rows, move color 3 down as far down as possible.

3.  **Magenta (6) Placement:** Place the magenta (6) pixel in the bottom-left corner (row 4, column 0).

4.  **Blue (1) and Red (2) Movement:** Move the blue (1) and red (2) pixels such that they retain their relative horizontal relationship. The blue and red will occupy the two rightmost spaces, placing the blue pixel in the first available spot in the first available row from the bottom up. Then place the red pixel relative to the blue one.

5.  **Clear Remaining:** All other cells are set to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
