Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (0,4) # Top-left corner of the L
      orientation: top_right
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (2,2)
      orientation: bottom_left
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (5,3)
      orientation: bottom_right

output_grid:
 objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (0,4) # Top-left corner of the L
      orientation: top_right
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (2,2)
      orientation: bottom_left
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      position: (5,3)
      orientation: bottom_right
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (0,5)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (2,3)
    - color: 1 (blue)
     shape: single cell
     position: (5,3)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is consistent with the previous example. It identifies azure (color 8) L-shaped objects (made of three cells) and paints a blue cell (value 1) relative to each L-shape's orientation. The key is to precisely define "relative to" based on the L-shape orientation, covering all four cases in the `find_l_shapes` function:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects that are composed of three cells, forming an "L" shape.

2.  **Determine Orientation and Target:**  For each identified L-shape, determine its orientation (top_left, top_right, bottom_left, or bottom_right). The target cell to be colored blue (1) is:
    *   **top\_left or top\_right:** The cell to the *right* of the top-most part of the L-shape.
    *    **bottom\_left:** The cell to the *right* of the *upper part* of the L-shape
    *   **bottom\_right:** The cell that completes the square at the *top of the object*

3.  **Change color:** Change the color value of the target cell to blue (1).

4.  **Keep initial object:** The identified L-shaped objects remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Step-by-step explanation applied to the new example:**
1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**
The input grid contains three azure "L" shapes, with diverse orientations.

2. **First L shape**
 - It is located at (0,4).
 - Its orientation is top_right.
 - The cell at the right of the upper element is (0,5). This position is painted in blue.

3.  **Second L shape**
 - It is located at (2,2).
 - Its orientation is bottom_left.
 - The cell at the right of the upper part of the shape is (2,3). This position is painted in blue.

4.  **Third L shape**
 - It is located at (5,3).
 - Its orientation is bottom_right.
 - The cell where a square can be formed is (5,3).

5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid shows the original azure L-shapes and a blue cell (value 1) next to each one, based on the rules explained.

The Python code provided previously already implements this logic correctly by using the function find\_l\_shapes to analyze the shape.
