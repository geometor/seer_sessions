It identifies azure (color 8) L-shaped objects (made of three cells) and paints a blue cell (value 1) relative to each L-shape's orientation. The key is to precisely define \"relative to\" based on the L-shape orientation, covering all four cases in the `find_l_shapes` function:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects that are composed of three cells, forming an \"L\" shape.\n\n2.  **Determine Orientation and Target:**  For each identified L-shape, determine its orientation (top_left, top_right, bottom_left, or bottom_right). The target cell to be colored blue (1) is:\n    *   **top\\_left or top\\_right:** The cell to the *right* of the top-most part of the L-shape.\n    *    **bottom\\_left:** The cell to the *right* of the *upper part* of the L-shape\n    *   **bottom\\_right:** The cell that completes the square at the *top of the object*\n\n3.  **Change color:** Change the color value of the target cell to blue (1).\n\n4.  **Keep initial object:** The identified L-shaped objects remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation applied to the new example:**\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis:**\nThe input grid contains three azure \"L\" shapes, with diverse orientations.\n\n2. **First L shape**\n - It is located at (0,4).\n - Its orientation is top_right.\n - The cell at the right of the upper element is (0,5). This position is painted in blue.\n\n3.  **Second L shape**\n - It is located at (2,2).\n - Its orientation is bottom_left.\n - The cell at the right of the upper part of the shape is (2,3). This position is painted in blue.\n\n4.  **Third L shape**\n - It is located at (5,3).\n - Its orientation is bottom_right.\n - The cell where a square can be formed is (5,3).\n\n5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid shows the original azure L-shapes and a blue cell (value 1) next to each one, based on the rules explained.\n\nThe Python code provided previously already implements this logic correctly by using the function find\\_l\\_shapes to analyze the shape.\n"
