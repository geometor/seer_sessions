Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate "L"-shaped objects composed of azure (color 8) pixels. These "L" shapes can be in one of two orientations:
    *   **Top-Left:** An azure pixel with one azure pixel directly below it and one azure pixel directly to its right.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** An azure pixel with one directly above and on directly to the left.

2.  **Transformation Rule (Conditional based on L-shape orientation):**
    *   **Top-Left L-shape:** Insert a single blue (color 1) pixel diagonally down and to the right of the corner azure pixel (one cell down, one cell right).
    *  **Bottom-Right L-Shape:** Insert a single blue pixel (color 1) diagonally up and to the left of the corner azure pixel (one cell up, on cell left).

3. **Output:** Create a new grid that is copy of input grid, including the inserted blue pixel(s) in their new positions. There are no changes to the locations or colors of any of the other objects.

**Key Observations and Context:**

*   **Object Recognition:** The core objects are "L"-shaped structures of a specific color (azure).
*   **Orientation:** The *orientation* of the L-shape is crucial for determining the placement of the new blue pixel.
*    **Relative Positioning:** The transformation involves adding a new pixel (blue) in a position *relative* to the corner of the identified L-shape. The new pixel is always diagonal to the corner pixel.
*   **No other Changes**: pixels that are not part of the "L" shapes are not involved in the transformations.
* **Action**: The core action of inserting a new blue pixel, changing a white pixel to blue, not adding a new blue pixel.
