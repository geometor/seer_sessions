This time, they are oriented such that the 'L' opens to the right in the top part of the grid and to the left in the bottom part.\n\n2.  **Locate Insertion Points**:\n    *   For the top-right azure shape, locate the pixel that is right below the rightmost azure pixel of the shape.\n    *   For the bottom-left azure shape, locate the pixel right above the leftmost azure pixel of that shape.\n\n3.  **Insert**: Change these insertion pixels to blue (value 1).\n\nThe core concept remains the same as in the first example: identify L-shapes and insert a blue pixel at a specific relative position. The key difference lies in the orientation of the \"L\" shapes and, consequently, the precise rule for blue pixel placement. The previous code should work, but I'll double-check it now, adding print commands for debugging and understanding.\n\n"
