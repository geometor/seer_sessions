Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and the inferred transformation rule:



```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - colors:
      - input:  [white, azure]
      - output: [white, azure, blue]
  - objects:
    - azure_shapes:
      - description: Two distinct L-shaped objects made of azure pixels.
        One is in the top-left quadrant, and the other mirrors it in the bottom-right quadrant.
      - properties:
        - shape: L-shaped
        - size: 3 pixels each
        - orientation: Mirrored across the center.
    - blue_pixel:
      - description: A single blue pixel appearing only in the output.
      - location: Inside the mirrored L shape, the pixel is right below of uppermost azure pixel.
changes:
  - added:
      - A blue pixel (value 1) has been introduced in two cells, as described before, into the output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects**: Locate the two azure "L"-shaped objects, made by three pixels.

2.  **Locate insertion points**: For the top-left azure shape, locate the pixel that is right below the upmost azure pixel. For the bottom-right azure shape, locate the pixel left-adjacent to the rightmost azure pixel.

3.  **Insert**: Change this insertion pixels to blue (value 1)

In essence, the transformation identifies specific locations within existing L-shaped patterns and adds a blue pixel at a specific relative position within each.
