Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Two 2x1 rectangles, one 1x2 rectangle, and two single cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
      shape: Two 2x1 rectangles, one 1x2 rectangle and two single cells
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: Three single cells.
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains azure (8) colored objects and a white (0) background.  The azure objects have various shapes as described above.

2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare the output grid to the input grid. The azure objects remain in the same positions. New blue (1) objects appear.

3. **Observe Transformations**:
    *   Azure (8) objects are unchanged.
    *   Cells to the right of azure objects that were originally white/0 are now blue(1).

4.  **Apply the Rule:**
    *   The cell at (1, 4) is to the immediate right of (1,5), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).
    *   The cell at (2, 3) is to the immediate right of (2,2), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).
    *   The cell at (5, 3) is to the immediate right of (5,4), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

The azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged. For each azure object, examine the cell directly to its right. If that cell is the background color (white/0), change it to blue (1).  Otherwise, leave it unchanged. This is the same rule as the first example. The provided Python code correctly implements this rule.
