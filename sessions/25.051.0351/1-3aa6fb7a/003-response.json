The azure objects have various shapes as described above.\n\n2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare the output grid to the input grid. The azure objects remain in the same positions. New blue (1) objects appear.\n\n3. **Observe Transformations**:\n    *   Azure (8) objects are unchanged.\n    *   Cells to the right of azure objects that were originally white/0 are now blue(1).\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule:**\n    *   The cell at (1, 4) is to the immediate right of (1,5), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).\n    *   The cell at (2, 3) is to the immediate right of (2,2), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).\n    *   The cell at (5, 3) is to the immediate right of (5,4), and is 0, therefore it turns to 1 (blue).\n\n**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**\n\nThe azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged. For each azure object, examine the cell directly to its right. If that cell is the background color (white/0), change it to blue (1).  Otherwise, leave it unchanged. This is the same rule as the first example. The provided Python code correctly implements this rule.\n"
