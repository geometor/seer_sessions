The azure objects appear as two 2x1 vertical rectangles and two individual cells.\n\n2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare each cell of the output grid to the input grid.\n\n3. **Observe Transformations**:\n    * The azure (8) objects from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n    * Inspect the cells to the immediate right of each azure object. If an azure object is found, and the adjacent cell on the right is background color (white/0), then this cell turns to color blue (1).\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule:**\n  - The cell at (1, 2) is to the right of the cell(1,1), and is color 0, therefore, it turns to 1 (blue).\n  - The cell at (4, 4) is to the right of the cell(4,5) and is color 0, therefore, it turns to 1 (blue).\n\n**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**\n\nThe azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged. For each azure object, examine the cell directly to its right. If the cell is background color (white/0), change it to blue (1). Otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n"
