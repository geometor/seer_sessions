For each distinct block of color 8:\n\n1. **Identify the Topmost Cell:** Locate the cell within the color 8 block that has the smallest row index. If there are multiple cells with the same smallest row index, any of them can be considered the topmost.\n\n2. **Modify Cell to the Right of Topmost Cell:** Check the cell immediately to the right of the topmost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue).\n\n3. **Identify the Bottommost Cell:** Locate the cell within the same color 8 block that has the largest row index. If there are multiple cells with the same largest row index, any of them can be considered the bottommost.\n\n4. **Modify Cell to the Left of Bottommost Cell:** Check the cell immediately to the left of the bottommost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue).\n\nThis process is repeated for every connected component of color 8 in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block Summary of Findings:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"ARC-AGI grid puzzle transformation\"\ntransformation_rule: \"For each connected component of color 8, change the cell to the right of the topmost cell and the cell to the left of the bottommost cell to color 1 if they are white (color 0) and within grid boundaries.\"\nobjects:\n  - type: \"Connected component\"\n    color: 8 (azure)\n    properties:\n      - \"topmost cell\"\n      - \"bottommost cell\"\nactions:\n  - \"Identify topmost cell of color 8 component\"\n  - \"Change cell to the right of topmost cell to color 1 if it is color 0 and within bounds\"\n  - \"Identify bottommost cell of color 8 component\"\n  - \"Change cell to the left of bottommost cell to color 1 if it is color 0 and within bounds\"\npredicates:\n  - \"is color 8\"\n  - \"is color 0\"\n  - \"is within grid boundaries\"\n  - \"is to the right of\"\n  - \"is to the left of\"\ncolors:\n  0: \"white\"\n  1: \"blue\"\n  8: \"azure\"\n```"
