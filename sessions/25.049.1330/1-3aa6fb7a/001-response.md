**Natural Language Description of Transformation:**

The transformation rule operates on connected components of color 8 (azure) in the input grid. For each distinct block of color 8:

1. **Identify the Topmost Cell:** Locate the cell within the color 8 block that has the smallest row index. If there are multiple cells with the same smallest row index, any of them can be considered the topmost.

2. **Modify Cell to the Right of Topmost Cell:** Check the cell immediately to the right of the topmost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue).

3. **Identify the Bottommost Cell:** Locate the cell within the same color 8 block that has the largest row index. If there are multiple cells with the same largest row index, any of them can be considered the bottommost.

4. **Modify Cell to the Left of Bottommost Cell:** Check the cell immediately to the left of the bottommost cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue).

This process is repeated for every connected component of color 8 in the input grid.

**YAML Block Summary of Findings:**

```yaml
task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle transformation"
transformation_rule: "For each connected component of color 8, change the cell to the right of the topmost cell and the cell to the left of the bottommost cell to color 1 if they are white (color 0) and within grid boundaries."
