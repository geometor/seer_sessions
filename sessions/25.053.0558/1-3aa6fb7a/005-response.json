            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided input and expected output examples, and the failures of the previous code.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on a more precise description:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Cells:** The transformation focuses on white (0) cells.\n\n2.  **Azure Neighbor Condition:** A white cell is a candidate for change *only if* it is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to at least one azure (8) cell.\n\n3.  **\"Bridging\" Azure Condition:** The adjacent azure cell(s) must, themselves, have *at least one other* azure neighbor.\n\n4. **Directionality Condition** The adjacent azure cell must connect to the other azure cells in *two different directions*. Note, these do *not* have to be orthogonal, ie, the azure cells could have diagonal connections.\n\n5.  **Transformation:** If *all* the above conditions are met, change the white cell to blue (1).\n\n**Key Improvements in Understanding and Description:**\n\n*   **Specificity of Adjacency:** Emphasizing horizontal/vertical adjacency for the initial white/azure connection, but any adjacency for the connection between azure pixels is critical. The previous attempts did not correctly apply the adjacency rules.\n*   **\"Bridging\" Concept:** The core idea is that the azure pixels form a \"bridge\" or \"link\" of at least two connected azure pixels. The white pixel fills in a gap *next to* this bridge. The previous code didn't correctly define how long the \"bridge\" must be.\n* **Directionality** - two azure cells is not sufficient, they must be connected in different directions\n\nThe previous code was too broad in its application of blue pixels. It placed them near *any* neighboring azure, not just those with other neighboring azures. It also incorrectly considered diagonal adjacency between the white starting cell and the azure neighbor.\n\nThe updated natural language program now describes a set of conditions, that, if all are met, trigger a single operation (changing the white cell to blue).\n"
