            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the failures of the previous code to refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**Observations from the failed attempts:**\n\nThe previous code attempted to identify distinct groups of azure pixels and place blue pixels between them. However, it failed because it didn't correctly identify the conditions for placing the blue pixels. It seems to be overly sensitive and only works on placing blue pixels between horizontal or vertical separations, and is ignoring that. It's also missing placements when it is supposed to. It seems that the core concept that we want to capture.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on the relationship between azure and blue pixels:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color azure (value 8) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Consider Potential Blue Pixel Locations:** Any white (value 0) pixel that is *adjacent* to an azure pixel is the location for considering a blue pixel insertion.\n\n3.  **Determine Azure Group Adjacency:**\n    *   We need to make sure that there is another azure pixel in the area, but it can't be *directly* adjacent. We can make use of a combined adjacency concept - check for horizontally, vertically, *and diagonally* adjacent pixels.\n    *   A white pixel becomes blue if it's adjacent to an azure pixel, and *that azure* pixel has an adjacent azure pixel neighbor.\n    *   And the adjacent azure neighbor must not be in the same direction.\n\n4. **Fill the Blue:** If conditions are met, insert 1s (blue).\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nThe rule seems to be about \"bridging\" or \"connecting\" azure regions. Blue pixels are placed in white spaces, but only when two separate \"regions\" of azure are close but not directly touching. The code needs to better differentiate this \"closeness\" and the need for different regions. A combined adjacency check to any immediate neighbor, then verification against direct adjacency will find the right locations.\n"
