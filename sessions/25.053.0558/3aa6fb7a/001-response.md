Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and initial thoughts:



```yaml
facts:
  grid_size: 7x7
  input_colors:
    - white: 0
    - azure: 8
  output_colors:
    - white: 0
    - azure: 8
    - blue: 1
  object_shapes:
    - single_pixels:
        color: azure
    - lines:
        color: azure
        orientation: vertical, horizontal
  changes:
      - color_added: blue
```



**Natural Language Program (Draft):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains azure (8) pixels, some forming vertical and horizontal lines, and the rest are white (0) background pixels.

2.  **Locate Change:** Comparing the input and output, we observe a single blue (1) pixel appearing where previously azure pixels didn't exist. And more specifically this blue pixel always appears in between two distinct groups of azure pixels.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** It appears we have added blue pixels in between distinct groups of azure pixels.

I'll now consider the next example to refine this rule.
