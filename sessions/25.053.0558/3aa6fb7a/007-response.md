Okay, let's analyze the second example, building upon the observations from the first.



```yaml
facts:
  grid_size: 7x7
  input_colors:
    - white: 0
    - azure: 8
  output_colors:
    - white: 0
    - azure: 8
    - blue: 1
  object_shapes:
    - single_pixels:
        color: azure
    - lines:
        color: azure
        orientation: vertical, horizontal
  changes:
      - color_added: blue
```



**Natural Language Program (Refined):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of azure (8) pixels and white (0) background pixels. The azure pixels form distinct groups, which can be single pixels or lines (vertical or horizontal).

2.  **Locate Change:**  The output introduces blue (1) pixels. These blue pixels consistently appear in locations that are adjacent to at least two *different* groups of azure pixels. It's crucial that the neighboring azure pixels belong to distinct groups; otherwise, no blue pixel is added.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Identify all distinct groups of contiguous azure pixels.
    *   Iterate through each white (0) pixel in the grid.
    *   For each white pixel, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *   If a white pixel has neighbors belonging to *more than one* distinct azure group, change the white pixel to blue (1).

The key refinement here is the explicit requirement that the neighboring azure pixels must belong to *different* groups for the blue pixel to be placed. The previous description was slightly ambiguous on this point. This version clarifies the rule's logic and explains how the code works.
