Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and initial thoughts:


```yaml
facts:
  grid_size: 7x7
  input_colors:
    - white: 0
    - azure: 8
  output_colors:
    - white: 0
    - azure: 8
    - blue: 1
  object_shapes:
    - single_pixels:
        color: azure
    - lines:
        color: azure
        orientation: vertical, horizontal
  changes:
      - color_added: blue
```


**Natural Language Program (Draft):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains azure (8) pixels, some forming vertical and horizontal lines, and the rest are white (0) background pixels.

2.  **Locate Change:** Comparing the input and output, we observe a single blue (1) pixel appearing where previously azure pixels didn't exist. And more specifically this blue pixel always appears in between two distinct groups of azure pixels.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** It appears we have added blue pixels in between distinct groups of azure pixels.

I'll now consider the next example to refine this rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
