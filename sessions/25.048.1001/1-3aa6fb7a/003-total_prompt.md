Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two L-shapes (one inverted)
      positions:
        - Top-left: (1,1)
        - Bottom-right: (3,4)
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two L-shapes (one inverted)
      positions:
       - Top-left: (1,1)
       - Bottom-right: (3,4)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions:
        - (1,2) between the two cells of the L-shape
        - (4,5) between the two cells of the L-shape
  dimensions: 7x7

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two distinct "L-shaped" objects made of color 8 (azure). One L-shape is at the top left, and the second L-shape is at the bottom right. The rest of the grid comprises 0 (white) single cells.

2.  **Detect the Filling:** We can observe in the output grid that a color 1 (blue) cell has been placed in between the two cells that form the "legs" of the L-shape object of color 8. The position of this new color is at the direct center point between two cells of the objects.

3.  **Describe the Transformation:** For each "L-shape" object, find the empty cell adjacent to the interior angle formed by the object, which means finding the only adjacent cell between the two cells forming the arms of the L-shape. Fill that cell by color 1(blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is to locate the empty cell at the inner center of each azure (color 8) L-shaped object and fill those positions with a single blue (color 1) cell. All other cells remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
