Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles
      count: 6
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 rectangles
      count: 6
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single pixel
      count: 2
  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects.
    * The first one is located on the left and consists of a vertical 1x2 rectangle with a 1 pixel extension on the bottom right.
    *   The second one is located on the right and consists of a horizontal 1x2 rectange with a 1 pixel extension on the bottom left.
    * The rest of the grid is filled with white (color 0) background.

2.  **Detect changes:**
    * Identify azure colored pixels, specifically at the position of top right corner of the shape.
    * From those positions, substitute the color from azure to blue.

3.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to change the color of top right azure pixel of each azure shape to blue.

In summary:
The input azure shapes are detected. For each shape, the top-right pixel of the shape is found and its color is changed from azure (8) to blue (1). The other parts of azure shapes, and the white background are all unchanged.
