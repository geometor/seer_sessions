Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 000-example_1
observations:
  input_grid:
    - "Size: 7x7"
    - "Colors: 0 (background), 8 (azure)"
    - "Objects: Two separate azure (8) objects. One 2x1 rectangle in the top left, and one 1x2 rectangle in the bottom right."
  output_grid:
    - "Size: 7x7"
    - "Colors: 0 (background), 8 (azure), 1 (blue)"
    - "Objects: The two original azure objects remain. Two blue (1) pixels have appeared, one adjacent to each azure object."
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation**

The transformation rule appears to involve adding a blue (1) pixel adjacent to each existing azure (8) object.  Specifically:

1. **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) objects within the input grid.
2. **Determine Placement:** For each azure object, find a directly adjacent (non-diagonal), empty (0-colored), neighbor cell where a blue pixel can be placed. The placement priority seems to be,
    - Top left azure object: place blue pixel in the right side.
    - Bottom right azure object: place blue pixel in the left side.
3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** Create a new blue (1) pixel at the chosen location.

**Natural Language Program**
```
1. Initialize the output as the same than input.
2. Find every azure object.
3. Insert a blue pixel next to it. If the azure object is in the top left, insert the pixel to its right. If the object is in the bottom right, insert the pixel to its left.
```

This description captures the core logic of the transformation: identifying specific colored objects and adding a new element based on their presence and locations.
