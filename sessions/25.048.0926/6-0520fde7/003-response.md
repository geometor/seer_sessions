Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,5)]
    gray_objects:
      - shape: single cell
        positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: Remaining cells
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_object:
      - shape: corners
        position: [(0,1), (1,2), (2,1)]
    white_objects:
      - shape: irregular
         positions: Remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Determine the center of the input grid, it will be the central gray pixel, which is at the coordinates (1, 3).

2.  **Construct output grid:** Create an output grid with size 3x3 filled with white pixels.

3.  **Count blue objects:** Iterate through each row and count the number of blue objects.

4.  **Place the red object:** Using the blue objects count on step 3, insert this number on the corresponding central pixel of the output grid by row.

In summary, the transformation extracts the central pixel of the original shape to create a new 3x3 grid. For each row, it counts the blue pixels. If the blue count is greater than 0, it replaces the central white pixel in the output grid with a red one (color code 2). The other pixels in the output remain white (color code 0).
