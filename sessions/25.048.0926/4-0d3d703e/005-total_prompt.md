Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping, incrementing each color value by a fixed amount:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have three distinct horizontal lines of colors: green (3), blue (1), and red (2).

2.  **Apply Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color by increment it by a constant value as follows:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4) - increment by 1.
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5) - increment by 4
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6) - increment by 4.

3.  **No other changes** The size and shape, and positions of colors don't change.

**Conclusion**
The increment is not uniform. The transformation is adding 1 to green, and 4 to the other colors.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is, again, a color mapping. The process is similar to the one observed in the first set of grids:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have three distinct horizontal lines of colors: red (2), green (3), and azure (8).

2.  **Apply Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color, incrementing it by the following logic:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6): increment by 4.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4): increment by 1.
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9): increment by 1.

3.  **No other changes** The size and shape, and positions of colors don't change.

**Conclusion**

The increment logic applies different values to different colors.
The transformation is adding 4 to red and 1 to the other colors, similarly to the first task.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
