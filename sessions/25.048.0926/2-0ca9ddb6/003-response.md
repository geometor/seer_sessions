Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the second set of input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cells
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cells
    azure_object:
      color: 8 (azure)
      position: [(0,3)]
      shape: single cell
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: fills the grid

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    red_objects:
      color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
      shape: single cells
    blue_objects:
      color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
      shape: single cells
     azure_object:
      color: 8 (azure)
      position: [(0,3)]
      shape: single cell
    yellow_objects:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
      shape: cross pattern around red objects
    orange_objects:
      color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [ (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: cross pattern surrounding blue object
    background:
      color: 0 (white)
      shape: fills the grid
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all red (color 2) cells and all blue (color 1) cells in the input grid. Note that there are two of each in this example. Also, observe that the azure object remains unchanged.

2.  **Red Object Transformation:** For each red cell, create a cross-shaped pattern of yellow (color 4) cells. The cross is centered one cell above the original red cell position. The cross arms extend one position horizontally. One yellow cell must be created two positions to the north. One yellow cell must be created two positions to the south.

3.  **Blue Object Transformation:** For each blue cell, create a cross-shaped pattern of orange (color 7) cells. The arms of this cross each extend one cell, centered on the blue object: one cell directly to its north, one cell directly to its south, one cell to its west, and one cell to its east.

4.  **Preservation**: The positions of the original red cells, blue cells and the azure cell are preserved.

**Summary of the Rule**

The transformation rule involves drawing yellow crosses centered one cell above each of the red cells, and orange crosses centered on each of the blue cells. The original red, blue, and azure cells, remain, and all other positions remain unchanged. This confirms that the rule identified in the first example pair is general and applicable to multiple instances of the colored objects.

```python
"""
