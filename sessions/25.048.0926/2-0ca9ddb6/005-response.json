The cross is centered one cell above the original position. This cross consists of one cell directly to its west and another cell to its east. It consists of one cell two positions to its north and one cell two positions to its south. The position of the red cell does not change.\n\n3.  **Blue Object Transformation:** For the blue cell, create a cross-shaped pattern of orange (color 7) cells, centered on the original blue cell. The arms of this cross each extend one cell, one cell directly to its north, another cell to its south and one cell directly to its west, and another to its east.\n\n4.  **Preserve:** The original red, blue, and magenta objects remain in their initial positions. The rest of the grid remains filled with color 0 (white).\n\n**Summary of the Rule**\n\nThe transformation rule involves drawing a yellow cross above the red cell and an orange cross around the blue cell. The original red, blue and magenta cells remain, other positions remain unchanged.\n"
