            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**Observations in YAML Format**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 6x6\n  objects:\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      count: 28\n      positions: Most of the grid\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      count: 1\n      position: (0,5)\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (1,3), (4,3)\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      count: 3\n      positions: (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (4,2), (5,2)\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 6x6\n  objects:\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      count: 28\n      positions: Most of the grid\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      count: 3\n      positions: (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      count: 2\n      positions: (4,2), (5,2)\n   - color: 8 (azure)\n      count: 1\n      positions: (5,3)\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      count: 1\n      position: (5,5)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program Description**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify non-white cells:** Locate all cells in the input grid that do *not* have the color white (0).\n\n2.  **Move to Bottom Row, Preserve Order**: Move a copy of all the non-white cells to the last row of the grid. The order of non-white cells in the input is maintained in the output. The colored cells are placed from left to right in the bottom row, according to the column-major order of their appearance in the input.\n\n3.  **Remove**: If any adjacent cell has the same color after relocating, only keep the leftmost one, and remove duplicate colors to its right, to avoid having adjacent cells in the last row of output with the same color.\n \n**Inferred Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\nThe colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original order, and removing equal adjacent colored cells. The remaining cells are set to white (0).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\nThe colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original order, and removing equal adjacent colored cells.

Sort non-white cells to preserve the column-major order in the bottom row\n    non_white_cells_sorted = sorted(non_white_cells, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))\n    # non_white_cells_sorted = sorted(non_white_cells, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[1]))\n     \n    # 3. Place the sorted non-white cells in the last row of the output grid.\n    last_row_index = 0\n    for cell in non_white_cells_sorted:\n        output_grid[rows - 1, last_row_index] = cell[0]\n        last_row_index += 1\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n"
