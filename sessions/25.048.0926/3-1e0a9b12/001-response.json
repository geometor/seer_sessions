The order of non-white cells in the input is maintained in the output: The colored cells are arranged in the last row, sorted from left to right, following the column major order in the input.\n\n3. **Remove**: Remove cells that have the same value of an adjacent cell (left, right, up, down).\n\n**Inferred Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\nThe colored objects from the input are copied and consolidated/moved into the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their original order, and removing equal adjacent colored cells. The remaining cells are set to white (0).\n"
