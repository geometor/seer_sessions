The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)` loses its down-left corner which turns blue.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be described as follows:\n\nLocate any azure (8) L-shaped object, find its up-right and down-left corner, and change the color to blue(1).\n"
