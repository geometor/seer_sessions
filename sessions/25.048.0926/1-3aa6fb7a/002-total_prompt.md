Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** These objects will be modified.

3.  **Detect corner change:** The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)` loses its up-right corner which turns blue. The azure L-shaped which is constituted by cells `(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)` loses its down-left corner which turns blue.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

Locate any azure (8) L-shaped object, find its up-right and down-left corner, and change the color to blue(1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
