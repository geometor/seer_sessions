Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [11, 11]
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: irregular
      position: centered, spanning multiple rows and columns
      bounding_box: [[2, 2], [7, 8]]
  background:
    color: 0

output_grid:
  dimensions: [11, 11]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: irregular, L-shaped
      position: Top-left part of the original gray object.
      bounding_box: [[2,2], [7,4]]
    - color: 2
      shape: irregular, mirrored L.
      position: Bottom-right part, replacing parts of the original grey.
      bounding_box: [[3,3], [7,7]]

  background:
    color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the single connected object composed of gray (color 5) cells in the input grid.

2.  **Divide and Conquer:**
    The object is replaced by two colors: azure (8) and red (2).

    - The azure (8) color fills the "top-left" segment and it is defined like this: if the object cell is above or on the main diagonal that goes from the element (0,0) of the bounding box, to the element (n,n) of the bounding box, but without counting the last row, it takes azure (8).
    - The red (2) replaces the "bottom-right" segment that is defined like this: if the object cell is below the main diagonal that goes from the element (0,0) of the bounding box, to the element (n,n) of the bounding box, and it's not in the top row, it takes color red (2).

3.  **Background Preservation:** The cells that are not part of the gray object (color 0) remain unchanged.

```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies a single connected gray (color 5) object in the input grid. This object is then divided into two parts based on the main diagonal of its bounding box. The upper-left part, above or on the diagonal (excluding the last row of the bounding box ), is colored azure (8). The bottom-right part, below the diagonal (excluding the top row of the bounding box), is colored red (2). Cells outside the gray object remain unchanged (color 0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
