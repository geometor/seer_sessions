Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes (or two separate 2x1 rectangles + one isolated cell for each)"
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 squares"
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). Each object is a separate connected component. These azure objects remain in the output grid.
2.  **Observe Single Color Substitutions:** Look at any single azure (8) cell from the input grid, not connected with other azure cells horizontally or vertically.
3. **Change Isolated cell to Blue:** Change this azure cell to blue (1). In the first group (top-left), the isolated azure is at (1,2). In the second group (bottom-right), the azure is at position (5,4). The rule changes these two cells.

**Elaborated Description of the Transformation**

The core transformation rule is: Find azure (8) cells that are not horizontally or vertically connected to another azure cell. Then, change the color of that cell from azure (8) to blue (1). Azure cells which have horizontal/vertical azure neighbors must remain azure.
