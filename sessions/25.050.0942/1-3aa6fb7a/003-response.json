For instance, in the input, the azure cell at (1, 4) changes to (1,4) in output; azure cell at (2,3) changes to blue at (2,3); azure cell at (5,3) becomes blue cell at (5,3).\n4. Azure objects that form bigger shapes must remain unchanged.\n\n**Elaborated Description of the Transformation**\n\nThe transformation rule is the following: Check every azure (8) cell. If an azure cell does not have any horizontally or vertically adjacent azure cells, it changes its color to blue (1). All other azure cells remain the same. The overall structure and position of most azure shapes/objects are preserved except where isolated azure cells become blue.\n\nThe python code provided is consistent with this rule and should produce the correct transformation.\n"
