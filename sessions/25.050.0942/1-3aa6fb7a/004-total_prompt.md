Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes (or two separate 2x1 rectangles + one isolated cell for each)"
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two 1x1 squares"
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). Each object is a separate connected component. These azure objects remain in the output grid.
2.  **Observe Single Color Substitutions:** Look at any single azure (8) cell from the input grid, not connected with other azure cells horizontally or vertically.
3. **Change Isolated cell to Blue:** Change this azure cell to blue (1). In the first group (top-left), the isolated azure is at (1,2). In the second group (bottom-right), the azure is at position (5,4). The rule changes these two cells.

**Elaborated Description of the Transformation**

The core transformation rule is: Find azure (8) cells that are not horizontally or vertically connected to another azure cell. Then, change the color of that cell from azure (8) to blue (1). Azure cells which have horizontal/vertical azure neighbors must remain azure.

```python
"""
Find azure (8) cells that are not horizontally or vertically connected to another azure cell. 
Then, change the color of that cell from azure (8) to blue (1). 
Azure cells which have horizontal/vertical azure neighbors must remain azure.

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each cell of the grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check if the cell is azure (8)

                neighbors = []
                if r > 0:

                if r < rows - 1:

                if c < cols - 1:
                    neighbors.append(input_grid[r, c+1])  # Right

                # Check if any neighbor is also azure (8)

                for neighbor_color in neighbors:
                    if neighbor_color == 8:
                        is_isolated = False
                        break

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Multiple connected components of color 8"
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5,4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Same connected azure components as the input"
     - color: 1
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Isolated cells"
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains multiple azure (8) colored objects.
2.  **Observe Single Color Substitutions:** Identify azure (8) cells that are *not* connected horizontally or vertically to any other azure (8) cells.
3.  **Change Isolated cell to Blue**: Transform those specific azure cells into blue (1) cells. For instance, in the input, the azure cell at (1, 4) changes to (1,4) in output; azure cell at (2,3) changes to blue at (2,3); azure cell at (5,3) becomes blue cell at (5,3).
4. Azure objects that form bigger shapes must remain unchanged.

**Elaborated Description of the Transformation**

The transformation rule is the following: Check every azure (8) cell. If an azure cell does not have any horizontally or vertically adjacent azure cells, it changes its color to blue (1). All other azure cells remain the same. The overall structure and position of most azure shapes/objects are preserved except where isolated azure cells become blue.

The python code provided is consistent with this rule and should produce the correct transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
