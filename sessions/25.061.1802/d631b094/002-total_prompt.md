**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids as input and output. The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size (1x2, 1x3, 1x1, 1x4). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The core task seems to be extracting specific colored pixels from the input grid and forming a new output grid with only those extracted pixels. The non-zero pixels in the input seem to be the "objects" of interest, and the transformation involves selecting and potentially replicating these objects based on their color/value. The "background" is always color 0 (white). The output grid only contains the selected color and its dimensions are determined by the number of times the color occurred in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: object_extraction
  input:
    type: 2D_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    data_type: integer
    values: 0-9
  output:
    type: 2D_grid
    dimensions: variable (1xn)
    data_type: integer
    values: matches_non_zero_input_values
  objects:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        color: integer (0-9)
        position: (row, col)
  actions:
    - select: non-zero pixels
    - replicate: selected pixels to form output grid
  relationships:
    - input_grid_contains: multiple pixels
    - output_grid_contains: selected pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero pixels within the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Determine** the color (numerical value) of the non-zero pixels. Note that within each input grid there is only ever a single color present.
3.  **Count** the number of times this non-zero color appears in the input grid.
4.  **Create** a new 1 x N output grid, where N is the count obtained in step 3.
5.  **Fill** all cells of the output grid with the non-zero color value identified in step 2.

In essence, the program extracts all non-zero pixels of a specific color from the input grid and creates a new horizontal grid containing only that color, with the length of the new grid equal to the number of occurrences of the color in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
