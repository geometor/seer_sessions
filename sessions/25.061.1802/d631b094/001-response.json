            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids as input and output. The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size (1x2, 1x3, 1x1, 1x4). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The core task seems to be extracting specific colored pixels from the input grid and forming a new output grid with only those extracted pixels. The non-zero pixels in the input seem to be the \"objects\" of interest, and the transformation involves selecting and potentially replicating these objects based on their color/value. The \"background\" is always color 0 (white). The output grid only contains the selected color and its dimensions are determined by the number of times the color occurred in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
