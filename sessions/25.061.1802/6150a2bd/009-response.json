The core logic of rotating the grid is sound. Let's examine the new cases to ensure comprehensive understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nAll examples are correct. No need for specific reports.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 00d62c1b\nfacts:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - shape: variable dimensions\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - shape: dimensions are swapped and reversed compared to input_grid (due to rotation)\n  - action: rotate\n    description: The input_grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    details:\n      - The rotation swaps rows and columns.\n      - The order of rows in the input becomes the order of columns in the output, but in reversed sequence.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. All elements maintain their original values, only their positions within the grid change according to the rotation. The number of rows in the input grid becomes the number of columns in the output grid, and the number of columns in the input grid becomes the number of rows in the output grid. The order of elements is also adjusted to reflect the counter-clockwise rotation.\n"
