Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid. The colors/values within the grid are preserved, but their positions change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_pixels
  - observation: input and output grids have same dimensions
  - observation: values/colors in input grid are preserved in output grid
  - action: rotation
    type: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.  All elements maintain their original values, only their positions within the grid change according to the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
