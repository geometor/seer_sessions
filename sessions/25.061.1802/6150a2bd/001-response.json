Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\nThe task involves two 3x3 grids in each example. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a different color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation and possibly some form of mirroring or reflection. The relative positions of the numbers change significantly, suggesting a reordering rather than a simple in-place modification. The colors remain associated with their original numbers throughout.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"

Imagine grabbing the upper right corner and twisting to lower right.\n\n3.  **Output:** The rotated grid is the output.\n\nThe key concept is the 90 degree clockwise rotation of the grid, and not a reflection.\n\nThe colors/numbers maintain consistant relatonships, all being rotated together.\n"
