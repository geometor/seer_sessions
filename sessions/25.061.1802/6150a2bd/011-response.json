            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code correctly identified the transformation rule as a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The provided code using `np.rot90` accurately implements this rotation. Since the code works for all training examples, no code changes are needed. The initial description also appears accurate.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify:** Double-check that the code indeed works for all provided training examples. Although the prompt states it works, explicit verification is crucial. Since it passed the training, let's assume this passed.\n2.  **Metrics & Observations:** Analyze each input-output pair, focusing on dimensions and how the rotation affects specific pixel positions.\n3.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing the core concept (rotation) and relevant observations.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Ensure the natural language program is concise and accurately describes the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n\n**Metrics & Observations (Example Analysis):**\n\nSince we do not have explicit examples, let's represent a generic example and reason based on dimensions change.\n\n*   **Generic Example:**\n    *   Input Grid: `H x W` (Height x Width)\n    *   Output Grid: `W x H` (Width x Height)\n    *   Pixel (r, c) in Input -> Pixel (c, H - 1 - r) in Output\n\n*Example*\n\nInput:\n```\n[[1, 2, 3],\n [4, 5, 6]]\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[[3, 6],\n [2, 5],\n [1, 4]]\n```\n\nInput shape is 2x3. Output shape is 3x2.\n\nPixel (0,0) which is 1, moves to (0, 2-1-0) = (0,1).\nPixel (0,1) which is 2, moves to (1, 2-1-0) = (1,1).\nPixel (0,2) which is 3, moves to (2, 2-1-0) = (2,1).\nPixel (1,0) which is 4, moves to (0, 2-1-1) = (0,0).\nPixel (1,1) which is 5, moves to (1, 2-1-1) = (1,0).\nPixel (1,2) which is 6, moves to (2, 2-1-1) = (2,0).\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\ntransformation:\n  type: rotation\n  direction: counter-clockwise\n  degrees: 90\n  input_shape: H x W\n  output_shape: W x H\n  pixel_mapping: (r, c) -> (c, H - 1 - r)\n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. This means the rows of the input become the columns of the output, and the columns of the input become the rows of the output, but in reverse order. The element at row `r` and column `c` in the input grid will be located at row `c` and column `H-1-r` in the output grid, where `H` is the height of the input grid.\n"
