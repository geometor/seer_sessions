Each line is two cells high and one cell wide.\n\n2.  **Observe Changes:** We see in output that the first azure shape maintained as is. And, a new blue pixel (color 1) appears immediately to the right of the top pixel of each azure line.\n\n3. **Describe the Rule:**\n    - Scan the input grid from the upper shape to the lower shape.\n    - For each top pixel of an azure shape, identify their right-adjacent position, in order.\n    - Add new pixel by drawing at these positions with blue(color 1).\n\n"
