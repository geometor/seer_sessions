Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical lines
        positions:
          - (1,1), (2,1)  # One line
          - (4,3), (5,3)  # Another line
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the remaining cells
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical lines
        positions:
          - (1,1), (2,1)  # One line
          - (4,3), (5,3)  # Another line
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - (1,2) # Next to first azure line
          - (4,4)   # Next to second azure line
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the remaining cells

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct vertical lines of color 8 (azure). Each line is two cells high and one cell wide.

2.  **Observe Changes:** We see in output that the first azure shape maintained as is. And, a new blue pixel (color 1) appears immediately to the right of the top pixel of each azure line.

3. **Describe the Rule:**
    - Scan the input grid from the upper shape to the lower shape.
    - For each top pixel of an azure shape, identify their right-adjacent position, in order.
    - Add new pixel by drawing at these positions with blue(color 1).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
