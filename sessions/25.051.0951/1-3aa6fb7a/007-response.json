            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program and the Python code.\n\n**Analysis of the Failed Examples**\n\nThe previous code and description have a flaw: it places a blue pixel to the *left or right* indiscriminately. It prioritizes the left, but if the left is occupied, it checks the right. The issue is, it doesn't consistently apply the blue pixel to the same side for all azure pixels. Looking closely at the *expected* outputs in the examples reveals a specific pattern: the blue pixel is added to the *right* of the *rightmost* azure pixel in a contiguous horizontal sequence of azure pixels, and to the *left* of the *leftmost* azure pixel if there is an empty space.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a revised natural language description of the transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous horizontal sequences of azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Place Blue Pixels to the left and the right:** for each azure region, place a blue (color 1) pixel immediately to the right of the *rightmost* azure pixel of this region, and another blue pixel at the left, only if these are blank pixels.\n\n**Revised Python Code (Conceptual - High Level)**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        c = 0\n        while c < cols:\n            if output_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                # Found start of an azure region\n                start_c = c\n                while c < cols and output_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                    c += 1\n                end_c = c - 1  # Index of the rightmost azure pixel\n\n                # Place blue to the right of the rightmost\n                if end_c + 1 < cols and output_grid[r, end_c + 1] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r, end_c + 1] = 1\n                # Place blue to the left of the leftmost\n                if start_c -1 >= 0 and output_grid[r, start_c -1] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r,start_c -1] = 1\n            else:\n                c += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Improvements**\n\n*   **Contiguous Region Handling:** The code now explicitly identifies *contiguous horizontal regions* of azure pixels. It uses a `while` loop to find the start and end of each azure region.\n*   **Rightmost and leftmost Pixel Logic:**  The code specifically places a blue pixel to the right of the `end_c` (rightmost azure pixel) and to the left of the 'start_c'.\n*   **Boundary Checks:** It continues to perform important boundary checks (`end_c + 1 < cols` and `start_c - 1 >= 0`) to prevent index-out-of-bounds errors.\n*   **White space Check** Added a condition to perform operation only on blank pixels.\n\nThis revised approach correctly captures the transformation rule observed in the provided examples. It focuses on identifying regions of azure pixels and placing blue pixels adjacently, respecting boundaries and prioritizing the right side of the rightmost azure pixel of the region, and the left side of the leftmost azure pixel.\n"
