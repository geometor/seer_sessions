And, a new blue pixel (color 1) can appear immediately to the left or the right of an azure pixel, only once for an azure pixel.\n\n3. **Describe the Rule:**\n    - Scan the input grid from the upper shape to the lower shape.\n    - For each azure shape, identify their right-adjacent and left-adjacent position, in order.\n    - If a position doesn't have any colored pixel, add a new pixel by drawing at these positions with blue(color 1).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Identify all azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.\n2. For each identified pixel, check its immediate left or right. If it is empty, then place a blue (color 1) there.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find pixels of specified color.\n    \"\"\"\n    pixels = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color:\n                pixels.append((r, c))\n    return pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:\n    1.
