            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the color replacement rule (8, 2, and 3 to 5) and implemented it. The provided code passed all training examples. Therefore, no change is needed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with colors 8, 2, and some others.\n    *   Output: Colors 8 and 2 are replaced with 5.\n    *   Result: Success. The code correctly replaced 8 and 2 with 5.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid.\n    *   Output: Colors 8, 2 and 3 are replaced by 5.\n    *   Result: Success.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid\n    *    Output: colors 8, 2 and 3 are replaced by 5\n    *   Result: Success\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  example_1:\n    input_grid_shape: 3x3\n    output_grid_shape: 3x3\n    color_changes:\n      - original: 8\n        replacement: 5\n      - original: 2\n        replacement: 5\n  example_2:\n    input_grid_shape: 5x5\n    output_grid_shape: 5x5\n    color_changes:\n      - original: 8\n        replacement: 5\n      - original: 2\n        replacement: 5\n      - original: 3\n        replacement: 5\n  example_3:\n    input_grid_shape: 7x7\n    output_grid_shape: 7x7\n    color_changes:\n      - original: 8\n        replacement: 5\n      - original: 2\n        replacement: 5\n      - original: 3\n        replacement: 5\n  \n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a simple color substitution:\n\n1.  Identify all pixels with the color azure (8), red (2) or green (3).\n2.  Change the color of these identified pixels to gray (5).\n3.  All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
