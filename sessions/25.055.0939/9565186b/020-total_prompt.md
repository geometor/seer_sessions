## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 3 8
4 4 4
8 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B969BA0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
4 4 4
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B9681C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.  The input grid contains a variety of colors (green, yellow, azure, blue), while the output grid appears to simplify the colors, retaining the yellow row and changing the rest to gray. The key seems to be identifying and preserving the row that is entirely composed of a single color, and specifically, yellow (color 4).  All other cells become gray (color 5).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
  - object: Input grid (3x3)
  - object: Output grid (3x3)
  - property: Each cell in the grids has a color value (0-9).
  - property: Colors are represented by integers.
  - action: Identify the row in the input grid where all pixels have the same color value.
  - action: identify if the row with all the same color is yellow.
  - action: If a solid yellow (color 4) row is found, maintain it in the output grid.
  - action: Change all other cells to gray (color 5) in output grid.
  - relationship: The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions.
  - relationship: The middle row of the input consisting of the color yellow (4) is maintained in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Inspect the input grid:** Examine each row of the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Identify Homogeneous Rows:** For each row, check if all pixels within that row have the same color value.
3.  **Check for Yellow:** if the identified row is color 4 (yellow)
4.  **Preserve Yellow Row:** If a row exists which only contains yellow, copy that entire row to the corresponding row in the output grid.
5.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells in the output grid, *not* part of the preserved yellow row, are set to color 5 (gray).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
