The colors are represented by single digits (0-9).  The most obvious change is the replacement of certain colors with others, seemingly based on their original color. There isn't an apparent geometric transformation (rotation, reflection, etc.). The transformation seems to focus solely on color replacement.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
