The input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid retains the red pixels (2) in their original positions but replaces both the blue and azure pixels with gray (5) pixels. The transformation seems to be a color replacement based on location and original color. The red color is a constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
