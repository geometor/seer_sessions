    Transforms the input grid by replacing colors 8, 2 and 3 with 5.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the color replacement rule (8, 2, and 3 to 5) and implemented it. The provided code passed all training examples. Therefore, no change is needed.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with colors 8, 2, and some others.
    *   Output: Colors 8 and 2 are replaced with 5.
    *   Result: Success. The code correctly replaced 8 and 2 with 5.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid.
    *   Output: Colors 8, 2 and 3 are replaced by 5.
    *   Result: Success.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid
    *    Output: colors 8, 2 and 3 are replaced by 5
    *   Result: Success

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  example_1:
    input_grid_shape: 3x3
    output_grid_shape: 3x3
    color_changes:
      - original: 8
        replacement: 5
      - original: 2
        replacement: 5
  example_2:
    input_grid_shape: 5x5
    output_grid_shape: 5x5
    color_changes:
      - original: 8
        replacement: 5
      - original: 2
        replacement: 5
      - original: 3
        replacement: 5
  example_3:
    input_grid_shape: 7x7
    output_grid_shape: 7x7
    color_changes:
      - original: 8
        replacement: 5
      - original: 2
        replacement: 5
      - original: 3
        replacement: 5
  
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color substitution:

1.  Identify all pixels with the color azure (8), red (2) or green (3).
2.  Change the color of these identified pixels to gray (5).
3.  All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
