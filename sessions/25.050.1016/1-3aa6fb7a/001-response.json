The top-left most is the object that has the smallest x and y coordinates. The bottom-right most has the largest x and y coordinates.\nCreate a blue pixel (1) by moving +1 on the y-axis from the top-left most, and another by moving -1 in the x-axis of the bottom-right most azure pixel. The rest of azure color pixels remain unchanged.\n"
