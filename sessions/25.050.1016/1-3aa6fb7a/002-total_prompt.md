Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) colored shapes, can consider it as individual pixels or two separate groups."
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Same structure as input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,3)]
    
      shape: "Two single blue (1) pixels."
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we have azure (color 8) pixels at the following locations: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 4).

2. **Introduce blue color:**
    - The azure object at (1,1) becomes the anchor point for a blue color 1 pixel at position +1 on the y-axis, that is position (1,2).
    - The azure object at (5,4) becomes the anchor point for a blue color 1 pixel at position -1 on the x-axis, that is position (4,3).
3.  **Preserve Other Azure Pixels:** All other azure pixels remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is as follows: Find the top-left most and bottom-right most azure (8) objects. The top-left most is the object that has the smallest x and y coordinates. The bottom-right most has the largest x and y coordinates.
Create a blue pixel (1) by moving +1 on the y-axis from the top-left most, and another by moving -1 in the x-axis of the bottom-right most azure pixel. The rest of azure color pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
