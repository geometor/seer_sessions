facts:
  - observation: |
      The number of red pixels in the input grid is counted.
  - observation: |
      One is added to the count of red pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's dimensions vary.
  - observation: |
      In example 1, the red pixel count is 2, plus one is 3, and the output is a 1x1 grid with the value [3].
  - observation: |
      In example 2, the red pixel count is 3, plus one is 4, and the output is a 2x2 grid with all values [4].
  - observation: |
      In example 3, the red pixel count is 1, plus one is 2, and the output is a 1x1 grid with the value [2].
  - conclusion: |
      The output grid is a square, where the height and width is equal to the input red count, and each cell value equal to the input red count.
