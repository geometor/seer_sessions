            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code and update our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was overly simplistic, focusing solely on the first training example. It incorrectly assumed that the output would always be a 1x1 grid filled with blue (color index 1). The test results on the subsequent examples clearly demonstrate this assumption is wrong. The core issue is that the initial program didn't discern any relationship between the input and output grids, only observed the presence of red in the first example and fixated on blue, possibly as the requested output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** We need to meticulously examine all input-output pairs, not just the first one.\n2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent relationships between the input and output grids across all examples. This includes:\n    *   Object Identification: Determine what constitutes an \"object\" in these grids.\n    *   Object Properties: Color, size, position, shape.\n    *   Transformations: How are the objects in the input related to objects in the output.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the true transformation rule, accounting for all examples.\n4.  **Re-evaluate color mapping:** Ensure we accurately capture the purpose and role of each color.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo help, I will use comments to derive an understanding of how input is transformed to output in each set, looking for differences between the transform code execution result and the expected result.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 2 2 2 0]\n [0 2 2 2 0]\n [0 2 2 2 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[1]]\nCode Result:\n[[1]]\nDifference: None\n\n#Observation: Input contains red pixels (2) surrounded by white (0). Output is 1x1 blue(1).\n```\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 2 2 2 0]\n [0 2 4 2 0]\n [0 2 2 2 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[1]]\nCode Result:\n[[1]]\nDifference: None\n\n#Observation: Input contains a yellow (4) pixel inside of red (2) pixels surrounded by white (0). Output is 1x1 blue(1).\n```\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 2 2 2 0 0]\n [0 0 2 2 2 0 0]\n [0 0 2 2 2 0 0]\n [0 0 2 2 4 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[1]]\nCode Result:\n[[1]]\nDifference: None\n\n#Observation: Input contains a yellow pixel inside of red pixels surrounded by white. Output is 1x1 blue.\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      objects:\n        - type: rectangle\n          color: red\n          surrounded_by: white\n      output:\n        - type: single_pixel\n          color: blue\n  - example_2:\n      objects:\n        - type: rectangle\n          color: red\n          contains:\n            - type: single_pixel\n              color: yellow\n          surrounded_by: white\n      output:\n        - type: single_pixel\n          color: blue\n  - example_3:\n      objects:\n        - type: rectangle\n          color: red\n          contains:\n            - type: single_pixel\n              color: yellow\n          surrounded_by: white\n      output:\n        - type: single_pixel\n          color: blue\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Observe the input grid. Identify the presence of a contiguous block of red pixels. This block may or may not contain a single yellow pixel. This red region is surrounded by white pixels.\n2.  Regardless of the input grid's contents, create a 1x1 output grid.\n3.  Fill this output grid with blue (color index 1).\n\nThe core concept revealed through the examples is that the output will always be a 1 x 1 grid containing blue (color index 1).\n"
