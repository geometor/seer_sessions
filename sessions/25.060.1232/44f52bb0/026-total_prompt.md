**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B94F8D0>

**output:**
```

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B8FC850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The output is a single numerical value. The input grid contains the colors white (0) and red (2). The example output is 7 (orange). It appears the task involves some operation on the colored pixels in the input, resulting in a single-digit output. The presence of '2' (red) in the input, and '7'(orange) in the output suggests there's no direct mapping between the colors in the input and the final color in the output, so, it must be related with number of pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - input_type: grid
  - input_dimensions: 3x3
  - input_values: [0, 2]
  - input_colors: [white, red]
  - output_type: single_value
  - output_value: 7
  - output_color: orange
  - objects:
      - description: red pixels
        count: 3
      - description: white pixels
        count: 6
relationships:
- relationship: The input grid contains specific colored pixels.
- relationship:  The output is a single numerical value probably derived from the input grid.
actions:
- action: Count the number of red pixels.
- action: Calculate a value based on the count.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Red Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid and count the number of pixels with the value '2' (red).
2.  **Multiply by 3 - then add 1:** Multiply the count of red (2) pixels in the input by 3 and add one (+1).
3.  **Return as Result:** Return the value.

In this example, we had a input containing:
* red count = 3
* 3 * 2 + 1 = 7
* output = 7


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
