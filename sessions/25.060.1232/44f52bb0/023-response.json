            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved counting red pixels, adding one, and creating a square grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example. The size and color of the generated grid are not always connected to the initial red count. We need a more general rule.\n\nMy strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze each example**: Carefully examine the input and output grids, focusing on the relationship between them, not just the red pixels. I will run a code block to gather grid dimensions, pixel counts for each color, and relationships of size, color, and pixel counts.\n2.  **Identify common patterns**: Look for consistent relationships that hold across *all* training examples.\n3.  **Revise the natural language program**:  Develop a new program that captures the generalized transformation rule, and is not overly specific.\n4.  Verify: Mentally check, that the proposed general rule will be applicable to all the input/output pairs provided.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)\n\n    input_dims = input_grid.shape\n    output_dims = output_grid.shape\n\n    input_colors = {}\n    for color in range(10):\n        input_colors[color] = np.sum(input_grid == color)\n\n    output_colors = {}\n    for color in range(10):\n        output_colors[color] = np.sum(output_grid == color)\n    \n    print(f\"Input Dimensions: {input_dims}\")\n    print(f\"Output Dimensions: {output_dims}\")\n    print(f\"Input Colors: {input_colors}\")\n    print(f\"Output Colors: {output_colors}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\nexamples = [\n    ([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]], [[21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20], [21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20]]),\n    ([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], [[17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16], [17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16], [17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16], [17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16]]),\n    ([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]], [[13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11], [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11], [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11], [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11], [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11], [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11]]),\n]\n\nfor i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)\n\n```\n\n**Observations and Facts (YAML)**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        dimensions: [4, 20]\n        shape: rectangle\n        colors: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 80, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}\n        dominant_color: 2\n      output:\n        dimensions: [20, 20]\n        shape: square\n        colors: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 20:380, 21: 0} # Note: Output color should have been 20: 0 and 21:380\n        dominant_color: 21 # and 20\n      transformation:\n        type: resize_and_fill\n        rule: \"Output grid is a square.
