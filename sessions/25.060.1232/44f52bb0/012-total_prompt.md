**input:**
```
2 0 2
2 0 2
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B9E74D0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B8566D0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing two colors: red (2) and white (0). The input image shows a distinct pattern.
*   **Output:** A 1x1 grid containing a single blue (1) pixel. The output seems to be a significant reduction and simplification of the input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to be reducing the entire input grid into a single pixel, perhaps based on some property of the input grid. The output color (blue) is not present in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2] # white, red
    description: Input grid with a pattern of red and white pixels.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements: [1] # blue
    description: Output grid consisting of a single blue pixel.

  - action: reduce_grid
    description: The input grid is reduced to a single pixel.

  - relationship: color_change
    description: output color not present in the input grid.
    input_colors: [0,2]
    output_colors: [1]

  - observation: pattern_in_input
    input_pattern: red pixels form a vertical and horizontal cross, leaving the center white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Pattern Recognition**: Identify the presence of color 2(Red) and 0(White).
3. **Reduce and change color**: Reduce the input to 1 and set the color to Blue.
4.  **Output:** Create a 1x1 grid containing the single blue pixel.

In simpler terms, the program reduces the input grid to a single, blue-colored pixel, regardless the content.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
