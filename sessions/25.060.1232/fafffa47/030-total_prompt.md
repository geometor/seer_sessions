Previous Code:
```python
"""
Divides the input grid into 2x1 sections and maps colors based on the presence of maroon (9) and blue (1) pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    height, width = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((height // 2, width), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each 2x1 section
    for i in range(0, height, 2):
        for j in range(width):
            section = input_grid[i:i+2, j:j+1]

            # Map colors based on section content
            if 9 in section:
                output_grid[i//2, j] = 2
            elif 1 in section:
              output_grid[i//2,j] = 0 #explicit null
            else:
                output_grid[i//2, j] = 0

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a reasonable, but incomplete, interpretation of the first training example. It correctly identifies the 2x1 sectioning of the input grid and attempts a color mapping. However, it fails to capture the full logic, as evidenced by errors in subsequent examples. The core issue is that the mapping is not simply "if 9 then 2, if 1 then 0", but has some other conditions. The code execution results will confirm the true mapping.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Execute the code:** Run the `transform` function on all training inputs.
2.  **Analyze the results:** Compare predicted outputs with actual outputs, focusing on color mismatches. This will reveal the conditions under which specific colors are produced.
3. **Re-evaluate objects, actions, properties**: Use code execution to look more closely at the input.
4.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to accurately capture the complete transformation rule.

**Code Execution and Metric Gathering**

I'll use the `code_execution` tool to run the provided code on each training input and compare the results with the expected outputs. I'll collect metrics, focusing on where the predicted and actual outputs differ.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
