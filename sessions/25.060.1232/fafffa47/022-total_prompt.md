Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 6x3 grid containing single-digit integers (0, 1, 9). These represent colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid, seemingly a compressed or summarized version of the input, containing single-digit integers (0,2).
*   **Colors:** The input features white (0), maroon (9) and blue(1). The output features white (0) and red (2).
*    The output grid is exactly half the height of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements: [0, 1, 9]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2]
  - relation: output_grid_height: "half of input_grid_height"
  - action: map_color
    input_color: 9
    output_color: 2
  - action: map_color
    input_color: 1
    output_color: 0
    
  - action: compress
    description: "every two rows of the input grid maps to one row on the output grid"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Prepare an output grid that is 3x3 (half the height of the input, same width).
2.  **Row-wise Compression:** Iterate through the input grid, taking two rows at a time.
3. **Color Mapping within rows:**
    *   If a cell in the two rows considered is maroon (9), map it to red (2) in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    *    If a cell is blue(1), map to to white(0).
    *    Otherwise maintain the same value (white=0)
4.  **Output:** Return the resulting 3x3 output grid.

In essence, the transformation appears to condense the input grid vertically by a factor of two, mapping each pair of rows into a single row in the output, performing a color substitution, and preserving horizontal alignment.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
