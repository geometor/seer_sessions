The input grid is larger (6x3) than the output grid (3x3).  The colors in the input are white, maroon, and blue. The output contains only white and red. It appears that sections of the input grid are somehow summarized or condensed into the output grid. The specific colors present in the input seem to influence both the presence and color of pixels in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
