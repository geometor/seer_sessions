Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input consists of two distinct, vertically stacked grids. The top grid contains the color maroon (9) and white (0), while the bottom grid consists of blue (1) and white (0). The output is a single grid, smaller in height than the combined input grids, and contains only red (2) and white (0). The maroon and blue colors in the input grid are replaced by red and white, respectively, in the output grid. It seems like the height of input is reduced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: top_grid
    type: grid
    colors: [maroon, white]
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: 3
  - name: bottom_grid
    type: grid
    colors: [blue, white]
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: 3
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    colors: [red, white]
    properties:
      height: top_grid.height
      width: 3

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    input: [top_grid, bottom_grid]
    parameters:
        maroon: red
        blue: white
        white: white
    output: output_grid

  - name: reduce_height
    input: [ top_grid, bottom_grid]
    parameters:
            final_height: top_grid.height
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: vertical_stack
    objects: [top_grid, bottom_grid]
  - type: transformation
    input: [top_grid, bottom_grid]
    output: output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** two input grids: a "top grid" and a "bottom grid".
2.  **Determine** the height of the top input grid.
3.  **Create** an output grid with the same width as the input grids (3) and height of top grid.
4. **Replace Colors**: Iterate through the cells of the top input grid:
    *   If a cell in the top grid is maroon (9), the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes red (2).
    *   If a cell in the top grid is white (0), the corresponding cell in the output grid remains white (0).
5. **Ignore**: bottom grid is not used in creation of the output.

In essence, the transformation extracts the top grid from the input, replaces maroon with red, and uses that as the output grid.
