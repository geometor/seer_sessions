      input_objects:
        - object_1:
            type: rectangle
            color: blue
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [3, 3]
      output_objects:
        - object_1:
            type: rectangle
            color: blue
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [3, 3]
      transformation: Copy the first detected 3x3 uniform blue region to the output grid, maintaining its original position.
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:
            type: rectangle
            color: gray
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [3, 3]
        - object_2:
          type: rectangle
          color: yellow
          size: 3x3
          top_left: [8,10]
      output_objects:
        - object_1:
            type: rectangle
            color: gray
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [3, 3]
        - object_2:
          type: rectangle
          color: yellow
          size: 3x3
          top_left: [8,10]          
      transformation: Copy all detected 3x3 uniform non white regions, preserving their original position.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
       - object_1:
          type: rectangle
          color: green
          size: 3x3
          top_left: [5,6]
      output_objects:
        - object_1:
          type: rectangle
          color: green
          size: 3x3
          top_left: [5,6]
      transformation: Copy the first detected 3x3 uniform green region to the output grid, maintaining its original position.
