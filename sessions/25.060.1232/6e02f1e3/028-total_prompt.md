**input:**
```

4 4 4
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8FC9D0>

**output:**
```

0 5 0
0 0 5

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. The top two rows are filled with the number 4 (yellow), and the bottom row is filled with the number 3 (green).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid. The diagonal from top-left to bottom-right is filled with the number 5 (gray), and all other cells are filled with the number 0 (white).
*	The size and shape of the grid is constant

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - row_1: [4, 4, 4]
      - row_2: [4, 4, 4]
      - row_3: [3, 3, 3]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - row_1: [5, 0, 0]
      - row_2: [0, 5, 0]
      - row_3: [0, 0, 5]
  - transformation:
      type: diagonal_fill
      from_value: any # the original values do not matter
      to_value: 5
      other_values: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3 in this case).
2.  **Diagonal Fill:** Iterate through the cells of the output grid. If a cell lies on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), fill it with the value 5 (gray).
3.  **Other Cells:** Fill all other cells (those not on the main diagonal) with the value 0 (white).

In simpler terms, the transformation replaces all values on the main diagonal with 5 and sets all other cells to 0, regardless of the input values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
