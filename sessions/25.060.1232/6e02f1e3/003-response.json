The output is also a 3x3 grid, but it contains the numbers 5 and 0, representing gray and white colors. The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the original colors with a new color (gray, 5) in a specific pattern, and the remainder are set to white (0). The specific pattern appears to be the diagonal from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
