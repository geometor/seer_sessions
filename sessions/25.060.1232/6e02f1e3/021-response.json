The input grid consists entirely of green pixels (represented by the number 3). The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but with the top row being gray (represented by the number 5) and the remaining two rows being white (represented by the number 0). The grid dimensions remain constant. The black borders are considered insignificant styling, and not a color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Preserve the dimensions.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule recolors the input grid based on the row index. The first row becomes gray, and all other rows become white. The core logic isolates the row index as the element of the grid to operate on.\n"
