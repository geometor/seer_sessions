**input:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423327A50>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE4233273D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid consists entirely of yellow pixels (represented by the number 4). The output grid has the top row replaced with gray pixels (represented by the number 5), and the rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (represented by 0). The grid dimensions remain constant (3x3).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_state:
      - [4, 4, 4]
      - [4, 4, 4]
      - [4, 4, 4]
    output_state:
      - [5, 5, 5]
      - [0, 0, 0]
      - [0, 0, 0]
    transformation:
      - change_color:
          row: 0
          old_color: 4
          new_color: 5
      - change_color:
          rows: [1, 2]
          old_color: 4
          new_color: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the top row:** Locate the first row (row index 0) of the input grid.
2.  **Change Top Row to Gray:** Change all pixels in the top row to gray (color 5).
3.  **Identify remaining rows** Locate the all rows after the first row.
4.  **Change other rows to White:** Change the color all pixels in these rows to white (color 0).

Essentially the whole grid is scanned and first row is replaced to color 5, and all others to color 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
