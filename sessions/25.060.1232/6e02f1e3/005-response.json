            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: modifying the main diagonal. However, the initial program assumed all off-diagonal elements should become white (0). The additional training examples reveal that this isn't universally true; off-diagonal elements are set to white. The problem description is accurate and the code works perfectly, so no change is needed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on where the initial program might have needed adjustment and an updated analysis confirming it does not:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Diagonal elements correctly set to gray (5).\n    *   Off-Diagonal elements set to white(0).\n    * **Observation:** Initial logic is correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Output Shape: 5x5\n    *   Diagonal elements correctly set to gray (5).\n    *   Off-Diagonal elements set to white(0).\n     * **Observation:** Initial logic is correct.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 7x7\n    *   Output Shape: 7x7\n    *   Diagonal elements correctly set to gray (5).\n    *   Off-Diagonal elements set to white(0).\n    * **Observation:** Initial logic is correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Set main diagonal to gray, all other cells to white.\"\n  - objects:\n      - name: grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - rows: variable\n          - cols: variable\n          - main_diagonal: cells where row index equals column index\n  - actions:\n      - description: \"Iterate through each cell of the grid.\"\n      - condition: \"If the cell is on the main diagonal (row index equals column index).\"\n        result: \"Set cell value to 5 (gray).\"\n      - condition: \"If cell is not on main diagonal.\"\n        result: \"Set cell to 0 (white)\"\n  - outcome: input grid with main diagonal set to gray and the rest set to white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Main Diagonal:** Locate the cells forming the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the input grid. A cell is on the main diagonal if its row index is equal to its column index.\n2.  **Set Diagonal to Gray:** Change the value of all cells on the main diagonal to 5 (gray).\n3. **Set Off-Diagonal to White:** Chang the value of the cells *not* on the main diagonal to 0 (white).\n4.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.\n"
