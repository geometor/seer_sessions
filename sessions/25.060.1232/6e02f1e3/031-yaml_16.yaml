observations:
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: same dimensions as input_grid
      elements:
        - location: main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
          value: 5 (gray)
        - location: all other cells
          value: 0 (white)
    invariants:
      - The input grid's content does not affect the output.
      - The output grid's dimensions equal the input grid.
