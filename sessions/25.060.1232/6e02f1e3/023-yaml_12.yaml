observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      shape: 5x5 in all training examples
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      shape: same as input_grid (5x5)
  - action: transform_first_row
    description: The first row of the input grid is always transformed to gray (5) in the output grid.
  - action: transform_other_rows
    description: All rows other than the first row are transformed to white (0) in the output grid.
  - invariant: shape_preservation
    description: The shape of the grid remains constant during the transformation.
