The input grid appears to be larger (7x4) than the output grid (3x4). There's a noticeable reduction in the variety of colors used; the input has orange (7), white (0), blue (1), gray (5), whereas the output only has white (0) and green (3). The spatial arrangement of pixels also changes significantly.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The column index with all the '1's from input is used to create the output, and then, the '1's are changed to '3's in the output grid. All other values are '0's.\n\nEssentially, the transformation isolates a specific feature (the vertical blue stripe) in the input, represents it in a highly simplified form. All colors except blue are changed to white in output.\n"
