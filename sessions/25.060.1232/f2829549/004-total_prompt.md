Okay, here's a report on my perception of the task, including a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a more complex arrangement of colors, while the output grid seems to simplify this arrangement, focusing on a single color (green, represented by the number 3) and white (represented by 0). The dimensions of the grid also change, becoming smaller. There appears to be a relationship of extraction between the input and output. A specific feature is extracted and simplified.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [7, 0, 1, 5]  # Orange, White, Blue, Gray
      dimensions: 4x7
      cells:
        - [7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]
        - [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]
        - [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 5]
        - [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 3]  # White, Green
      dimensions: 4x3
      cells:
        - [0, 0, 3]
        - [0, 3, 3]
        - [0, 3, 0]
        - [0, 0, 3]

  - name: column_of_ones
    type: object
    properties:
      color: 1 #blue
      location: column 4

actions:
    - name: Extract
      description: identify and extract the column defined by the ones, plus the 2 columns to its right
      
    - name: Replace
      description: within the extracted region, replace all values that aren't all zeros with a 3

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: "extraction and replacement"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the column in the input grid that contains all 1s (blue).
2.  **Extract:** Extract this column, along with the two columns immediately to its right.
3. **Replace:** In the extracted sub-grid, replace all non-zero values with the number 3 (green). All zero cells remain as zero.
4.  **Output:** The resulting sub-grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
