There's a consistent vertical blue (1) stripe and varying arrangements of orange (7) and grey (5) pixels. The rest of the grid appears to be white (0).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids (3x3). They seem to contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels. The green pixels appear to be strategically placed, while the remaining cells are white.\n* **Relationship:**: The green pixels' placement in the output grid seems related to the position of non-white, non-blue and specifically orange pixels in the input grid, relative to the central blue (1) column.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"

It is always in column index 3.\n2.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** The output grid is always 3x3.\n3.  **Mapping Input to Output:** For each cell in the output grid (at row *r* and column *c*):\n    *   Examine rows r\\*2 and (r\\*2)+1 in the Input grid.\n    *   If there's an orange (7) pixel to the *left* of the blue stripe in either of those rows:\n        *   Set the output grid cell (*r*, *c*) to green (3).\n        * Where c = 0 or 1 (corresponding to the orange on left of the input grid's blue line being in the first or second column.\n    * if there is an orange (7) pixel to the *right* of the blue stripe and 4 colums to the right of blue, in rows (r\\*2) or (r\\*2+1):\n       *  Set the output grid cell (*r*, *c*) to green (3).\n        * where c=2\n    *   Otherwise, set the output grid cell (*r*, *c*) to white (0).\n\nIn summary, the output grid is a 3x3 representation indicating the presence of orange pixels in specific regions relative to the blue stripe in the input grid. Two rows of input map to a single row of output. The left two columns and the right most section beside the blue stripe define the green zones.\n"
