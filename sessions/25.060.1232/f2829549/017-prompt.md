Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts all pixels of value '1' (blue) that are in the fourth column.

The new grid has the same amount of rows as the input. It also has width of 3.

Replace the selected blue pixels in the input grid with green pixels (value `3`) in the output.
Maintain the row but set the new column based on this:

- If the blue pixel is located at an even-numbered row index (0-indexed), place the green pixel at column index 0 of the corresponding row in the output grid.
- If the blue pixel is located at an odd-numbered row index, place the green pixel at column index 2 of the corresponding row in the output grid.
- all other output cells are white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with the same number of rows as the input and 3 columns, filled with 0 (white).
    rows = input_grid.shape[0]
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid to find the blue pixels (value 1) in the fourth column (index 3).
    for i in range(rows):
        if input_grid[i, 3] == 1:
            # If a blue pixel is found, determine the output column based on row index parity.
            output_col = 0 if i % 2 == 0 else 2
            # Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (value 3).
            output_grid[i, output_col] = 3

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
