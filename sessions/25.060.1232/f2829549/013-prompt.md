Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify the Blue Selector:** Find the column in the input grid that contains only blue pixels (value 1).
2.  **Iterate Input Grid by Row:** For each row in the input:
    *   Locate the blue pixel (value 1) in the identified column.
    *   **Select Adjacent Pixel**: If there is a blue pixel in this row at that index, then select the pixel directly to the right of the blue pixel in the input grid.
        * If the input grid does not have any pixels to the right of the blue pixel, then select 0
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create an output grid that is n_row x 3.
4.  **Populate Grid** Insert the selected pixel in the middle of the row in the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
