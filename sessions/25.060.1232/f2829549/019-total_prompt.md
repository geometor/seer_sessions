Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies all blue pixels (value '1') in the input grid. For each blue pixel:

1. A corresponding green pixel (value '3') is created in the output grid.
2. The output grid always has 3 columns and the same number of rows as the input grid. All non-green pixels are white (0).
3. The row of the green pixel in the output grid matches the row of the blue pixel in the input grid.
4. The column of the green pixel is determined by the row index of the blue pixel:
   - If the row index is even, the green pixel is placed in column 0.
   - If the row index is odd, the green pixel is placed in column 2.

    # Initialize output grid with the same number of rows as the input and 3 columns, filled with 0 (white).
    rows = input_grid.shape[0]
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid to find all blue pixels (value 1).

                output_col = 0 if i % 2 == 0 else 2
                # Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (value 3).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
