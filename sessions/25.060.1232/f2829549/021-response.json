There's a prominent vertical blue (1) line. Other colors present include orange (7), gray (5), and white (0).\n*   **Output:** A 4x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It primarily contains white (0) pixels, with some green (3) pixels appearing in a pattern related to the orange (7) pixels in the input. The blue and grey colors are removed.\n* **Transformation**: Some form of extraction of certain areas, removing other areas, and recoloring a specific color\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
