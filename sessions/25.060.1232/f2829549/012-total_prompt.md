Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify Key Column: The program focuses on the fourth column (index 3) of the input grid, containing only the blue pixels.
2. Grid Reduction: Create output grid with dimensions based on number of unique values on either side.
3. Copy and Recolor: The column index with all the '1's from input is used to create the output, and then, the '1's are changed to '3's in the output grid. All other values are '0's.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Find the column with all '1's (blue)
    key_column_index = -1
    for j in range(cols):
        if np.all(input_grid[:, j] == 1):
            key_column_index = j
            break
            
    #count unique values to left and right
    left_unique_count = len(np.unique(input_grid[:, :key_column_index]))
    right_unique_count = len(np.unique(input_grid[:, key_column_index+1:]))


    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)
    
    if key_column_index != -1:
         # Create the output grid with reduced dimensions (e.g., same height, 3 columns).
        
        # Copy and recolor the key column to the new grid.
        output_grid[:, 1] = 3

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example, focusing on a column of all blue pixels (value 1) and creating a 3-column output grid, placing green (3) in the middle column. This approach works for the first example but fails to generalize to the other examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule is far more specific than initially thought and needs a more precise understanding of the geometry and object interaction. Specifically, the code fails to identify the pattern where a single blue pixel is used as an "extractor", pulling only the items that are adjacent to the blue in each row.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs to identify the *precise* conditions under which pixels are copied or modified. Don't overgeneralize. The blue pixel is an object that acts on adjacent objects.
2.  **Object-Oriented Approach:** Focus on identifying "objects" (contiguous regions of the same color) and their spatial relationships.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The refined natural language program should incorporate conditional statements (if-then) to handle different scenarios, especially regarding how the blue pixel acts as a selector for the adjacent item.

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where necessary):**

Let's analyze each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x6, Key column (all 1s) at index 3.
    *   Output: 6x3, Middle column is all 3s.
    *   *Result: Correct.* The initial code correctly handles this case.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, Key column (all 1s) at index 1.
    *   Output: 5x3, Middle column is all 3s.
    *   *Result: Incorrect.* The program needs to find the blue pixels and select the item on the right for each row.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 9x9, Key column (all 1s) at index 4.
    *   Output: 9x3, Middle column is all 3s.
    *   *Result: Incorrect.* Similar to example 2, a more precise rule involving blue pixel selection is required.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [6, 6]
        blue_column:
            exists: true
            index: 3
            pixel_value: 1

  output:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [6, 3]
        green_column:
          exists: true
          index: 1
          pixel_value: 3

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [5, 5]
        blue_pixels: [1,1,1,1,1] # column of 1s

  output:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [5, 3]
        selected_values: [2, 0, 3, 2, 0] #items to right of the blue pixel

example_3:
  input:
    objects:
    - type: grid
      dimensions: [9,9]
      blue_pixels: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] # column of 1s
        
  output:
      objects:
        - type: grid
          dimensions: [9, 3]
          selected_values: [2,0,0,4,0,2,0,4,5] #items to right of the blue pixel
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Blue Selector:** Find the column in the input grid that contains only blue pixels (value 1).
2. **Iterate Input Grid by Row:** For each row in the input:
    *   Locate the blue pixel (value 1) in the identified column.
    *   **Select Adjacent Pixel**: If there is a blue pixel in this row at that index, then select the pixel directly to the right of the blue pixel in the input grid.
        * If the input grid does not have any pixels to the right of the blue pixel, then select 0
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create an output grid that is n_row x 3.
4. **Populate Grid** Insert the selected pixel in the middle of the row in the output grid.

Essentially, the blue pixels act as "selectors," choosing the pixel immediately to their right in each row of the original grid. The output is a reconstruction showing only the selected values in a new grid that places the selections in the middle column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
