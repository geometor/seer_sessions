The input grid appears to have a more complex arrangement of colors, while the output grid seems to simplify this arrangement, focusing on a single color (green, represented by the number 3) and white (represented by 0). The dimensions of the grid also change, becoming smaller. There appears to be a relationship of extraction between the input and output. A specific feature is extracted and simplified.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
