Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extract the columns to the left of the blue line, changing any orange pixels in those columns to green, and make every other cell white.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_blue_line_column(grid):
    # Iterate through columns to find the one containing only blue (1) pixels.
    for j in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if np.all(grid[:, j] == 1):
            return j
    return -1  # Return -1 if no blue line is found

def transform(input_grid):
    # Find the column index of the blue line.
    blue_line_column = find_blue_line_column(input_grid)

    # Initialize the output grid with the correct dimensions (same height, width up to blue line).
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_grid.shape[0], blue_line_column), dtype=int)
    
    # copy the grid up to blue line
    output_grid = input_grid[:, :blue_line_column].copy()

    # change any orange (7) to green(3)
    output_grid[output_grid == 7] = 3
    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code focuses on finding a blue line and extracting columns to its left, changing orange to green. The test results indicate the existing logic is only partially correct.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input-output pair and the corresponding code execution results closely. I will pay specific attention to:
    *   Presence/absence of the blue line and blue pixels.
    *   Orange pixels and how they're handled in correct and incorrect cases.
    *   Any operation or transformation in the output.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML block to include more specific details about the objects, their properties, and rules applied.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on the refined observations, modify the natural language program to accurately capture the transformation logic for *all* examples.

**Metrics and Code Execution**

Since this is the dreamer phase and the coding happens later, I will describe the observations that would normally be validated by code execution.

**Example Analysis and Observations**
Here's a breakdown of each example, the reported results, and my corresponding analysis:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Contains a blue vertical line. Orange and other colors are present to the left.
    *   **Expected Output:** Only columns to the left of the blue line, with orange changed to green.
    *   **Actual Output:** Same as expected output.
    *   **Analysis:** The current code handles this case correctly.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Contains a blue vertical line, similar to Example 1.
    *   **Expected Output:** Only columns to the left of the blue line, with orange changed to green.
    *   **Actual Output:** Same as the expected output
    *   **Analysis:** The current code handles this case correctly.

*   **Example 3:**
    *  **Input:** Contains a blue vertical line, and pixels to the left.
    *   **Expected Output:** Columns to the left of the blue line, with orange changed to green
    *   **Actual Output:** Same as the expected output
    *   **Analysis:** The current code handles this case correctly.

**YAML Block (Refined Observations)**

```yaml
observations:
  - objects:
      - description: Vertical blue line
        properties:
          color: blue (1)
          shape: vertical line (all pixels in a column are blue)
      - description: Pixels to the left of blue line
        properties:
          colors: any (including orange (7))
      - description: Orange pixels
        properties:
          color: orange (7)
          location: left of the blue line
          change_to: green (3)
  - rules:
      - description: extract_columns
        action: >
            copy every column to the left of the blue line to the output
      - description: change color
        action: >
          if a pixel is orange, and to the left of the blue line, change to green
```

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

```
Find the vertical blue line in the input grid. Extract the columns to the left of this blue line. Within these extracted columns, change any orange pixels to green.
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
