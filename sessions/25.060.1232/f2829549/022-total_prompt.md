Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the perceived transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 4x7 grid of single-digit integers (colors). There's a prominent vertical blue (1) line. Other colors present include orange (7), gray (5), and white (0).
*   **Output:** A 4x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It primarily contains white (0) pixels, with some green (3) pixels appearing in a pattern related to the orange (7) pixels in the input. The blue and grey colors are removed.
* **Transformation**: Some form of extraction of certain areas, removing other areas, and recoloring a specific color

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: vertical_line
    type: line
    color: blue (1)
    position: column 4 (input_grid)
  - name: orange_pixels
    type: pixels
    color: orange (7)
    positions: various (input_grid)
  - name: green_pixels
     type: pixels
     color: green(3)
     positions: various (output_grid)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output_grid appears to be a cropped and recolored section of the input_grid.
  - type: correspondence
    description: The green (3) pixels in output_grid correspond to the locations of orange pixels to the left of the blue line in input_grid.

actions:
    - type: crop
      description: select columns from the original input to construct a smaller grid
    - type: recolor
      description: Change orange (7) to green (3) in selected regions.
    - type: remove
      description: remove blue(1) and grey(5) pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Column:** Locate the vertical blue (1) line in the input grid (column 4).
2.  **Define Extraction Area:** Consider only the columns to the *left* of the blue line (columns 1-3).
3.  **Recolor and Copy:**
    *   Copy the selected area (first three columns).
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels within this copied area to green (3).
    *   All other pixels become, or stay, white (0)
4.  The copied and recolored area becomes the output grid.

In simpler terms: Extract the columns to the left of the blue line, changing any orange pixels in those columns to green, and make every other cell white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
