"""
1.  **Identify the Anchor:** Find the column in the input grid that is entirely composed of blue pixels (value 1). This is our "anchor column."
2.  **Determine Extraction Range:** The output grid will always be 3 columns wide. The included columns are the one immediately to the left of the anchor column, the anchor column, and the one immediately to its right.
3. **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid containing only the three columns identified in step 2.
4.  **Change Colors:** Within this extracted subgrid, change all pixels that are *not* black (0) to green (3).
5.  **Return:** The modified 3-column subgrid is the output.
