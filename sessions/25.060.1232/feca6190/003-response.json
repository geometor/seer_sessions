The colors present are blue (1), white (0), and orange (7).\n*   **Output:** A 10x10 grid. The input grid's contents appear to be \"expanded\" or \"projected\" diagonally, creating a larger grid, with the diagonal running from the bottom-left to top-right. The original values seem to act as a \"seed\" for this diagonal expansion.\n* The output grid expands the original elements and all pixels have had zeros added to each side.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
