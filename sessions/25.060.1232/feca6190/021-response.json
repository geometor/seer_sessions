The output is a larger, square grid. The original input row appears to be replicated and shifted diagonally downwards within the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros (white pixels). The output grid is much larger, seemingly a square with a side length equal to the number of input elements times the number of input cells (1x5 input becomes 15x15). The replicated input starts in the lower left and appears to draw a diagonal up to the right.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The length of one side of the square is the number of elements in the input, (which is always one row) multiplied by the number of pixels in the input row. In this case it is 1*5 = 15\n\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an empty square grid (all zeros) of the size calculated from the input in the previous step. (here, a 15x15 grid).\n\n3.  **Replicate and Shift:**\n    *   Iterate from the bottom row to the top row of the output grid (row index `i` from 14 down to 0).\n    *   For each row `i`, place the input row into the output grid starting at column `14 - i`. This shifts the input row diagonally upwards and right with each step.\n    *   stop after placing input once into each row of the output.\n\nIn essence, the input row is copied and placed diagonally across the output grid, starting from the bottom-left corner and extending towards the top-right, with the remaining cells filled with zeros.\n"
