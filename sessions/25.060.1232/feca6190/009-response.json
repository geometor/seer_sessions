The input grid contains a single non-zero element (red, value 2) at the center, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid is an expansion of this, with the single red pixel from the input becoming a diagonal line of red pixels in the output, stretching from the bottom left to the top right. All other pixels in the output are white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The diagonal should go from the bottom left to the top right. The amount of red pixels will correspond to the initial input width, each input cell expanded to one output red pixel.\n4. **Result:** The result is a 5x5 grid with a diagonal line of red pixels from bottom-left to top-right, and all other pixels are white.\n\n"
