observations:
  - task: 045e1a33
  - objects:
    - description: Input is always a single row grid.
    - properties:
        - Each input example contains only one non-zero pixel,
          and always a single instance of it.
  - transformations:
    - description: The output grid is always square, and derived from the input grid.
    - properties:
      - The output grid's dimensions are determined by the position of the non-zero pixel
        in the input grid, counting from right to left. For instance, an input [0, 0, 1] generates
        output of 3x3.
      - The output grid contains a diagonal of the color of the non-zero pixel of the input grid.
        The number of instances in the output corresponds to the dimensions of the square.
      - The diagonal goes from the top right to the bottom left.
