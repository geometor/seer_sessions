"""
The input, a single row of pixels, is replicated and diagonally placed in a larger square output grid. The output grid's side length is determined by multiplying the number of elements in the input (always one row) by the length of the input row. The replicated rows are shifted diagonally upwards and to the right, and the remaining grid is filled with zeros.
