facts:
  - observation: The input is always a single row (1 x N).
  - observation: The output is always a square grid (15 x 15).
  - observation: The input row is placed on the anti-diagonal of the output grid.
  - observation: The anti-diagonal starts from the bottom-left corner.
  - observation: All other cells in the output grid are filled with black (0).
  - object: input_row
    properties:
      type: 1D array
      description: Represents the input pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      shape: (15, 15)
      description: The resulting grid after transformation.
  - action: place_anti_diagonal
    description: Places the input_row on the anti-diagonal of the output_grid.
  - constraint: output_grid_size is always 15x15
