**Perception of Elements**

The core transformation appears to involve expanding a 1xN input grid into an NxN output grid. The non-zero values in the input grid seem to be "projected" diagonally in both directions within the output grid.  Zero values in the input are treated as "background" and are not explicitly projected, but influence the size of the output. The output grid appears to be a square matrix. The dimension of the output matrix is defined by the length of the input array. The number of non zero values defines the length of the diagonal.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: input_grid
    description: 1-dimensional array of integers (0-9). Represents colors.
    properties:
      - size: 1xN (where N varies)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9

  - type: output_grid
    description: 2-dimensional array of integers (0-9). Represents colors.
    properties:
      - size: NxN (square matrix where N is equal to the number of elements on input array)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9

  - type: transformation
    description:  Expands the input grid into a square output grid, projecting non-zero values diagonally.
    operations:
      - input_size_determination: "The number of elements N in the input array, determines the dimensions (NxN) of the output grid."
      - diagonal_projection: "Each non-zero element in the input array creates a diagonal line of the same value in the output grid."
      - diagonal_direction: "The diagonals run from top-right to bottom-left and from top-left to bottom-right, intersecting at cells corresponding to the original position of the input element."
      - zero_handling: "Zero values in the input do not create diagonals; they define the size of the output square."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1. **Determine Output Size:** Measure the length (number of elements), N, of the input 1xN array. The output will be a square grid of size NxN.

2. **Iterate Input:** For each element in the input array, get its value and its index (position).

3. **Diagonal Projection (if non-zero):** If the element's value is not zero, perform the following:
   a. **Create two diagonals:** In the output grid, draw a diagonal line of the same color (value) as the current input element, starting from the top row, at the column corresponding to the input element's index. Extend this diagonal downwards and to the left.
   b. Simultaneously, create a second diagonal of the same color, starting at the same position in the input grid on the top row, but expanding it downwards and to the right.

4. **Zero Handling:** Zero values in the input array are skipped (no diagonal is drawn).  They serve to define the size of the output. They are the background.

5. **Complete Output:** The final output grid is the result of all diagonal projections, with zeros filling the remaining cells.

In essence, the non zero elements form a cross, and it's coordinates are determined by the index and the value of the input elements.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
