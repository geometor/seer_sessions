facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    shape: 1x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Single row grid with one non-zero element.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    shape: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Square grid, with a diagonal of non-zero elements.
  - object: non_zero_element
    type: integer
    value: 4 (in the example)
    description:  The element that is not zero in the input and is replicated in the output.
  - relationship: input_element_position_to_output_size
    description: The position of the non-zero element in the input (counting from right to left) determines the size of the output grid.
  - relationship: non_zero_element_replication
    description:  The non-zero element from the input is replicated diagonally from top-right to bottom-left in the output.
  - action: transform
    description: Convert the input grid into the output grid based on the position of the non-zero element.
