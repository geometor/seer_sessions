The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Output Grid Size: The output grid has the same dimensions as the number of columns of the input grid (NxN).
2.  First row: The first row of the output grid is the same as the input row.
3.  Subsequent Rows: Each subsequent row of the output grid takes the previous row and applies a circular shift to the right by one position.
