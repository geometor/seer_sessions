Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.  Treat each contiguous block as a separate object.
2.  **Direct Transformation:**  For *every* blue pixel in the input grid, change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).  Do not rely on bounding boxes; perform a direct color swap based on the presence of blue.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions and all zeros,
    # then copy the input grid to preserve non-blue pixels.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through all pixels in the input grid
    for row_index, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        for col_index, pixel_value in enumerate(row):
            # If a pixel is blue (1) in the input, change it to red (2) in the output
            if pixel_value == 1:
                output_grid[row_index, col_index] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
