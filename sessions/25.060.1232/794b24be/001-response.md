Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of pixels. The input grids contain pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grids contain pixels of two different colors: white (0) and red (2). The transformation seems to be related to the presence and position of blue pixels in the input.  The output grid dimensions are always the same as the input grid. The changes appear to be localized - blue pixels are somehow replaced by red.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 3x3 and contain white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Output grids are 3x3 and contain white (0) and red (2) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The position of the white pixels is always constant
  - rule: |
      Blue pixels in the input grid are replaced by red pixels.
  - rule: |
       If there are diagonal, adjacent or side by side connected blue pixels, they become a single object spanning the same place as the original blue pixel.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** blue pixels (value 1).
3.  **Replace** any blue pixel (1) with red pixel (2).
4.   If the next cell is blue in either horizontal or vertical direction, replace it as well.

In summary, the program replaces all blue pixels in the input grid with red pixels, maintaining the size, shape and relative positions and connectivity.
