1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
3.  If a pixel is blue (1), then:
    - If any blue pixel on the top row, that forms a contiguous group of 2 or more changes that whole group to red
    - change any single blue cell in the second or third row to white
    - change any other blue cell to red
4. Output will be created with changes to cells with corresponding coordinates.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified some key aspects of the transformation: handling white pixels, identifying blue pixels, and attempting to differentiate behavior based on row position. However, the logic for contiguous blue blocks and the conditions for changing blue pixels to red or white is not entirely accurate, especially in the cases in example 3, which is very simple. The approach of finding contiguous blocks is valid, but the conditions for changing colors based on block size and row needs to be clarified by looking at the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the differences, but first identify all the objects, their properties and actions.
2.  **Refine Contiguous Block Logic:** Determine the precise rule for how the size and position of contiguous blue blocks affect the transformation. It is important that the top row is considered different than other rows.
3.  **Simplify single cell transformations:** A single blue cell in the second and third rows must become white, while a single cell in any other row must become red.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language description to accurately reflect the refined transformation rules.
5.  **Update Code:** Based on updated Natural Language, provide new code.
6.  **Iterate:** Test the updated code and natural language program, and repeat the process if necessary.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution for demonstration - actual values will be determined during coding):**

```python
def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    """
    Analyzes the results of the transformation and returns relevant metrics.
    """
    correct = np.all(expected_output == actual_output)
    diff = expected_output != actual_output
    diff_count = np.sum(diff)
    

    metrics = {
        'correct': correct,
        'diff_count': diff_count,
        'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
        'output_shape': expected_output.shape,
      
    }
    
    if not correct:
        #where are the differences
        diff_coords = np.where(diff)
        
        
        metrics['diff_coords']=diff_coords
        metrics['input_vals_diff']= input_grid[diff_coords]
        metrics['expected_vals_diff']= expected_output[diff_coords]
        metrics['actual_vals_diff'] = actual_output[diff_coords]
    

    return metrics

    },
]

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: white_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    actions:
      - remain unchanged
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      location: row index
      contiguity: exists as single cell or contiguous block of 2 or more
    actions:
      - if: location is top row and part of contiguous block
        then: change to red
      - if: location is second or third row and is a single cell
        then: change to white
      - if: location is not the top row and part of contiguous block
        then: change to red
      - if: is a single cell in other row
        then: change to red
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **White Pixels:** If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
3.  **Blue Pixels - Top Row Contiguous Blocks:** If a pixel is blue (1) and is located in the top row (row index 0), and part of the block is 2 or more pixels, change the color of the entire block to red(2).
4.  **Blue Pixels - Single Pixel 2nd or 3rd Row:** If a blue pixel is in the second or third row (row index 1 or 2) and part of a contiguous block, change the color to white (0).
5.  **Blue Pixels - Contiguous Blocks not Top Row:** If a blue pixel is not in the top row and part of the block is 2 or more pixels, change the color of the entire block to red(2).
6.  **Blue Pixel - Single:** Change any other single blue cell to red (2)
7.  **Output:** The output grid is created by applying these transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
