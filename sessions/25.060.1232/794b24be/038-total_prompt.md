**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423327B50>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 0
0 0 0

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid in both the input and output. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains 0s (white) and 2s (red). The transformation seems to involve changing specific colors based on their presence and position in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: color_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color:
            input: [0, 1]  # white, blue
            output: [0, 2] # white, red
          position: (row, column)
actions:
  - type: change_color
    condition:
      - if input pixel is blue (1)
      - and input row is 0
    result: change to red (2)
  - type: keep_color
      - if input color is white
      - result: remain white

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current pixel's color is blue (1).
3. **Check** If the blue pixel is in the first row (row index 0).
4.  **If both conditions are true**, change the pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid.
5.  **Otherwise**, if the pixel is white (0), keep it as white (0) in the output grid.
6.  All the pixels not in the first row are changed to white/0

In simpler term, convert all blue pixels in first row of the input grid, to red pixels in the output grid, and set any other pixels to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
