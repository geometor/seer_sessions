Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  Identify Non-zero Pixels: Examine the input grid and find all pixels with a non-zero value (representing any color other than white).
2.  Output Grid Initialization: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with zeros (white).
3.  Place Red Pixel: Regardless of how many non-zero pixels there are in the input, or what color the non-zero pixel are, place a single red pixel (value 2) at the top-left corner (position [0, 0]) of the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with zeros, same size as input
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Place a red pixel (value 2) at the top-left corner (0,0)
    output_grid[0, 0] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
