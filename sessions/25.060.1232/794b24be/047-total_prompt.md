Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify the top row of the input grid.
2.  Change the color of all pixels in the top row to red.
3. All other pixels not in the top row should stay white.
4.  The output grid is the result of this transformation.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as all white (0) with the same dimensions as the input_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the columns of the top row (row 0)
    for j in range(cols):
        # Change the color of all pixels in the top row to red (2)
        output_grid[0, j] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
