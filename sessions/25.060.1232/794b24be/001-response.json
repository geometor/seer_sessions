The input grids contain pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grids contain pixels of two different colors: white (0) and red (2). The transformation seems to be related to the presence and position of blue pixels in the input.  The output grid dimensions are always the same as the input grid. The changes appear to be localized - blue pixels are somehow replaced by red.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If the next cell is blue in either horizontal or vertical direction, replace it as well.\n\nIn summary, the program replaces all blue pixels in the input grid with red pixels, maintaining the size, shape and relative positions and connectivity.\n"
