rules:
  - If a blue pixel exists in the input, a red rectangle replaces it in the output.
  - The red rectangle's top-left corner is at the same row and column as the top-leftmost blue pixel in the input. The red rectangle extends one pixel to the right.
  - If multiple blue pixels are in input, only use the topmost, then leftmost.
  - All other pixels that are not blue are unchanged.
