**input:**

1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B94F850>

**output:**
```

0 2 0
0 0 0

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains pixels of color blue (1) and white (0). The output grid contains pixels of color red (2) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve replacing blue pixels with red pixels and, in some cases, white pixels with red pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 1] # input grid
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue
      - color:
          values: [0, 2] # output grid
          mapping:
            0: white
            2: red

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    input_color: 1
    output_color: 2
  - type: replace_color
    input_color: 0
    output_color: 2

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grids maintain the same dimensions and pixel layout after the transformation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid containing pixels of values 0 (white) and 1 (blue).

2.  **Top Row Transformation:** Iterate through each pixel in the *top row* of the input grid.
    *   If a pixel in the top row is blue (1), change it to red (2).
    *   If a pixel in the top row is white(0), change it to red (2).

3. **Middle and Bottom Row Transformation**
      Iterate through each pixel in the *middle and bottom row* of the input grid.
    *   If a pixel in the middle or bottom row is white (0), it stays white.
    *   If a pixel in the middle or bottom row is blue(1), it becomes white (0)

In other words, all the top row become red, all other colors become white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
