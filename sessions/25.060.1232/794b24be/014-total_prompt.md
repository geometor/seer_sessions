<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8FC350>

**output:**

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid with cells containing either 0 (white) or 1 (blue).
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid with cells containing either 0 (white) or 2 (red).
*   **Transformation:** The blue (1) pixels in the input seem to be replaced with red (2) pixels in the output, with potentially some spatial relationship or rule determining their placement. All blue objects become red objects, and all other objects are white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    element_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
      position:
        row: [0-2]
        column: [0-2]
actions:
  - name: replace_color
    input: blue pixel (1)
    output: red pixel (2)
  - name: preserve_color
    input: white pixel(0)
    output: white pixel(0)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  Blue pixels in the input correspond to red pixels at a consistent offset or location in the output. Other cells are white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **If** a pixel's value is 1 (blue):
    *   Change the value to 2 (red) in a corresponding top,left biased location in the output grid.
3.  **Else If** the pixel's value is 0:
      *   Keep the value 0 in the same location.
4. The top left corner most blue is transformed to red.

Based on the single example, I have an assumption that there may be an offset from all blues become red. I can verify that with the next example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
