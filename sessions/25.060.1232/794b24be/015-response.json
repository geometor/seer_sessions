            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, focusing on a very particular pattern (top-left blue pixel and its immediate neighbors). It correctly handles white pixels, but only changes the color to red in a way that doesn't generalize. The test results clearly show this, as it only succeeded on the first example where this specific pattern existed, and fails on the others, including the test input. The core issue is an over-reliance on a single example and a lack of abstraction.  We need a more general rule that captures the *essence* of the transformation, without being tied to the specifics of one example.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  Carefully examine *all* training examples, not just the first one.\n2.  Identify common features/transformations across all examples.\n3.  Develop a natural language program that describes the general rule, and\n4.  Refine the logic with any edge cases we have.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics and Analysis**\nI will use previous information provided to develop a report.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input: 3x3 grid with a blue pixel at (0, 1) and white pixels elsewhere.\n*   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with red pixel at (0,0) and (0,1).\n*   Actual Output:  Matches expected.\n*   Metrics:\n    *   Input: Blue object of size 1.\n    *   Output: Red object of size 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input: 3x3 grid, all white pixels.\n*   Expected Output: 3x3 grid, all white pixels.\n*   Actual Output: Matches Expected.\n*   Metrics:\n    *   Input: No objects of interest.\n    *   Output: No objects of interest.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input: 4x4 grid with a blue pixel at (2, 2) and white pixels elsewhere.\n*   Expected Output: 4x4 grid with red pixels at (0,0) (0,1) and white pixels elsewhere.\n*   Actual Output: only (0,0) is red.\n*   Metrics:\n    *   Input: Blue object of size 1.\n    *    Output: Red Object of size 2\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid with blue pixels forming a 2x2 square at (0,3) and the other is white.\n*   Expected Output: 5x5 grid with red pixels at (0,0), (0,1) and white pixels elsewhere.\n*    Actual Output: only (0,0) is red.\n*   Metrics:\n    *    Input: Blue Object of size 4.\n    *   Output: Red object of size 2.\n\n**Test Input:**\n*    Input: 3x3 with blue pixel at (1,1) and white pixels elsewhere.\n*    Expected output: 3x3 with red pixels at (0,0) and (0,1)\n*   Actual Output: only (0,0) is red.\n*   Metrics:\n     *    Input: Blue Object of size 1\n     *   Output: Red Object of size 2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_set: \"training\"\n    objects:\n      - color: blue\n        role: input_marker\n        size:\n          min: 1\n          max: 4\n        notes:\n            - single pixel or block of pixels\n      - color: red\n        role: output_object\n        size: 2\n        position: always at (0, 0) and (0,1)\n        notes:\n            - covers the top-left two cells\n      - color: white\n        role: background\n        notes: remains unchanged\n\n  - example_set: \"test\"\n    objects:\n        - color: blue\n          role: input_marker\n          size: 1\n          notes: single pixel\n        - color: red\n          role: output_object\n          size: 2\n          position: should be at top-left corner (0,0) and (0,1)\n          notes: code failed to generate correctly, only produced (0,0)\n        - color: white\n            role: background\n            notes: remains unchanged\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Input Marker:** Locate the blue pixel(s) in the input grid. These can appear anywhere and be of variable size (single or 2x2 block in the examples). The presence of a blue pixel is a necessary trigger for the transformation. If no blue is present, no change occurs.\n\n2.  **Create Output Object:** Regardless of the position or size of the blue input, create a two-pixel red object.\n\n3.  **Position Output Object:** Place the red pixels in the top-leftmost two positions of the grid, at coordinates (0, 0) and (0, 1).\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:** All white pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThe most significant change from the initial program is removing the direct relationship between *where* the blue pixel is and *where* the red pixels are. The blue acts as a trigger, but its position and size do not influence the position of the red output, which is *always* in the top-left corner.\n"
