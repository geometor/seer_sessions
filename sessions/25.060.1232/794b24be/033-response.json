            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code correctly handled the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the logic: the initial program assumes *all* blue pixels in the first row should be changed to red, and all blue pixels in other rows become white. The additional examples demonstrate more complex behavior dependent on the _context_ of the blue pixels. It appears there are unstated rules.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will use `code_execution` to meticulously examine *each* input and output grid, along with the current code's output. This will involve checking pixel values at specific locations and identifying discrepancies. This process is a deep inspection of the input grid, the expected output, and the result of applying the current `transform` function.\n2.  **Identify Contextual Rules:** The key is to move beyond simple row-based rules. I need to look for spatial relationships, connectivity, or other patterns that might dictate when a blue pixel changes to red, white, or remains blue.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll reformulate the natural language program to accurately capture the observed transformations, including any contextual dependencies.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement**: It is possible that future test cases will reveal additional edge cases or rules.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nI will now use a series of calls to my `code_execution` tool to analyze each example.\n\n```tool_code\nprint(f'{task.train = }')\nfor i,example in enumerate(task.train):\n  input_grid = example[\"input\"]\n  expected_output_grid = example[\"output\"]\n  actual_output_grid = transform(np.array(input_grid))\n  print(f'{i = }')\n  print(f'{input_grid = }')\n  print(f'{expected_output_grid = }')\n  print(f'{actual_output_grid = }')\n  print(f'{np.array_equal(actual_output_grid,expected_output_grid) = }')\n\n```"
