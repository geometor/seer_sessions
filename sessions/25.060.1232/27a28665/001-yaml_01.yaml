objects:
  - input_grid: 3x3 grid
  - output_square: 1x1 grid
  - cells: individual elements within the grids, with integer values (0-9)
  - color_map: defines the color of a cell based on its value
properties:
  - cell_value: integer (0-9)
  - cell_color: derived from cell_value using COLOR_MAP
  - count: the output number (integer)
actions:
  - count_non_zero: count cells with a value not equal to zero.
  - count_specific_color: count the number of occurrences of a specific value in the input grid
relationships:
  - input_to_output: the input grid determines output digit and color
  - output value represents a count of the non-zero and non-white colored pixels.
