**input:**
```
4 4 0
4 0 4
0 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE4233081D0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE4233087D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The grid contains two colors: yellow (4) and white (0). The output is a single pixel of blue (1). The key seems to be related to counting or identifying a specific pattern of the colored pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [yellow, white]
      color_values: {yellow: 4, white: 0}
  - output:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 1x1
      colors: [blue]
      color_values: {blue: 1}
  - observation:
      description: "The input grid contains a pattern of yellow and white pixels."
  - transformation_hypothesis:
      description: "The output blue pixel might represent a count or a boolean result based on the arrangement of yellow pixels in the input"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Output Value Determination.** Check if there are any border pixels that are a different value than the center pixel. If there are, create the output grid as a 1x1 blue(1) grid, otherwise output a grid of the center pixel.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
