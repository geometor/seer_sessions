Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. The grid contains two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The azure pixels form a symmetrical pattern around the center.
*   **Output:** A single number, 2 (red).
* The output represents a count.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]

  - type: integer
    value: 2

relationships:
  - type: count
    description: The output integer represents a count of something in the input grid.

actions:
    - type: find object
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Objects**: Locate separate, contiguous blocks of the same color within the grid. Each block counts as an object.
2.  **Count**: Count the number of azure (8) colored objects.
3.  **Output**: output is 2.

Based on the above observations. the input grid has azure objects that can split into 2.
