**input:**
```
0 1 1
0 1 1
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B97BBD0>

**output:**
```
3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B97A350>
Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and develop a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid with cells containing either 0 (white) or 1 (blue).
*   **Output:** A single number, 3, presented within what appears to be a 1x1 green grid.
*   **Transformation:** The output seems to be a count of something related to input pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      type: pixel
      values: [0, 1] #0 is white, 1 is blue
  - name: output_value
    type: scalar
    value: 3
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
      type: pixel
      values: [3]

relationships:
  - type: count_of
    subject: output_value
    object: input_grid
    property: 'pixels with value 1'

actions:
 - type: count
   agent: system
   target: 'pixels where value ==1 in input'
   result: output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the Blue Pixels:** Iterate through all the pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check Color.** For each cell, see if the color of the pixel is '1' (blue).
3.  **Tally Blues** Count up the total number of blue pixels.
4.  **Output Result:** The final output is a scalar that represents the total count of blue pixels.

Essentially this program performs pixel counting, counts all the pixels that match the condition of the value being equal to 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
