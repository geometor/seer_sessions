Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the number of azure (8) pixels in the input grid and outputs the count as a 1x1 grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by counting all azure pixels.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 1x1 grid containing the count of azure pixels.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Count all azure pixels
    azure_count = np.count_nonzero(input_array == 8)

    # Create the 1x1 output grid with the count.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
