**input:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B94CC50>

**output:**
```
6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B94CE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The output is a single pixel of magenta (6). The task seems to involve counting or some other operation related to the gray pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)]
      - color: gray
        value: 5
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)]
  - type: pixel
    color: magenta
    value: 6

actions:
  - type: count
    target: gray pixels

relationships:
   - input_grid: contains 5 gray pixels
   - output_pixel: has value 6.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  The output is a 1x1 grid, where the color of the only pixel corresponds to that count + 1 (because the grey pixel count is 5 and output is 6).

Essentially, it is replacing the input grid by an 1x1 output grid containing the count + 1 of grey (5) pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
