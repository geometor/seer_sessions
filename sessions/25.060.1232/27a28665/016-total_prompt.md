**input:**
```
5 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B97B150>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B94F8D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors (likely 0 for white and 5 for gray). The output is a single numerical value (2), colored red. It appears the task involves counting something within the input grid. The output color might relate to the count result, and it may be pre-defined color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells:
        - value: 5 #gray
        - value: 0 #white
        - value: 5
        - value: 0
        - value: 5
        - value: 0
        - value: 5
        - value: 0
        - value: 5
  - type: scalar
    properties:
      value: 2
      color: red

actions:
  - type: count
    target: specific pattern in the grid

relationships:
  - input: grid
  - output: scalar (count)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of 2x2 squares within the 3x3 input grid where all the sub-grid cells have the same color value.
2.  The overall count from step 1 is the final output and is always a single digit.
3.  The output is displayed on a grid of color red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
