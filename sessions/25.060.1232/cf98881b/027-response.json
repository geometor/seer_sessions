The input grid is wider and contains more colors than the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified, smaller version of a section of the input grid. The primary color in both input and output is yellow (4). The output grid appears to retain spatial relationships from the input, but only of yellow and a few non-yellow pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
