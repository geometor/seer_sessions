Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting specific colored columns. However, the subsequent examples reveal a crucial flaw in the initial approach: the size of output is not always 4x4 and selection of columns depends on size of the matching column. The core concept of identifying columns by color is partially correct, but the logic for selecting *which* instance of a colored column and constructing output grid size is incomplete or incorrect.

The strategy to address the errors will involve:

1.  **Analyzing Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output for each example where the code failed. Pay close attention to the dimensions and the specific column indices that were incorrectly selected.
2.  **Refining Column Selection:** The rule for selecting the *first* or *second* instance of a colored column needs adjustment. It's likely dependent on factors not yet considered, potentially related to position or repetition patterns.
3.  **Dynamic Output Size:** The output grid size isn't fixed at 4x4. The code needs to determine the output dimensions dynamically based on the input. The current padding to match the first non-zero column length is a good start but may need refinements.
4.  **Iterative Improvement:** Modify the natural language program and code based on the analysis of each failed example, testing after each change to ensure progress.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To accurately gather metrics, I'll use a `get_metrics` function which consolidates error reporting. This will be crucial in debugging.

```python
def get_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    """
    Compares the expected and actual outputs, reporting discrepancies.

    Args:
        input_grid: The input grid.
        expected_output:  The expected output grid.
        actual_output: The actual output grid produced by the transform function.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing metrics about the comparison.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    actual_output = np.array(actual_output)

    metrics = {
        "input_shape": input_grid.shape,
        "expected_shape": expected_output.shape,
        "actual_shape": actual_output.shape,
        "match": np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output),
    }
    if not metrics["match"]:
        diff = expected_output - actual_output
        metrics["difference"] = diff.tolist()
    else:
        metrics["difference"] = None  # No difference if they match

    return metrics

def test_transform_on_examples(transform_func, examples):
    results = []
    for example in examples:
        input_grid = example["input"]
        expected_output = example["output"]
        actual_output = transform_func(input_grid)
        metrics = get_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output)
        results.append(metrics)
    return results
```

Now run against all the training examples.

```python
examples = [
    {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4]]},

for i, res in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      shape: variable, determined by the input data

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      shape: derived from the input, with height equal to the length of selected columns, and width equal to the number of colors (in this case, always 4 columns: Maroon, Yellow, White, Yellow)

  - name: target_colors
    type: list
    properties:
      values: [9, 4, 0, 4] # Maroon, Yellow, White, Yellow

actions:
  - name: find_column
    description: Locates columns containing a specific color.
    parameters:
      color: integer representing the target color
      grid: the grid to search within
    constraints: Selects based on the matching color and length of input grid.

  - name: construct_output
    description: Creates the output grid by combining the selected columns.
    parameters:
        columns: A list of selected columns
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The target colors are Maroon (9), Yellow (4), White (0), and Yellow (4), in that order.

2.  **Find Matching Columns:**
    *   Find a column in the input grid that contains the color Maroon (9).
    *   Find a column in the input grid that contains the color Yellow (4).
    *   Find a column in the input grid that contains the color White (0).
    *   Find another, distinct column that contains the color Yellow (4).

3.  **Determine Output Height:** The height of the output grid is determined by the shortest length of the *found* columns, where *found* means they contain the target color. If a color is not found the length of that column is not considered.

4. **Select Columns for Output:** Select subcolumns to build the output. If any target colors where not found in the input grid, then an empty column (all zeros) is used.

5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Combine the selected columns in the order Maroon, Yellow, White, Yellow, to form the output grid. The output grid will have 4 columns.
