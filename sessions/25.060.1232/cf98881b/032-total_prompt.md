"""
1. Identify 4x4 Subgrids: Examine the input grid and identify all possible 4x4 subgrids.
2. Filter by Color: From the identified 4x4 subgrids, select the subgrid composed entirely of either yellow, blue, or white pixels.
3. Prioritize finding a grid: If multiple such grids exist, it is not clear what rule to apply - the problem description implies there should be only one.
4. Output: The output is the selected 4x4 subgrid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and correctly identified the 4x4 subgrid composed of yellow, blue, and white pixels. However, it fails on subsequent examples because it doesn't account for:

1.  **Different Subgrid Sizes:** The target subgrid isn't always 4x4.
2.  **Color Combinations:** The target isn't always composed of yellow, blue, and white pixels.

The strategy for improvement is to:

1.  **Generalize Subgrid Size Detection:** Instead of hardcoding 4x4, we need to dynamically determine the size of the target subgrid.
2.  **Generalize Color Rule:** Identify the color rule dynamically.
3. **Prioritize finding only one subgrid:** Verify we are detecting a single valid subgrid.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

To understand the patterns, let's analyze each example pair. Since I do not have a code execution environment here I must rely on the problem description that includes the input and expected output.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 10x10 grid with a 4x4 subgrid of yellow, blue, and white.
    *   Output: The 4x4 subgrid.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 2:**
    *    Input: 13 x 11 grid with a shape outlined in blue.
    *    Output: 2 x 6 section.
    *    Result: fail - found four potential subgrids, not the 2 x 6 expected.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 15 x 15 with a 3x3 subgrid in upper left.
    *   Output: The 3x3 subgrid.
    *   Result: fail - found four potential subgrids, none of which were 3x3.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Find a subgrid within a larger grid."
  - example_1:
      subgrid_size: "4x4"
      subgrid_colors: [yellow, blue, white]
      subgrid_location: "Embedded within the larger grid."
  - example_2:
      subgrid_size: "2x6"
      subgrid_colors: [blue]
      subgrid_location: "outlined in blue"
  - example_3:
    subgrid_size: "3x3"
    subgrid_colors: [gray, green, blue, white]
    subgrid_location: "upper left"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Potential Subgrids:** Examine the input grid and identify all possible subgrids, of all possible sizes (from 1x1 up to the size of original grid, less one).
2.  **Determine Color Set:** Determine the allowable color from the set \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
3.  **Filter Matching Subgrids:** Filter subgrids based on which only contain the allowable colors, and return any that match.
4. **Prioritize Subgrid:** Assume only one will subgrid will match.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
