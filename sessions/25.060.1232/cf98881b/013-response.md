Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code focused on finding a yellow pixel as an anchor and extracting a 4x4 subgrid. This approach works for some cases but fails when the 4x4 subgrid exceeds the input grid's boundaries, or more importantly, it is revealed by example 2 that the sub-grid size is flexible. The current strategy is too rigid. We need to adapt the program to handle cases where:

1.  A yellow pixel may not exist.
2.  The size of extracted subgrid is dynamic, not fixed to 4x4. It should be determined by the input, not hardcoded.
3.  Boundary conditions when extracting the grid

The primary strategy is to iteratively refine the observations and hypothesis by examining each example, identifying the shortcomings of the current code, and updating the natural language program to encompass all observed behaviors. We need to determine the subgrid's dimension dynamically, not hardcoded it as 4x4.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each training example, the expected output, the actual output from the code, and the resulting assessment:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid with a yellow pixel at (1, 2).
    *   Expected Output: 4x4 subgrid starting at (1, 2).
    *   Actual Output: 4x4 subgrid starting at (1, 2).
    *   Assessment: Correct. The current code handles this case.

*   **Example 2:**
    *    Input: 8x7 grid with a yellow pixel at (6,1)
    *    Expected Output: 2x5 subgrid, as it is the largest subgrid including the
    *   yellow pixel.
    *    Actual Output: 0x0 empty grid because the selected top left yellow does not have the space for a 4x4 square below and to its right.
    *    Assessment: **Incorrect.** The current logic fails. The size and starting point are not correctly determined, because 4x4 is not appropriate, it does not specify the rule to generate the dimension.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with no yellow pixel
    *    Expected Output: An empty grid, shown as 0x0.
    *    Actual Output: 0x0 empty grid.
    *   Assessment: Correct. The current code's `find_top_leftmost_color` will correctly return None.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains: pixels
      - dimensions: variable, potentially smaller than input_grid or empty (0x0)
  - object: anchor_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: top-leftmost occurrence of yellow in input_grid
    actions:
        if anchor exist:
            - description: Extract a subgrid, starting at the anchor pixel.
            - dimensions: Not fixed. It is the largest possible subgrid starting at the anchor pixel.
        if anchor does not exist:
            - description: return an empty grid 0x0.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Anchor:** Search for the top-leftmost yellow (color value 4) pixel within the input grid. This pixel will be the anchor point. If no yellow pixel is found, return an empty (0x0) grid.

2.  **Determine Subgrid Dimensions:** If a yellow pixel is found, determine the largest possible rectangular subgrid that can be formed, where anchor is part of the subgrid.

3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract this subgrid from the input grid.

4. **Return the subgrid.**
