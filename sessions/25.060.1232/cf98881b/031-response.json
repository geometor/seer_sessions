            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and correctly identified the 4x4 subgrid composed of yellow, blue, and white pixels. However, it fails on subsequent examples because it doesn't account for:\n\n1.  **Different Subgrid Sizes:** The target subgrid isn't always 4x4.\n2.  **Color Combinations:** The target isn't always composed of yellow, blue, and white pixels.\n\nThe strategy for improvement is to:\n\n1.  **Generalize Subgrid Size Detection:** Instead of hardcoding 4x4, we need to dynamically determine the size of the target subgrid.\n2.  **Generalize Color Rule:** Identify the color rule dynamically.\n3. **Prioritize finding only one subgrid:** Verify we are detecting a single valid subgrid.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis:**\n\nTo understand the patterns, let's analyze each example pair. Since I do not have a code execution environment here I must rely on the problem description that includes the input and expected output.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 10x10 grid with a 4x4 subgrid of yellow, blue, and white.\n    *   Output: The 4x4 subgrid.\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *    Input: 13 x 11 grid with a shape outlined in blue.\n    *    Output: 2 x 6 section.\n    *    Result: fail - found four potential subgrids, not the 2 x 6 expected.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 15 x 15 with a 3x3 subgrid in upper left.\n    *   Output: The 3x3 subgrid.\n    *   Result: fail - found four potential subgrids, none of which were 3x3.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Find a subgrid within a larger grid.\"\n  - example_1:\n      subgrid_size: \"4x4\"\n      subgrid_colors: [yellow, blue, white]\n      subgrid_location: \"Embedded within the larger grid.\"\n  - example_2:\n      subgrid_size: \"2x6\"\n      subgrid_colors: [blue]\n      subgrid_location: \"outlined in blue\"\n  - example_3:\n    subgrid_size: \"3x3\"\n    subgrid_colors: [gray, green, blue, white]\n    subgrid_location: \"upper left\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Subgrids:** Examine the input grid and identify all possible subgrids, of all possible sizes (from 1x1 up to the size of original grid, less one).\n2.  **Determine Color Set:** Determine the allowable color from the set \\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n3.  **Filter Matching Subgrids:** Filter subgrids based on which only contain the allowable colors, and return any that match.\n4. **Prioritize Subgrid:** Assume only one will subgrid will match.\n\n"
