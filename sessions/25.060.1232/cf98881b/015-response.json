The input grid seems to have several distinct regions of color, including yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), blue (1), and white(0). The output grid appears to be a compressed or summarized version of the input, retaining only some of the original colors, mainly yellow and maroon, with single occurrences of white and blue. It is apparent that a specific region from input is selected.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
