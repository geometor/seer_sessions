The colors (represented by digits) in the output grid seem to be a selection of colors from the input grid, and the output grid appears to be a cropped and possibly filtered version of the input.  The transformation isn't a simple sub-region selection; some colors are entirely removed. The arrangement of the retained pixels may also have patterns or relationships within the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
