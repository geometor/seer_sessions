The most obvious change is a significant reduction in width. The height remains the same. Colors seem to be mostly preserved, but their positions change. It appears that columns are being selectively removed. The color '2' (red) and most of the '0'(white) and some '9'(maroon) appear to be removed consistently. It looks like all the columns with '2'(red) are removed. Let's examine the factual relationships.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
