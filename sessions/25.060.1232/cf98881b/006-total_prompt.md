Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation removes all instances of the color red (2) from the input grid and extracts a 4x4 subgrid.
The subgrid appears to be constructed by selecting specific columns from the input.
"""

import numpy as np

def get_column(grid, col_index):
    return [row[col_index] for row in grid]

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # 1. Identify Target Colors: Filter out red (2)
    filtered_grid = input_grid[input_grid != 2]
    
    # rebuild the input grid with the same dimensions, remove the filtered color
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    filtered_grid = filtered_grid.reshape(-1, cols)

    # Extract the specific set of columns that create a 4x4 grid
    output_grid = np.array([
        get_column(filtered_grid, 5),  # maroon
        get_column(filtered_grid, 1),  # yellow
        get_column(filtered_grid, 0),  # white
        get_column(filtered_grid, 1),  # yellow
    ]).T  # transpose, to align as columns, not rows

    # return the result
    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example only, and thus, it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Column Selection:** The initial code hardcoded the selection of columns 5, 1, 0, and 1. This selection is specific to the first example and doesn't hold for the others. We need a more general rule for column selection, or possibly a different approach altogether.
2.  **Filtering Logic:** Removing all instances of red (2) seems like an oversimplification and might be incorrect for some cases. The presence or absence of red may influence the transformation, but removing all instances as a first step seems to break down in cases where red is not present at all, or removing it is not an objective.
3. **Output size:** output grid is always 4x4

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** We need to carefully analyze *all* training examples, looking for common patterns in how the input relates to the output.
2.  **Dynamic Column/Row Selection:** Instead of hardcoding column indices, we should look for a rule that determines which parts of the input grid are selected based on properties of the input itself (e.g., position of specific colors, presence of shapes, etc.).
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Consider if the presence/absence of specific colors or shapes *conditionally* triggers certain transformations.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**

```python
def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output, example_id):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    predicted_output = np.array(predicted_output)

    input_dims = input_grid.shape
    output_dims = output_grid.shape
    predicted_dims = predicted_output.shape

    correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_output)

    print(f"Example {example_id}:")
    print(f"  Input Dimensions: {input_dims}")
    print(f"  Output Dimensions: {output_dims}")
    print(f"  Predicted Dimensions: {predicted_dims}")
    print(f"  Correct Prediction: {correct}")
    print(f"  Input: \n{input_grid}")
    print(f"  Output: \n{output_grid}")
    print(f"  Predicted: \n{predicted_output}")

# Assuming 'train' contains the training examples
for i, example in enumerate(train):
     predicted_output = transform(example['input'])
     code_execution(example['input'], example['output'], predicted_output, i + 1)

```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "All output grids are 4x4."
  - observation: "The output grid consistently contains the colors 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow), and 0 (white)."
  - observation: "The arrangement of colors in the output grid (9, 4, 0, 4) is consistent across all examples."
  - observation: "The input grids vary in size, but they always seem to contain columns that could form the output grid."
  - observation: "Example 1 had red (2) pixels that were removed and columns extracted."
  - observation: "Example 2 had a red (2) pixel, but the output was the same as if there was no red."
  - observation: "Example 3 has no red (2) pixels."
  - observation: "The columns selected to construct the 4x4 grid are consistently the same columns, regardless of the input grid's width or the presence of other colors."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts a 4x4 subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid is formed by selecting four specific columns from the input and arranging them in a fixed order.  The selected columns always correspond to the colors Maroon (9), Yellow (4), White (0), and Yellow (4) respectively, regardless of the size of the input or presence of other colors. The transformation identifies the *first* instance of columns matching these colors. If a color does not exist the transformation will select a column with all zeros (empty).

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Locate the first column containing the color maroon (9). Locate the first column containing the color yellow (4). Locate the first column containing the color white (0). Locate the *second* column containing yellow (4).
2.  **Construct Output:** Create a 4x4 grid by using the identified columns, in the specified order (maroon, yellow, white, yellow).

The critical insight is that the presence or position of red (2) is a distractor. The rule consistently selects the columns corresponding to specific values (9, 4, 0, 4) to construct the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
