Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger and contains more colors than the output grid. The output grid seems to be a compressed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining some of the original colors and shapes, but significantly reduced in size. The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), blue (1) and white (0).

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cell_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]
    actions:
      - compress
      - extract_subgrid

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains_all_colors_of: output_grid
  - output_grid: smaller_than: input_grid
  - output_grid: subregion_of: input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Subgrid:** Locate a subgrid within the input grid, using the following rules.
2.  **Subgrid extraction start:** Start the first row of the new grid at the first non-zero value on the far right of the first row of the input.
3. **Subgrid dimensions:** Use the column of the extracted value as the guide - extract a 4x4 block with this as the upper right corner of a new block.
4.  **Output the Subgrid:** The identified 4x4 subgrid becomes the output grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts a specific 4x4 subgrid from the input, defined by the right-most, top-most, non-zero cell.
