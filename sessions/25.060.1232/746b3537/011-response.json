The output is a 1x4 grid (1 row, 4 columns) of colored pixels. The colors in the output seem to correspond to some of the colors present in the input, but with a reduced number of pixels and a change in the arrangement/shape of the grid. The input grid has repeating rows, which might be important to the transformation. There are duplicated colors and unique colors in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For each column identify the unique color, ignoring duplicates if a column only containts one color it becomes the unique color.\n2.  **Construct Output Row:** Create a new row. For each column in the original grid, place the identified (or deduplicated) color in the output row, the output row should now have as many items as there are unique colors per column in the input..\n\nEssentially, the transformation collapses each column down to its unique color, and then combines these unique colors into a single output row.\n"
