Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 2D grid of colored pixels, where each color is represented by a single digit. The output appears to be a simplified, condensed representation of the input grid. Specifically, the output seems to extract the unique colors present in each *row-block* of the input, maintaining their vertical order. A "row-block" seems to be defined as a set of contiguous rows with identical values across all columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain single-digit integers representing colors
      - row-blocks: contiguous rows with identical color values across all columns

  - type: color
    properties:
      - representation: single-digit integer (0-9)
      - mapping: corresponds to a specific color (e.g., 4: yellow, 2: red, 8: azure, 3: green)

actions:
  - identify_row_blocks: locate contiguous rows with identical color values
  - extract_color: determine the single color value of a row-block
  - condense: reduce each row-block to a single representation of its color
  - order_vertically: preserve the original top-to-bottom order of row-blocks in the output

relationships:
  - row-block_contains_color: Each row-block is defined by a single, uniform color.
  - input_to_output: The output is a condensed, ordered representation of the input's row-blocks, showing only each block's color.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Row-Blocks:** Divide the input grid into "row-blocks". A row-block is a group of one or more consecutive rows where *all* the cells in each row have the *same* color value.

2. **Extract Representative Colors:** For each identified row-block, extract the single color value that represents all cells within that block.

3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new 1-dimensional grid (a single column).  Each element in this output grid corresponds to a row-block in the input grid, in their original vertical order (from top to bottom). The value of each element in output grid will be representative color of its corresponding row block.

4. The result will be a 1-dimensional grid listing a sequence of color values, where the sequence corresponds to the color of each row block in the input from top to bottom.
