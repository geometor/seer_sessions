**input:**
```

8 8
8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x256 at 0x7CE423308850>

**output:**
```

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x192 at 0x7CE423308BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels into a 1D grid (a single column) of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a consistent pattern: pairs of rows with identical colors and values. The output grid seems to extract a single representative value/color from each of these paired rows. The colors and their corresponding numerical values are maintained between the input and output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2x2 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 3x1 grid.
  - property: Input grid has paired rows of identical colors/values.
  - property: Row 1 and 2 are red (value 2).
  - property: Row 3 and 4 are magenta (value 6).
  - property: Row 5 and 6 are azure (value 8).
  - action: Extract a single value from each pair of identical rows.
  - relationship: Output grid contains one color/value from each unique paired row in the input.
  - relationship: Vertical order of colors is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Paired Rows:** Iterate through the input grid, examining rows in pairs (row 1 and 2, row 3 and 4, etc.).
2.  **Check for Identical Rows:** Within each pair, verify that the rows are identical in terms of color/value distribution.
3. **Extract Representative Value**: Select the first row (or all the values on the first row if multiple values exists per row) from each verified identical pair
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid consisting of a single column. Populate this column with the representative rows extracted in step 3, preserving the original vertical order.

In essence, the transformation collapses pairs of identical rows into single-row representations in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
