Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The input grids are always rectangular and composed of horizontal bands of uniform color and height. The output grids seem to represent a compressed version of the input, maintaining the color sequence vertically but reducing it to a single row, or removing repetitions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [integer values 0-9]
      - shape: [rows, columns]
      - bands: list of horizontal bands of the same color
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [integer values 0-9]
      - shape: [rows, columns]
      - extracted_colors: list of colors derived from input_grid
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid is a compressed representation of the input grid.
actions:
    - name: compress_rows
      agent: transformation
      description: Reduce horizontally stacked same-colored rows to one row with the same color.
    - name: remove_duplicate_adjacent
      agent: transformation
      description: removes horizontally stacked same colored rows, even with different widths.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Bands:** Examine the input grid. Recognize distinct horizontal bands, where each band consists of rows with all pixels having the same color.
2. **Extract Colors:** For the first example the sequence is vertically, from top to bottom extract the color to be displayed on one pixel.
3. **Reduce Duplicate Colors:** For examples 2, 3, the sequence is read from left to right and the sequence of the first row is outputted.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid.

In short, take the color sequence by row or by column, and eliminate the repetition of rows and colors, by keeping only one row of each distinct color.
