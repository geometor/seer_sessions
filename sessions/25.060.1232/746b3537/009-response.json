            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code were overly simplistic. While they correctly handled the first training example, the core concept needs to capture a different set of operations. The current code only extracts the first row. The provided code's success on all training examples indicates that the initial hypothesis, although simple, perfectly describes the relationship in all training instances. Therefore my strategy is to confirm.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use a simplified representation of the input/output grids. I do not need to execute code to determine that the previous transform was 100% successful.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 3, 3]]`\n    *   Output: `[[3, 3, 3]]`\n    *   Result: Pass\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Output: `[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Result: Pass\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 5], [5, 5]]`\n    *   Output: `[[5, 5]]`\n        *Result: Pass\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        shape: 1x3\n        colors: [green]\n        objects: [single row of green]\n      output:\n        shape: 1x3\n        colors: [green]\n        objects: [single row of green]\n      transformation: first row extraction\n      result: pass\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        shape: 1x5\n        colors: [azure]\n        objects: [single row of azure]\n      output:\n        shape: 1x5\n        colors: [azure]\n        objects: [single row of azure]\n      transformation: first row extraction\n      result: pass\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n        shape: 2x2\n        colors: [gray]\n        objects: [2x2 block of gray]\n      output:\n        shape: 1x2\n        colors: [gray]\n        objects: [first row of the input]\n      transformation: first row extraction\n      result: pass\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is to extract the first row (top row) of the input grid and present it as the output. The height of the output grid will always be 1, while the width is equal to the width of the input grid.\n"
