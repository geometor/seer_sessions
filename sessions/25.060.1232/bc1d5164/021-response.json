The primary colors involved are yellow (4) and white (0). The input grid appears to be larger than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, focusing on the yellow pixels and some of the white pixels. The spatial arrangement of the yellow pixels is maintained, but their relative distances are compressed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
