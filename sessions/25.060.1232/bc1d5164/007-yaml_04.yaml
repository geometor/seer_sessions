  Identify the smallest closed shape in the input grid and extract it.  A closed shape is defined as a contiguous region of non-black pixels where no pixel in the region has a neighbor of the same color in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

objects:
  - name: closed_shape
    properties:
      - color: non-black
      - smallest: true
      - enclosed: true # No adjacent pixels of the same color in cardinal directions
