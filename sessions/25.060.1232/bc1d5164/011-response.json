            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focused on selecting columns based on the presence of red pixels (color code 2). This approach worked for the first training example but failed on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule is not solely dependent on red pixels. We need to consider other colors and potentially the overall structure of the input grid to derive a more general rule. The strategy is to shift from a \"red-pixel-centric\" view to a more holistic view, analyzing spatial relationships and color patterns across all training examples. We should consider that \"first, middle, and last\" are important, but they might refer to different colors in different examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo gain more specific insights, I need to inspect each input/output pair and the generated output. I'll use code execution to do this and present the findings in a structured format. Since I can't directly execute code here, I will describe the *kind* of code I would execute and the expected results of that execution.\n\n**Example 1: (Already analyzed - baseline)**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains red pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** Correctly extracted a 3x3 subgrid based on the first, middle, and last red pixel columns.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matched the Expected Output.\n*    Observation: current code is correct\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 7 x 5, Contains Blue (1), Yellow(4), Red(2)\n*   **Expected Output:** 3 x 5. Contains columns with Blue (1), Yellow (4), Red (2).\n*    **Generated Output:** 3 x 5, Contains columns with Red Only\n\nCode to execute (conceptually):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Provided input and expected output grids for example 2\ninput_grid_2 = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 4, 0, 2],\n    [1, 0, 4, 0, 2],\n    [1, 0, 4, 0, 2],\n    [1, 0, 4, 0, 2],\n]\nexpected_output_2 = [\n    [1, 4, 2],\n    [1, 4, 2],\n    [1, 4, 2],\n    [1, 4, 2],\n    [1, 4, 2],\n]\n\n# run through transform\nactual_output_2 = transform(input_grid_2)\n\nprint(f\"Input:\\n{np.array(input_grid_2)}\")\nprint(f\"Expected Output:\\n{np.array(expected_output_2)}\")\nprint(f\"Actual Output:\\n{np.array(actual_output_2)}\")\n\n# Check if Actual Output == Expected Output\nprint(f\"Outputs Match: {np.array_equal(np.array(actual_output_2), np.array(expected_output_2))}\")\n\n# Observation\n# The relevant columns are the first, third and fifth. These\n# columns have the first occurences of Blue(1), Yellow(4), and\n# Red(2) respectively\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** 6 x 6, contains Gray(5), Orange(7), and Green(3)\n*   **Expected Output:** 3 x 6, Contains columns with Gray(5), Orange(7), and Green(3)\n*   **Generated Output:** 3 x 6, Contains nothing because there are no Red(2) columns\n\nCode to execute (conceptually):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n# Provided input and expected output grids for example 3\ninput_grid_3 = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 3],\n    [0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 3],\n    [0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n]\n\nexpected_output_3 = [\n    [5, 7, 0],\n    [5, 7, 0],\n    [5, 7, 3],\n    [5, 7, 3],\n    [5, 7, 3],\n    [5, 7, 0],\n]\n\n# run through transform\nactual_output_3 = transform(input_grid_3)\n\nprint(f\"Input:\\n{np.array(input_grid_3)}\")\nprint(f\"Expected Output:\\n{np.array(expected_output_3)}\")\nprint(f\"Actual Output:\\n{np.array(actual_output_3)}\")  # Likely incorrect\n\n# Check if Actual Output == Expected Output\nprint(f\"Outputs Match: {np.array_equal(np.array(actual_output_3), np.array(expected_output_3))}\")\n\n# Observation\n# The relevant columns are the second, fourth and sixth. These\n# columns have the first occurences of Gray(5), Orange(7), and\n# Green(3) respectively\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects: [grid_7x7]\n      input_colors: [red]\n      output_objects: [grid_3x3]\n      output_colors: [red]\n      rule: \"Select columns containing the first, middle, and last red pixels.\"\n      success: true\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects: [grid_7x5]\n      input_colors: [blue, yellow, red]\n      output_objects: [grid_3x5]\n      output_colors: [blue, yellow, red]\n      rule: \"Select columns containing the first occurrence of each unique color present in the colored rows.\"\n      success: false\n  - example_3:\n      input_objects: [grid_6x6]\n      input_colors: [gray, orange, green]\n      output_objects: [grid_6x3]\n      output_colors: [gray, orange, green]\n      rule: \"Select columns containing the first occurrence of each unique color present in the colored rows\"\n      success: false\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Unique Colors:** Examine the input grid and identify the unique colors present *other than black (0) or white(0)*.\n2.  **Find First Occurrences:** For each unique color, find the *column index* of its first occurrence within the grid.\n3. **Sort Column Indices**: Sort these column indices in ascending order.\n4.  **Extract Columns:** Create a new grid by extracting the columns from the input grid corresponding to the sorted column indices. Specifically, extract the columns at indices `[0]`, `[len(indices)//2]`, and `[-1]` of this sorted list. This corresponds to the first, middle, and last of the identified columns.\n5. **Transpose and Output:** Transpose the extracted grid section and output the result. (transpose is required due to how numpy handles column selection)\n\nThis revised program accounts for the selection of columns based on different colors and considers their order of appearance, not just the presence of red. The \"first, middle, and last\" concept is now applied to the ordered set of columns containing unique colors.\n"
