The primary colors observed are white (0) and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, focusing on specific areas containing the green color. The output grid appears to be a compressed or cropped version of the input grid, retaining only the columns and rows that contain the green (3) value.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
