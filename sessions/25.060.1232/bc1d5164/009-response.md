Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The input grid appears larger than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, and some selection or filtering of pixels based on their color and/or position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, white]
      dimensions: [5, 7]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, white]
      dimensions: [3, 3]
  - name: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: red
      value: 2
  - name: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: white
      value: 0

actions:
  - name: reduce_size
    description: The grid's dimensions are reduced.
  - name: select_pixels
    description: Specific pixels are selected to form the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red) in the input grid.

2.  **Consider a Sub-Grid:** Imagine a sliding 3x3 window moving across the input. The section of the input grid containing all red squares would be the area of focus.

3. **Construct Sub-grid:** In this case, the sub grid containing red pixels has a height of 3 and width of 5.

4.  **Extract Columns:** From this new grid, take the first, the middle, and the last columns to create the new grid.
