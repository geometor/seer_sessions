facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - divided into regions based on output_grid dimensions

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0 or 1, representing white or blue)
      dimensions: smaller than input_grid
    actions:
      - represents presence of red pixels in corresponding input regions

  - object: regions
    properties:
      type: sub-sections of the input_grid
      shape: determined by row and column ratios
    actions:
      - checked for presence of red pixels

  - object: red_pixels
    properties:
      color: red (value 2)
    actions:
      - trigger blue pixel in output_grid

  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      color: blue (value 1)
    actions:
      - indicate presence of red pixels in corresponding input region
