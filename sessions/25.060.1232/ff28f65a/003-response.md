Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 5x5 grid containing a 2x2 block of red (value 2) pixels in the top-left corner. The rest of the grid is white (value 0).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with a single blue (value 1) pixel in the top-left corner. The rest of the grid is white (value 0).
*   **Transformation:** It seems like the 2x2 red block is being represented by a single pixel of a different color (blue) and the overall grid size is being reduced. It is reducing the overall grid, but keeping the object in the upper left corner.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
        shape: 2x2 block
        location: top-left
      - value: 0
        color: white
        shape: fill
        location: rest
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
        shape: single pixel
        location: top-left
      - value: 0
        color: white
        shape: fill
        location: rest
actions:
  - type: represent
    input: 2x2 red block
    output: single blue pixel
  - type: reduce_size
    input: 5x5 grid
    output: 3x3 grid
relationships:
    - input_grid contains red_block
    - output_grid contains blue_pixel
    - blue pixel represents red block

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** a 2x2 block of red pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Represent** this 2x2 block with a single blue pixel.
3.  **Reduce** the overall grid size from 5x5 to 3x3.
4. **Place** the blue pixel in the top-left corner of the new, smaller, output grid.
5.  **Fill** the remaining cells of the output grid with white pixels (value 0).

In essence, the transformation seems to be summarizing or symbolizing the presence of the red square with a single blue pixel and reducing the canvas size.
