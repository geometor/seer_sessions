            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of dividing the input grid into nine regions and checking for 2x2 red squares within each region is a good starting point. However, the provided examples reveal nuances that the initial program doesn't fully capture. Specifically, the code detects whether a 2x2 red square *starts* within a section, which isn't sufficient. It needs to detect whether *any part* of a 2x2 red square exists within that section. The current implementation's region boundaries and square-checking logic are too strict, causing it to miss cases where a square overlaps multiple regions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Region Boundary Handling:** Instead of strict boundaries, we should consider overlapping regions. A 2x2 square can cross boundaries of the conceptually divided input.\n2.  **Improve Square Detection:** The logic must check if *any part* of a 2x2 red square intersects with a region.\n3.  **Leverage Code Execution:** We will use `code_execution` to inspect the `red_squares` found and the mapping to the output grid to confirm our logic and assumptions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nLet's meticulously examine each example. I'll create a detailed report to summarize these findings and inform the updated natural language program. I'll leverage the provided `find_squares` function for parts of the examination.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_squares(grid, size, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous blocks of a

**Process:**\n    *   Identify all 2x2 contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels in the input grid.\n    *   Conceptually divide the input grid into nine regions. The boundaries of these regions are determined by dividing the input grid's height and width by 3. These regions may overlap.\n    *   For each cell in the 3x3 output grid:\n        *   Determine the corresponding region in the input grid.\n        *   Check if *any part* of a 2x2 red square intersects with that region. It's sufficient for even a single pixel of the red square to fall within the region.\n        *   If *any part* of a 2x2 red square intersects with the region, set the corresponding output cell to blue (1).\n        *   Otherwise, set the output cell to white (0).\n\nThis revised natural language program addresses the identified issues. The key change is the emphasis on *any part* of the red square intersecting, rather than the square needing to start within the calculated boundary. This handles the cases where red squares span multiple regions.\n"
