The output is a 3x3 grid with blue (value 1) and white (value 0) pixels. The shapes formed by the red pixels in the input appear to be separate. The output seems to represent the presence or absence of those shapes in a simplified, smaller representation. The blue pixels in the output seem to correlate with where the *red* objects *were* in the *input*.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output reduces the information, acting as a coarse-grained \"presence map\" of red objects from the input.\n"
