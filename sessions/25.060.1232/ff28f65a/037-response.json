            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information, analysis of the results, and an updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were a good starting point, focusing on dividing the input grid into nine regions and checking for the presence of red (2) and orange (7) pixels. However, the logic for determining the output color needs refinement. The initial code considered regions containing red and non-orange as producing blue output, but the test results reveal a nuance related to only checking if non-orange and non-red are in the grid. We need to make it clear that the presence of red takes precedence.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine the provided input/output/predicted output triplets carefully to pinpoint the exact conditions where the prediction deviates from the expected output.\n2.  **Refine Logic:** Adjust the natural language program to clearly articulate the precedence rules for red and orange.\n3.  **Code Modification:** The supplied code already implements the key parts. We will use the refined logic to guide updates to the code.\n4. **Iterate:** We will use the results of processing the training examples, to find the errors and improve the results.\n\n**Example Metrics and Results:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll outline the expected behavior based on visual inspection, and we will confirm this with code execution in the next step. Here's a summary of what the metrics should reflect for each example based on manual assessment:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Analysis: The provided code correctly identifies the presence of red, resulting in a blue output where appropriate.\n    *   Result: `CORRECT`\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 15x15\n    *   Expected Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Analysis: Similar to example 1, red presence dictates blue output. The code handles this correctly.\n    *   Result: `CORRECT`\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 15x15\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3\n    *   Analysis: Regions containing only orange *should* result in white output (which is the default behavior). The existing logic should result in a correct answer.\n    *   Result: `CORRECT`\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)\n      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)\n      - meta_grid: 3x3 division of the input_grid into nine regions\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: 3x3\n      - cell_values: integers (determined by input_grid region analysis)\n\n  - object: region\n    type: subgrid\n    properties:\n        - parent: input_grid\n        - contains: set of pixels\n    actions:\n        - check_for_color: determines if specific colors are present in a region\n        - any_non_orange_non_red: determines if there are any colors other than orange or red\n  - color_precedence:\n    - rule1: \"If a region contains red, the output is blue, regardless of other colors.\"\n    - rule2: \"If a region contains no red, and only orange, the output is white\"\n    - rule3: \"The default output value is white\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into nine equal regions, forming a 3x3 meta-grid. The size of each region is determined by the dimensions of the input grid. If the dimensions are not perfectly divisible by 3, the bottom and right edges are used in the final regions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Regions:** For each region in the input grid:\n    *   Check if the region contains any red pixels (value 2).\n    *   If red is present, the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid is set to blue (value 1).\n    *   If no red is found, the region is checked to see if *any* pixels exist that are not orange. If not, it defaults to white (value 0)\n\n3.  **Output:** The result is a 3x3 output grid where each cell's value is determined by the rules applied to the corresponding region in the input grid.\n"
