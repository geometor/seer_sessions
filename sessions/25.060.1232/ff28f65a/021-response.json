The input grid contains two 2x2 squares of red (color 2) pixels, separated by a two-column gap of white (color 0) pixels. The output grid has two blue (color 1) pixels in the top corners, separated by a single, white (color 0) pixel. The rest of the output grid is white. It seems the input squares are \"detected\" or \"represented\" as single pixels on output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
