Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two distinct 2x2 squares of color 2 (red). The output grid seems to represent a compressed or abstracted version of the input, with 1's (blue) appearing where the red squares were and 0's (white) everywhere else. The transformation doesn't preserve the full detail of the input but seems to indicate the presence and general location of the red squares. It is essentially showing the top row (y=0) of where there were previously objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: square
    color: 2  # Red
    size: 2x2
    positions:
      - top_left: [1, 1]
      - top_left: [3, 3]
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
        input: 5x5
        output: 3x3
  - type: background
    color: 0 #white

actions:
  - type: detect_presence
    target: square
    description: Identify the presence of red squares.
  - type: reduce_dimension
    description: reduce size to just top row of objects

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains multiple red squares.
  - output_grid: Represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of red squares in a compressed format, with an apparent emphasis on the top row where there were red pixels in the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Examine** the input grid (5x5) for squares of color 2 (red).
2. **Note** the y=0 row indexes that contain color 2.
3. **Create** an output grid (3x3).
4. **Represent** the presence of the object in the first row using a single blue (1) pixel in the relative x position.
5. The dimension will always be reduced by the height-2.
6. The width is equal to the count of object +1.

In essence the presence of a red square, and the y=0 position are mapped in the output. All other locations are represented as 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
