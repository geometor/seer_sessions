Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid containing two distinct "objects" formed by the color red (value 2) against a background of white (value 0).  The output is a 3x3 grid with blue (value 1) and white (value 0) pixels. The shapes formed by the red pixels in the input appear to be separate. The output seems to represent the presence or absence of those shapes in a simplified, smaller representation. The blue pixels in the output seem to correlate with where the *red* objects *were* in the *input*.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static, fills the entire grid initially
  - id: object_1
    color: red (2)
    shape: irregular, appears to consist of two separate 2x2 squares
    property: potentially independently identifiable
  - id: object_2
      color: red (2)
      shape: irregular, appears to consist of one 2x2 squares
      property: potentially independently identifiable
  - id: indicator
    color: blue (1)
    property: indicates presence of red objects in corresponding input region
  - id: output_background
    color: white(0)
    property: fills the output space not occupied by blue indicators

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    from: object_1, object_2 (input)
    to: indicator (output)
    description: Locations of red objects in the input determine the locations of blue pixels in the output.
  - type: size_reduction
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid
      description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.

actions:
  - type: object_detection
    description: Identify and locate contiguous regions of red pixels.
  - type: region_mapping
    description: Map the regions of detected red objects to corresponding locations in a smaller output grid.
  - type: presence_indication
    description: Mark the mapped regions in the output grid with blue pixels, other areas are white
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Divide and Conquer:** Divide the input grid conceptually into nine approximately equal regions, in a 3x3 meta-grid.
2. **Object Presence Check:** For each of the nine regions in the input grid:
   - Check if the region contains any red (2) pixels.
3. **Output Generation:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
   - If a region in the input grid contained red pixels, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to blue (1).
   - Otherwise, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).

Essentially, the program detects whether any "red objects" are present within the bounds of a region of the input grid, and sets a corresponding pixel in the output to 'blue' to indicate presence. The output reduces the information, acting as a coarse-grained "presence map" of red objects from the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
