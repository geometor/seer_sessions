**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 2
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8C0DD0>

**output:**
```
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41A796F50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The output grid contains '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in color and a reduction in the number of colored pixels. Specifically, a 2x2 block of red pixels is replaced with a single blue pixel in the top-left corner.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - name: red_block
    type: object
    shape: rectangle
    dimensions: 2x2
    color: red
    location:
       start: [1,1] # row, col 0-indexed
       end: [2,2]
  - name: blue_pixel
      type: object
      shape: single cell
      color: blue
      location: [0,0]

actions:
  - type: replace
    agent: system
    target: red_block
    replacement: blue_pixel at [0,0]
  - type: clear other
    agent: system
    target: red pixels

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: red_block is located within the input_grid
  - type: transformation
    description: input_grid transforms to output_grid by replacing red_block with blue_pixel and changing all remaining red pixels to white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify a 2x2 block of red (value '2') pixels.** If such block exists, continue, otherwise output = input
2.  **Replace this block:** Create one blue (value '1') pixel located at row 0, column 0.
3. **Clear Remaining Red:** Set all remaining red to white (value '0').
4. **Result:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
