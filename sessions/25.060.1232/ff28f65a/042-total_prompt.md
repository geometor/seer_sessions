"""
The transformation rule involves simplifying a 7x7 input grid into a 3x3 output grid. The input grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output represents a simplified version of the input, where each cell in the 3x3 output indicates the presence (blue) or absence (white) of red pixels within a corresponding region of the 7x7 input.

    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Define the size of the regions in the input grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a 7x7 input grid and a 3x3 output grid. The core idea was to check for the presence of red pixels in specific regions of the input and represent their presence with a blue pixel in the output. This approach worked for the initial example, but the subsequent examples reveal that the input and output grid sizes, and therefore the regions, are not fixed.

The errors indicate a mismatch between predicted and expected outputs. This is because the code assumes fixed input/output dimensions (7x7 and 3x3) and fixed region sizes. The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Dynamically determine grid sizes:** The code needs to determine the input and output grid dimensions dynamically, rather than assuming they are 7x7 and 3x3.
2.  **Dynamically determine regions:** Based on the input and output grid sizes, calculate how the input grid should be divided into regions. The region sizes should be determined so that each "output" cell has a corresponding and proportional region within the "input".
3.  **Generalized Region Mapping:** The core logic (checking for non-zero, i.e., red/ink, pixels within a region and setting the corresponding output pixel to blue) remains valid. However, the regions need to be proportional to input.

**Metrics and Code Execution**

To understand the relationships between input and output grids, I'll use code execution to get their dimensions and calculate the ratios.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grids(task):
    results = []
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        input_shape = input_grid.shape
        output_shape = output_grid.shape
        row_ratio = input_shape[0] / output_shape[0]
        col_ratio = input_shape[1] / output_shape[1]
        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_shape,
            'output_shape': output_shape,
            'row_ratio': row_ratio,
            'col_ratio': col_ratio
        })
    return results

# Assuming the 'task' variable from ARC is available
# For demonstration, let's simulate a task with a couple examples
task = {
    'train': [
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]},
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0], [0, 1]]},
        {'input': [[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2,2,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]], 'output': [[0,0],[0,1]]}
    ]
}

grid_analysis = analyze_grids(task)
print(grid_analysis)
```

```output
[{'input_shape': (7, 7), 'output_shape': (3, 3), 'row_ratio': 2.3333333333333335, 'col_ratio': 2.3333333333333335}, {'input_shape': (5, 5), 'output_shape': (2, 2), 'row_ratio': 2.5, 'col_ratio': 2.5}, {'input_shape': (6, 6), 'output_shape': (2, 2), 'row_ratio': 3.0, 'col_ratio': 3.0}]
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      shape: variable
    actions:
      - divided into regions based on output_grid shape
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers, predominantly 0 (white) and 1 (blue)
      shape: variable, smaller than input_grid
    actions: []
  - object: regions
    properties:
      type: sub-arrays of input_grid
      shape: determined by the ratio of input_grid and output_grid dimensions
      content: contain pixels from input_grid
    actions:
      - presence of non-zero pixels determines corresponding output_grid pixel value
  - general:
      relationship: output_grid represents a simplified view of input_grid, indicating presence/absence of non-zero (red) ink
      ratio: input_grid dimensions are proportional to output_grid dimensions (approximately)
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Input and Output Dimensions:** Get the height and width of both the input and output grids.
2.  **Calculate Ratios:** Calculate the row ratio by dividing the input grid's height by the output grid's height. Calculate the column ratio by dividing the input grid's width by the output grid's width.
3.  **Iterate through Output Grid:** For each cell in the output grid (from top-left to bottom-right):
    *   **Determine Corresponding Input Region:** Calculate the starting and ending row and column indices for the corresponding region in the input grid. Use the ratios and current output cell indices. The row/column indices need to convert to an `int`.
    *   **Check for Ink:** Examine the pixels within the calculated input region. If *any* pixel in this region is not white (value is not 0), it signifies the presence of "ink".
    *   **Set Output Cell Value:** If ink is detected in the region, set the current output grid cell to blue (1). Otherwise, leave it as white (0).
4.  **Return Output Grid:** The output grid now represents the simplified presence/absence of ink from the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
