Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine our approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved finding a 2x2 red block and replacing it with a single blue pixel in a smaller 3x3 output grid. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the initial code *only* looks for 2x2 red blocks, and the output grid size and content is hardcoded. We need a more flexible approach that adapts to different input patterns and sizes. The strategy will involve these steps:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs, not just the first one.
2.  **Identify common elements/transformations:** Look for patterns that apply across multiple examples, rather than just the first.
3.  **Generalize the rule:** Develop a natural language program that describes the transformation in a way that's not specific to a single example.
4.  **Focus on object properties**: Identify properties that differentiate one
    object from another, for example, its shape or color, but also consider
    its size or edges.
5.  **Abstract to object actions**: define the overall rule in terms of the
    objects and how they are transformed and moved
6. **Revise code**: The code will likely need significant changes. The function to identify a red block needs generalization.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the patterns, let's use code execution to gather information about each example:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
    """Analyzes a grid and returns relevant properties."""
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    shapes = {}
    for color in unique_colors:
        coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
        min_row, min_col = np.min(coords, axis=0)
        max_row, max_col = np.max(coords, axis=0)
        width = max_col - min_col + 1
        height = max_row - min_row + 1
        shapes[color] = (width, height)
    return {
        "shape": grid.shape,
        "unique_colors": unique_colors.tolist(),
        "color_shapes": shapes
    }

def analyze_example(example):
    """Analyzes an input-output pair."""
    input_analysis = analyze_grid(np.array(example["input"]))
    output_analysis = analyze_grid(np.array(example["output"]))
    return {
        "input": input_analysis,
        "output": output_analysis,
    }

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the largest red rectangle:** Find the largest contiguous block of red pixels in the input grid. Consider "largest" to prioritize width, then height if widths are equal.
2.  **Represent with a blue pixel:** Replace the entire red rectangle with a single blue pixel.
3.  **Resize the grid:**
    *   Set the output grid height to 3.
    *   Set the output width based on its relationship to the identified red
        rectangle - in some cases it can be reduced to 3 and in others it
        needs to be adjusted to accommodate placing the blue pixel.
4. **Place Blue Pixel**: The blue pixel representing the red object will always
   be on the second row.
5. **Fill**: Fill the remaining grid cells with white pixels.
6. **Center Blue Pixel**: In two of the three training sets, the blue pixel is
   horizontally centered, however, this rule isn't consistent and needs
   additional review.

This revised program is more general and accounts for the variations observed in the training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
