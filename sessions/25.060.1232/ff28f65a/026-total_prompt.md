Previous Code:

The program identifies 2x2 red squares in the input grid and represents them as blue pixels in the output grid. The output grid has one row, and its width is three less than the input grid's width. For each 2x2 red square, a blue pixel is placed in the output grid at row 0, and at a column one greater than the column of the top-left pixel of the red square.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying 2x2 red squares and representing them as single blue pixels in a single-row output grid. The positioning of the blue pixel was based on the column of the top-left corner of the red square. The testing reveal that this approach is similar to the correct solution, and the output grid size is generally correct. The main issue is a detail related to the position that must be resolved.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input/output pair, focusing on how accurately predicted output matched expected output. For each of the input, output, and predicted output grids I will use code to create numpy arrays. This will enable me to compare ground truth and predictions quantitatively.
2.  **Refine Object and Action Descriptions:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will update the YAML block documenting facts to accurately reflect objects, properties, and actions. The most important changes, again, relate to the positioning criteria.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** I'll rewrite the natural language program to reflect the corrected transformation logic.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output and the code's predicted output:

```python
import numpy as np

def check_output(predicted_output, expected_output):
    if predicted_output.shape != expected_output.shape:
        print(f"  Shape mismatch: Predicted {predicted_output.shape}, Expected {expected_output.shape}")
        return False
    else:
        comparison = predicted_output == expected_output
        if not np.all(comparison):
          print("  Differences:")
          print(comparison)
          return False
        else:
          print("  Outputs match")
          return True

def describe_grid(grid):
  return f"{grid.shape} {grid.tolist()}"
```

**Example 0:**

```python
input_grid0 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])
expected_output0 = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]])

print(f"input: {describe_grid(input_grid0)}")
print(f"expected: {describe_grid(expected_output0)}")

predicted_output0 = transform(input_grid0)
print(f"predicted: {describe_grid(predicted_output0)}")

check_output(predicted_output0, expected_output0)
```

**Example 1:**

```python
input_grid1 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])
expected_output1 = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

print(f"input: {describe_grid(input_grid1)}")
print(f"expected: {describe_grid(expected_output1)}")

predicted_output1 = transform(input_grid1)
print(f"predicted: {describe_grid(predicted_output1)}")

check_output(predicted_output1, expected_output1)

```

**Example 2:**

```python
input_grid2 = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])
expected_output2 = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
print(f"input: {describe_grid(input_grid2)}")
print(f"expected: {describe_grid(expected_output2)}")

predicted_output2 = transform(input_grid2)
print(f"predicted: {describe_grid(predicted_output2)}")

check_output(predicted_output2, expected_output2)
```

**YAML Block (Facts)**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2]
      - shape: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1]
      - shape: (1, input_grid.width - 3)
  - name: red_square
    type: object
    properties:
      - shape: 2x2
      - color: 2 (red)
  - name: blue_pixel
    type: object
    properties:
      - shape: 1x1
      - color: 1 (blue)

actions:
  - name: find_squares
    input: input_grid
    output: list of red_square coordinates
    description: Locates all 2x2 red squares within the input grid.
  - name: create_output
    input: input_grid, red_square coordinates
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Creates a single-row output grid. For each 2x2 red square found,
      a blue pixel is placed in the output grid. The blue pixel's
      column position is the same as the column position of the
      top-left pixel of the 2x2 red square.
```

**Natural Language Program**

The program identifies all 2x2 red squares in the input grid. It then creates a single-row output grid whose width is three less than the input grid's width. For each 2x2 red square found in the input grid, a blue pixel (value 1) is placed in the output grid. The blue pixel is placed at row 0, and the column index of the blue pixel is equal to the column index of the top-left corner of the red square. All other pixels in the output grid are black (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
