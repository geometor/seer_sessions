Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input grids contain 2x2 blocks of red pixels (value 2) on a background of white pixels (value 0).
*   The output grids are always 3x3.
*   The output grids contain blue pixels (value 1) where the red 2x2 blocks were located in the input, and white pixels (value 0) everywhere else.
*   The output grid seems to represent a simplified, smaller "map" of the red blocks in the input grid. Each blue pixel in the output corresponds to the existence of at least one 2x2 red block at the general input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: [0, 2]
      colors: [white, red]
  - name: red_block
    type: object
    properties:
        shape: 2x2 square
        color: red
        value: 2
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: [0, 1]
      colors: [white, blue]
      size: 3x3

actions:
  - name: map_blocks
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Maps the presence of 2x2 red blocks in the input to blue pixels in the output.

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    from: red_block
    to: blue_pixel
    description: Each blue pixel represents a region in the original image where a 2x2 red block was present.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide** the input grid into non-overlapping regions, conceptually, based on a 3x3 output grid.
    *   For each of input, consider the input grid dimension, divide the height by 3 and width by 3. These are row\_block\_size and col\_block\_size, respectively.
    *   A block is then each set of cells within range 0..row\_block\_size and 0..col\_block\_size.

2.  **Iterate** through each of the nine regions corresponding to one output cell.
    *   If a region, contains any 2x2 red blocks, the corresponding output cell should be blue (1).

3. **Check** Within each such conceptual section of original array.
    *    Look for contiguous blocks of four '2' values forming a 2x2 square.

4.  **Output**: Create a 3x3 output grid.
    *   If such blocks were found at input section at output cell coordinate, place a blue pixel (1) at that output location;
    *   otherwise, place a white pixel (0).

In essence, the program detects the presence or absence of 2x2 red blocks within specific regions of the input grid and represents this with a blue pixel in a fixed-size 3x3 output grid.
