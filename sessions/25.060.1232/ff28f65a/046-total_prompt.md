Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains only 0 (white) and 2 (red) pixels. The output grid contains 0 (white) and 1 (blue) pixels. The output seems to represent a simplified, smaller version of the input, focusing on the presence and relative position of red (2) areas in the input, converting them to blue (1). The transformation appears to extract a specific pattern or feature related to the largest connected red object in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: train_8
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: [0, 2]
    description: Input grid with white and red pixels.
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1]
    description: Output grid with white and blue pixels.
  - id: red_object
    type: object
    color: red
    description: Connected component of red pixels in the input grid.
  - id: blue_object
    type: object
    color: blue
    description: Representation of red area as blue pixels in the output
actions:
  - name: extract_pattern
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts a 3x3 representation of the largest 2-colored object.
relationships:
  - type: simplification
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid is a simplified representation of the input grid.
  - type: color_change_and_presence
    from: red_object
    to: blue_object
    description: blue pixels represent the shape outline of red area of the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the largest connected red (2) object:** Find the largest contiguous block of red pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine the bounding box**: conceptualize the smallest possible rectangle around the largest connected red object
3.  **Translate and Scale**: conceptualize how to shrink the rectangle to a maximum size of 3x3, with each edge being 0 or 1 based on color:
    1.  if an edge contains only 0 (white), the output edge is all 0
    2.  if any part of the edge contains a 2, set the output edge to 1
4. **Create Output Grid**: build a 3x3 output, populate it with 0's (whites)
5. **Outline the conceptual shape**: Based on the shrunken rectangle edges, if an edge is present, set the color to 1 (blue) in the output.

In simpler terms, the program finds the most prominent red shape in the input, conceptually outlines a rectangle around that area, then creates a 3x3 grid where blue pixels indicate the outline of the red shape. White pixels indicate the absence of red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
