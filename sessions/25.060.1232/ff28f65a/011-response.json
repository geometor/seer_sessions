            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information, assess the results, and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed to detect 2x2 red squares and mark their top-left positions (adjusted for the output grid's size) with blue pixels. The provided results on the expanded training set reveal issues. Specifically the size reduction and location of the blue pixels are not general across all examples.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input-output pair. This involves identifying not just the red squares but also how other shapes and colors might play a role. I need to identify edge cases and ensure assumptions are explicit.\n2.  **Pattern Refinement:** Based on the analysis, refine the understanding of the core transformation logic.\n3.  **Code Structure:** consider how the code may need to be refactored to solve this problem, e.g., it may be necessary to introduce new functions or change how the grid is processed\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo accurately analyze each example, I'm going to perform a structured analysis and record this in the yml.\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 0\n    input_grid_shape: (7, 7)\n    output_grid_shape: (5, 5)\n    red_squares:\n      - (1, 1)\n      - (3, 3)\n    blue_pixels_output:\n      - (0, 0)\n      - (2, 0)\n    observations: |\n      The output grid is smaller than the input grid by 2 in both dimensions.\n      Each 2x2 red square in the input is represented by a single blue pixel\n      in the output. The blue pixel's x-coordinate corresponds to the\n      red square's top-left x-coordinate - 1. All of the blue squares are on row 0\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid_shape: (8, 9)\n    output_grid_shape: (6, 7)\n    red_squares:\n      - (3, 1)\n      - (3, 5)\n    blue_pixels_output:\n      - (2,0)\n      - (2,4)\n    observations: |\n       The output grid is smaller than the input grid by 2 in both dimensions.\n       Each 2x2 red square in the input is represented by a single blue pixel\n       in the output. The blue pixel's x-coordinate corresponds to the\n       red square's top-left x-coordinate - 1. The blue pixels are on row 0.\n       There is a 2x2 magenta box that does not affect the output.\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid_shape: (13, 16)\n    output_grid_shape: (11, 14)\n    red_squares:\n      - (3, 3)\n      - (6, 4)\n      - (9, 5)\n      - (5, 9)\n      - (8, 10)\n    blue_pixels_output:\n      - (2,2)\n      - (5, 3)\n      - (8, 4)\n      - (4, 8)\n      - (7,9)\n    observations: |\n       The output grid is smaller than the input grid by 2 in both dimensions.\n       Each 2x2 red square in the input is represented by a single blue pixel\n       in the output. The blue pixel's x-coordinate corresponds to the\n       red square's top-left x-coordinate - 1.  The blue pixels y-cordinate corresponds to the red square's top-left y-coordinate - 1.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Scan the Input:** Examine the input grid to identify all 2x2 squares of red (color 2) pixels.\n2.  **Record Positions:** For each red square found, record the x and y coordinates of its top-left pixel.\n3. **Create Output Grid:** create a new grid that is smaller that the input grid by 2 on each axis\n4.  **Mark Output:** in the output grid, place a blue pixel (color 1) in a location that is offset by -1 in both x and y from the input red square location.\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid should be white (color 0).\n"
