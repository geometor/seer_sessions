Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program finds 2x2 red squares in the input, and for each, creates a blue pixel on the first row output grid with an x position corresponding to original position / 2.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_squares(grid, size, color):
    squares = []
    for row in range(grid.shape[0] - size + 1):
        for col in range(grid.shape[1] - size + 1):
            subgrid = grid[row:row+size, col:col+size]
            if np.all(subgrid == color):
                squares.append((row, col))

    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find 2x2 red squares
    squares = find_squares(input_grid, 2, 2)

    # Represent each square as a blue pixel in the output
    for square in squares:
        row, col = square
        output_row = 0

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved finding 2x2 red squares and representing them with blue pixels in the output. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the output grid dimensions and the placement of the blue pixels don't always follow the `col // 2` logic. The output grid is not necessarily of a fixed size. Additionally it seems the placement is not just based on columns but also on columns and rows.

**Strategy**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Examine each input-output pair, focusing on:
    *   Presence and location of 2x2 red squares in the input.
    *   Dimensions of the output grid.
    *   Position(s) of blue pixels in the output grid.

2.  **Refine the Rule:** Look for consistent patterns:
    * Are output grid dimensions related to input.
    * Correct the placement strategy of blue pixels.

3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Describe the general rule that applies to *all* training examples.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To better understand how to derive a correct transformation rule, let's create some metrics.
The code below will generate those metric.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_squares(grid, size, color):
    squares = []
    for row in range(grid.shape[0] - size + 1):
        for col in range(grid.shape[1] - size + 1):
            subgrid = grid[row:row+size, col:col+size]
            if np.all(subgrid == color):
                squares.append((row, col))
    return squares

def get_blue_pixel_positions(grid):
    return np.array(np.where(grid == 1)).T.tolist()

def analyze_examples(task_data):
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

        red_squares = find_squares(input_grid, 2, 2)  # Find 2x2 red squares
        blue_pixels = get_blue_pixel_positions(output_grid) # Find blue pixels.

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
            'red_squares': red_squares,
            'blue_pixels': blue_pixels,
        })
    return results

task_data = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2]],
            "output": [[1, 0, 1]]
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]],
            "output": [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
        },
		{
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
        }
    ]
}

analysis_results = analyze_examples(task_data)

for i, result in enumerate(analysis_results):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input shape: {result['input_shape']}")
    print(f"  Output shape: {result['output_shape']}")
    print(f"  Red Squares: {result['red_squares']}")
    print(f"  Blue Pixels: {result['blue_pixels']}")
```

```
Example 1:
  Input shape: (6, 6)
  Output shape: (1, 3)
  Red Squares: [(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)]
  Blue Pixels: [[0, 0], [0, 2]]
Example 2:
  Input shape: (6, 9)
  Output shape: (1, 7)
  Red Squares: [(1, 1), (1, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6)]
  Blue Pixels: [[0, 1], [0, 5]]
Example 3:
  Input shape: (9, 11)
  Output shape: (1, 10)
  Red Squares: [(1, 1), (1, 8), (6, 1), (6, 8)]
  Blue Pixels: [[0, 1], [0, 8]]
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_size: [6, 6]
      output_grid_size: [1, 3]
      red_squares: [[1, 1], [1, 4], [4, 1], [4, 4]]
      blue_pixels_output: [[0, 0], [0, 2]]
      blue_pixel_count: 2
  - example_2:
      input_grid_size: [6, 9]
      output_grid_size: [1, 7]
      red_squares: [[1, 1], [1, 6], [4, 1], [4, 6]]
      blue_pixels_output: [[0, 1], [0, 5]]
      blue_pixel_count: 2
  - example_3:
      input_grid_size: [9, 11]
      output_grid_size: [1, 10]
      red_squares: [[1, 1], [1, 8], [6, 1], [6, 8]]
      blue_pixels_output: [[0, 1], [0, 8]]
      blue_pixel_count: 2
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Red Squares:** Identify all 2x2 squares of red (color 2) pixels within the input grid.

2. **Determine output rows and columns**: The output is always a single row.
The number of columns seems to be determined by input_grid_width - 3.

3.  **Place Blue Pixels:** For each 2x2 red square found:
    *   Calculate the column index of the red square's top-left pixel.

    *   In the output grid, place a blue pixel (color 1) at row 0.
    *  The column is determined by: `red_square_top_left_column + 1`

In summary the transformation identifies locations of 2x2 red squares in
the input image and translates them, by their x,y coordinates into a single
blue pixel in the first row of the output. The output width is equal to the
input width, minus three.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
