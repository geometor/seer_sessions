observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cell_values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - meta_grid: 3x3 division of the input_grid into nine regions

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (determined by input_grid region analysis)

  - object: region
    type: subgrid
    properties:
        - parent: input_grid
        - contains: set of pixels
    actions:
        - check_for_color: determines if specific colors are present in a region
        - any_non_orange_non_red: determines if there are any colors other than orange or red
  - color_precedence:
    - rule1: "If a region contains red, the output is blue, regardless of other colors."
    - rule2: "If a region contains no red, and only orange, the output is white"
    - rule3: "The default output value is white"
