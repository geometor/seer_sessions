examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: red
        shape: vertical line
        height: 3
      - color: green
        shape: vertical line
        height: 3
    transformation:
      type: column_creation
      output_width: number of distinct colors
      output_height: max object height

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: L-shape
        height: 3 # along vertical direction
        width: 2 # along horizontal direction
    transformation:
      type: object_reproduction
      notes: reproduces a similar object, but not the exact shape

    objects:
      - color: orange
        shape: square
        height: 3
