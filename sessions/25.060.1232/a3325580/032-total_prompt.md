Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid with colored pixels. The output is a 3x2 grid, also with colored pixels. The colors present in the input are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The output grid only contains red and green pixels. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the input seems to be related to their appearance in the output. Specifically it looks like there are two separate colored objects, and the output grid combines them into columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 2, 3]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements: pixels
    colors: [2, 3]
  - name: red_object
    type: object
    color: 2
    shape: irregular
    input_location: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)

  - name: green_object
    type: object
    color: 3
    shape: irregular
    input_location: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extract colored objects (non-white pixels) from the input grid.
  - type: arrangement
    description: Arrange extracted colored object into two columns, where each row contains one pixel of each.
  - type: repetition
    description: repeat colors vertically

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid's columns correspond to the extracted colors in the input

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify and Isolate Objects:** Find all non-white (color not 0) connected regions (objects) in the input grid. In this example, we find two objects: a red object and a green object.
2. **Extract Colors**: Record the distinct colors of those objects, here Red (2) and Green(3).
3. **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with dimensions based on number of objects. the height of each colored object determines height of the columns. The width will be the number of colors, in our case 2.
4. **Arrange Colors:** Put first color in first column, second color in the second column. Repeat colors vertically down their respective columns.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
