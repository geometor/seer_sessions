1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of the same color as distinct objects.
2.  **Locate color 2:** Find all objects with color 2 (red).
3. **Determine count:** Count the how many object of color 2 there are.
4.  **Create Output:** Create a new grid that is is `count` tall by 1 cell wide
5. **Fill output** Fill the grid with the color 2 (red).
