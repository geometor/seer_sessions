**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves identifying and extracting specific colored objects from a grid and representing them in a new, smaller grid. The output grid's dimensions and content are determined by the presence and arrangement of certain colors in the input grid. The background color (0/white) is consistently ignored. It appears only certain colors are selected for the output, while others are disregarded. The output grid consists of vertical columns of the selected colors.  The height of the output grid seems to be related to how many times an non-background object appears.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are 10x10."
  - observation: "Output grids are variable in height and width, but always rectangular."
  - observation: "Output grids contain only a subset of colors from the input."
  - observation: "The background color (0/white) is always absent in the output."
  - observation: "Colors in the output grid are arranged in vertical columns."
  - observation: "In each example, each non-black color appears in the input a number of times greater or equal to the number of output rows."
  - rule: "Select specific colors, excluding background"
  - rule: "Create rows equal to the height of each non-black object"
  - colors:
    - example1: [4, 6, 8] # Yellow, Magenta, Azure
    - example2: [9, 4] # Maroon, Yellow
    - example3: [2]    # Red
    - example4: [8]    # Azure
    - example5: [2,3]     # Red, green
    - example6: [1,4,8]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** For each input grid, determine the colors to be included in the output. These are all non-zero (non-white) colors. There can be multiple colors, one color or two colors.

2.  **Determine the number of rows:** Determine how often each target color appears in connected component in the input. Create this number of rows.

3.  **Construct Output:** Create an output grid. The width of the output will equal the number of colors identified for the output. The number of rows will be described in step 2. Fill each row with the target colors.

4. **Order of output:** List the colors selected in increasing order.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
