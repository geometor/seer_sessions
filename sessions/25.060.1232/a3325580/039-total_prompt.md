Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Objects: Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Each of these regions constitutes an "object."
2. Extract Colors: For each identified object, record its color (pixel value). The relative position of the color to each other in the grid does not appear to matter.
3. Create Output Grid: Create a new output grid. Iterate through the input grid, if the pixel is one of the colors, then keep it, otherwise discard the value (which removes all 0's)
4. Determine new output dimensions. Create a new grid of those dimensions.
5. Fill the output grid: Place the color values from left-to-right, top-to-bottom
6. The output grid only contains the unique non-zero color values from input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
