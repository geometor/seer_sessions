  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 1
          bounding_box: (3, 2) to (3, 2)
          shape: single pixel
        - color: 3
          bounding_box: (4, 2) to (5, 2)
          shape: vertical line
      output_objects:
        - color: 1
          bounding_box: (0, 0) to (2, 0)
          shape: vertical line
        - color: 3
          bounding_box: (0, 1) to (2, 1)
          shape: vertical line
      transformation: |
          Objects are transformed into vertical lines.
          The height of the output lines matches the maximum height of any input object.
          The width of each output line is 1. The color is preserved. The objects are arranged horizontally.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 8
          bounding_box: (2, 2) to (3, 4)
          shape: L-shape
      output_objects:
        - color: 8
          bounding_box: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
          shape: square
      transformation: |
        An L-shaped object is transformed into a filled square.
        The output square's dimensions match the bounding box of the input L-shape.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: 6
          bounding_box: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
          shape: square
      output_objects:
        - color: 6
          bounding_box: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
          shape: square
      transformation: |
          A square remains unchanged.
  - example_4:
    input_objects:
      - color: 1
        bounding_box: (3,7) to (3,7)
        shape: single pixel
      - color: 3
        bounding_box: (6,6) to (6,6)
        shape: single pixel
    output_objects:
      - color: 7
        bounding_box: (0,0) to (1,1)
        shape: square
    transformation: |
      Unable to determine a consistent transformation rule from the provided data. The input contains two single pixels and it is transformed to a 2 x 2 orange square
  - example_5:
    input_objects:
      - color: 5
        bounding_box: (1,2) to (2,4)
        shape: rectangle
      - color: 3
        bounding_box: (5,5) to (5,5)
        shape: single pixel
    output_objects:
      - color: 7
        bounding_box: (0,0) to (1,1)
        shape: square
    transformation: |
      Unable to determine a consistent transformation rule from the provided data.
      The input contains a rectangle and a single pixel and it is transformed to
      a 2 x 2 orange square.
