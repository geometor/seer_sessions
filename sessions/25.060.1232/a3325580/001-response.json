The output grid's dimensions and content are determined by the presence and arrangement of certain colors in the input grid. The background color (0/white) is consistently ignored. It appears only certain colors are selected for the output, while others are disregarded. The output grid consists of vertical columns of the selected colors.  The height of the output grid seems to be related to how many times an non-background object appears.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Create this number of rows.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create an output grid. The width of the output will equal the number of colors identified for the output. The number of rows will be described in step 2. Fill each row with the target colors.\n\n4. **Order of output:** List the colors selected in increasing order.\n"
