Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example. While the provided code attempts to capture some aspects of the transformation (identifying colors and using them as columns), it makes a significant, incorrect assumption about how rows are determined, using "matching colors" in rows which is not a consistent rule across all examples. The core idea of using unique colors for columns has merit, but the row logic needs a complete overhaul.  The strategy will be to discard the current `get_color_rows` function and focus on a simpler, more direct mapping between the input and output. The concept of "objects" isn't directly helpful given the actual transformation rule.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To understand the patterns better, I'll manually go through each input/output pair and create summaries. I'll then express these as facts.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, Colors: Blue (1), Red (2)
    *   Output: 2x2, Col 1: Blue, Blue; Col 2: Red, Red
    *   Observation: Output height = number of non-zero colors in the input. Output columns represent each unique color.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, Colors: Green (3), Yellow (4), Magenta (6)
    *   Output: 3x3, Col 1: Green, Green, Green; Col 2: Yellow, Yellow, Yellow; Col 3: Magenta, Magenta, Magenta.
    *   Observation: Consistent with Example 1. Output height = number of unique non-zero colors.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7, Colors: Orange (7), Azure (8), Maroon (9)
    *   Output: 3x3, Col 1: Orange, Orange, Orange; Col 2: Azure, Azure, Azure; Col 3: Maroon, Maroon, Maroon.
    *   Observation: Consistent with Examples 1 & 2.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 10x10, Colors: Red (2), Green (3)
    *   Output: 2x2, Col 1: Red, Red; Col 2: Green, Green.
    *   Observation: Consistent with previous examples.

*   **Example 5**:
    * Input: 1x3, Colors: Yellow(4)
    * Output: 1x1: Col1: Yellow

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width corresponds to the number of distinct non-zero colors present in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's height is equal to the number of distinct colors in the input.
  - observation: |
      Each column in the output grid represents a unique color from the input grid.
  - observation: |
      Each column is filled with the color it represents, repeated for the height of the output grid.
  - observation: |
    The input grid size is not relevant to the output grid size other than in the count of distinct colors
  - action: |
      The transformation identifies the unique non-zero colors in the input.
  - action: |
      The transformation creates an output grid where each column corresponds to a unique color.
  - action: |
      The transformation fills each column with its corresponding color, repeating the color down the column.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Unique Colors:** Find all unique, non-zero (non-black/background) colors in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's width and height will be equal to the number of unique colors identified in step 1.
3.  **Create Columns:** For each unique color, create a column in the output grid.
4.  **Fill Columns:** Fill each column with its corresponding color. The color should be repeated vertically to fill the entire column height.

This revised program is simpler and more accurately reflects the consistent pattern observed across all training examples. The previous focus on "color rows" is completely removed, and object detection is not needed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
