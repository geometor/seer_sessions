"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous regions (blocks) of the same color as distinct objects.
2.  **Count Objects:** Count the total number of distinct objects found in the input grid.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a height equal to the total number of objects and a width of 1.
4. **Get first object pixel**: Iterate each identified object and get the color of the first pixel in the object.
5.  **Fill Output Grid:** For each object, fill one cell in the output grid, starting from the top (row 0) and going down.  The value (color) of the cell should be the color of the first pixel of the object.
