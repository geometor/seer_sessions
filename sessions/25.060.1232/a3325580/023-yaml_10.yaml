task: object_counting_and_representation
domain: grid_world
objects:
  - definition: contiguous regions of the same color
    properties:
      color: integer value representing the color (0-9)
      size: number of pixels in the region
      shape: irregular, defined by contiguous pixels
actions:
  - identify: locate all objects in the input grid
  - count: determine the number of identified objects
  - represent: create a single-pixel representation of each object in a new grid
  - stack: arrange the single-pixel object representations vertically
transformation:
  input: 2D grid of integer color values
  output: 2D grid with height equal to the number of objects and width 1, where each cell represents an object and contains its original color.
