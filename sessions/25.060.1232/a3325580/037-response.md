Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains several distinct colored objects: a vertical line of blue (1) pixels, a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels, and an L-shaped object of yellow (4) pixels. The output grid seems to extract and consolidate these colored objects, removing the surrounding white (0) pixels and reducing the overall grid size. The colors in the output are maintained, and empty cells have disappeared.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    shape: vertical line
    initial_position: column 1, rows 2-4
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    shape: L-shape
    initial_position: column 3-4, rows 5-6
  - color: azure
    value: 8
    shape: horizontal line
    initial_position: column 7-9, row 3
  - color: white
    value: 0
    shape: background
    initial_position: all other cells

transformation:
  - type: object extraction
    description: Non-white objects are extracted.
  - type: size reduction
    description: The grid is reduced, removing all white space, to only the size of the bounding box.
  - type: object arrangement.
    description: The x,y coordinates of the colors are not considered

output:
  - grid_size: 3x3
  - object_colors: [blue, yellow, azure]
  - object_values: [1, 4, 8]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Each of these regions constitutes an "object."
2.  **Extract Colors:** For each identified object, record its color (pixel value). The relative postion of the color to each other in the grid does not appear to matter.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new output grid. Iterate through the input grid, if the pixel is one of the colors, then keep it, otherwise discard the value (which removes all 0's)
4.  Determine new output dimensions. Create a new grid of those dimensions.
5. Fill the output grid: Place the color values from left-to-right, top-to-bottom
6.  The output grid only contains the unique non-zero color values from input.
