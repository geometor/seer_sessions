Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain several colored regions, defined by contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, possibly capturing some key features or a simplified "sketch" of the input. There's a blue (1) line crossing the entire input that is not there on the output. There is also a one pixel wide border surrounding some inner objects made of different color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid, 9x9, containing colored regions.
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]  # white, blue, yellow, magenta, orange, azure
      - size: 9x9
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid, 4x4, representing a condensed version.
    properties:
      - colors: [4, 6, 7, 8]  # yellow, magenta, orange, azure
      - size: 4x4
  - type: region
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]
      - shape: variable (not necessarily rectangular)
  - type: border
    description: one pixel wide color frame surrounding other inner objects.

actions:
  - type: condensation/extraction
    description: Extracting specific color information or features from the input grid.
  - type: simplification
    description: Reducing the size and complexity of the grid.
  - type: border removal
    description: removing the inner vertical and horizontal lines of color '1'

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains multiple colored regions.
  - output_grid: Represents a simplified or abstracted version of the input grid.
  - colored_regions: Defined by color and adjacency in the input grid; some might be represented in the output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** In the input grid, identify distinct regions formed by contiguous pixels of the same color, excluding color 1 (blue) which forms the cross.
2.  **Extract Corner Colors:**
    - For the top-left quadrant, extract the most prominent colors ignoring the separating blue line and white (0). Preserve their relative positions.
    - Repeat the logic from step 2 for the other 3 quadrants.
3. **Remove single pixel blue line and zeros**: Remove blue line, and all zero values
4. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid. The colors of regions at the corners of input shape are now represented.

In essence, the transformation extracts the color arrangement of the 4 quadrants, defined by blue lines, and eliminates the inner lines and zeros that might be considered background or separators.
