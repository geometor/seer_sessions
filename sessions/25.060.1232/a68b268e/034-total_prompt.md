Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored pixels, with some apparent shapes and patterns. The output grid seems to be a condensed, abstracted, or summarized version of the input, retaining some key colors and possibly reflecting larger-scale structural features. There's a line of blue (1) pixels in the input and this does not feature in the output. The output seems focused on the corners of four regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    observations:
      - contains multiple distinct colored regions
      - presence of horizontal and vertical lines
      - orange (7), yellow(4), azure (8) and magenta (6) colors are prominent in distinct regions separated by the blue(1) line
      - a blue horizontal line of 1s separates two regions

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    observations:
      - colors seem to correlate with regions in the input_grid
      - size is significantly smaller than the input_grid

  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid, likely by summarizing or abstracting larger regions into single pixels.
    details:
      - The top-left corner of each of the four regions (orange, yellow, azure, magenta) in input is retained in the output.
      - The output consists of the top-left corner pixel of each of these regions and a horizontal line separating the two.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into four quadrants using the horizontal line of blue (1) pixels, and consider pixels up to the next zero value, to create four distinct colored regions:
    *   Top-Left: Primarily orange (7)
    *   Top-Right: Primarily Yellow (4)
    *    Bottom-Left: Primarily Azure (8)
    *   Bottom-Right: Primarily Magenta (6)

2.  **Extract Corner Pixels:** For each of the four regions identified, select the top-left pixel from the corner.

3.  **Construct Output:** Form the output grid by taking the top-left pixel from each of the four regions of the input.

This program describes how the corners of the colored blocks get retained.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
