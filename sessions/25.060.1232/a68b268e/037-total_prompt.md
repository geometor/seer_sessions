Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Separator:** Find the horizontal line of blue (1) pixels within the input grid. This line divides the grid into two regions: a "top region" and a "bottom region".

2.  **Identify Corners:**
     - Top Left Corner: Get the top-left pixel of the entire input grid.
     - Top Right Corner: Get the top-right pixel of the entire input grid.
     - Bottom Left Corner: Get the bottom-left pixel from the input grid.
     - Bottom Right Corner. Get the bottom-right pixel from the input grid.

3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid.
    - Fill rows 0, 1, and 2 with the top-left corner pixel in the first, second, and third columns and the top-right corner pixel in the last column.
    - Fill row 3 with:
        - Columns 0, 1 and 2: the top-left corner pixel
        - Column 3: The bottom-left corner pixel.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
