Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a grid of variable size.

2.  **Blue Row:** Identify the horizontal row where all pixels are blue (value 1).

3.  **Output Grid:** The output is a 4x4 grid.

4.  **First Row Construction:**
    *   Take the values of row 1 of the input grid and, starting from the right, copy 4 values to row 1 of the output grid.

5.  **Second Row Construction:**
    *   Take the values of row 2 of the input grid, and, starting from the right, copy 4 values to row 2 of the output grid.

6.  **Third Row Construction:**
    *   The third row of the output grid is always filled with orange (value 7).

7.  **Fourth Row Construction:**
    *    Take the values of the row below the blue row of the input grid, and, starting from the right, copy 4 values to row 4 of the output grid.

8. **Dimensions:** The output grid is always 4x4

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
