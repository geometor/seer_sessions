The input grid contains various colored pixels, with some apparent shapes and patterns. The output grid seems to be a condensed, abstracted, or summarized version of the input, retaining some key colors and possibly reflecting larger-scale structural features. There's a line of blue (1) pixels in the input and this does not feature in the output. The output seems focused on the corners of four regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
