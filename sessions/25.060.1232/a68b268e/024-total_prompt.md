Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This line serves as a reference point.
2.  **Observe the pattern:** Moving from left-to-right, and top-to-bottom, select the first occurance of colors in this order: orange, azure, yellow, magenta.
3. **Extract Selected Pixels**: Once this set of colors is found, record the next occurance in the order, repeating the sequence.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid. Arrange the extracted pixels into the 4x4 grid, row by row.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have several issues:

1.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection**: The code selects colors in the entire input grid, not with any restriction
2.  **Incorrect Output Dimensions**: The code attempts to force the result to a 4x4 or padded 2x2 output grid, which is not always correct. It should dynamically determine the output dimensions based on the input and extracted elements.
3.  **Incomplete Pattern Matching:** It doesn't correctly capture the full spatial relationships or sequences.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:

1.  **Refine Pixel Selection:** Focus on the precise, localized criteria and sequence for pixel selection.
2.  **Dynamic Output Dimension:** Calculate the correct output size.
3.  **Iterative Review:** Examine each training example closely to derive the correct transformation rule, generalizing across all examples.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To better understand the patterns, let's use a code block to get more precise metrics about each example.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_values = np.unique(grid)
    return {
        "shape": (rows, cols),
        "unique_values": unique_values.tolist(),
        "grid": grid.tolist()  # Include the full grid for inspection
    }

def analyze_examples(task):
    analysis = {}
    for i, example in enumerate(task["train"]):
        input_grid = np.array(example["input"])
        output_grid = np.array(example["output"])
        analysis[f"example_{i+1}"] = {
            "input": describe_grid(input_grid),
            "output": describe_grid(output_grid),
            "predicted_output": describe_grid(transform(input_grid))
        }
    return analysis

# Assuming 'task' variable is loaded with the current task data
task_analysis = analyze_examples(task)
print(task_analysis)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
