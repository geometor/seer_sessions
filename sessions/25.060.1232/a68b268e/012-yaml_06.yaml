- observation: Each input consists of 2 or 3 rectangular objects of different colors.
- observation: The output grid is always 4x4.
- observation: The output grid contains the colors from the input grid.
- observation: The output grid uses color '0' (white) as padding.
- observation: The output colors seem to match those of the input colors, with repetitions.
- observation: The input objects are large rectangular blocks of the same color.
- rule: |
    The colors present in the input grid appear in the output grid, with the
    remaining cells of the 4x4 output grid filled with 0 (white). If there
    are two colors in the input, each is repeated in the output, in the first
    column and in the 2nd and 4th columns.  If there are three input colors, the
    colors appear in the output in positions: [0,0], [3,0], and either [3,3] or
    [1,1].
