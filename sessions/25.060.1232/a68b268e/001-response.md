Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The inputs are grids of varying sizes, filled with single-digit integers representing colors. A prominent feature is a horizontal line of '1's (blue) dividing the input grid into upper and lower sections. The output grids are consistently 4x4.  Colors in the output seem to be derived from the input, but their positions are altered, and the blue dividing line is absent. It seems input colors above the line are extracted somehow, and re-arranged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - horizontal_line:
          value: 1
          description: separates grid into two regions

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - size: [4, 4]
      - colors: derived from input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract_colors
    description: Select specific colors from the input grid, potentially only above the horizontal line.
  - name: arrange_colors
    description: Place the extracted colors into a 4x4 grid, based upon some pattern or positional changes.

relationships:
  - input_grid colors relate to the output grid colors, though positions change.
  - colors above the horizontal line seem related to the output pixels
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Dividing Line:** Locate the horizontal line of '1's (blue pixels) within the input grid.
2. **Focus on the Upper Section:** Consider only the section of the input grid *above* the horizontal line.
3.  **Extract Non-Zero and Non-One:** identify the non-zero and non-one color values in the section of the grid defined in step 2.
4. **Arrange Colors:** arrange into a new 4x4 grid, where:
    * the first column contains the rightmost non-zero, non-one element of each row, moving top to bottom, stopping after 4 elements.
    * the second, third, and fourth columns contain the first three unique non-zero, non-one element of each column, moving left to right, stopping after 4 elements.

This natural language program offers a testable procedure.
