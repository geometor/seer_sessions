Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x9 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grid has a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels dividing it roughly in half. There are distinct colored regions above and below this line. The output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version of a specific area in the input. The output grid preserves some colors and relative positions of colored regions, but it is not a simple sub-grid extraction. The output consists of the four corner colors of the input, with a row of orange (7) at the bottom, and below it an azure (8) at the bottom left and white (0) bottom right.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a 9x9 grid into a 4x4 grid.  The transformation does not seem to involve simple sub-grid extraction. The output captures information of the four corner colors in the input image. The blue line seems to mark a key part of the transform.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]  # white, blue, yellow, magenta, orange, azure
      - has_horizontal_divider:
          color: 1  # blue
          row: 4

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0, 4, 7, 8] # white, yellow, orange, azure

  - name: regions
    type: areas
    properties:
        - definition: contiguous blocks of the same color

actions:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: "Creates a new 4x4 grid with upper left pixels coming from upper left, upper right from upper right, bottom left from under horizontal divider on left, bottom right from under horizontal divider on right."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Regions:** Locate the four corners of the input.
2.  **Extract corner colors:** Note colors of 4 corner pixels
3. **Construct first row, second row:** Fill in with 4 corner colors
4. **Construct third row:** Orange (7) all across the row
5. **Construct fourth row:** Azure(8), Orange(7), Yellow(4), White(0)

Essentially, the rule focuses specifically on the color of four corners and the area below the blue dividing line, extracting those values and reconstructing the pattern.
