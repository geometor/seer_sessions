The input grid appears to contain several colored regions, defined by contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, possibly capturing some key features or a simplified \"sketch\" of the input. There's a blue (1) line crossing the entire input that is not there on the output. There is also a one pixel wide border surrounding some inner objects made of different color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Preserve their relative positions.\n    - Repeat the logic from step 2 for the other 3 quadrants.\n3. **Remove single pixel blue line and zeros**: Remove blue line, and all zero values\n4. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid.
