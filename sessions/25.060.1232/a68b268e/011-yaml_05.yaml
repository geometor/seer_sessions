observations:
  - object: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - width: Variable
      - height: Variable
      - values: Integers from 0 to 9.

  - object: output_grid
    description: A 4x4 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - width: 4
      - height: 4
      - values: Integers from 0 to 9, derived from the input grid.

  - object: uniform_color_blocks
    description:  Rectangular regions within the input grid where all pixels have the same color.
    properties:
        - color: Integer from 0-9
        - top_left_corner: (row, col) coordinates
        - bottom_right_corner: (row, col) coordinates

  - action: extract_corners
    description: Identifies the top-left and bottom-right corners of the largest uniform color blocks.

  - action: construct_output
    description: Creates the 4x4 output grid.
    details:
      - step_1: Uses top-left corner of the top-left uniform block to fill the first column of the output grid.
      - step_2: Uses the top-left and bottom-right of the block at the bottom right to fill the second and fourth columns of the output, interlacing them.
      - step_3: Fill all empty cells of the ouput with 0.
