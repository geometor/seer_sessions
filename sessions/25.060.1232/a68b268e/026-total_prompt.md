"""
1.  **Identify the Central Line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This line serves as a reference point.
2.  **Observe the pattern:** Starting immediately *after* the blue line, find the *first* occurrences of the colors orange (7), azure (8), yellow (4), and magenta (6), *in that order*.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved finding a central blue line and extracting the first occurrences of specific colors (orange, azure, yellow, magenta) after that line, then arranging them in a 2x2 grid. This worked perfectly for the first example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the "central blue line" rule is not universally applicable. Some examples don't have a blue line, and the arrangement of the target colors and their relationship to any potential "reference" point varies.

The core concept of identifying specific colors and forming a 2x2 output grid seems valid across all examples. The primary challenge is generalizing the selection mechanism. Instead of relying on a central blue line, we need a more flexible approach that can adapt to different input configurations. The strategy should involve:

1.  **Re-evaluating the "Reference Point" Concept:** The blue line isn't a reliable reference. We need to determine if there are *any* consistent spatial or color-based relationships between the pixels that are ultimately selected for the output. This might involve considering relative positions, rows, columns, or other patterns.
2.  **Prioritizing Color Identification:** The selection of specific colors (7, 8, 4, 6) remains crucial. We should ensure this part of the logic is robust.
3.  **Adaptive Output Construction:** The 2x2 output grid formation is consistent, but we need to ensure the correct pixels are selected regardless of the input grid's structure.
4.  Investigate alternative selection criteria:
    - Selection based on first occurence of target color.
    - Selection based on last occurence of target color.
    - Selection based on a specific row or column index.
    - Selection based on diagonal position
    - Any consistent geometric or topological feature.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get accurate metrics, I'll use a hypothetical `code_execution` function. Since I cannot execute Python code here, I will outline the kind of analysis `code_execution` would perform and describe the expected results.

```
# Hypothetical code_execution calls and expected results

# Example 1: (Already Successful)
# No need for detailed analysis, as it passed.

# Example 2:
input_grid_2 = ...  # (The actual input grid data)
output_grid_2 = ... # (The actual output grid data)

# Hypothetical code_execution
predicted_output_2 = transform(input_grid_2)

print(f"Example 2 - Predicted Output:\n{predicted_output_2}")
print(f"Example 2 - Expected Output:\n{output_grid_2}")
print(f"Example 2 - Match: {np.array_equal(predicted_output_2, output_grid_2)}")

# Check for presence of a vertical blue line
blue_line_col_2 = find_central_blue_line(input_grid_2)
print(f"Example 2 - Blue Line Column: {blue_line_col_2}") # Expected: -1 (No blue line)

# Check selected pixels
selected_pixels_2 = extract_pixels(input_grid_2)
print(f"Example 2 - selected pixels: {selected_pixels_2}") # Expected: []

# Expected Output Metrics for Example 2:
# - Match: False
# - Blue Line Column: -1
#   This indicates that the "central blue line" logic failed, as expected.

# Example 3:
input_grid_3 = ...  # (The actual input grid data)
output_grid_3 = ... # (The actual output grid data)

#Hypohetical code_execution
predicted_output_3 = transform(input_grid_3)
print(f"Example 3 - Predicted Output:\n{predicted_output_3}")
print(f"Example 3 - Expected Output:\n{output_grid_3}")
print(f"Example 3 - Match: {np.array_equal(predicted_output_3, output_grid_3)}")

# Check for presence of a vertical blue line
blue_line_col_3 = find_central_blue_line(input_grid_3)
print(f"Example 3 - Blue Line Column: {blue_line_col_3}") # Expected: -1 (No blue line)

# Check selected pixels
selected_pixels_3 = extract_pixels(input_grid_3)
print(f"Example 3 - selected pixels: {selected_pixels_3}") # Expected: []

# Expected Output Metrics for Example 3:
# - Match: False
# - Blue Line Column: -1
# This further reinforces the failure of the blue line approach.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Find all pixels with colors orange (7), azure (8), yellow (4), and magenta (6) within the input grid.
2.  **Select Target Pixels**: The selection criteria is not the blue line. We must investigate a new selection mechanism based on the first or last occurrences of each target color within the entire input grid. *For now, let's hypothesize that the pixels selected are the FIRST occurrences of these colors when scanning the grid row by row, from left to right, and top to bottom.*
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill the 2x2 grid with the selected pixels, *row by row*. The order of selection (based on the row-by-row scan) determines the placement in the output grid.

This revised natural language program removes the dependency on the blue line and proposes a new, simpler selection criterion (first occurrence in a row-by-row scan) that needs to be tested.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
