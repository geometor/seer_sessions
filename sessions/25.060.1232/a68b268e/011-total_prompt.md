Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts specific 3x3 regions from the input grid and uses their corner colors to construct a 4x4 output grid. The output grid's first column corresponds to the colors in the first column of 3x3 blocks on the left side of the input. The top row corresponds to the colors in the top row of the top-right 3x3 block. The colors appearing on the corners are preserved, while others (like the central '1') are discarded.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
