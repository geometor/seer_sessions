The colors (represented by numbers) in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid, but not in a simple sub-sampling or averaging way. There are distinct objects of different colors present in the input, and elements of these objects are somehow selected/rearranged in the output. The output maintains some relative position information, but significantly reduced in scale and altered. It appears some colors \"survive\" and others are eliminated in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It does not follow that cells in the 4x4 are directly mapped to 2x2 subgrids of the input.\n3.  **Positional Clues:**\n    *   The magenta (6) block on the left of the input is represented on the left side of the output.\n    *   The maroon (9) block on the right side of input is partially represented, also mostly on the right side of output.\n    *   Yellow (4) and Gray (5) pixels maintain some of the relative input locations.\n4. **Selection Rule:** It's challenging to define an explicit selection rule, however the output forms contiguous blocks of colors 5, 9, 4, 6. And where these blocks meet, 0 may be used.\n\nIt is very difficult to define a comprehensive and accurate rule that guarantees the correct answer. This is a very complex transformation.\n"
