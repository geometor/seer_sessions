            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided task examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into a smaller output grid. The colors present are yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), maroon (9), and white (0). The output grids seem to be a condensed representation of the input grids, focusing on specific color arrangements. It appears that the transformation isn't a simple sub-sampling or direct mapping of regions. There's a re-arrangement of colors involved, indicating a more complex rule than mere compression. The consistent 4x4 size of the output grids is a notable feature. The white (0) pixels in the input seem to often, but not always, disappear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Treat white (0) pixels as background or separators.\n2. **Color Grouping and Arrangement** : Examine the four non-zero colored pixels in the top-left area, note colors. Repeat to get three more groups of four, moving to the right, and then start at the left, one row down.\n3. **Condense and Rearrange, Top Left Quadrant** : Create the top-left cell of the output grid using a color from among the first four colors in a consistent order.\n4. **Condense and Rearrange, Top Right Quadrant** Create the top-right cell of the output grid using the color that follows the first in the four colors, in a consistent order.\n5. **Condense and Rearrange, All** : Create the entire output grid using the patterns of colors and their consistent ordering.\n6. **Output Grid**: The final result is a 4x4 grid containing a condensed and rearranged representation of the key color features from the input grid.\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the color information, ignoring their precise coordinates, groups them, and reconstructs a 4x4 output with the essential non-background color information.\n"
