There appear to be distinct regions or \"objects\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color.\n*   **Output:** A 4x4 grid, also with colored pixels. The output seems to be a compressed or abstracted representation of the input, maintaining some, but not all, of the original colors and spatial relationships. It appears like a 2x2 block has been sampled and reduced to a single pixel, with no consistent choice of which input cell.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There will be a total of (8/2) * (8/2) = 16 such blocks.\n2.  **Reduce:** For each 2x2 block in the input, select the a single pixel, the selection is not consistent between cells.\n3.  **Construct:** Create a new 4x4 output grid. Each pixel's location will corespond to its equivalent 2x2 block. Place the selected pixels in the output grid accordingly.\n\nThe key here is recognizing the 2x2 block reduction. The challenge is the inconsistent selection.\n"
