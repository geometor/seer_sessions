The input grid contains several colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color). It appears that specific colored pixels from the input grid are selectively chosen and rearranged to form the output grid. The colors themselves seem to be preserved during the transformation, meaning a yellow pixel in the input remains yellow in the output, and so on. The relative positions, shapes, and size of colored blocks change, but some colors do take on a new position in an adjacent color block.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore the white (0) pixels.\n\n2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract the smallest subgrid using a spiral pattern, starting from the centroid, which contains those colored cells.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid. Fill in the identified colors while attempting to keep their input color, and respecting adjacency.\n\n4.  **Fill by Adjacency Order:**\n    -   Place one gray(5) in a top-left corner position.\n    -   Moving diagonally down, place a maroon(9).\n    -   Move up and to the right, place a gray(5).\n    -   Move down and left, and place a magenta(6).\n    -   Move left, place a gray(5).\n    -   Continue spiraling inward, filling in the most adjacent cells and colors present.\n    -   The yellow(4) is found on the bottom left.\n\n5.  **Complete Grid:** Continue extracting the cells spiraling out until a 4 x 4 grid is complete.\n\nIn short. Spiral inwards from a top-left diagonal to identify the output grid cells.\n"
