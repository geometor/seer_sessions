observations:
  - task: "Reduce 2x2 blocks to single pixels"
  - objects:
    - type: "2x2 blocks"
      properties:
        - "composed of 4 pixels"
        - "adjacent blocks do not overlap"
    - type: "pixels"
      properties:
        - "color: integer value 0-9"
  - actions:
    - description: "Select one pixel from each 2x2 block based on its color"
    - rules:
      - "If the 2x2 block contains value (3), select the pixel that has value (3). Prioritize (3) the most."
      - "If a block does not contain (3), then it must have value (1). Select pixel with color (1)."
      - "All the example blocks contained either (1) or (3)"
