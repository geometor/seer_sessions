The row and column indices of the output pixel are the row and column indices of the *top-left* pixel of the 2x2 window, each divided by 2 (integer division).\n    *   The color of the output pixel is the color of the *top-left* pixel of the 2x2 window in the input grid.\n5. **Complete Output:** The output is built up of pixels based on these 2x2 intersection checks.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef check_intersection_2x2(grid, r, c, colors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks for an intersection of at least 2 different colors within a 2x2 window.\n    \"\"\"\n    window_colors = set()\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            nr, nc = r + i, c + j\n            if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]:\n                window_colors.add(grid[nr, nc])\n    return len(window_colors.intersection(colors)) >= 2\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((input_grid.shape[0] // 2, input_grid.shape[1] // 2), dtype=int)\n    colors_of_interest = {0, 4, 5}\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid using a 2x2 window\n    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0] - 1):\n        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1] - 1):\n            # Check for intersection in the 2x2 window\n            if check_intersection_2x2(input_grid, r, c, colors_of_interest):\n                # Place pixel in output grid\n                output_grid[r // 2, c // 2] = input_grid[r, c]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
