Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of reducing 2x2 blocks in the input grid to single pixels in the output, with an inconsistent selection of which pixel to pick. While this general concept is correct, the "inconsistency" was initially interpreted and hard-coded as a specific, fixed pattern, made to solve the example. Running on other example pairs made this apparent. The code needs to select pixels from the 2x2 blocks based on a consistent rule.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Analyze Results**: Examine the provided input/output pairs, coupled with the actual results produced by the current code.  The key is to identify a *consistent* rule governing the pixel selection, rather than an *inconsistent* one.
2.  **Refine Hypothesis**: Based on the correct selection rule, develop the natural language program, and from that, the selection logic.
3.  **Focus on a General Rule:** I must ensure that I am not making assumptions in a selection process based on only a single example, which is what happened.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of the input/output pairs, using the given information:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 8x8, mostly black (0) with some blue (1).
    *   Expected Output: 4x4, derived by picking specific pixels from 2x2 input blocks.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 10x10, mostly black (0) with some blue (1) and green(3)
    *   Expected Output: 5x5, the specific pixel locations that matter are (row, col): (0,0),(0,2),(1,0)
    *   Actual Output: Does *not* match the expected. Mismatches are at these
        locations (row, col): (0, 2), (1, 0)

*    **Example 3:**
    *    Input: 12x12, mixed colors, mostly blue (1)
    *    Expected Output: 6x6 selection based on colors, all green(3) is selected
    *    Actual: Does *not* match expected.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: "Reduce 2x2 blocks to single pixels"
  - objects:
    - type: "2x2 blocks"
      properties:
        - "composed of 4 pixels"
        - "adjacent blocks do not overlap"
    - type: "pixels"
      properties:
        - "color: integer value 0-9"
  - actions:
    - description: "Select one pixel from each 2x2 block based on its color"
    - rules:
      - "If the 2x2 block contains value (3), select the pixel that has value (3). Prioritize (3) the most."
      - "If a block does not contain (3), then it must have value (1). Select pixel with color (1)."
      - "All the example blocks contained either (1) or (3)"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide**: Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.
2.  **Inspect**: For each 2x2 block, inspect the pixel values.
3.  **Prioritize**:
      If color green (3) exists in the block, the output is (3).
      If green (3) is *not* present, the output is always blue(1).
4.  **Construct**: Create the output grid, where each pixel corresponds to the selected color from its respective 2x2 block.

This program describes the transformation process much more accurately and generalizes across all three provided training examples. It moves away from an "inconsistent" selection to a rule-based selection based on color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
