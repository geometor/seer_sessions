Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on object perception, transformation logic, and a natural language program description.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids consistently show a structure resembling a vertical "U" shape composed of grey (5) pixels.  Within this "U", there's a horizontal rectangle of azure (8) pixels. The background is white (0). The output grids are consistently 3x3, containing a combination of azure (8) and white (0) pixels. The azure pixels from the input's rectangle seem to be the primary focus of the transformation. The positioning and number of the azure pixels change from input to output based on position and number, also the other objects are not present in the ouput.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static

  - object: U_shape
    color: grey (5)
    property: frame
    relation: contains rectangle

  - object: rectangle
    color: azure (8)
    property: dynamic
    relation: contained_by U_shape

  - action: extract
    target: rectangle
    
  - action: resize
    target: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    
  - action: position
    target: azure (8) pixels
    rule: based on relative position and quantity of pixels within input
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the background (white pixels), the "U" shape (grey pixels), and the azure rectangle within the "U".
2.  **Extract Rectangle:** Focus solely on the azure rectangle within the "U" shape. Disregard the "U" shape and background.
3. **Determine Output Configuration**
    * Create a blank, white output 3x3 grid
    * Place azure colored pixels from the left-most and working to the right, skipping a pixel if there are more than 3 azure colored pixels in a row of the extracted rectangle from the Input
        * If, in the Input, there are 1, 2, or 3 azure colored pixels in a row, fill in the first row of the output from left to right with the same number of azure colored pixels
        * If there are 4 or more azure colored pixels, alternate azure and white pixels in the first row of the output.
4.  **Output:** Present the resulting 3x3 grid.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the azure rectangle, then creates a 3x3 representation of the rectangle on the first line, alternating if necessary. All other input elements are discarded.
