The input grid contains pixels of colors gray (5), azure (8), and white (0). The output grid contains only azure (8) and white (0). The azure pixels in the input seem to form a solid rectangular block in the center, surrounded by a frame of gray, which itself is \"framed\" by white. The output appears to be a significantly reduced and simplified representation of the input. The crucial element appears to be azure object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
