Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved finding an azure block, extracting its bounding rectangle, and using the top-left pixel's color to populate the output. This approach works for some, but not all, of the training examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable. Some examples don't have azure, and the relationship between the input and output isn't always about the top-left pixel of an azure block. We need to generalize the rule. It appears the size of the output is *always* 3x3 and we *always* fill the top left of the output grid with a single value, derived from the input grid. The key seems to be identifying *which* single value.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** I'll use `code_execution` to examine each input/output pair, focusing on:
    *   Presence/absence of azure.
    *   The value at output_grid[0,0] in the *expected* output.
    *   The location(s) of that value in the input grid.
    *   Properties of those locations (e.g., are they part of a contiguous block, are they on an edge, etc.)

2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Based on the metrics, I'll look for a consistent rule that explains how the value placed at output_grid[0,0] is selected from the input grid, *regardless* of the presence of azure.

3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** I'll update the natural language program to reflect the generalized rule.

4.  **Update YAML facts**: record the new observations

**Code Execution for Metrics**

    """Analyzes the input and output grids to gather metrics."""
    results = {}

    # Check for azure
    results["has_azure"] = 8 in input_grid

    # Value at output_grid[0, 0]
    output_value = output_grid[0, 0]
    results["output_value"] = output_value

    # Find locations of output_value in input_grid
    input_locations = []
    for row in range(input_grid.shape[0]):

    # Analyze properties of the locations (This part will need refinement)
    # We can add more checks based on what might seem relevant

**Metrics and Observations**

```
Train Set Metrics:
Example 1:
{'has_azure': True, 'output_value': 8, 'input_locations': [(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)], 'location_properties': 'Multiple Locations'}
Example 2:
{'has_azure': True, 'output_value': 8, 'input_locations': [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)], 'location_properties': 'Multiple Locations'}
Example 3:
{'has_azure': False, 'output_value': 7, 'input_locations': [(5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)], 'location_properties': 'Multiple Locations'}
Example 4:
{'has_azure': False, 'output_value': 2, 'input_locations': [(3, 4)], 'location_properties': 'Single location'}
```

Key observations from the metrics:

*   The output's top-left value can be any color, not just azure (8).
*   The output value *always* exists somewhere in the input grid.
*  In all cases the value selected for the output grid's top-left corner, is located at `[row, 4]`

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The top-left cell of the output grid (output_grid[0, 0]) always contains a value that is present in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The value in the output_grid[0,0] is always the value found at input_grid[row, 4], where row can vary.
  - observation: |
     The color of the selected value can be any of the available colors.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Value:** Find the pixel value located at the 5th column (index 4) in the input grid. The specific row will change depending on where the non-zero pixel is, starting from top to bottom.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid filled with 0s.
3.  **Place value:** Place the value identified in step 1 into the top-left cell (position [0, 0]) of the output grid.
4. output the new grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
