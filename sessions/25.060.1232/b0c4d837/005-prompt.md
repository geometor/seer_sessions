Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that encloses all the identified azure pixels.
3.  **Extraction:** Extract the sub-grid defined as follows.
    *   The top row of the sub-grid should be the row that contains the azure pixels.
    *   The sub-grid should have 3 columns, starting from the first column containing azure.
4. **Output Construction:** The extracted sub-grid and resize/crop it to a 3x3, keeping only original pixels in the process.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
