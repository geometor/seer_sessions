"""
1.  **Locate Azure Rectangle:** Find the smallest rectangle containing all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract Top Row:** Take the top row of the azure rectangle.
3. **Take first 3:** take the first three values from this row.
4.  **Create Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
5.  **Populate Top Row:** Place the extracted values from step 3, into the top row of the output grid.
6.  **Fill Remaining Rows:** Fill the remaining rows (rows 1 and 2) of the output grid with black (0) pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and makes a significant assumption: that the transformation always involves extracting a 3-pixel segment from the top row of an azure rectangle and placing it in a 3x3 output grid. The results on the other training examples reveal this is incorrect and that the solution is more specific to the first training example. The core issue is that the code doesn't generalize well; it's overfit to the first example. We need to revise our understanding to encompass *all* training examples. It will be essential to analyze *all* aspects of *all* of the training examples, and pay special attention to the cases where the current code failed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each input/output pair, meticulously document:
    *   Presence and location of azure (8) pixels.
    *   Dimensions of the azure region (if any).
    *   Relationship between the azure region and the output.
    *   Output grid dimensions.
    *   Values in the output grid and their potential origin in the input.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, formulate a new, more general hypothesis about the transformation rule. It's likely that the azure rectangle isn't always the key, or that the extracted portion is not always 3 pixels wide or from the top row.
3.  **Natural Language Program Update:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the refined hypothesis.
4.  **Prepare for Code Update:** Make sure the facts and new program will provide a good, structured base for the next phase of the task.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution):**

Because we are in the "dreamer" phase, I cannot execute code, but will detail observations from the provided training examples:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x6 grid with a 3x1 azure rectangle at (0,3).
    *   Output: 3x3 grid with top row `[8, 8, 8]` and other rows `[0, 0, 0]`.
    *   Code Result: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid with a 1x2 azure rectangle at (4, 0)
    *   Output: 2x2 grid with first row: `[8, 8]` and second row: `[0, 0]`
    *   Code Result: **Incorrect**. Output is 3x3 and doesn't match expected output.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 11x11. No azure pixels.
    *   Output: 1 x 1 grid with a single `[0]`
    *   Code Result: **Incorrect**. Returns a 3x3 output.
*   **Example 4**
    *   Input: 14x14 grid with a single azure pixel at (5, 11)
    *   Output: 1x1 grid with a single \[8]
    *   Code Result: **Incorrect.** Returns a 3 x 3 output.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: 8  # Azure
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: [3, 1]
        top_left: [0, 3]
    output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]
    output_values:
      - row: 0
        values: [8, 8, 8]
      - row: 1
        values: [0, 0, 0]
      - row: 2
        values: [0, 0, 0]
    transformation: "Extract top row of azure rectangle, pad with zeros to 3x3."

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 8  # Azure
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: [1, 2]
        top_left: [4, 0]
    output_grid_dimensions: [2, 2]
    output_values:
      - row: 0
        values: [8, 8]
      - row: 1
        values: [0, 0]
    transformation: "Output is width and height of the azure object, top row is all 8s, other rows are all 0s"

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects: [] #no azure
    output_grid_dimensions: [1, 1]
    output_values:
      - row: 0
        values: [0]
    transformation: If no azure objects, return a single zero

  - example_id: 4
    input_objects:
      - color: 8 # Azure
        shape: point # single pixel
        dimensions: [1,1]
        top_left: [5, 11]
    output_grid_dimensions: [1, 1]
    output_values:
        - row: 0
          values: [8]
    transformation: if only one azure, then output is only the single azure
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Check for Azure Pixels:** Examine the input grid for the presence of azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Handle No Azure Case:** If there are no azure pixels, create a 1x1 output grid containing a single black (0) pixel.

3.  **Handle Single Azure Pixel Case:** If there is exactly one azure pixel, create a 1x1 output grid containing a single azure (8) pixel.

4.  **Handle Azure Rectangle Case (General):** If there is a contiguous region of azure pixels (forming a rectangle):
    *   Determine the *width* and *height* of this azure rectangle.
    *   Create an output grid with dimensions equal to the width and height of the azure rectangle.
    *   Fill the top row of the output grid with azure (8) pixels.
    *   Fill all the other rows of the output grid with black (0) pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
