            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code focused on identifying a contiguous azure region and extracting its bounding box. This works for the first training example, but it's likely too specific. We need to generalize the rule to accommodate other shapes and surrounding colors, and perhaps consider a different approach based on how consistent the \"enclosure\" concept is across the examples. We need to look very closely at the input and expected output grids for each example. The core issue might not be the code itself, but the initial assumption about the azure region being the sole focus. There might be other patterns, like a specific shape formed by the gray pixels, or a combination of colors we need to extract.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo understand the patterns, I'll use a combination of visual inspection and, where applicable, simple calculations to describe each input/output pair. I can use the code execution functionality to help compare properties like sizes of input, output, region sizes, etc.\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, including observations and metrics where I see a way to use the code execution tool:\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Input:** An upside-down \"U\" shape of gray pixels encloses an azure region.\n*   **Expected Output:** The azure region is extracted.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output. The code works as intended for this specific case.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x7\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *    Azure region size : 9\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Input:**  A gray \"arch\" encloses a region of orange and yellow, the arch sits on top of a single row of blue\n*   **Expected Output:** The orange and yellow area\n*   **Actual Output:** empty grid of size 0x0 - actual output did not find any azure\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Output Size: 2x5\n    *    Azure region size : 0\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*   **Input:**  Gray pixels forms a \"C\" shape which encloses red and green area.\n*   **Expected Output:** Red and green area\n*   **Actual Output:** empty grid of size 0x0- actual output did not find any azure\n*    Azure region size : 0\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        shape: upside-down \"U\"\n        enclosing_color: gray (5)\n        enclosed_color: azure (8)\n      output:\n        description: Extracted enclosed region\n        colors: [azure]\n  - example_2:\n    input:\n      shape: \"arch\"\n      enclosing_color: gray\n      enclosed_colors: [orange, yellow]\n    output:\n      description: Extracted enclosed region minus the blue line below it\n      colors: [orange, yellow]\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n          shape: \"C\"\n          enclosing_color: gray\n          enclosed_colors: [red, green]\n      output:\n          description: extracted enclosed region\n          colors: [red, green]\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Enclosing Shape:** Find the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels that forms a recognizable shape (e.g., \"U\", \"arch\", \"C\").\n2.  **Identify interior:** find the region within the gray shape.\n3. **Output Interior:** Create a new grid consisting of the interior area.\n\n"
