It contains a central structure made of '5' (gray) and '8' (azure) pixels. The '5' pixels form a rectangular border, and the '8' pixels fill the interior of this border. The output is a 3x3 grid containing two '8' (azure) pixels in the top row and the rest are '0' (white) pixels. It appears to be a drastically reduced and simplified representation of the central feature of the input, extracting azure elements.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
