Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed based on the first example, creating a green border and attempting a white cross. However, the subsequent test results reveal inconsistencies. The primary issue is that the generated code doesn't correctly create the intended white cross pattern for all cases and the border. It appears the size of output is related to size of input. The approach of directly setting pixels at `output_grid[1,i]` and `output_grid[i,1]` is too rigid and doesn't adapt to different grid sizes.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Border:** The border creation needs to be dynamic, determined by the input grid's dimensions, this is working, so we can preserve that.
2.  **Adaptive Cross:** The white "cross" (or plus sign) logic must be generalized. Instead of hardcoded indices, it should calculate the center row and column based on the grid size and place the white pixels accordingly.
3. **Consistent output**: review how the output size changes.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example and result:

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid, name):
    """Analyzes a single grid and returns relevant metrics."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_values = np.unique(grid)
    value_counts = {val: np.count_nonzero(grid == val) for val in unique_values}
    print(f"  {name}:")
    print(f"    Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")
    print(f"    Unique Values: {unique_values}")
    print(f"    Value Counts: {value_counts}")
    adjacent_diffs = 0
    for r in range(rows):
      for c in range(cols-1):
        if grid[r,c] != grid[r,c+1]:
          adjacent_diffs += 1
    for r in range(rows-1):
      for c in range(cols):
        if grid[r,c] != grid[r+1,c]:
          adjacent_diffs += 1

    print(f'    Adjacent Diffs: {adjacent_diffs}')

def analyze_example(example):
    """Analyzes an input-output pair and the transformed output."""
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Assuming 'transform' is your function
    analyze_grid(input_grid, "Input")
    analyze_grid(output_grid, "Expected Output")
    analyze_grid(transformed_grid, "Transformed Output")
    print(f"    Match: {np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid)}")
    print("---")
    
def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape
    
    # Change all pixels on the outer border to green (3)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1:
                output_grid[i, j] = 3
            
    # Create a plus pattern of white pixels inside the frame.
    # Iterate, excluding the border to create white pixels.
    for i in range(1, rows -1):
        output_grid[1,i] = 0
        output_grid[i,1] = 0

    return output_grid
