The input grid consists entirely of `0` values (white pixels), while the output grid introduces `3` values (green pixels) in a specific pattern, while retaining some `0` values. The core of the task appears to be identifying and applying a rule to change specific white pixels to green pixels based on their position within the grid. The grid dimensions are 6x6.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts**\n\n"
