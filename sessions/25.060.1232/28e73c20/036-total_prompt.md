Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved creating a green border and a green cross in the center. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced pattern. The core concept seems to be about creating shapes (border, cross) using a specific color, but the conditions for creating these shapes and their interactions are not fully captured by the initial program. The additional examples show that only a border *or* a cross is created, and depends on size of input.

The strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze each example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each training example. Focus on identifying discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.
2.  **Identify conditions:** Determine the conditions under which a border is created, and the conditions under which a cross is created. The size of the input grid seems likely to be a key factor.
3.  **Refine the program:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect these conditions and the resulting transformations.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the errors, it's helpful to look at the dimensions of each input grid:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a function to calculate the task metrics and compare with expected.
def calculate_task_metrics(task):
    metrics = []
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        rows, cols = input_grid.shape
        
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        
        metrics.append({
            'input_rows': rows,
            'input_cols': cols,
            'output_rows': output_grid.shape[0],
            'output_cols': output_grid.shape[1],
        })
    return metrics

metrics = calculate_task_metrics(task)
print(metrics)
```
```
[{'input_rows': 6, 'input_cols': 26, 'output_rows': 6, 'output_cols': 26}, {'input_rows': 5, 'input_cols': 19, 'output_rows': 5, 'output_cols': 19}, {'input_rows': 6, 'input_cols': 13, 'output_rows': 6, 'output_cols': 13}]
```

Based on these metrics and visual inspection of the grids, the following observations can be made:

*   **Example 1 (6x26):** A green border is created.
*   **Example 2 (5x19):** A green cross is created at the center.
*   **Example 3 (6x13):** A green border is created.

It appears that a border is constructed when *either* the number of rows *or* the number of columns is even. If *both* are odd, then a cross is created.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- object: grid
  properties:
    rows: variable
    columns: variable
    cells: integers (0-9)
  actions:
    - name: create_border
      condition: rows is even OR columns is even
      color: green (3)
      description: Fill the outermost rows and columns with green.
    - name: create_cross
      condition: rows is odd AND columns is odd
      color: green (3)
      description: Fill the central row(s) and column(s) with green.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Examine Input Dimensions:** Determine the number of rows and columns in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Border:** If *either* the number of rows *or* the number of columns is even, create a green (value 3) border around the grid. The border consists of filling the outermost rows and columns with green.
3.  **Conditional Cross:** If *both* the number of rows *and* the number of columns are odd, create a green (value 3) cross at the center of the grid. The cross consists of filling the central row(s) and central column(s) with green. If the number of rows is even, there are two central rows. Similarly, if the number of columns is even, there are two central columns.
4. **Output:** The result will be a copy of input grid with either a border or a cross, not both.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
