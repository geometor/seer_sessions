The output is a 15x15 grid with a complex pattern of 0s (white) and 3s (green). The output appears to have a symmetrical, almost fractal-like structure, with nested squares of green and white. There's an \"x\" pattern of green in white, and the borders of the square change between white and green.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
