The output is also an 8x8 grid, but it contains a combination of 0s (white) and 3s (green). The 3s appear to form a filled square outline or border, while the inside pattern is an arrangement of green and white pixels. The core transformation seems to involve introducing the color green (3) based on a specific geometric pattern, while some of the original white pixels (0) are retained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
