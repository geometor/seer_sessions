Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a green spiral-drawing function, starting from the top-left corner. It changes white (0) cells to green (3) and turns right whenever it encounters a boundary or an already green cell.

The results across the training examples show the approach is partially successful.

- correct:
  + example 1: transformation matches expected output
- incorrect:
  + example 0: transformation doesn't fill the entire grid,
    only changes up to the first "turn"
  + example 2: transformation doesn't fill the entire grid,
    and "turns" prematurely, only filling a portion of the first row

From the test cases that show correct output vs the incorrect ones, it can be
seen that the turn signal should only apply when the spiral can no longer move
forward.

By considering all the examples, we will be able to update the natural language
program to:

- update the condition that controls spiral turning
- add support for colored borders

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformation, let's gather some metrics.

Here is code that, for each input-output pair, reports:

- input and output grid shape,
- number and starting position of solid blocks of color

```python
import numpy as np

def get_block_data(grid):
    """
    Identifies contiguous blocks of the same color in a grid.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are colors and values are lists of (start_row, start_col, count) tuples
        representing contiguous blocks of that color.
    """
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
    block_data = {}

    def dfs(row, col, color, count):
        if (
            row < 0
            or row >= rows
            or col < 0
            or col >= cols
            or visited[row, col]
            or grid[row, col] != color
        ):
            return count

        visited[row, col] = True
        count += 1

        count = dfs(row + 1, col, color, count)  # Down
        count = dfs(row - 1, col, color, count)  # Up
        count = dfs(row, col + 1, color, count)  # Right
        count = dfs(row, col - 1, color, count)  # Left
        return count

    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            if not visited[row, col]:
                color = grid[row, col]
                block_count = dfs(row, col, color, 0)
                if color not in block_data:
                    block_data[color] = []
                block_data[color].append(((row, col), block_count))

    return block_data

#display all available examples
for index in range(len(task.train)):

    input_grid = task.train[index]["input"]
    output_grid = task.train[index]["output"]

    # Get shape information
    input_shape = np.array(input_grid).shape
    output_shape = np.array(output_grid).shape

    # Get block data for input and output
    input_blocks = get_block_data(np.array(input_grid))
    output_blocks = get_block_data(np.array(output_grid))
    
    print(f"Example {index}:")
    print(f"  Input Shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Output Shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"  Input Blocks: {input_blocks}")
    print(f"  Output Blocks: {output_blocks}")    
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Start at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the input grid.
    *   Set the initial drawing direction to right (0, 1).
    *   Set the drawing color to green (3).

2.  **Spiral Drawing:**
    *   Iterate through the grid cells, attempting to draw a spiral:
    *   If the current cell color is white (0), change it to green (3).
    *   Check the next cell in the current direction.
        *  If next cell is not white (0) or out of bounds, change direction by
           turning right (rotate direction vector 90 degrees clockwise).
        *  Otherwise, proceed with the current direction
    *   Move to the next cell in the updated direction.

3.  **Border Preservation:**
    *   Ensure that the colored border (any color other than white) in the
    *   input grid remains unchanged in the output grid. This means the spiral
        should not overwrite any non-white cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
