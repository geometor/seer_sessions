Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Outline:** Create a 10x10 grid.
2.  **Border:** Fill the outermost border (top, bottom, left, and right edges) of the grid with green pixels (value 3).
3. **Central Cross:** in the central 6 x 6 grid (i.e., skip the first and last row and first and last column), make a cross with arm length 3 (including the center pixel, which will already be set to 3 from previous step):
    *   Fill the central vertical line and center horizontal line within the 6 x 6 grid with green(3) pixels except for the pixels at locations (3,1),(3,8) and (8,3),(8,8) where (0,0) is top left.
4.  **Background:** All other pixels remain white (value 0).

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with zeros (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Fill the border with 3s (green)
    output_grid[0, :] = 3  # Top row

        output_grid[i, 7] = 3

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed for a 10x10 grid and created a specific cross pattern within a border. However, the training examples reveal that the grid size varies, and the cross pattern's position and, to some extent, its dimensions also adapt to the grid size. The core concept of a border and a cross-like structure seems consistent, but the exact implementation details need adjustment to be more general and flexible. My strategy will be to analyze how the border and cross are defined relative to the varying grid sizes and identify the consistent rules governing their construction. The core concept of making certain exceptions during the cross formation are incorrect and should be removed.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To understand the pattern, I'll use code execution to get the dimensions of the input and output grids for each example and check the correctness of the current code.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(task):
    results = []
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output = transform(input_grid)  # Using the provided transform function
        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output, output_grid)
        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
            'correct': correct
        })
    return results
example_task = {
    'train': [
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]},
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]},
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]}
    ]
}

results = analyze_results(example_task)
for r in results:
    print(r)
```

```output
{'input_shape': (10, 10), 'output_shape': (10, 10), 'correct': True}
{'input_shape': (7, 7), 'output_shape': (7, 7), 'correct': False}
{'input_shape': (6, 6), 'output_shape': (6, 6), 'correct': False}
```

The code only works correctly for the 10x10 input. For other sizes, it fails. Let's review how cross is constructed.  The cross is always positioned such that it creates a symmetric shape.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      size: variable (rows, cols)
  - name: border
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      location: outermost rows and columns of the grid
  - name: cross
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: plus sign (+)
      position: centered within the grid, excluding the border

actions:
  - name: create_border
    description: Fill the outermost rows and columns of the grid with green (3).
  - name: create_cross
    description: Fill the central horizontal and vertical lines of the inner grid (excluding the border) with green (3).
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create a Border:** Fill the outermost rows and columns of the input grid with the color green (value 3).
2.  **Create a Cross:**  Within the inner grid (the area remaining after excluding the border), find the central row and central column. Fill these central row(s) and column(s) with the color green (value 3). If there are even numbers of rows, there will be two 'central rows'. Similarly for columns.

The previous exceptions were incorrect and are therefore removed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
