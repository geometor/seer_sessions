  - task: "grid transformation"
  - input_grid_dimensions: [3, 6]
  - output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]
  - input_colors:
    - yellow: 4
    - green: 3
    - white: 0
  - output_colors:
    - magenta: 6
    - white: 0
  - object_count:
      input:
        yellow: 2
        green: 2
        white: 14
      output:
          magenta: 4
          white: 5
  - observations:
    - "The output grid is smaller in the x-dimension (columns)"
    - "The output grid has a total of 4 cells of 6 (magenta)."
    - "The number of colored pixels (non-white) is conserved."
    - "The input grid has 2 yellow and 2 green blocks, summing to 4 non-zero numbers."
