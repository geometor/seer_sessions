Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a grid by replacing non-white pixels with magenta, keeping white pixels unchanged, and compressing the columns by half.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with dimensions half the width of the input
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_rows, input_cols // 2), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid
    for i in range(input_rows):
        for j in range(input_cols // 2):
            # compress the grid by two columns at a time
            if input_grid[i, 2*j] != 0 or input_grid[i, 2*j + 1] != 0:
                output_grid[i,j] = 6 # set to magenta
            else:
                output_grid[i,j] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
