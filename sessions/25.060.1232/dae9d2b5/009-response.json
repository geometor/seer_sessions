The input grid has yellow (4), green (3), and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has magenta (6) and white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid also change: the input is 3x6 (rows x columns), and the output is 3x3. It appears there's a relationship between non-white colors in input, which is replaced by magenta in output. White remains the same.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
