objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable (input), 3x3 (output)
      colors: [0, 3, 4] (input), [0, 6] (output)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
        color:
            input: [0, 3, 4]
            output: [0,6]
        position:

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    parameters:
      old_color: [3, 4]
      new_color: 6
  - name: resize_grid
    parameters:
      new_dimensions: [3, 3]
  - name: map_positions
    description: maps the positions of colors 3 and four in the in put grid to color 6 in output grid

relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    input:
        3:6
        4:6
        0:0
  - type: spatial_mapping
    description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid correspond to magenta pixels in the output grid. The arrangement isn't a direct 1:1 mapping due to resizing, but relative positioning seems important.
