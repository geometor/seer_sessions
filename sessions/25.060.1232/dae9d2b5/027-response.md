Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x6 grid with colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with colored pixels. The colors present are white (0) and magenta (6).
*   **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a compressed and recolored version of the input grid. The dimensions are reduced, and the non-white colors in the input are replaced with magenta in the output. There appears to be a relationship between the input positions and output positions, as the colors that are not white have a specific arrangement in the output grid based on where the input is a non-white cell.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: 3x6
  - output_grid_dimensions: 3x3
  - input_colors: [0, 3, 4]
  - output_colors: [0, 6]
  - input_objects:
      - color: 3
        positions: [(0,4), (2,3), (2,4)]
      - color: 4
        positions:  [(1,0), (2,2)]
  - output_objects:
      - color: 6
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
  - color_mapping:
      - input: 3
        output: 6
      - input: 4
        output: 6
  - spatial_relationship: Input grid is condensed into the output grid, with non-zero input pixels mapping to a specific location and color in output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of size 3x3, initialized with all white (0) pixels.
2.  **Color Mapping:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid, check if its color is either green(3) or yellow(4):
3.    If a cell is not white(0)
    * replace its value with magenta (6).
4.  **Condensation and Placement:** : Create output grid
    - If a cell in the input grid had green(3) or yellow(4)
    - Set the cell to magenta(6) based on relative locations.
    - The first non-white cell from top left will get mapped to output\_grid\[0]\[1].
    - The next non-white cells will be filled, to output\_grid\[1]\[0], output\_grid\[2]\[0], output\_grid\[2]\[1] and output\[2]\[2].

In short: every non-white pixel from input grid, is set to 6 (magenta) in the output grid. The first non-white cell in the top-left corner of input grid will be in (0, 1) of output. All other non-white cells will be set in the output grid at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) respectively based on their first appearance.
