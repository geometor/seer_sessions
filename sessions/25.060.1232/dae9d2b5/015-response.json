The input grid contains colors white (0), yellow (4), and green (3), while the output grid primarily consists of magenta (6) and a single white pixel (0). The dimensions of the input grid (3x6) are different from the output grid (3x3). It appears the non-zero colors are being replaced, and there's potentially a spatial relationship or compression involved. There is one 0 at the beginning of the first row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
