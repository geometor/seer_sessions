**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7CE41B97A350>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid has yellow (4), green (3), and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has magenta (6) and white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid also change: the input is 3x6 (rows x columns), and the output is 3x3. It appears there's a relationship between non-white colors in input, which is replaced by magenta in output. White remains the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 6]
      colors: [0, 3, 4]
      color_names: [white, green, yellow]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      colors: [0, 6]
      color_names: [white, magenta]
  - observations:
      - "Non-white pixels in the input grid are replaced by magenta pixels in the output grid."
      - "White pixels remain unchanged."
      - "The output grid is smaller than the input grid, specifically the number of columns is different."
      - "input columns are compressed from 6 to 3 in output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify non-white pixels**: Iterate through the input grid, locating all pixels that are not white (0).
2.  **Replace with magenta**: In the output grid, change the color value to magenta (6) for the columns that has a non-white color.
3. **Conserve white color**: White (0) color, and all rows with only the white color will not be changed.
4.  **Compress columns**: Reduce the number of columns by half (from 6 to 3), using an approach which can be merging columns or picking every odd or even column, and transform the input values into output values by replacing any non-white with magenta.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
