**input:**
```
4 4 0 3 3 0
4 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7CE41B8FFBD0>

**output:**
```
6 6 0
6 0 0
0 0 6

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x6 in this example). The colors are defined by a color map that's provided. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex spatial reasoning or object manipulation at first glance, rather a simple replacement based on some rule related to the pixel.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors yellow (4), green (3), and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid contains magenta (6) and white (0).
  - relationship: Yellow (4) and Green(3) in input are replaced by Magenta(6)
  - relationship: White (0) remains unchanged.
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - elements: integers (representing colors)
  - action: Color Replacement.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **If** the pixel's value is 4 (yellow) or 3(green).
3.  **Then** replace it with 6 (magenta).
4. **Else,** leave the pixel's original color.
5.  **Return** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
