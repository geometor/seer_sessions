Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output grids are the same size (20x20). The input grid appears to contain two primary colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid introduces two new colors: orange (7) and red (2). The blue regions in the input seem to dictate the overall shape, while the orange and red fills appear within those blue "outlines". Specifically, it looks like contiguous regions of 0s surrounded by 1s are replaced. Some 0s are replaced by 7s, and others are replaced by 2s. The choice between 7 and 2 appears to related to some form of alternating or secondary containment.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 20x20
      colors: [white, blue, orange, red]
    input_colors: [white, blue]
    output_colors: [white, blue, orange, red]
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: white
      border: blue
      fill: [orange, red]
    actions:
      - fill_interior
    relationships:
      - contained_by: blue border

actions:
  - identify_regions:
      description: Find contiguous areas of white pixels surrounded by blue pixels.
  - fill_regions:
      description: Change color of white regions to either orange or red based on some unknown internal pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that are completely enclosed by blue (1) pixels. These form closed shapes.

2.  **Fill Inner Regions (Alternating):** Fill those white regions with two new colors following a pattern:
      *   Fill the inner most regions with red (2)
      *   Fill outer most regions with orange (7)

3.  Leave the surrounding blue (1) pixels, and the open white (0) pixel (not surrounded by 1's) unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
