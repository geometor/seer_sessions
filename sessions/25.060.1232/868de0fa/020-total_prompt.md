Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that are *completely* enclosed by blue (1) pixels. A region is considered enclosed only if *all* of its constituent white pixels have neighboring blue pixels in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

2. **Identify Open Regions** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that have at least one pixel in the group that does not have all blue pixels for neighbors in all for cardinal directions.

3.  **Fill Inner Regions:** Fill the enclosed white regions with orange (7).

4.  Leave the surrounding blue (1) pixels unchanged. Do not change the open white regions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved filling enclosed white regions with orange. The subsequent test results reveal that this program is not universally applicable to all training examples. Some examples require filling based on different criteria (e.g. not fully enclosed, largest areas). Therefore, the strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze each example carefully:** Examine the input, expected output, and the actual output of the current code. Identify discrepancies.
2.  **Identify common patterns/rules:** Determine if there's a more general rule that covers all training examples, or if different rules apply to different subsets of examples.
3. **Update the natural language program incrementally**: modify the original program, be specific on error corrections, and improvements.
4.  **Refine object and action descriptions:** Make the YAML description more precise based on all examples.
5. **Consider Alternative Hypotheses:** If a simple rule can not describe the set, then explore different rules such as selecting regions based on size, position, etc.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To better understand the transformations, I will use numpy to check results and conditions:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)
# I am creating simplified examples to demonstrate the concept

# these have been simplified from the training set examples
example_inputs = [
    np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]]),
    np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]),
    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]])
]

example_outputs = [
    np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 7, 1], [1, 1, 1]]),
    np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 7, 7, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]),
    np.array([[7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7]])
]

previous_code_outputs = [
    np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 7, 1], [1, 1, 1]]),
    np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 7, 7, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]),
    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]])
]


def calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    """Calculates metrics for a single example."""

    input_white_count = np.sum(input_grid == 0)
    input_blue_count = np.sum(input_grid == 1)
    expected_orange_count = np.sum(expected_output == 7)
    actual_orange_count = np.sum(actual_output == 7)
    correct_pixels = np.sum(expected_output == actual_output)
    total_pixels = expected_output.size
    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0

    return {
        "input_white": int(input_white_count),
        "input_blue": int(input_blue_count),
        "expected_orange": int(expected_orange_count),
        "actual_orange": int(actual_orange_count),
        "accuracy": float(accuracy),
    }

for i, (inp, exp, act) in enumerate(zip(example_inputs, example_outputs, previous_code_outputs)):
    metrics = calculate_metrics(inp, exp, act)
    print(f"Example {i+1} Metrics: {metrics}")

```

```text
Example 1 Metrics: {'input_white': 1, 'input_blue': 8, 'expected_orange': 1, 'actual_orange': 1, 'accuracy': 1.0}
Example 2 Metrics: {'input_white': 2, 'input_blue': 10, 'expected_orange': 2, 'actual_orange': 2, 'accuracy': 1.0}
Example 3 Metrics: {'input_white': 10, 'input_blue': 2, 'expected_orange': 10, 'actual_orange': 0, 'accuracy': 0.16666666666666666}
```

**YAML Facts**
```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - type: region
          color: white
          initial_state: enclosed
          final_state: filled_orange
        - type: boundary
          color: blue
          state: unchanged
      actions:
        - fill_enclosed:
            input: white_region
            output: orange_region

  - example_2:
      objects:
        - type: region
          color: white
          initial_state: enclosed
          final_state: filled_orange
        - type: boundary

          state: unchanged
      actions:
        - fill_enclosed:
            input: white_region
            output: orange_region

  - example_3:
      objects:
        - type: region
          color: white
          initial_state: open
          final_state: filled_orange
        - type: region
            color: blue
            initial_state: "inner"
            final_state: "unchanged"
      actions:
        - fill_open:
            input: white_region
            output: orange_region
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Examine the grid and identify all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.
2.  **Determine Fill Condition:**
    *   If a white region is *completely* enclosed by blue (1) pixels (all neighboring pixels in the four cardinal directions are blue), it should be filled.
    *   If *no* white regions are completely enclosed by blue pixels, fill *all* white regions.
3.  **Fill Regions:** Change the color of the pixels in the identified white regions to orange (7).
4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All non-white pixels (in the examples, only blue (1) pixels have been observed), should remain unchanged.

**Reasoning for Changes**:

The critical change is in Step 2. The original program *only* filled completely enclosed regions. The metrics and outputs from example 3 show it does not select any region. Example 3's expected output shows that if there are no enclosed regions, then fill *all* white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
