Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Blue Shape:** Identify the contiguous region of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This forms the "blue shape."
2.  **Locate Top-Left:** Find the top-left pixel of the blue shape.
3.  **Change Top-Left to Orange:** Change the color of the top-left pixel of the blue shape to orange (7).
4.  **Create Red Rectangle:**
    * find the bounding box (min/max rows/cols) of the blue object
    * Create a 2x2 red (2) rectangle *inside* the blue shape.
    * The red rectangle's columns will be the *last two* columns of the *blue shape*.
    * The red rectangle will be positioned vertically to begin at the second row of the blue shape, and end at the second to last row of the blue shape.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
