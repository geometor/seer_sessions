"""
1.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Find all enclosed regions formed by contiguous blue (1) pixels. These regions are considered fillable.
2.  **Horizontal Division:** Within *each* identified enclosed region, treat blue lines and existing grid edges that form enclosed areas as dividers.
3. **Determine Fill Color within region:**
    *   If a fillable area within a region is *above* a blue line divider, the fill color is orange (7).
    *   If a fillable area within a region is *below* a blue line divider, the fill color is red (2).
4.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:** For each identified enclosed region, replace all interior white (0) pixels with the designated fill color determined in step 3, based on its position relative to horizontal dividing lines within the region.
5. **Preserve Outlines**: Keep the original blue pixels of the outline unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved filling enclosed regions with orange above blue lines and red below. The subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this approach. The simple "above/below" rule doesn't hold universally. The code correctly identifies the enclosed blue shapes, but the fill logic based on horizontal dividers is incorrect for some examples. The second example does NOT have any horizontal dividers, and the rule fails here. The third example shows the region split by a horizontal divider.

The strategy for resolving the errors will involve:

1.  **Re-examining the Fill Rule:**  The "above/below" rule needs to be replaced with a more general rule that accounts for all cases. I will use code_execution to examine the pixel patterns inside the shapes.
2.  **Consistent Fill within Shapes (Revised):**  It appears the fill color of a shape could be constant.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's an analysis of each example, including metrics gathered via observation and code execution:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output Grid:")
    print(output_grid)
    print("Predicted Output Grid:")
    print(predicted_grid)
    
    input_blue_shapes = find_shapes(input_grid, 1)
    output_blue_shapes = find_shapes(output_grid, 1)

    print(f"Number of input blue shapes: {len(input_blue_shapes)}")
    print(f"Number of output blue shapes: {len(output_blue_shapes)}")


    correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid)
    print(f"Correct prediction?: {correct}")

    if not correct:
        diff = output_grid != predicted_grid
        print("Difference:")
        print(diff.astype(int)) # show differences as 0 and 1
        
        # Check fill colors in the *output* grid within blue shapes
        if len(output_blue_shapes) > 0 :
          for shape in output_blue_shapes:
            min_x = min(x for x, y in shape)
            max_x = max(x for x, y in shape)
            min_y = min(y for x, y in shape)
            max_y = max(y for x, y in shape)
            
            fill_colors = set()
            for x in range(min_x + 1, max_x):
              for y in range(min_y+1, max_y):
                if output_grid[x,y] != 1:
                    fill_colors.add(output_grid[x,y])

            print(f"Fill colors within output shape: {fill_colors}")

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Find all enclosed regions formed by contiguous blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Determine Fill Color:** Each enclosed region has a unique and consistent fill color. There are no divider lines within shapes.
    *   The first identified enclosed region (from top-left, reading row-wise) is filled with orange (7).
    *   The second identified enclosed region is filled with red (2).
    *   The third and subsequent regions alternate - orange and then red
3.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:** For each identified enclosed region, replace all interior white (0) pixels with the designated fill color determined in step 2.
4.  **Preserve Outlines:** Keep the original blue pixels of the outline unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
