Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 1s (blue).
*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), 2s (red), and 7s (orange).
*   The 0s (white) in the input remain 0s (white) in the output.
*   The 1s (blue) in the input seem to be changing to other colors based on their position or surrounding pixels. Specifically, some blue regions remain blue, some become red, some orange
*   It appears the change of blue pixels is related to enclosed shapes

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    input_colors: [0, 1]  # white, blue
    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 7]  # white, blue, red, orange

actions:
  - name: color_change
    input: 1  # blue
    output: [1, 2, 7]  # blue, red, or orange
    condition: >
      The output color depends on the object to which it originally belonged to.

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: Adjacent pixels of the same color form an object.

    - type: enclosure
      description: >-
          Pixels forming different "shapes" or "contiguous components" may have different transformation
          rules, even though they share the original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Color Preservation:** All white (0) pixels in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid.

3.  **Object Identification:** Identify contiguous regions (objects) of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Consider diagonally touching pixels as part of distinct regions.

4.  **Color Transformation by Object:**
    *   Blue pixels at top and bottom borders stay blue.
    *   Blue pixels at left and right borders stay blue.
    *   The blue object in the top-left corner that forms a shape similar to a square has the interior blue (1) changed to red (2).
    *   The blue object in the middle-right that forms a cross or plus shape has the interior blue (1) pixels changed to orange (7).
    *   The blue object at the center-bottom, similar to a reversed L, with interior blue (1) pixels, are changed to orange (7)

5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
