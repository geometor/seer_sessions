  - observation: |
      The input grids contain blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
      The output grids contain red (2), orange (7), blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - objects:
      - type: connected_regions
        color: blue (1)
        description: Contiguous groups of blue pixels, connected horizontally or vertically.
  - actions:
      - type: classification
        criteria:
          - L-shaped: If the number of pixels in a blue region is less than the area of its bounding box, and not a single pixel, it's classified as L-shaped.
          - Rectangular: If the number of pixels in a blue region is equal to the area of its bounding box, it is classified as rectangular.
          - Other: any region not meeting the criteria for L-Shaped or Rectangular.
      - type: recoloring
        rule:
          - L-shaped regions are recolored to orange (7).
          - Rectangular regions are recolored to red (2).
          - Other regions remain blue.
      - type: preservation
        rule: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
