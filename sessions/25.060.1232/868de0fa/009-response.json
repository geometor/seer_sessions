The primary colors observed are blue (1), white (0), orange (7), and red (2). The input grid contains a connected region of blue (1) pixels against a background of mostly white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to modify some of the blue pixels within the originally blue region to red (2), and a single blue pixel is changed to orange (7). The transformation doesn't seem to extend the region, change any white, or add any other colors to the background.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
