The input grid appears to contain two primary colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid introduces two new colors: orange (7) and red (2). The blue regions in the input seem to dictate the overall shape, while the orange and red fills appear within those blue \"outlines\". Specifically, it looks like contiguous regions of 0s surrounded by 1s are replaced. Some 0s are replaced by 7s, and others are replaced by 2s. The choice between 7 and 2 appears to related to some form of alternating or secondary containment.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
