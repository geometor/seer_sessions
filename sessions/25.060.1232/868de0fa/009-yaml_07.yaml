facts:
  - observation: The input is a 10x10 grid of pixels, each with a color value.
  - observation: The output is a 10x10 grid with some color values changed.
  - object: blue_region: A contiguous block of blue (1) pixels in the input.
  - property: blue_region.shape: Irregular, but contained within the top-right quadrant
  - property: blue_region.location: Top-right quadrant
  - action: Some blue (1) pixels within the blue_region are changed to red (2).
  - action: One blue (1) pixel is changed to orange (7).
  - relationship: The red (2) pixels form a rectangular sub-region.
  - relationship: the orange (7) pixel appears at the top left of the original shape (likely the most top, and then most left)
  - constraint: White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.
  - constraint: No new regions are formed.
