The output is always a single pixel, either white (0) or azure (8). The key seems to be identifying a dominant color or a color that meets a specific condition within the input grid. There isn't any obvious geometric transformation or object manipulation. Instead the relationship between all of the different colors present in the input is used to produce the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
