The transformation seems to involve a form of compression or summarization, where regions of the input grid are represented by single pixels in the output grid. The red pixels seems to be related with the grey ones, and the white one are transfered as is.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are from the input, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n2. **Check White:** If any of the cells at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) are equal to 0, then the output pixel for that respective position equals 0.\n3.  **Summarize:** For each of the identified 3x3 regions in the input, determine their center cell (2,2) in the input. Create output.\n4. **Color Conversion**: If any of the other cells in a region are equal to 2, replace the output pixel by 5 (gray).\n\nIn summary the center of each sub-region, where there center are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) and (3,3) for the input, is translated to the respective cell (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) and (2,2) in the output grid, replacing the value '2' for a '5'. If center of the input is 0, it remains zero in the output.\n"
