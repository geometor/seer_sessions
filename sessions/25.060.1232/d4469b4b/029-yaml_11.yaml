observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      size: 5x5
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: 3x3_regions
    type: overlapping subgrids
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      count: 9
      centers: correspond to output_grid pixels
  - action: map_region_to_pixel
    description: Each 3x3 region in the input maps to a single pixel in the output.
  - rule: color_determination
    conditions:
      - if: "any pixel in the 3x3 region is 2 (red)"
        then: "output pixel is 5 (gray)"
      - else: output pixel is 0 (white)
