facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain regions of various colors, with red regions being of primary interest.
  - object_identification: |
      Red regions are identified as distinct objects based on pixel contiguity.
  - property_shape: |
      The shape of a red region can vary (e.g., 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, or a line).
  - property_color: |
      The relevant colors are red (input) and gray (output). Black for no red.
  - action_transformation: |
      The shape defined by the red pixels is replicated using gray pixels.
  - action_output_size: |
      The size of output is dependent on red shape, not the input grid.
  - action_no_red: |
     If there are not red pixels, a single black pixel is returned.
