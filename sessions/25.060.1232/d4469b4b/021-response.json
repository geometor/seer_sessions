The input grid contains only two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid also contains two colors: white (0) and gray (5).

This will result in a total of 9 different 3x3 subgrids ((5-3+1) \\* (5-3+1) = 3\\*3).\n3. **Counting the number of Blue pixels** Within input, for each 3x3 subgrid and center, determine if it is blue.\n4. **Determine output color:** If the centered pixel of input subgrid is blue(1) then set output to gray(5). Otherwise(0) output will be white(0).\n5. Set output grid to gray or white based on this condition.\n\nIn essence, the output is a condensed representation where each cell's color (gray or white) depends on whether that position in input is blue.\n"
