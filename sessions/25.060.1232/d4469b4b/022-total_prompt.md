**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7CE4233278D0>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains only two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid also contains two colors: white (0) and gray (5). It appears that the output grid is derived from the input grid by examining 3x3 subgrids within the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: [0, 1]  # white, blue
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 5]  # white, gray
  - type: subgrid
    name: sliding_window
    dimensions: 3x3

actions:
  - type: slide_window
    agent: sliding_window
    target: input_grid
    description: A 3x3 window slides across the input grid.
  - type: count
    agent: sliding_window
    target: input_grid.elements
      #description: counts the number of blue(1) in subgrid
  - type: determine_color
      #description: determines the color in output based on number of blue

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a sliding window operation.
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: sliding_window
    description: in each window position

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Sliding Window:** A 3x3 window slides over the input grid, moving one cell at a time, both horizontally and vertically. This will result in a total of 9 different 3x3 subgrids ((5-3+1) \* (5-3+1) = 3\*3).
3. **Counting the number of Blue pixels** Within input, for each 3x3 subgrid and center, determine if it is blue.
4. **Determine output color:** If the centered pixel of input subgrid is blue(1) then set output to gray(5). Otherwise(0) output will be white(0).
5. Set output grid to gray or white based on this condition.

In essence, the output is a condensed representation where each cell's color (gray or white) depends on whether that position in input is blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
