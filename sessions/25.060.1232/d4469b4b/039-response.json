The input grid is 5x5, and the output grid is 3x3. The colors involved are white (0), green (3), and gray (5). The primary element seems to be a reduction in grid size, accompanied by a change in color. The green elements become gray elements.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The original 5x5 grid is made smaller, becoming a 3x3 grid. Any green elements in the original grid will be gray elements.\n4. **White Remains:** all other colors are removed, becoming white.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves reducing a 5x5 grid to a 3x3 grid, and recoloring the green areas of the original as gray areas in the output.\n"
