**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is 5x5, and the output grid is 3x3. The colors involved are white (0), green (3), and gray (5). The primary element seems to be a reduction in grid size, accompanied by a change in color. The green elements become gray elements.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: green
        value: 3
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: gray
        value: 5
  - action: transformation
    type: grid_reduction_and_recolor
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
  - relationship:
      subject: green pixels (input)
      predicate: become
      object: gray pixels (output)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green (3) Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '3' (green) in the input grid.
2.  **Change to Gray:** The color of those located cells is changed from green(3) to gray (5)
3. **Reduce Grid:** Reduce the grid size. The original 5x5 grid is made smaller, becoming a 3x3 grid. Any green elements in the original grid will be gray elements.
4. **White Remains:** all other colors are removed, becoming white.

In summary, the transformation involves reducing a 5x5 grid to a 3x3 grid, and recoloring the green areas of the original as gray areas in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
