Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Regions**: Examine the input grid and identify contiguous regions of red pixels. Each of these regions is treated as a single object.
2.  **Determine the shape**: Find the shape of the red pixel region.
3.  **Replicate with Gray**: Create an output grid where the shape is replicated using gray pixels in place of the red ones. The position and overall shape of the red region in the input directly correspond to the position and shape of the gray region in the output.
4. **Output Size**: The size of the gray area depends on the input size of red area.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The current code correctly identifies red regions and replaces them with gray. However, it seems to assume that the output grid should be the same size as the input grid, which is not always the case. The code also fails if there are no red. The core logic of identifying a region of a specific color (red) and replicating its shape with another color (gray) is sound, but the output grid dimensions need to be handled dynamically, and it should return black when no red is found.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** The output grid size should be determined by the bounding box of the identified red region, not the input grid size. We'll calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the red pixels and use that to create the output grid.
2.  **Handle no red pixels**: When no red found return the a single black pixel

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the dimensions and the transformation:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, Red region: 1x1
    *   Expected Output: 1x1, Gray region: 1x1
    *   Actual Output: 3x3, Gray region: 1x1
    *   **Observation:** Output size is incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7, Red region: 3x3
    *   Expected Output: 3x3, Gray region: 3x3
    *   Actual Output: 7x7, Gray region: 3x3
    *   **Observation:** Output size is incorrect.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 11x11, Red region: 5x5
    *   Expected output: 5x5, Gray Region: 5x5
    *   Actual Output: 11x11, Gray Region: 5x5
    *    **Observation:** Output size is incorrect.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 2x3, No Red pixels
    *   Expected output: 1x1 black
    *   Actual Output: 2x3 all black
    *    **Observation:** Output size is incorrect.
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input: 4x4, Red pixels in a line shape
    *   Expected output: line of grey of same shape
    *   Actual Output: 4x4 shape filled in with grey
    *   **Observation**: shape not being calculated properly.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain regions of various colors, with red regions being of primary interest.
  - object_identification: |
      Red regions are identified as distinct objects based on pixel contiguity.
  - property_shape: |
      The shape of a red region can vary (e.g., 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, or a line).
  - property_color: |
      The relevant colors are red (input) and gray (output). Black for no red.
  - action_transformation: |
      The shape defined by the red pixels is replicated using gray pixels.
  - action_output_size: |
      The size of output is dependent on red shape, not the input grid.
  - action_no_red: |
     If there are not red pixels, a single black pixel is returned.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Examine the input grid to find contiguous regions of red pixels. Each contiguous region is treated as a single object.
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the bounding box of the red region. This is done by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by red pixels.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new output grid. The dimensions of this grid are determined by the size of the bounding box calculated in the previous step.
4.  **Replicate with Gray:** Iterate through the coordinates within the bounding box. If the corresponding pixel in the input grid is red, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray.
5.  **Handle No Red Pixels**: If no red pixels are found, return an output grid of size 1x1 containing a single black (color 0) pixel.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
