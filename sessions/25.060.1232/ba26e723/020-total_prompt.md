Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replace specific yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels based on their horizontal neighbors in the top row only. If a yellow pixel in the top row has yellow neighbors on both sides (left and right), it changes to magenta. If a yellow pixel in the top row has white neighbors on both sides, it changes to magenta. Otherwise, the pixel remains unchanged. Pixels in other rows are not modified.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and implemented a rule that changes yellow pixels in the top row to magenta based on their immediate left and right neighbors. The conditions were: yellow neighbors on both sides OR white neighbors on both sides.

After testing on all training examples, it appears that the rule needs to be more specific to the overall pattern of the grid. Simply, checking neighbors and color isn't doing the job. The program needs more context to describe the objects and the overall goal of the transformation. It's failing when different colors appear as neighbors in the top row and when the size of an "object" changes from the input to the output.

My strategy is to analyze the broader context within each input-output pair, looking for patterns beyond immediate neighbors, before adjusting the natural language program.

**Example and Results Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including an analysis of the code's success or failure:

*   **Example 1:** Input shape (3, 5), Output shape (3, 5)
    *   The code correctly transformed the input. The yellow pixels at (0,1) and (0,3) had yellow neighbors and where change to magenta.
*   **Example 2:** Input shape (3, 5), Output shape (3, 5)
    *   The code correctly transformed the input. The yellow pixels at (0,1) and (0,3) had white neighbors and where change to magenta.
*   **Example 3:** Input shape (3, 5), Output shape (3, 5)
    *   The code **incorrectly** transformed the input. The yellow pixel at (0,1) had a red and yellow neighbor. The yellow pixel at (0,3) had a green and yellow neighbor. Both were change to magenta.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  example_1:
    input:
      - object_1: "yellow line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    output:
      - object_1: "magenta line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    transformation: "The connected yellow line changes color to magenta"
  example_2:
    input:
      - object_1: "yellow line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    output:
      - object_1: "magenta line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    transformation: "The connected yellow line changes color to magenta"
  example_3:
    input:
      - object_1: "yellow line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    output:
      - object_1: "magenta line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    transformation:  "The connected yellow line changes color to magenta"

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find a horizontal line of connected yellow pixels in the top row of the input grid.
2.  **Transform:** Change the color of *all* pixels in that identified line to magenta.
3.  **Preserve:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

Essentially, if a yellow pixel is part of a horizontal, contiguous line of yellow pixels in the top row, it turns magenta. It doesn't check individual neighbors. It's concerned whether it belongs to a horizontal "line" object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
