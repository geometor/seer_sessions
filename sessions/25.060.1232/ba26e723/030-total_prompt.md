Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program changes every 3rd column where at least one of the cells is yellow (value 4) by prepending a six.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = input_grid.shape[0]
    cols = input_grid.shape[1]
    output_grid = output_grid.tolist()
    # Iterate through columns
    for j in range(cols):
        # Check if it is the third column (index 2, 5, 8, etc.)
      if (j + 1) % 3 == 0:
        #Check every third column for yellows, if so then prepend
        for i in range(rows):
          if input_grid[i][j] == 4:
              output_grid[i][j-1] = 6
              break;

    return np.array(output_grid)
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was based on a limited observation (likely the first training example). It incorrectly assumed that a '6' should be prepended to a column if the *third* column contained a yellow cell. The provided test results across multiple examples reveal a different and more nuanced pattern. It appears to be inserting the 6 before columns that contain a yellow and are adjacent to an all white column.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the column index of the yellow cells, the color, and column index of all adjacent cells, and where and how the '6' is introduced.
2.  **Refine Pattern Recognition:** The core issue is understanding the precise condition under which the '6' is prepended. The initial "every 3rd column" and "at least one yellow" hypotheses are incorrect.
3.  **Iterative Program Adjustment:** Based on the refined pattern, we'll update the natural language program.
4.  **Code Execution Metrics** I will use python to generate reports to confirm observations.

**Code Execution Metrics and Observations:**

To confirm my visual observations, I'm going to define a python function that I will call through `code_execution` to develop metrics reports. This function will:

1.  Take the input and output grids.
2.  Identify columns with yellow cells.
3.  Check the colors of adjacent columns
4. Report the column, the coordinates and colors of the yellow cells and a text description of the colors in adjacent columns.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grids(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    analysis = []

    for j in range(cols):
        for i in range(rows):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Found yellow
                yellow_info = {
                    'column': j,
                    'yellow_coordinates': (i, j),
                    'yellow_color': 4,
                    'left_neighbor': [],
                    'right_neighbor': []
                }

                # Check left neighbor
                if j > 0:
                    for row_index in range(rows):
                      yellow_info['left_neighbor'].append(input_grid[row_index,j-1])
                # Check right neighbor
                if j < cols - 1:
                    for row_index in range(rows):
                        yellow_info['right_neighbor'].append(input_grid[row_index,j+1])

                analysis.append(yellow_info)

    return analysis

```

Now, I will use `code_execution` to call this for each example:

```tool_code
examples = task_data["train"]
reports = []
for example in examples:
    input_grid = example["input"]
    output_grid = example["output"]
    report = analyze_grids(input_grid, output_grid)
    reports.append(report)
print(reports)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
