The primary colors involved are yellow (4), white (0), and magenta (6). The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid by a simple, localized operation. The transformation seems to involve the introduction of the color magenta (6) based on a specific pattern related to the arrangement of yellow (4) and white (0) pixels in the input. It appears that every third column where at least one of the values is yellow will be prepended by a 6.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
