Transforms an input grid by replacing certain yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels based on specific rules related to their position within the grid. Specifically, it targets yellow pixels at the corners of the first and last rows, every other yellow pixel in the first and last row (starting from the second yellow pixel), and the middle yellow pixel of any three consecutive horizontal yellow pixels in the middle row.
