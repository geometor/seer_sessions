The output introduces magenta (6) while retaining yellow and white.\n*   **Pattern:**  There's a clear alternating pattern in the input, both horizontally and vertically. The output seems to disrupt this pattern with the introduction of magenta. The magenta appears at locations corresponding to the corners of 2x2 yellow squares, and is inserted into the corners of 3x3 squares.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Starting from the top-left, view the grid in terms of 3x3 squares, but only place a magenta in the corners, skipping to every other location along the x axis and y axis.\n2.  **Substitute Color:** If a cell at one of these locations is white (0), replace it with magenta (6).\n3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other cells, the non-corner-intersecting white cells (0) and all the original yellow (4), remain unchanged.\n\nIn simpler terms, the rule identifies specific white cells, located at the corners defined by a 3x3 grid, and changes them to magenta. The 3x3 squares don't exist in the input data, but the corners are created using the pattern and shape of the layout of yellow pixels.\n"
