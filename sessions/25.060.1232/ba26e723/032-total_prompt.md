Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program inserts a '6' before columns that contain a yellow pixel and are immediately to the right of an all-white column.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = input_grid.shape[0]
    cols = input_grid.shape[1]
    output_grid = output_grid.tolist()

    # Iterate through columns
    for j in range(cols):
        #Check if the left neightbor column is all white
        if j > 0:
          all_white = True
          for i in range(rows):
            if input_grid[i][j-1] != 0:
              all_white = False
              break
          if all_white:
            # Check this column for yellows, if so then prepend a 6 to this column
            for i in range(rows):
              if input_grid[i][j] == 4:
                  output_grid[i][j] = 6
                  break;

    return np.array(output_grid)
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a limited observation (the first training example). It correctly identified a pattern (inserting a '6' before columns with yellow pixels adjacent to an all-white column) but failed to generalize to other scenarios present in the subsequent training examples. The primary issue is that the code prepends 6 on only the location of yellow pixel, not the whole column. Also the code only check columns, but the rule may apply to rows.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs, focusing on the discrepancies between the `transform` function's output and the expected output.
2.  **Identify missed patterns:** Determine what rules or patterns the initial code *didn't* account for.
3. **Object Properties:** Record the properties of the input/output pairs, including rows, columns, height, width, and colors.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to incorporate the newly discovered rules, making it more comprehensive.
5.  **Prepare for Code Update:** Use insights gathered to create a structured YAML document summarizing object properties, actions, and conditions.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To accurately assess the examples, I need to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `transform` function. I'll use a simple representation to display this:
*   "Correct" if the transformed output matches the expected output.
* "Incorrect" if there's a mismatch

I'll record this in the YAML along with object properties:

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 0
    input_grid_dims: [3, 5]
    output_grid_dims: [3, 5]
    input_colors: [0, 4]
    output_colors: [0, 4, 6]
    transform_result: Incorrect
    verified_rule: "Insert 6 before yellow in columns next to all white columns."

  - example_id: 1
    input_grid_dims: [5, 5]
    output_grid_dims: [5, 5]
    input_colors: [0, 4]
    output_colors: [0, 4, 6]
    transform_result: Incorrect
    verified_rule: "Insert 6 before yellow in columns next to all white columns."

  - example_id: 2
    input_grid_dims: [7, 9]
    output_grid_dims: [7, 9]
    input_colors: [0, 4]
    output_colors: [0, 4, 6]
    transform_result: Incorrect
    verified_rule: "Insert 6 before yellow in columns next to all white columns."
```

**YAML Document (Facts)**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors
      - colors_present: [0 (white), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]
    actions:
      - "Insert: The digit '6' (magenta) is inserted into the grid."
      - "Conditional Placement: The insertion is dependent on the presence of color 4 (yellow) and color 0(white)."

  - pattern: column_adjacency
    properties:
      - "A column containing only color 0 (white) is immediately to the left of a column containing color 4 (yellow)."
    actions:
        - "Insert 6 before a yellow-containing column"

  - pattern: column_transformation
    properties:
      - "all cells of magenta color is prepended to the whole column"
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's the revised natural language program:

1.  **Scan Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid, starting from the second column (index 1).
2.  **Check Left Neighbor:** For each column, check if the column immediately to its left contains *only* white pixels (color 0).
3.  **Check Current Column:** If the left neighboring column is all white, examine the current column.
4.  **Yellow Presence:** If the current column contains at least one yellow pixel (color 4).
5.  **Insert Magenta:** Insert a magenta pixel (6) in every row, before existing pixels on the column being checked.

The program is: *If a column contains a yellow pixel and that column is next to the all-white column on the left, prepend magenta pixels to the whole yellow-containing column.*

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
