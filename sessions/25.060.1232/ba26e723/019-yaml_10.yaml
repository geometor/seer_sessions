    input:
      - object_1: "yellow line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    output:
      - object_1: "magenta line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    transformation: "The connected yellow line changes color to magenta"
  example_2:
    input:
      - object_1: "yellow line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    output:
      - object_1: "magenta line spanning 3 pixels, connected"
      - object_2: "yellow pixels below the line"
    transformation: "The connected yellow line changes color to magenta"
