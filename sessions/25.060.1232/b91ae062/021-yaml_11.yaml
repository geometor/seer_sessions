facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid.
  - object: color_block
    properties:
      - color: Value from 0 to 9, representing a specific color.
      - size: Initially 1x1 in the input.
      - expanded_size: 3x3 in the output.
    actions:
      - expand: Replicates the color into a 3x3 block.
  - relationship: spatial_mapping
    description: |
      The relative positions of color blocks in the input are preserved in the output.
      For each cell (x,y) in the input grid, there is a corresponding 3 x 3 block with starting index (x*3, y*3) in the output grid.
