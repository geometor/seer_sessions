The original grid's colors and their spatial arrangement seem to be the key. Each colored pixel in the input appears to be expanded into a 4x4 block of the same color in the output. The relative positions of the colored blocks are maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is done by multiplying the pixel's row and column indices by the expansion factor (4).\n    *   Fill a 4x4 block in the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner, with the pixel's color.\n\n3.  **Completion:** The output grid is now filled with expanded blocks, representing the transformation of the input grid.\n\nIn essence, the program takes each pixel in the input and \"blows it up\" into a 4x4 square of the same color in the output, maintaining the relative layout.\n"
