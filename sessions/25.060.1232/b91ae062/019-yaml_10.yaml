        - description: Input grid pixels
          properties:
            - color: Value of the pixel (0-9)
            - position: [row, col] within the input grid
        - description: Output grid blocks
          properties:
            - color: Same as the corresponding input pixel
            - dimensions: [3, 3] # constant expansion
            - position: Scaled [row, col] of the corresponding input pixel
    transformation: Each input pixel is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid, replicating the pixel's color.
