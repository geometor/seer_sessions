summary: |
    The input grid's pixels are expanded into 4x4 blocks of the same color in
    the output grid.
examples:
  - id: example_1
    input_grid_shape: [3, 3]
    output_grid_shape: [12, 12]
    input_colors: [black, blue, yellow]
    output_colors: [black, blue, yellow]
    objects:
      - input_pixels: Each pixel in the input grid.
        properties:
          color: Varies (black, blue, yellow).
          position: (row, col) in the input grid.
        actions:
          expand: Replaced by a 4x4 block of the same color in the output grid.
      - output_blocks: 4x4 blocks in the output grid.
        properties:
          color: Same as the corresponding input pixel.
          position: Determined by the input pixel's position, scaled by 4.
