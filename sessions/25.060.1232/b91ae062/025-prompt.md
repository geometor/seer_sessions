Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Input:**  A grid of pixels of varying dimensions.
2.  **Output:** A grid of pixels. The output grid height matches the input grid height. The output grid width is 3 times the input grid width.
3.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Create a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid.
    *   The color of the 3x3 block is the same as the original pixel's color.
    *  The top-left corner of the 3 x 3 block will start in the output grid at the same y index as the input pixel, the x index will be the original x index multiplied by 3.

    # Initialize output_grid.  Height is same as input, width is 3x input.
    input_height = input_grid.shape[0]
    input_width = input_grid.shape[1]
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_height, input_width * 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    for i in range(input_height):
        for j in range(input_width):
            # Get the color of the current pixel.
            color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Create the 3x3 block. The top-left corner's position is crucial.
            for x in range(3):
                output_grid[i, j*3 + x] = color  # Only need to set one row

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
