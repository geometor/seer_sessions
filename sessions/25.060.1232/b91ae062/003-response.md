Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors in the input grid appear to be replicated and expanded in the output grid. The expansion factor seems to be related to the dimensions (doubling both height and width). There's a clear spatial relationship between the input and output pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [6, 7, 0] #magenta, orange, white

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [6, 7, 0] #magenta, orange, white

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: system
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    parameters:
      - factor_x: 2
      - factor_y: 2

relationships:
  - type: spatial_mapping
    description: Each pixel in input_grid maps to a 2x2 block in output_grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Receive a 3x3 input grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the output grid dimensions by multiplying the input grid's width and height by 2. (3x2 = 6, resulting in 6x6).
3.  **Iterate and Expand:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Replicate the pixel's color to form a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    *  The top-left corner of each 2x2 block corresponds to the position where input cell would be at double resolution.
4.  **Output:** Return the resulting 6x6 grid.

In essence, the transformation rule is to double the size of the grid and expand each original pixel into a 2x2 square of the same color.
