actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Each cell in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
    parameters:
      - factor: 3 # Expansion factor

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: The relative positions of colors in the input grid are maintained in the output grid after expansion.
