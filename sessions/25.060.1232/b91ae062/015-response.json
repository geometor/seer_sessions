The smaller grid appears to contain single-digit integers representing colors. The larger grid seems to be an expansion of the smaller grid, where each cell in the original grid is replicated into a 3x3 block of the same color in the larger grid. The spatial relationships between colors/numbers are preserved during this expansion.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
