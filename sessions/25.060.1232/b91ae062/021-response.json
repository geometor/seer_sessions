Each color (represented by a number) in the input seems to be replicated into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output. The relative positions of the colors are maintained. The overall shape changes from 3x3 in the input to 9x9 in the output.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"

For each cell with color 'C' at position (x, y):\n    *   **Expand** the cell into a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n    *   The top-left corner of this 3x3 block will be at position (x\\*3, y\\*3) in the output grid.\n    *   Fill all nine cells of this 3x3 block with the color 'C'.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes each pixel in the input and blows it up into a 3x3 square of the same color in the output, effectively scaling the entire image by a factor of 3 in both dimensions.\n"
