**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors in the input grid seem to be replicated in the output grid, but in a specific pattern. The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, where each original pixel is transformed into a 2x2 block of the same color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3, output grid is 6x6.
  - object: Input pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Defined by integer value (0-9).
      - location: (row, column) in the input grid.
    actions:
      - Replicated into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - relationship: Each input pixel's color maps directly to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
  - observation: The transformation doubles the dimensions of the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  For each input pixel at location (row, column), **create** a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
3.  The 2x2 block's top-left corner will be at position (2\*row, 2\*column) in the output grid.
4.  **Fill** all four pixels within this 2x2 block with the same color as the original input pixel.

Essentially, each pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 square of the same color in the output. The output dimensions are double the input dimensions in both height and width.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
