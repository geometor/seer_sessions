```python
"""
1.  **Copy:** Copy all azure (8) pixels from the input grid to the output grid.
2. **Extend:** For azure pixels in the input grid where a vertical line of 4 green blocks, centered on the azure can be created without going out of bounds or overlapping with other azure blocks, add a vertical line of green (3) pixels centered vertically on the azure pixel, creating a total length of four green pixels. If the azure pixel is too close to the top or bottom edge, OR adjacent vertically or horizontally, then the green extension is not created.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured the core idea of copying azure pixels and extending them with green lines. However, the `can_extend` function and the extension logic itself have some flaws, leading to incorrect green line placement and lengths. The main issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect `can_extend` logic:** The original `can_extend` function was too restrictive. It prevented extensions if azure was adjacent vertically or horizontally.
2.  **Overlapping extensions**: The provided examples do have overlapping extensions
3. **Length Control:** The initial vertical length targeted for the green extensions wasn't completely right (it targeted 4). It appears that the green lines always have a total length of 5.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine `can_extend`:** Modify `can_extend` to focus solely on boundary checks and preventing the placement of a green pixel in a location occupied by *azure*.
2.  **Correct Extension Logic:** Ensure the green extensions center correctly on the azure pixel and achieve a total length of 5.
3.  **Iterative Testing and Adjustment:** After each modification, re-run the code on all training examples to identify any remaining discrepancies.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To analyze effectively, I'll create some helper functions, I will output the example index, the number of azure and green pixels that should be in the output based on my analysis, and compare these to what the code is producing:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, transform_function):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):
        transformed_grid = transform_function(input_grid.copy())
        expected_azure = np.sum(output_grid == 8)
        actual_azure = np.sum(transformed_grid == 8)
        expected_green = np.sum(output_grid == 3)
        actual_green = np.sum(transformed_grid == 3)

        results.append({
            "example": i + 1,
            "expected_azure": expected_azure,
            "actual_azure": actual_azure,
            "expected_green": expected_green,
            "actual_green": actual_green,
            "azure_correct": expected_azure == actual_azure,
            "green_correct": expected_green == actual_green
        })
    return results

# dummy transform and examples for demonstration, will use in subsequent turn
def dummy_transform(input_grid):
    return input_grid

dummy_examples = [
  (np.array([[8,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]), np.array([[8,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]])),
  (np.array([[8,0,0],[0,8,0],[0,0,0]]), np.array([[8,0,0],[0,8,0],[0,0,0]]))
  ]

analysis = analyze_results(dummy_examples, dummy_transform)
print(analysis)
```

```output
[{'example': 1, 'expected_azure': 1, 'actual_azure': 1, 'expected_green': 0, 'actual_green': 0, 'azure_correct': True, 'green_correct': True}, {'example': 2, 'expected_azure': 2, 'actual_azure': 2, 'expected_green': 0, 'actual_green': 0, 'azure_correct': True, 'green_correct': True}]
```

I will use the above function in the next turn using the actual examples.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_pixel
    description: Pixels with color value 8. These are the starting points for the transformation.
    properties:
      color: azure
      value: 8

  - object: green_line
    description: Vertical lines of pixels with color value 3.
    properties:
      color: green
      value: 3
      length: 5
      orientation: vertical
    relationship: "extends from azure_pixel, centered on it"

  - action: copy
    description: Azure pixels from the input are copied to the output.
    source: azure_pixel
    destination: output_grid

  - action: extend
    description:  For each azure pixel, a vertical green line is created, centered on the azure pixel.
    condition: >
      The extension can occur as long as the new green pixels are within the grid bounds
      and don't overwrite existing azure pixels.
    length: 5 (including the central azure pixel)

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Azure Pixels:** Copy all azure (8) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions.

2.  **Extend with Green Lines:** For each azure pixel in the *output* grid:
    *   Create a vertical line of green (3) pixels centered on the azure pixel.
    *   The total length of the green line (including the azure pixel) should be 5.
    *   The extension should only happen if it doesn't go out of the grid's boundaries.
    * If placing a green pixel would overwrite an existing azure, then that green pixel is not placed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
