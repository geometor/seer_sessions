Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Create Green Cross:** For each azure pixel:
    *   Check the four directly adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
    *   If an adjacent cell is not azure (8) or green (3) , and is within the grid bounds, change it to green (3).
3.  **Preserve Azure:** Maintain all existing azure pixels in their original locations, unchanged.
4. **Maintain all Zeros:** The black (0) pixels remain as they are.

In other words, if there is an object composed of connected azure pixels:

1.  Maintain the initial object pixels.
2.  Expand the shape into a '+' cross like shape by adding green to each branch *if there are not any green pixels already there*.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which led to an incomplete understanding of the transformation rule. While the code correctly creates a green cross around *some* azure pixels, it doesn't handle all cases, specifically in more complex scenarios. It appears the presence of white and interacting or overlapping objects is not handled correctly.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, including the failed ones, to identify exactly where the current logic breaks down. Pay close attention to the surrounding context of the azure pixels.
2.  **Object Identification:** Define what constitutes an "object" in this context. It might be a contiguous block of azure pixels, or it could be more nuanced.
3.  **Refine Rule:** Update the natural language program to account for the edge cases and complexities observed in the additional examples. Specifically address the situation where expanding will "collide" with existing features or expand outside boundaries.
4. **Maintain Zeroes:** Explicitly account for maintaining zero pixels in the examples.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations:**

I will use `print()` statements within a refined `transform` function to generate reports about each example. Since I can't directly execute code, I'll describe the intended output of the print statements. I'll focus on training examples 2 and 3.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid, example_index):
    """Transforms the input grid and prints debugging information."""

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    print(f"Example {example_index}: Input Grid\n{input_grid}")

    azure_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)
    print(f"Example {example_index}: Azure Pixel Locations: {azure_pixels}")


    for row, col in azure_pixels:
        print(f"Example {example_index}: Processing Azure Pixel at ({row}, {col})")
        # Check and place green pixel above.
        if row > 0 and output_grid[row-1, col] != 3 and output_grid[row-1, col] != 8:
            print(f"Example {example_index}: ({row}, {col}) - Placing Green Above")
            output_grid[row-1, col] = 3
        # Check and place green pixel below.
        if row < rows - 1 and output_grid[row+1, col] != 3 and output_grid[row+1, col] != 8:
            print(f"Example {example_index}: ({row}, {col}) - Placing Green Below")
            output_grid[row+1, col] = 3
        # Check and place green pixel to the left.
        if col > 0 and output_grid[row, col-1] != 3 and output_grid[row, col-1] != 8:
            print(f"Example {example_index}: ({row}, {col}) - Placing Green Left")
            output_grid[row, col-1] = 3
        # Check and place green pixel to the right.
        if col < cols - 1 and output_grid[row, col+1] != 3 and output_grid[row, col+1] != 8 :
            print(f"Example {example_index}: ({row}, {col}) - Placing Green Right")
            output_grid[row, col+1] = 3

    print(f"Example {example_index}: Output Grid\n{output_grid}")

    return output_grid
```
The print statements intend to show the state of the grid, and decisions made during each step.
The report would look something like this:

```text

[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]

```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml

  input_objects:
    - type: azure_shape
      pixels: [[1,1]]
  output_objects:
    - type: azure_shape
      pixels: [[1,1]]
    - type: green_cross
      center: [1,1]
      arms: [[0,1], [2,1], [1,0], [1,2]]

      arms:  [[0,1], [2,1], [1,0]]
    - type: green_cross
      center: [1,2]
      arms:  [[0,2], [2,2], [1,3]]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  Consider contiguous azure pixels (horizontally or vertically adjacent) as a single object.

2.  **Expand Each Object:** For *each* identified azure object:
    *   Expand by adding a single green pixel to each open side.
    *   An open side exists if the adjacent cell is not azure or green, AND it is within grid bounds.
    * An azure object may contain 1 or more pixels.

3.  **Preserve Azure:** Maintain all existing azure pixels in their original locations, unchanged.

4.  **Maintain Zeros:** The white pixels remain as they are.

This refined natural language program addresses the connected azure pixels as a single object, preventing the overlapping green crosses observed in the initial attempts. It clarifies the expansion rule, adding only *one* layer of green pixels around *each* azure object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
