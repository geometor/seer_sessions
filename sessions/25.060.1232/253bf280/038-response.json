Pixel Values: Each pixel in the output grid has the identical value (0-9) as the corresponding pixel in the input grid, at the same row and column position.\n3.  Colors: The colors represented by the pixel values are therefore also identical and in the exact same locations.\n4. No Operation: No pixels are changed, added, removed, or moved.
