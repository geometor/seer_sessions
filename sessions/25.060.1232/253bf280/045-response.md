Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (12x11). The primary colors involved are black (0), azure (8), and green (3). The azure pixels in the input seem to trigger the appearance of green pixels in the output. The transformation appears to be local, focused around existing azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: train_8
  - input_grid_dimensions: [12, 11]
  - output_grid_dimensions: [12, 11]
  - colors:
      - black: 0
      - azure: 8
      - green: 3
  - objects:
      - name: azure_pixel
        color: azure
        input_locations: [[1, 3], [4, 6], [4, 10], [5, 1], [9, 3]]
      - name: green_pixel
        color: green
        output_locations:  [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3], [7, 3], [8, 3], [4,7], [4,8], [4,9]]
  - relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Green pixels appear adjacent to azure pixels in the output.
      - type: transformation
        description: Azure pixels seem to be a catalyst for the creation of Green Pixels.
      - type: shape
        description: A connected set of azure pixels forms a shape. The addition of the green pixels expands the object into a '+' cross like shape.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Create Green Cross:** For each azure pixel:
    *   If there is not a green pixel directly above the azure, place green pixel in the grid location directly above it.
    *   Repeat for the locations: below, to the left and to the right.
3.  **Preserve Azure:** Maintain all existing azure pixels in their original locations, unchanged.
4. **Maintain all Zeros:** The black (0) pixels remain as they are.

In other words if there is an object composed of connected azure pixels:

1.  Maintain the initial object pixels.
2.  Expand the shape into a '+' cross like shape by adding green to each branch.
