The input grid contains a few '8's (azure) on a background of '0's (white). The output grid retains the '8's in their original positions and introduces '3's (green) between the '8's horizontally.  The transformation appears to be limited to the rows containing the '8's.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

All values outside these indices should be copied over (in this case 0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation connects the azure ('8') pixels in each row with a horizontal line of green ('3') pixels, leaving the other areas unchanged.\n"
