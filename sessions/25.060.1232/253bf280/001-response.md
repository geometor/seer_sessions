Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are:

*   **Grids:** 2D arrays of varying dimensions.
*   **Pixels:** Individual cells within the grids, represented by integer values (0-9).
*   **Colors:** Integers are visualized with colors, 0 is white, 3 is green, 8 is azure.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. In this case, the azure (8) pixels appear to be the primary objects.
*   **Transformations:** The azure objects seem to be either generating green (3) lines extending from them, or sometimes remaining unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    type: primary

  - name: green_pixel
    color: green (3)
    type: generated

actions:
  - name: extend
    agent: azure_pixel
    target: adjacent_cells
    result: create green_pixel

conditions:
    - if: azure_pixels form continuous horizontal or vertical lines
      then: extend green pixels between them, creating a filled line.
      else:
        do not change

relations:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [azure_pixel, green_pixel]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Analyze Azure Pixel Arrangement**: Determine if there are two or more azure pixels and whether they are arranged either in a straight horizontal or vertical line in the output.
3.  **Conditional Extension:**
    *   If the azure pixels exist in a horizontal or vertical line, fill the space between the azure colored pixels, inclusive of the columns/rows of the edge azure pixels, with green (3) pixels, maintaining the original azure pixel positions. If they cross (both exist in horizontal and vertical, fill both).
    *   If azure pixels are not aligned, or only one azure pixel, keep the output the same as the input.

The core concept is that azure pixels, when aligned, "bridge" or "connect" by filling the intervening space with green pixels. If not aligned or if there is only one, there are no changes.
