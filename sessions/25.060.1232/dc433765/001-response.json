The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), yellow (4), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve shifting the positions of the non-zero colored pixels within the grid, while keeping the zeros in their original relative positions. The dimensions of the input and output grids remain the same. The key aspect seems to be the relative positioning of colored pixels with respect to each other and to the grid edges, with colored cells moving downwards and the white cells (0) remaining relatively static.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, if a zero is above, below, left, or right of another zero in the input, this relative positioning should exist in the output.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves moving the colored pixels (3 and 4) to the middle row of the grid, maintaining their relative horizontal positions, and ensuring that the size of the matrix does not change. The cells with the 0 value do not appear to be directly part of the logic for moving the non-zero cells, but they do remain in place relative to each other.\n"
