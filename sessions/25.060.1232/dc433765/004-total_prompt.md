**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE4233088D0>

**output:**
```

0 3 0
0 0 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the first example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 3x3 grids. Each cell contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The colors present are green (3), yellow (4), and white (0).  The positions of the colored cells change between the input and output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        values: [0, 3, 4]  # Representing colors white, green, and yellow

  - type: object
    color: green
    initial_position: [0, 0] # top-left
    final_position: [1, 1]  # center

  - type: object
    color: yellow
    initial_position: [2, 2] # bottom-right
    final_position: [2, 2]  # bottom-right, no movement

actions:
  - type: move
    object: green object
    from: [0,0]
    to: [1, 1]

  - type: stay
    object: yellow object
    position: [2,2]

relationships:
    - object1: green object
      object2: yellow object
      relation: "no interaction"
    - object1: grid
      object2: cells
      relation: contains

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify colored objects:** Find all cells that are not white (0). In this case, a green cell (3) and a yellow cell (4).
2.  **Move the green object**: The green object (3) located at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the input grid moves to the center (1, 1) of the output grid.
3.  **Keep the yellow object at same position:** The yellow object (4) remains in its original position at the bottom-right (2, 2).
4. **Fill empty with white:** The remaining cells are white (0) in both the input and the output.

In essence, the transformation involves moving the green object to the center and leaving the yellow object in place. All other positions are filled with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
