*   **Actual Output:** (Matches Expected)
*   **Observation:** No rows are removed. There is a row of zeros *below* the green pixel.

**Revised Hypothesis and Key Insight**

After careful review, it's clear that the presence of the green pixel (3) is indeed the trigger, but the critical factor for removing a row is whether the green pixel is *adjacent* (immediately above or below) to an *entire* row of zeros. Critically, if the green pixel has two all zero rows, one above *and* one below, only the upper row is removed (example 1). If there is *no* row of zeros adjacent to the green pixel, or only non-zero rows, no change occurs.
