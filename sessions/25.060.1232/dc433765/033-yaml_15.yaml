facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 11x11.
  - observation: Most pixels are 0 (white).
  - observation: Input grid contains a green pixel (value 3) and a yellow pixel (value 4).
  - observation: The output grid contains the same green (3) and yellow (4) pixel, at the same X coordinates
  - observation: The y coordinates of the green and yellow pixels are the same in the input and output grids
  - observation: output grid is identical to the input grid, except the all-zero row above the green pixel has been deleted
  - relationship: the row directly above the green pixel in the input becomes the location for green in the output
