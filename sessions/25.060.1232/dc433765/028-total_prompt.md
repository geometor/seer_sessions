Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   Most of the grid cells are '0' (white).
*   The input grid contains two non-zero colored pixels: '4' (yellow) and '3' (green).
*   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except the '3' (green) pixel has moved up one row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: pixel_4
    type: pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: [2, 2]
    final_position: [2, 2]
  - id: pixel_3
    type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    initial_position: [7, 2]
    final_position: [6, 2]

actions:
  - type: move
    object: pixel_3
    direction: up
    magnitude: 1 row

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixel_4 and pixel_3 are in the same column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each non-zero pixel:
    a. If the pixel is green (3), move it one row up.
    b. All the other pixels remain in the initial position
3.  Construct the output grid with the updated pixel positions.

In simpler, more specific, terms for this particular task and this particular example:

1. Find the green pixel.
2. Move the green pixel up by one row.
3. Keep every other pixel the same.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
