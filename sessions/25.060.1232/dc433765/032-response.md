1.  **Identify the Green Pixel:** Locate the single green pixel (color value 3) within the input grid.

2.  **Check Boundary and Color Above**: If the green pixel has a pixel above and the color above is azure (8), proceed.

3.  **Move and Replace:** If the conditions in step 2 are met:
    *   Move the green pixel up by one row.
    *   Fill the green pixel's *original* location with azure (8, the color of the pixel that *was* directly above it).

4.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels remain unchanged in color and position.

5.  **Edge Case:** If the green pixel does not have a pixel above or the color of any pixel above it is not azure, the green pixel does not move.
