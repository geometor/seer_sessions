Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expands a single-row input grid into a multi-row output grid. The leftmost region of the input, defined by a contiguous sequence of identical colored pixels, is extended downwards, creating a rectangular area of the same color. The remaining cells on the right, starting from where the color changes in the input, are filled with white (0), keeping the output width consistent with the input width. The height of the output grid is equal to the number of pixels of the initial color in the input row.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extending a region of the same color downwards. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a flaw in this approach: it only works correctly when the input grid is a single row, and the fill region extends down. The core issue is that my initial assumption was too narrow, focusing on a vertical expansion of the leftmost color. I need a program to handle cases with multiple rows and non-vertical expansion.

My strategy will be as follows:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine each input-output pair carefully, paying attention to the initial color, the shape of the colored region, and how it's "extended" or "filled."
2.  **Identify the core rule:** Determine the general principle that governs the transformation, which goes beyond simple vertical expansion.
3.  **Gather Metrics:** I will collect the height, width and initial color of each input.
4.  **Refine the natural language program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the generalized rule.
5.  **Prepare for the next phase (coding):** make sure the descriptions is clear and detailed enough to guide the development of correct Python code.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here, I will analyze each example, calculate the metrics and comment:

**Example 1**
```
Input:
[[4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[4. 4. 4. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [4. 4. 4. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [4. 4. 4. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```
- Input Height: 1
- Input Width: 9
- Initial color: 4
- Observation: The program worked as it should.

**Example 2**
```
Input:
[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8.]
 [8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8.]
 [8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8.]]
```
- Input Height: 3
- Input Width: 9
- Initial color: 8
- Observation: The color in the top-left corner of the input (8) expands to fill an area equal to the length of the contiguous block of that color (9 = the width).

**Example 3**
```
Input:
[[2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```
- Input Height: 3
- Input Width: 9
- Initial color: 2
- Observation: Similar to Example 2, the top-left color (2) expands.

**Example 4**
```
Input:
[[6 6 6 0 0]
 [6 6 6 0 0]
 [6 6 6 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[6. 6. 6. 0. 0.]
 [6. 6. 6. 0. 0.]
 [6. 6. 6. 0. 0.]]
```
- Input Height: 5
- Input Width: 5
- Initial color: 6
- Observation: Again, the initial color (6) expands.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- task: expansion
- objects:
    - name: input_grid
      type: grid
      properties:
        - initial_color: varies # Color of the top-left pixel
        - height: varies # Number of rows
        - width: varies  # Number of columns
    - name: output_grid
      type: grid
      properties:
        - height: same as the length of the contiguous block in input
        - width: same as input_grid width

- actions:
  - description: The color of the top-left pixel of the input grid is expanded.
  - details: |
        The contiguous block of pixels with the same color as the top-left pixel determines the height,
        and the input grid width determines the width. The height of the contiguous block will be the
        number of pixels in the first group of pixels of the same color starting from the top-left.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Initial Color and Contiguous Block:** Determine the color of the pixel in the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid. Find the length of the contiguous block of pixels of this initial color, starting from the top-left corner and moving horizontally.

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same width as the input grid. The height of the output grid is equal to the length of the contiguous block of the initial color identified in step 1.

3.  **Fill the Output Grid:** Create a rectangular region in the output grid. The dimensions are determined in Step 2. Fill this region with the initial color.

4. **Fill the rest** Fill the remaining cells to the right of the rectangular with 0.

In summary, the transformation rule identifies the color of the top-left pixel and extends a rectangle of the same color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
