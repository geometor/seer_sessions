Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies the first non-zero element in the input grid and replicates it downwards and to the right, forming a triangular pattern. The height of the output grid and the number of replications in each row are determined by the number of rows of the triangle, in the example, 4. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.

import numpy as np

def get_first_nonzero(grid):
    # return first non zero element of grid
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved replicating the first non-zero element in a triangular pattern. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this pattern is not consistent. The strategy to handle these inconsistencies should involve these main principles:

1.  **Identify a More General Rule:** We need to move beyond the simple triangular replication and find a rule that explains all the training examples. We need to account for the fact that the size of the output is a function of the input.
2.  **Object Recognition:** We need to better define what constitutes an "object" in each example. This might involve looking at contiguous regions of the same color, lines, or other shapes.
3.  **Positional Relationships:** We need to analyze the spatial relationship between the identified objects in the input and the output.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The updated natural language program will likely require more conditional logic to handle different cases.

**Example and Result Metrics**

To accurately assess the results, let's define some useful metrics and functions using a code block. I want to inspect the inputs and outputs and look for patterns.

```python
import numpy as np

def grid_diff(grid1, grid2):
    """Show differences between two grids"""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Different shapes"
    return grid1 - grid2

def analyze_examples(task):
    """Analyze training examples, calculate metrics, and compare outputs."""
    results = []
    for example in task["train"]:
        input_grid = np.array(example["input"])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example["output"])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Assuming 'transform' is defined
        diff_grid = grid_diff(expected_output_grid,predicted_output_grid)

        example_data = {
            "input_shape": input_grid.shape,
            "output_shape": expected_output_grid.shape,
            "predicted_shape": predicted_output_grid.shape,
            "first_nonzero": get_first_nonzero(input_grid),
            "diff": diff_grid.tolist() if isinstance(diff_grid, np.ndarray) else diff_grid,
            "output_eq": np.array_equal(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid)
        }
        results.append(example_data)
    return results

# Example task data (replace with actual task data)
task = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]],

        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3]],
        },
    ]
}

analysis_results = analyze_examples(task)
for i, result in enumerate(analysis_results):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input shape: {result['input_shape']}")
    print(f"  Output shape: {result['output_shape']}")
    print(f"  Predicted shape: {result['predicted_shape']}")
    print(f"  First nonzero: {result['first_nonzero']}")
    print(f"  Output Matches Expected: {result['output_eq']}")
    print(f"  Differences: {result['diff']}")

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Seed:** Find the first non-zero pixel in the input grid. This pixel's color will be the "seed" color.

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The height of the output grid is equal to the number of rows in the input grid.
    *   The width of the triangle at its base is equal to the row number of the seed pixel plus one (using zero based numbering)

3.  **Construct the Triangle:**
    *   Create an output grid filled with zeros, with the dimensions determined in step 2.
    *   Starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid, replicate the seed color downwards and to the right to form a triangle.
    *   The triangle expands by one cell in width for each row down.
    *   The number of rows in the triangle equals the row index of the seed pixel in the input grid + 1.

4.  **Fill Remainder:** The remaining cells of the output grid remain filled with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
