facts:
  - object: blue_region
    description: The contiguous region of blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      shape: variable (rectangle, single pixel)
      size: variable
      position: variable
  - transformation:
    type: reshape
    description: The blue region is reshaped into a square.
    details:
      - The number of blue pixels in the input is maintained in the output.
      - The blue region is reshaped, with its height and width becoming equal.
      - If the input blue shape has height h and width w, the output has height and width equal to sqrt(h*w) rounded up.
      - The y-position of the top of the output shape is the same as the y position of the top of the input.
