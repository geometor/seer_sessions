Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expands a single-row input grid into a multi-row output grid. The gray (5) region on the left side of the input is extended downwards, creating a rectangular gray area. The remaining cells on the right are filled with white (0), keeping output width consistent.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms a single-row input grid into a multi-row output grid.
    
    Args:
        input_grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.
    
    Returns:
        A numpy array representing the output grid.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same width as the input and a height of 5.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Find the boundary between gray and white pixels.
    boundary = 0

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding a single-row input into a multi-row output, extending a gray region and filling the rest with white. While this worked for the first example, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The height of the output doesn't seem to be fixed at 5, and the color of the expanded region isn't always gray. The core concept of identifying a region and expanding it is valid, but the specifics need adjustment. The existing code *does* correctly model the width of the input grid.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to examine each input/output pair, recording the dimensions, colors used, and the apparent boundary between regions.
2.  **Identify Objects and Properties:** Create a YAML block summarizing key observations. Look for objects and relationships.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the collected data, develop a more accurate and general description of the transformation rule. It is likely that height and fill color are the primary misses.

**Gather Metrics**

I'll use `code_execution` to get precise information about the input and output grids of each example. I will examine each input and output of the training set provided, comparing what was provided with the result from running the code.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = output_grid.shape
    predicted_height, predicted_width = predicted_grid.shape

    # Find the initial color in the input
    initial_color = input_grid[0, 0]

    # Determine the fill color
    fill_color = initial_color

    boundary = 0
    for x in range(input_width):
        if input_grid[0, x] != fill_color:
            break
        boundary += 1

    print(f"  Input: {input_height}x{input_width}, Output: {output_height}x{output_width}, Predicted: {predicted_height}x{predicted_width}, Fill Color: {fill_color}, Boundary: {boundary}")

    match = np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid)
    print(f"{'Matches Expected Output' if match else 'ERROR: Does Not Match Expected Output'}")

def examine_all(task):
    for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_grid = transform(input_grid)
        print(f"Example {i+1}:")
        analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid)
        print("---")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
