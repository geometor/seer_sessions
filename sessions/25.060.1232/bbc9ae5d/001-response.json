The input grids are single-row grids with varying lengths, containing numerical digits (0-9). Each digit represents a color. The output grids have the same number of columns as their corresponding input grids but have a variable number of rows that appear to be derived from the input data and a specific pattern. The non-zero digits in the input seem to expand downwards, creating a triangular shape filled with the same digit. The '0' digits remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
