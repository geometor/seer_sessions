  - description: The color of the top-left pixel of the input grid is expanded.
  - details: |
        The contiguous block of pixels with the same color as the top-left pixel determines the height,
        and the input grid width determines the width. The height of the contiguous block will be the
        number of pixels in the first group of pixels of the same color starting from the top-left.
