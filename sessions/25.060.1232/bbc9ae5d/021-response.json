The input grid consists of a sequence of colored pixels: four azure (8) pixels followed by two white (0) pixels. The output grid expands on this. The azure pixels appear to be replicated downwards, while the white pixels have a more complex behavior, with a mixture of replication and adding additional azure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
