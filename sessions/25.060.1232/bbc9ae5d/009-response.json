The input grid contains a sequence of numbers, predominantly 0 (white), with a single non-zero digit 2 (red) at the beginning. The output grid expands vertically, replicating the initial '2' (red) in a specific pattern, forming a triangular shape, while the 0 (white) remain unchanged. The key transformation seems to be related to replicating and positioning the non-zero element, forming a growing sequence of 2s downwards. The height of the output grid is equal to the number of 2s in the first column.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, the height will be four, determined by some unspecified mechanism.\n3.  **Create output grid**: Generate a new grid where the height is as identified on step 2.\n4.  **Replicate non-zero element:** The first element of each row in output starts with first element of input. For the first row, place single non-zero at top-left position. The next row will replicate twice, and the next, and so on.\n5. **Fill remaining cells**: All cells right of the replicated elements retain their original values from the input grid (which are all '0' in this example).\n\nEssentially, the rule takes the first element of input, and extends a triangle of these values downwards with increasing length.\n"
