            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved replicating and reflecting a single row. However, the other training examples reveal that the transformation applies to *multiple* rows, not just the first one. The core concept of replication and circular-shifted reflection seems correct, but the code needs to iterate over all rows in the input grid. The strategy, therefore, is to modify the program and code to operate on each row of the input grid independently.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the examples, the code's output, and my observations. I'll use a simplified representation of the grids for brevity.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: `[4]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[4, 4, 4]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[4, 4, 4]`\n    *   Observation: The initial case works as designed.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 4], [3, 4], [4, 3]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`\n    *Observation: The code only processes the first row and doesn't replicate for other rows in the grid.\n\n*    **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    Input: `[[5, 1, 8], [7, 8, 5]]`\n    Expected: `[[5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 8], [8, 5, 1], [7, 8, 5], [7, 8, 5], [5, 7, 8]]`\n    Actual Output: `[[5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 8], [8, 5, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n     *Observation: Same issue. Only transforms the first row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: row_wise_transformation\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    attributes:\n      rows: multiple\n      columns: variable\n      elements: colors (integers 0-9)\nactions:\n  - name: replicate_row\n    description: Duplicate each row.\n  - name: reflect_and_shift\n    description: >\n      Create a mirrored copy of each row with a circular right shift of colors.\nrules:\n    - Each row in the input is processed independently.\n    - For each row:\n        1. Duplicate it immediately below.\n        2. Create another row, mirroring the input, but shift each pixel's value.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate:** For each row in the input grid:\n2.  **Replicate:** Copy the entire row to create a new, identical row directly below the original.\n3.  **Reflect/Mirror with Shift:** Create a third row by reflecting/mirroring the original row. During the reflection, shift the color values of each pixel one position to the *right*, within that row. If a color would shift \"off the end\" of the row, wrap it around to the beginning of that same row.\n4.  Place replicated and transformed rows directly below one another.\n\nIn essence, the original program was correct in its core logic of replication and shifted reflection but was incomplete as it only applied to a single row. This revised program explicitly states the row-wise iteration needed for grids with multiple rows.\n"
