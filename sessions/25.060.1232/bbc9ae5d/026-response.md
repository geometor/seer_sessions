1.  **Iterate:** For each row in the input grid:
2.  **Replicate:** Copy the entire row to create a new, identical row directly below the original.
3.  **Reflect/Mirror with Shift:** Create a third row by reflecting/mirroring the original row. During the reflection, shift the color values of each pixel one position to the *right*, within that row. If a color would shift "off the end" of the row, wrap it around to the beginning of that same row.
4.  Place replicated and transformed rows directly below one another.
