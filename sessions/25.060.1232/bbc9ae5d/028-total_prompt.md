**input:**
```
7 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x64 at 0x7CE41B94EFD0>

**output:**
```
7 0 0 0 0 0
7 7 0 0 0 0
7 7 7 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the perceived transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A single-row grid (1x6) with numerical values representing colors. The first cell is orange (7), and the rest are white (0).
*   **Output:** A three-row grid (3x6) where the first column is entirely orange (7). The second and third columns, are copied from the first column in the input. The rest are white (0).
*	**Transformation**: The height is increased. The color is filled down.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      cells:
        - value: int # 0-9 representing color
          color: string # color name

  - type: column
    properties:
        index: int

actions:
  - name: extend_height
    parameters:
      new_height: int
  - name: fill_color
    parameters:
      source_column: int
      target_column: int
      color: int

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: columns are adjacent

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extend Height:** The input grid's height (number of rows) is increased to 3.
2.  **Copy first column:** The first column from the input grid is examined.
3.  **Fill color down:** The color of each value in the first column of the input grid, is copied to the output grid, stacked vertically by the new height of the grid.
4.  **Remainder of grid:** The rest of the grid, columns 2-6, remain 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
