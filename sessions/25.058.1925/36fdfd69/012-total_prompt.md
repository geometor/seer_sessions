Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each identified red pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right - not diagonally).
3. **Conditional Modification (Specifically Replacing with Yellow):**
    *   If a red pixel is adjacent to a white (0) pixel, change the red pixel to yellow (4).
    *   If a red pixel is not adjacent to any white pixels, it remains red.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved changing red pixels to yellow if they were adjacent to white pixels. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more complex rule. It appears that the presence of *any* adjacent color besides red itself can trigger the change from red to yellow. The current logic only accounts for white. Therefore, my strategy is to:

1.  Verify this new hypothesis by carefully examining all training examples and their results.
2.  Modify the natural language program to accurately reflect this broader adjacency rule.
3. Update the fact and prepare an effective NL program

**Metrics and Observations:**

To gain better insights, I need to analyze exactly which pixels changed and what their surrounding colors were.

Here's a summary of the provided inputs and results:

*   **Example 1:** (Correct) The code correctly changed the red pixels adjacent to white to yellow.
*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect) The code did not change any red pixels to yellow, all the red connected and only to other red pixels.
*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect) The code didn't change the red pixels adjacent to blue, only changed the single red pixel to yellow.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      - shape: variable dimensions
      - pixel_values: integers from 0 to 9, corresponding to colors

  - name: red_pixel
    description: A pixel with the value 2 (red).
    properties:
      - adjacent_pixels: A list of pixels directly above, below, left, or right of the red pixel.
      - changes_to: yellow (conditionally)

actions:
  - name: check_adjacency
    description: Examine the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of a red pixel.
  - name: conditional_change
    description: Change a red pixel to yellow if it's adjacent to any pixel other than itself.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Inspect Neighbors:** For each red pixel, examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right, *not* diagonally).
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a red pixel has any neighbor that is *not* red (2), change the red pixel to yellow (4). Otherwise, if all neighbors of red pixel are only red color, the red pixel remains unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
