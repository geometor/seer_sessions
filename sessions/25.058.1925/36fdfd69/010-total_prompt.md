Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output grids consist of pixels with integer values representing different colors. The primary colors observed are azure (8), white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The grids are 15x16 (height x width). The most prominent change appears to be the introduction or modification of yellow (4) pixels in areas where red (2) pixels exist.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    property: background

  - id: white_pixels
    color: white (0)
    property: background

  - id: red_pixels
    color: red (2)
    property: foreground, target_of_change

  - id: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    property: foreground, introduced_or_modified

actions:
  - name: modify_red_pixels
    type: color_change
    input: red_pixels
    output: yellow_or_red_pixels #some stay the same, other are changed to yellow
    condition: adjacent_to_white

relationships:
  - subject: red_pixels
    relation: adjacent_to
    object: white_pixels
    property: triggers_color_change #some red are not changed

  - subject: yellow_pixels
    relation: adjacent_or_replaces
    object: red_pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each identified red pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right - not diagonally).
3. **Conditional Modification (Specifically Replacing with Yellow):**
    *   If a red pixel is adjacent to a white (0) pixel, change some of these red pixel to yellow (4). Some of the red pixels do not get changed.
    *   If a red pixel is not adjacent to any white pixels, it remains red.

Key Observations and Uncertainties:
* It's clear which red pixels become yellow, and which ones stay red. Those diagonally adjacent to white stay red. Those directly adjacent to white become yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
