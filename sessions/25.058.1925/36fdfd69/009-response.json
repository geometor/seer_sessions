The primary colors observed are azure (8), white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The grids are 15x16 (height x width). The most prominent change appears to be the introduction or modification of yellow (4) pixels in areas where red (2) pixels exist.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Some of the red pixels do not get changed.\n    *   If a red pixel is not adjacent to any white pixels, it remains red.\n\nKey Observations and Uncertainties:\n* It's clear which red pixels become yellow, and which ones stay red. Those diagonally adjacent to white stay red. Those directly adjacent to white become yellow.\n"
