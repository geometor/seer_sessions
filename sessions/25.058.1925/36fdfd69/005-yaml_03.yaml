examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: single pixel
        neighbors: [white, white, white, red]
      - color: red
        shape: single pixel
    action: blue pixel changes to yellow if it has a red neighbor.
    result: correct

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: multiple pixels, various locations
        notes: Some are adjacent to red, some are not.
      - color: red
        shape: multiple pixels, various locations
        notes: Some are adjacent to blue, some are not.
    action: Only *some* blue pixels adjacent to red should turn yellow, the provided code is over-applying the rule.
    result: incorrect

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: multiple pixels, various locations and arrangements.
      - color: red
        shape: multiple pixels, various locations.
    action: Selective transformation of blue pixels adjacent to red pixels to yellow. The provided code is applying the transformation to all blue pixels and is too broad.
    result: incorrect
