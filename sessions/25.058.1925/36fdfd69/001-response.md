Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perceiving the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of numbers, representing colors.
*   **Colors:**  Multiple colors are present, and their arrangement seems key. The colors are consistent between input and output, just potentially with changed locations or values of specific pixels.
*   **Shapes/Objects:** Within the grids, contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. These objects appear to be undergoing some kind of transformation.
*   **Change in color of isolated color blocks** the isolated blocks of color in the input change to a different color, perhaps based on a fixed mapping or a relationship between color values

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous block of pixels with the same color
      - size: number of pixels in the block
      - location: (row, column) coordinates of pixels

actions:
  - type: color_change
    properties:
        input_color: integer (0-9)
        output_color: integer (0-9)
        affected_objects: Isolated Color Blocks

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      properties:
        - adjacency: pixels sharing an edge or corner
        - containment: one object within another

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Isolated Color Blocks:** Iterate through the input grid and identify "isolated color blocks." An isolated color block is a contiguous region of pixels of the same color that is *not* adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any other pixel of the same color.
2.  **Change the color:** For each isolated color block identified in step 1, change the color of the single unit color block.
    The mapping is:
        - 1 -> 1
        - 2 -> 2
        - 3 -> 3
        - 8 -> 8
    And
        - 1 -> 1 if adjacent to a block being colored
        - 2 -> 2 if adjacent to a block being colored
        - 3 -> 3 if adjacent to a block being colored
        - 8 -> 8 if adjacent to a block being colored
    Otherwise:
        - 1 -> 1
        - 2 -> 4
        - 3 -> 4
        - 8 -> 4

3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are *not* part of an isolated color block retain their original color in the output grid.

In short - find connected components/regions of color, replace the color of any such color regions of size 1 of color 2, 3 or 8 to 4.
