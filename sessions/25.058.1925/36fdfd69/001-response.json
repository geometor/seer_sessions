The colors are consistent between input and output, just potentially with changed locations or values of specific pixels.\n*   **Shapes/Objects:** Within the grids, contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. These objects appear to be undergoing some kind of transformation.\n*   **Change in color of isolated color blocks** the isolated blocks of color in the input change to a different color, perhaps based on a fixed mapping or a relationship between color values\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
