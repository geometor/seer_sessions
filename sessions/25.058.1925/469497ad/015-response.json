There are distinct regions of different colors in both. The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid, with added rows and columns. The central blue (1) region in the input is significantly enlarged in the output, and it maintains a square shape. A new color, gray(represented by '2') frames the other regions. The maroon(9), green(3), and yellow(4) areas also maintains the shape, but they are not expanded, and placed on the border of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Expand this region by a factor of 4, creating an 8x8 blue square centered within the output grid.\n3.  **Corner Region Placement**: Identify the non-white and non-blue regions (Maroon, green, yellow) in the original grid and their corner location. Replicate this to the corresponding corner, but placed them by replacing the background at the corner in the output.\n4. **Frame Creation**: Create a gray(2) region as frame. The gray region is located on the entire border of the grid except the corner where other colors are. Also, add some small gray region adjacent to other color except blue.\n\n"
