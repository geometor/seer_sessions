Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand the Grid:** Create a new grid that is three times the width and three times the height of the original grid, plus one extra column.
2.  **Fill with Zeros:** Initially, fill the entire expanded grid with zeros (white).
3.  **Replicate Input Colors:** Tile the input grid three times across and three times down in the expanded grid.
4.  **Add Red Column:** Add a column of red (2) pixels at the rightmost edge of the expanded grid. The height of the red column is determined by three times the height of the *input* grid. The red column starts on the first row.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
