Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, where each digit represents a color. There are distinct regions of different colors in both. The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid, with added rows and columns. The central blue (1) region in the input is significantly enlarged in the output, and it maintains a square shape. A new color, gray(represented by '2') frames the other regions. The maroon(9), green(3), and yellow(4) areas also maintains the shape, but they are not expanded, and placed on the border of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - colors: [0, 1, 3, 9, 4] # white, blue, green, maroon, yellow
      - central_region:
          color: 1 # Blue
          shape: square
          size: 2x2

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 20x20
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4] # white, blue, gray, green, maroon, yellow.
      - central_region:
          color: 1 # Blue
          shape: square
          size: 8x8
      - frame_region:
        color: 2 #Gray
        location: perimeter except bottom right corner and some area on border
      - maroon_region:
        color: 9
        location: left and bottom left
      - green_region:
        color: 3
        location: right and bottom
      - yellow_region:
        color: 4
        location: bottom right corner

  - action: expand
    description: The blue central square region in the input is enlarged in the output.
    parameters:
       factor: approximately 4x (from 2x2 to 8x8)

  - action: border_placement
    description: Place colored regions from input on the corresponding positions on the borders.
    parameters: {}

  - action: frame
    description: Gray region frames other colors.
    parameters: {}

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 20x20 output grid filled with white (0).
2.  **Central Region Expansion:** Identify the central blue (1) square region in the input grid. Expand this region by a factor of 4, creating an 8x8 blue square centered within the output grid.
3.  **Corner Region Placement**: Identify the non-white and non-blue regions (Maroon, green, yellow) in the original grid and their corner location. Replicate this to the corresponding corner, but placed them by replacing the background at the corner in the output.
4. **Frame Creation**: Create a gray(2) region as frame. The gray region is located on the entire border of the grid except the corner where other colors are. Also, add some small gray region adjacent to other color except blue.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
