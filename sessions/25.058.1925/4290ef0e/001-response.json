There are distinct regions/objects of different colors within each input grid. These objects seem to be enclosed by pixels of a different, uniform color.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid, also containing colored pixels. It appears to be a condensed or \"zoomed-out\" representation of the input, focusing on the distinct colored regions and their relative positions, while ignoring much of the background/enclosing color.\n*   **Transformation:** The process appears to identify distinct, enclosed regions/objects of color within the input. It extracts a representative shape of each distinct regions, placing them in the output grid while maintaining relative positioning. The background (enclosing color) is significantly reduced.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
