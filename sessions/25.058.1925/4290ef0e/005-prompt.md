Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Regions:** In the input grid, identify the distinct colored regions: the blue (1) squares, the green (3) cluster, the magenta (6) shapes, and the yellow background (4).

2.  **Create a Smaller Grid:** the output grid size can be pre-determined by the maximum extend of the non yellow regions.

3. **Magenta (6) Border:** create a border around the new, smaller grid using magenta color (6).

4.  **Inner Content:** Fill the area within the magenta border, from outermost to the middle:

    *   Copy to the new grid the blue squares, maintaining the count and general shape.
    *   Copy any green cluster preserving color and relative spatial relationships.
    *   The background is yellow (4).

In summary: Create an output grid of size pre-determined and where the non-yellow regions fit, frame it with a magenta border, copy the blue square shape, copy the green cluster, and the remaining areas are yellow.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
