Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying colored objects, doubling the grid
dimensions, and then replicating each object four times, arranging them in a
2x2 grid within the output grid. Each replicated object takes original grid
size.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_objects(grid):
    """
    Identifies contiguous regions of non-zero colors as objects.

    Args:
        grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are colors and values are lists of (row, col)
        tuples representing the object's pixels.  This implementation treats
        each pixel as its own object for this specific task.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
