Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training set results, and the task description to refine our understanding and improve the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to expand each non-white pixel into a 4x4 square. However, the description states that the expansion should be into a 2x2, not 4x4 square. Also the generated code doesn't handle white pixels in way described. The test results highlight discrepancies between the expected outputs and the outputs produced by the code. The core issue seems to be an incorrect scaling factor (4x4 instead of 2x2) and perhaps a misunderstanding of which pixels should be upscaled.

My strategy will be as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** I will examine each input-output pair to determine the accurate transformation.
2.  **Object Identification:** I'll define what constitutes an "object" in the context of each example, based on the ARC priors (contiguous blocks of the same color).
3. **Fact Documentation (YAML):** I'll create YAML structured data that lists observations of the objects and actions, including colors, shapes, positions, and transformations.
4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the metrics and facts, I'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.

**Gather Metrics & Results Review**

Since I can't directly execute code here, I'll meticulously describe what *would* be the output of code execution if I could run it, and compare that to the provided "Output" grids. I'll assume the provided `transform` function is the one being executed.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input: 3x3 grid with a single blue pixel in the center.
    *   Expected Output: 6x6 grid with a 2x2 blue square in the center.
    *   Actual (Simulated) Output: 6 x 6 grid with a 4x4 block in the center.
    *   *Observation*: Upscaling is happening, but the scale factor is incorrect (4x4, not 2x2).

*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input: 5x5 grid with a few scattered colored pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 10x10 grid where each colored pixel becomes a 2x2 block.
    *    Actual (Simulated) Output: 10x10 where each colored pixel became a 4x4 block.
    *   *Observation*: Consistent incorrect upscaling (4x4 instead of 2x2).

*   **Example 3:**

    *    Input: 7x7 grid, more complex shapes
    *    Expected Output: 14 x 14, 2 x 2 upscaling of colored pixels.
    *    Actual (Simulated Output): 14 x 14 with 4 x 4 upscaling.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Upscale Colored Pixels:** If a pixel is *not* white (color value is not 0), expand it into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid.
3. **Output Dimensions** The output grid will have the height of twice the input grid and a width twice the input grid.
4.  **Placement of Upscaled Pixels:** The top-left corner of each 2x2 square in the output grid corresponds to the position of the original pixel in the input grid, multiplied by two. I.e. the input pixel at \[row, col] maps to the output square with top left cornet at \[row \* 2, col \* 2].
5. **White Pixels Ignored:** White Pixels are effectively ignored, because the output array will have a default value of zero.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
