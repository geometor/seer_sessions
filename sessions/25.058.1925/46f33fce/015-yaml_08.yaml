facts:
  - description: "Identify non-zero pixels in the input grid."
    elements: [green (3), red (2), blue (1), yellow (4)]
  - description: "Each non-zero pixel initiates a region expansion."
    properties:
      - "Expansion occurs in orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right)."
      - "Expansion continues until another colored region or the edge of the grid is encountered."
  - description: "Expansion creates a rectangle around the original pixel"
    properties:
        - height: defined by other object or border
        - width: defined by other object or border
  - description: "White (0) pixels remain unchanged unless overtaken by an expanding colored region."
    properties:
      - "White is a passive background."
  - description: Each color expands to take up 1/4 of input
    properties:
      - height: 1/2 input height
      - width: 1/2 input width
