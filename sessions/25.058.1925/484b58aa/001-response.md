Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The most obvious visual feature is the presence of large areas of white (0) pixels in the input grids that disappear in the output grids. The colored pixels surrounding and interspersed with the white pixels seem to maintain their relative positions and colors. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant between input and output. This suggests a filling or removal operation related to the white pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 29x29 (rows x columns)
      - cell_values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  - object: white_pixel_region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - shape: contiguous block (irregular)
    actions:
      - removed: True  # Indicates the region is removed or replaced
  - object: colored_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
    actions:
      - maintain_position: True # Relative position is preserved
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: [white_pixel_region, colored_pixel]
    property: white regions are adjacent to colored pixels.
  - observation: grid_size_constant
    details: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous regions of white pixels (value 0) in the input grid. A contiguous region is defined as a group of white pixels connected horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Remove** those white regions.
3.  **Preserve** all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in their original positions within the grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, and the non-white pixels maintain their locations. In effect, the removal of the white pixels simply removes them and does not cause the surrounding pixels to shift, collapse, or change.

In essence, the transformation is a simple "removal of contiguous white regions", leaving the colored pixels untouched.
