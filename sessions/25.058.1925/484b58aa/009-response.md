Okay, I've examined the input and output grids for the `train_2` example. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to be a complex arrangement of colored pixels. The output grid seems to be a simplified or filtered version of the input. The most striking difference is the removal of a large, irregular "blob" of white (0) pixels in the center-left of the input, and also the removal of single, isolated white pixels. Other colors seem to mostly be preserved, however some shapes may be "trimmed" by removal of edge pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [30, 30] # Assuming all grids are 30x30 based on provided description.
      - cells: pixels # Each cell is a pixel.
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
         - color: integer (0-9) # Represents color based on COLOR_MAP.

  - type: "contiguous colored regions" # blobs
    properties:
      - color: integer
      - shape: irregular
      - size: number of pixels
    relationships:
      - adjacent_to: other regions

actions:
  - remove:
      - target: "contiguous colored regions"
        condition:
          - color: 0 #white
          - property: large size

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous regions (blobs) of pixels of the same color in the input grid.
2.  **Measure** the area (number of pixels) of each contiguous region.
3.  **Remove** contiguous white (color 0) regions, including any that appear to be large.
4.  **Retain** all other colored regions.
5. The resulting grid, with the identified regions removed, is the output.

In essence, the transformation acts as a filter that removes the white regions of the grid.
