Okay, I've examined the input and output grids for the `train_1` example. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are pixels arranged in a 2D grid. Each pixel has a color represented by an integer (0-9). There are regions of repeating color patterns, and notably, there are areas of white (0) pixels in the input that are not present in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - cells: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: remove_object
    description: Removes pixels of a specific color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, with adjacency being relevant.
  - type: object-grid
    description: The grid is composed of pixels.

observations:
    - The output grid is identical with the input grid, except pixels of color zero (white) are removed.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid with the color value 0 (white).
2.  **Remove** these identified pixels from the grid.
3. The output grid is a copy of input grid without all the white pixels.
