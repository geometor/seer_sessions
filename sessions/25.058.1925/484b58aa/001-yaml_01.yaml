    properties:
      - dimensions: 29x29 (rows x columns)
      - cell_values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  - object: white_pixel_region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - shape: contiguous block (irregular)
    actions:
      - removed: True  # Indicates the region is removed or replaced
  - object: colored_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
    actions:
      - maintain_position: True # Relative position is preserved
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: [white_pixel_region, colored_pixel]
