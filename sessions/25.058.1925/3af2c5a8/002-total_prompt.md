**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grids are smaller than the output grids.  The transformation seems to involve expanding the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The non-zero colored pixels in the input grid appear to define a "shape", which gets replicated and possibly "mirrored" or "reflected" in the output. It seems like some sort of patterned expansion is happening, replicating colored pixels in a way to create bigger shape of the same characteristic of the original one.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - relationship: larger than input_grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Increase the dimensions of the grid.
  - name: replicate
    description: Copy pixel values from the input grid to specific locations in the output grid, maintaining original color.
    parameters:
      - pattern:  The input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically.

relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: The output_grid is a transformed version of the input_grid.
  - type: spatial
    description:  Colored pixels placement in output related to the input position, but expands outwards to fill more space.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the colored shape:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These pixels constitute the shape to be expanded.
2.  **Determine expansion factors:** calculate factor by which the width and the height of input grid are multiplied to generate the output grid.
3.  **Expand Canvas:** Create a new, larger output grid.  The output grid's dimensions are determined as follows:
    *   Output width = (Input width \* 2) + (Number of spaces between colored blocks in input + number of blocks -1)
    *    Output Height = (Input Height * 2)
4.  **Replicate and Mirror:** Copy the colored pixels from the input grid to the output grid, replicating the initial colored blocks:
    *   Copy the input grid into the top-left corner of the output grid.
    *   Mirror the input grid horizontally to the right.
    *   Mirror the input grid vertically downwards.
    *   Mirror the entire expanded section (input grid + horizontal/vertical mirrors) down to cover output grid.

Essentially, the colored part of the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to create a larger output grid of a determined size.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
