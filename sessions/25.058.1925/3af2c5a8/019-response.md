Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding the grid and adding a green border. The logic for determining whether to add 2 or 4 to the width was based on the presence of a "long azure line." This logic seems to be too specific and doesn't generalize well to other examples. The test on input 3 indicates failure, suggesting that rule of `_is_long_azure_line` to determine width is flawed. It appears width is always increased by 2, except for the one case with azure line. The vertical expansion by 4 seems correct for the example and test set results.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze all training input/output pairs to identify the common pattern for grid expansion. Pay close attention to cases where the initial logic fails.
2.  **Object Identification:** List all recurring visual elements (objects) and their characteristics in the input and output grids.
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Formulate a more general rule for the expansion, possibly abandoning the "long azure line" concept if it proves inconsistent.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to reflect the revised understanding of the transformation.

**Example Metrics and Observations:**

Here are metrics and observations gathered about the examples, along with code execution results, where applicable.

**Example 1:**

*   Input Size: 22x26
*   Output Size: 26x28
*   Azure Line: Yes (columns 16 to 25)
*   Result: Pass

**Example 2:**

*   Input Size: 20x28
*   Output Size: 24x30
*   Azure Line: No
*   Result: Pass

**Example 3:**

*   Input Size: 19x26
*   Output Size: 23x28
*    Azure Line: No
*   Result: Pass

**Test Input Results:**

*Test Input 1*
*   Input Size: 22x26
*   Output Size: 26x28
*   Azure Line: Yes (columns 16-25).
*   Result: Pass

*Test Input 2*
*   Input size: 18x28
*   Output Size: 22x30
*   Azure Line: None
*   Result: Pass

*Test Input 3*

*   Input Size: 21x26
*   Output Size: 25x30
*   Azure Line: No
*   Result: **Fail** - output size should be 25x28.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - height: input_grid.height + 4
      - width: input_grid.width + 2
      - border_color: green (3)
  - name: azure_line # Potentially irrelevant object
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - location: specific columns in some input grids

actions:
  - name: expand_grid
    description: Increases the dimensions of the grid.
    details:
      - height_increase: 4
      - width_increase: 2
      - border_color: green (3)
  - name: center_content
    description: Places the original input grid content in the center of the expanded grid.
    details:
        - vertical_offset: 2
        - horizontal_offset: 1

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded to create a larger output grid. The height of the output grid is always 4 units greater than the input grid's height. The width of the output grid is always 2 units greater than the input grid's width.
2.  **Border:** The expanded area is filled with green (value 3), creating a green border around the original content.
3.  **Centering:** The original input grid's content is placed in the center of the expanded output grid. This means there will be a 2-unit green border at the top and bottom, and 1-unit green border on the left and right sides.
4.  **Azure line detection no longer used:** This original concept has determined to be unhelpful.
