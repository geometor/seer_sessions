Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Expansion:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create an output grid.
2. **Replication:** For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. Specifically, `output_grid[2*i, 2*j]`, `output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j]`, `output_grid[2*i, 2*j+1]`, and `output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j+1]` all receive the value of `input_grid[i, j]`.
3. **Selective Inversion**: Iterate through each cell in the *output* grid.
   * If a cell's value is 3, change it to 0.
   * If a cell's value is 0, change it to 3.
   * Otherwise, leave cell value unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
