The input grids are smaller than the output grids.  The transformation seems to involve expanding the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The non-zero colored pixels in the input grid appear to define a \"shape\", which gets replicated and possibly \"mirrored\" or \"reflected\" in the output. It seems like some sort of patterned expansion is happening, replicating colored pixels in a way to create bigger shape of the same characteristic of the original one.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These pixels constitute the shape to be expanded.\n2.  **Determine expansion factors:** calculate factor by which the width and the height of input grid are multiplied to generate the output grid.\n3.  **Expand Canvas:** Create a new, larger output grid.  The output grid's dimensions are determined as follows:\n    *   Output width = (Input width \\* 2) + (Number of spaces between colored blocks in input + number of blocks -1)\n    *    Output Height = (Input Height * 2)\n4.  **Replicate and Mirror:** Copy the colored pixels from the input grid to the output grid, replicating the initial colored blocks:\n    *   Copy the input grid into the top-left corner of the output grid.\n    *   Mirror the input grid horizontally to the right.\n    *   Mirror the input grid vertically downwards.\n    *   Mirror the entire expanded section (input grid + horizontal/vertical mirrors) down to cover output grid.\n\nEssentially, the colored part of the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to create a larger output grid of a determined size.\n"
