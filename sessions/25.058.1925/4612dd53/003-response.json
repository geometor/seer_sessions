Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (9x13).\n*   The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue).\n*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), and 2s (red).\n*   The 1s in the input grid seem to mostly correspond to 1s in the output grid, but some become 2s.\n*   The 2s (red) in the output grid appear to be \"filling in\" or \"adjacent to\" the 1s (blue) in some way, and the position of the blues may have some importance.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The transformation identifies shapes created by blue objects, and changes white cells inside and diagonally adjacent to the blue pixels to red.\n"
