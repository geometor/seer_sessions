examples:
  - example_1:
      blue_objects: 1  # Single, irregular shape
      white_to_red:
        correct: 5  # White pixels correctly turned red
        false_positives: 0  # White pixels incorrectly turned red
        false_negatives: 0  # White pixels not turned red, but should have been
      observations: |
          The blue object forms a "C" shape. White pixels enclosed by the "C" and diagonally adjacent are changed to red.
  - example_2:
      blue_objects: 1  # Single, square-like shape
      white_to_red:
        correct: 1
        false_positives: 3
        false_negatives: 0
      observations: |
        The blue object forms a filled square.  Only the top left corner is filled.  Bounding box is too inclusive.
  - example_3:
      blue_objects: 1
      white_to_red:
        correct: 1
        false_positives: 3
        false_negatives: 0
      observations: |
          Similar to example 2, a filled rectangle. Only top right pixel is red.
  - example_4:
      blue_objects: 1
      white_to_red:
          correct: 1
          false_positives: 4
          false_negatives: 0
      observations: |
          Another filled rectangle.  Only diagonally adjacent and one row "inside".  Need to define "inside" more strictly
