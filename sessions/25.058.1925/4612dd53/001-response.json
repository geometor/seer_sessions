The input grids primarily contain blue (1) and white (0) pixels, while the output grids introduce red (2) pixels alongside the existing blue and white. The blue pixels appear to form shapes, and the red pixels seem to be related to the blue shapes in some way. It seems like the red pixels \"highlight\" or trace parts of the blue shape. The transformation involves changing some white pixels to red and some blue to red (and vice-versa - or at least in some cases a red replaces a white and in others it replaces a blue).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also, look at adjacent blue pixels.\n3. **Determine Red Pixels:** The transformation colors some, but not all, of the blue pixels to red. It also colors white adjacent pixels red, in a pattern that seems to trace an inside and outside of the original object boundary. If a white pixel touches the blue shape, it could change to a red pixel, or if a blue touches another blue, it may change.\n4. **Apply Transformation.** Create the output by creating a grid identical to the input and then changing select blue and white pixels to red.\n\nThe core of the transformation lies in understanding *which* adjacent pixels are changed to red, and this seems to have a geometric component based on the 'inside' and 'outside' of the blue object, and on whether the existing pixel is blue or white.\n"
