<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2576x1714 at 0x78E5F2072F50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids containing pixels of different colors. The input grids primarily contain blue (1) and white (0) pixels, while the output grids introduce red (2) pixels alongside the existing blue and white. The blue pixels appear to form shapes, and the red pixels seem to be related to the blue shapes in some way. It seems like the red pixels "highlight" or trace parts of the blue shape. The transformation involves changing some white pixels to red and some blue to red (and vice-versa - or at least in some cases a red replaces a white and in others it replaces a blue).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_shape
    type: contiguous_region
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - size: variable

  - name: red_highlight
    type: pixel_set
    color: red (2)
    properties:
       - location: adjacent_to_blue_shape

  - name: background
    type: contiguous_region
    color: white (0)
    properties: []

actions:
  - name: highlight
    input: blue_shape, background
    output: red_highlight
    description:  Adds/Changes pixels adjacent to the blue shape to red, possibly based on some rule related to shape or position. It's an alteration, not pure addition since sometimes it is adding next to the shape and othertimes replacing a part of the original blue shape

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: red_highlight
    object: blue_shape
    description: Red pixels are always adjacent to (touching) blue pixels, either replacing them, or adding to them.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue shape:** Find the contiguous region(s) of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Analyze Adjacency:** Inspect the white (0) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right - not diagonally) to the blue shape. Also, look at adjacent blue pixels.
3. **Determine Red Pixels:** The transformation colors some, but not all, of the blue pixels to red. It also colors white adjacent pixels red, in a pattern that seems to trace an inside and outside of the original object boundary. If a white pixel touches the blue shape, it could change to a red pixel, or if a blue touches another blue, it may change.
4. **Apply Transformation.** Create the output by creating a grid identical to the input and then changing select blue and white pixels to red.

The core of the transformation lies in understanding *which* adjacent pixels are changed to red, and this seems to have a geometric component based on the 'inside' and 'outside' of the blue object, and on whether the existing pixel is blue or white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
