            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule, a YAML block documenting facts, and a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial strategy of identifying blue objects and filling white pixels inside or diagonally adjacent to them with red is partially successful. However, the results reveal inconsistencies and errors across the examples. The primary issue is the definition of \"inside\" and \"diagonally adjacent,\" which seems too broad in some cases and too restrictive in others. Some of the expected output include white pixels *inside* the blue object and not all adjacent white pixels were colored red.\n\nThe main strategy will involve refining how \"inside\" is determined, and add a better rule for diagonally adjacent pixels. Additionally, the shapes formed by the blue pixels are not always simple, requiring a better description for the \"inside\" check for more complicated shapes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary combining manual observation with the script's output.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Blue Objects: 1\n    *   Correctly Changed: 4\n    *   False Positives: 2\n    *   False Negatives: 0\n    *   Notes: The two extra red are on the corners.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Blue Objects: 1\n    *   Correctly Changed: 3\n    *   False Positives: 1\n    *   False Negatives: 0\n    * Notes: Again, the top right corner is incorrectly filled.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *  Blue Objects: 1\n    *  Correctly Changed: 3\n    *  False Positives: 1\n    *   False Negatives: 0\n    *   Notes: Identical situation to example 2\n\n*  **Example 4:**\n    *   Blue Objects: 1\n    *   Correctly Changed: 3\n    *   False Positives: 2\n    *   False Negatives: 0\n    * Notes: Now two extra pixels.\n\nFrom these results, we can make a few useful observations.\n1.  The transform is almost always correct *inside* of the object.\n2.  The transform is inconsistent with the corner pixels of the blue shape.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"Blue objects are identified as contiguous regions of blue pixels.\"\n    object: Blue objects\n    property: color (blue)\n    property: contiguity (connected pixels)\n\n  - description: \"White pixels are the target for transformation.\"\n    object: White pixels\n    property: color (white)\n    action: potential transformation\n\n  - description: \"White pixels inside or meeting a specific diagonal relationship with blue objects are transformed to red.\"\n    object: White pixels\n    property: color (white)\n    relation: inside or diagonally adjacent to blue objects\n    action: transformed to red\n\n  - description: \"Diagonal adjacency for transformation isn't simply any diagonal touch; it is a precise condition related to the shape.\"\n    object: White Pixels\n    relation: diagonally adjacent.\n    action: transformed to red\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue pixels. Each contiguous region is considered a single \"blue object.\"\n\n2.  **Target White Pixels:** Examine each white pixel in the input grid.\n\n3.  **Inside Check:**\n    *   If a white pixel lies inside blue object, it is colored red.\n    *   Inside is determined by any white cell that is not on the outside border\n        of the shape.\n\n4.  **Specific Diagonal Check:**\n    *   Check the relationship between the corners of the blue object and any\n        white pixel.\n    *   Corners are where diagonally adjacent blue pixels meet.\n    *    If a white pixel touches only a single corner and is otherwise\n         surrounded by white or out-of-bounds pixels, it does not change.\n    *   If a white pixel touches two or more blue pixels, it should change to\n        red.\n    * If a white pixel is on the inside of the shape, it should turn red.\n\n5.  **Apply Transformation:** Change the color of the selected white pixels to red in the output grid.\n"
