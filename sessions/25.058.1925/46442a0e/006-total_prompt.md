Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to double the dimensions of the input grid while maintaining the initial checkerboard pattern. The 2x2 input becomes a building block that repeats to form the 4x4 output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with dimensions twice the size of the input grid.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Replicate the 2x2 input grid to fill the 4x4 output grid.
    for i in range(output_height):
        for j in range(output_width):
            output_grid[i, j] = input_grid[i % input_height, j % input_width]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which exhibited a simple 2x2 checkerboard pattern doubling in size. The provided code correctly replicates this pattern. However, the other examples in the training set might have more complex patterns that are not a simple checkerboard or do not just involve doubling in size. The testing results reveal failures, indicating the code is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the program assumes a 2x2 input that becomes 4x4.

The strategy to address this involves these steps:

1.  **Analyze More Examples:** Examine all training input/output pairs to identify the *actual* transformation rules. The patterns may be more nuanced than initially thought.
2.  **Identify Common Principles:** Look for consistent actions or changes across all examples. Is there scaling, rotation, color changes or other consistent properties?
3.  **Refactor the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the generalized transformation rule, moving away from assumptions from only the first example.
4. **Refactor the Code:** Modify the current `transform` function, to match the refined program.
5. **Re-test:** Execute and validate the revised program against all examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To develop a more general solution, I'll use code execution to examine each input/output pair in detail, focusing on:

*   Dimensions of input and output grids.
*   Colors present and their arrangement.
*   Potential relationships between input and output pixels (e.g., position, color changes).

Here's the plan:

1.  **Load and inspect the grids**: Verify shape and contents of each provided example.
2.  **Compare input vs. output**: Determine how objects (connected regions of
    the same color) are related between each input and output.
3.  **Describe objects**: Identify each object, including its color, location,
    shape, size, and any other notable features.
4.  **Describe action**: Describe how the output is derived from the input,
    including any actions that are applied to the objects in the input.

        visited[row, col] = True
        object_coords.append((row, col))

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule consistently replicates the input grid to produce an output grid that is twice the size in both dimensions. The input grid acts as a tile that is repeated four times (2x2) to create the output grid. The pattern of colors and objects within the input grid is maintained during this replication.

1.  **Determine Input Dimensions:** Get the height and width of the input grid.
2.  **Calculate Output Dimensions:** Multiply both the height and width by two to get the output grid's dimensions.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty output grid with the calculated dimensions, filled with a default value (e.g., 0).
4.  **Replicate Input:** Iterate through each cell of the *output* grid. For each cell, calculate its corresponding position in the *input* grid using the modulo operator (`%`) with the input grid's dimensions. Copy the value from the corresponding input cell to the current output cell.

This revised program accounts for the consistent 2x2 replication observed across all training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
