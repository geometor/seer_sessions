Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid is smaller (3x3) than the output grid (6x6). The output grid appears to be some sort of expansion or combination of the input grid, with additional elements. There's a noticeable symmetry and repetition of colors in the output. The input grid has three distinct colors, which are also present in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [6, 9, 4] # Magenta, Maroon, Yellow
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    colors: [6, 9, 4] # Magenta, Maroon, Yellow
  - object: input_square
    type: rectangle
    color_groups:
      - color: 6 #magenta
        positions: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]
      - color: 9 #maroon
        positions:  [(0,1), (0,2)]
      - color: 4 #yellow
        positions:  [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)]
  - relationship: output_contains_mirrored_input
    description: The output grid seems to combine mirrored copies of the input around the central 2 x 2
  - object: border_colors
      type: alternating_colors
      colors: [6,9]
      description: magenta and maroon colors on top left, top, left, right and bottom edges.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Core:** Locate the 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels in the center of the original 3 x 3 grid.
2. **Expand Core:**  The 2x2 core becomes a 4x4 core in the center of a new, empty 6x6 grid.
3. **Mirror/Duplicate Columns:** The first column of input grid is mirrored on the left and duplicated on the right of expanded core. These appear as columns 1 and 6, respectively.
4. **Mirror/Duplicate Rows:** Take the last row, including the new mirrored elements and mirror it into the top row. Duplicate it and make a new bottom row.

In short: Expand core and then reflect input rows and columns to create larger output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
