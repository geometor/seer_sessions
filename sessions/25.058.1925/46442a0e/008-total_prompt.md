Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule replicates the input grid to produce an output grid that is twice the size in both dimensions. The input grid acts as a tile that is repeated four times (2x2) to create the output grid. The pattern of colors and objects within the input grid is maintained during this replication.

    # Calculate Output Dimensions: Multiply both the height and width by two to get the output grid's dimensions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: replication of the input grid to create a larger output grid. The code implements a 2x2 tiling mechanism. The provided examples, however, reveal a consistent success across all training inputs. This means that the current implementation and its underlying logic are sufficient to capture the transformation rule as demonstrated in the examples.  Since there are no errors, no changes are required, but we should still make observations about the examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

Since I don't have the actual input/output grids to execute code on, I will describe what I *would* do and the kind of information I would gather, simulating a code execution environment. I'll refer to example pairs by index (0, 1, 2). Then I'll construct a hypothetical report.

**Hypothetical Code Execution and Reporting:**

1.  **Input/Output Dimensions:** For each example pair (input_grid, output_grid), I would get `input_grid.shape` and `output_grid.shape`. I expect `output_grid.shape` to be exactly twice the dimensions of `input_grid.shape` in both height and width.

2.  **Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison:** I'd iterate through every pixel coordinate (i, j) of the `output_grid`. For each, I would calculate the corresponding input coordinate `(i % input_height, j % input_width)` and compare the pixel values. I expect them to be identical.

3.  **Object Identification (Hypothetical):** I would visually inspect (or, if I had image processing capabilities, algorithmically detect) distinct "objects" within the input grids. An "object" is a contiguous region of the same color. I would note the colors, shapes, and relative positions of these objects.

**Hypothetical Report (YAML):**

```yaml

  - example_index: 0
    input_shape: (3, 3)
    output_shape: (6, 6)
    objects:

      dimensions_doubled: True
      pixel_replication_correct: True
```

**Natural Language Program**

The input grid is replicated as a 2x2 tile to form the output grid.  The output grid's dimensions are exactly twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a pixel in the input grid, determined by finding the remainder of the output pixel's row and column indices divided by the input grid's height and width, respectively. The color/value of each pixel in the output is identical to its corresponding pixel in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
