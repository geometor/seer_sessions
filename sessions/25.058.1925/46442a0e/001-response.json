The grids are composed of colored squares, each represented by a single digit integer. The colors and their corresponding digits are consistent across the examples. The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with a specific arrangement of the input's elements. The shape of the output grid is not same as the input grid; it is always bigger, at least 2x2 times bigger.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
