**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The grids are composed of colored squares, each represented by a single digit integer. The colors and their corresponding digits are consistent across the examples. The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with a specific arrangement of the input's elements. The shape of the output grid is not same as the input grid; it is always bigger, at least 2x2 times bigger.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [integer_values] # e.g., [8, 6] in the first example
      - dimensions: [rows, cols] # e.g., [2, 2] in the first example

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [integer_values] # Same values as input_grid, but rearranged and expanded
      - dimensions: [rows, cols] # e.g., [4, 4] in first, [6,6] in second, third example
  - name: cell
    type: element
    properties:
      color: int
      position: [row, col]

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger output grid.
  - name: arrange
    description: The elements of the input grid are arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid.
  - name: rotate_and_mirror
    description: >
      input grid is rotated 90 degree clock-wise and mirrored across the horizontal axis to get a new grid.
      This transformation is performed two times.

relationships:
  - input_grid TO output_grid: one-to-one, transformation
  - input_grid cells TO output_grid cells: one-to-many, expansion and arrangement
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe Input:** Identify the dimensions (rows x columns) and the color values of the input grid.

2.  **Create Output Grid Shell**: create a new grid. The width and height of output grid are double of those of the transformed version of input grid.

3.  **Transform input grid:**
    *   Rotate input grid by 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   Mirror (flip) the rotated grid along its horizontal axis.

4.  **Expand and Arrange:**
    *   The original input grid fills the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   The transformed input grid fills the top-right and the bottom-left quadrants of output grid.
    *   Perform transformation on the input grid for the second time and put the result at the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
