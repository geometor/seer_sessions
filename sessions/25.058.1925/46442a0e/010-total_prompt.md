**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid of colored pixels into a larger grid. The colors present are orange (7) and azure (8). The output grid appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input grid, with a specific symmetrical pattern. The core pattern seems to be a cross shape made of azure, surrounded by orange.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [orange, azure]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x6
      colors: [orange, azure]
  - name: orange_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
  - name: azure_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)

actions:
  - name: scale_up
    description: Doubles the dimensions of the grid.
  - name: mirror
    description: Creates a symmetrical pattern by mirroring colors.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The azure pixels form a cross shape in the center of the output grid.
  - type: scaling
    description: The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scale Up:** Double the size of the input grid in both width and height. This means a 3x3 grid becomes a 6x6 grid.

2.  **Mirror and Expand:** The original input grid's pattern is mirrored both horizontally and vertically within this new grid.
    - Specifically we take each value in each cell in the original array, duplicate the value to make it 2x2.
    - Then we build a new array with the horizontal mirror to the right and concatenate
    - Then we take that result, and vertically mirror, and then concatenate the mirrow below the original


```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
