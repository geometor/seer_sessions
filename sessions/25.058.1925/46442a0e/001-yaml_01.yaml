objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [integer_values] # e.g., [8, 6] in the first example
      - dimensions: [rows, cols] # e.g., [2, 2] in the first example

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [integer_values] # Same values as input_grid, but rearranged and expanded
      - dimensions: [rows, cols] # e.g., [4, 4] in first, [6,6] in second, third example
  - name: cell
    type: element
    properties:
      color: int
      position: [row, col]

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger output grid.
  - name: arrange
    description: The elements of the input grid are arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid.
  - name: rotate_and_mirror
    description: >
      input grid is rotated 90 degree clock-wise and mirrored across the horizontal axis to get a new grid.
      This transformation is performed two times.

relationships:
  - input_grid TO output_grid: one-to-one, transformation
  - input_grid cells TO output_grid cells: one-to-many, expansion and arrangement
