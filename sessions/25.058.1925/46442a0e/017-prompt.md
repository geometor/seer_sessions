Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expands a 2x2 core of an input grid to 4x4 and then mirrors/duplicates the input's rows and columns to create a 6x6 output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_core(grid):
    # Find the 2x2 yellow (4) core in the input grid.  Assumes it exists and is unique.
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            if grid[r, c] == 4 and grid[r + 1, c] == 4 and grid[r, c + 1] == 4 and grid[r + 1, c + 1] == 4:
                return (r, c)

def transform(input_grid):

    # Mirror/Duplicate rows
    #   - copy extended last row of input grid, including new columns
    #      and duplicate it into the last row of output
    #   - mirror extended first row, including new columns and make it first row of output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
