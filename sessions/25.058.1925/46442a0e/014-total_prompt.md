Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Duplicate:** For every pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
2.  **Mirror Horizontally:**  Create a horizontal mirror image of the expanded grid from step 1.
3.  **Concatenate Horizontally:** Combine the expanded grid (step 1) with its horizontal mirror (step 2), placing the mirrored image to the *right* of the original.
4.  **Mirror Vertically:** Create a vertical mirror image of the horizontally concatenated grid from step 3.
5. **Concatenate Vertically**: Combine the horizontally concatenated grid (step 3) with its vertical mirror (step 4), placing the mirrored version *below* the horizontally combined grid. The final output size will *always* be twice the width and twice the height of the input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved a simple 2x2 duplication and mirroring along both axes. The provided code accurately reflects this initial program. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this transformation rule is not universally applicable to all cases. The code *works perfectly* for the first example, but fails in different ways on the second and third example. This indicates that the transformation rule needs to be revised to consider variations or conditional behaviors not present in the first example. The key will be to determine a *generalized* rule that explains all input/output relationships rather than separate, example specific rules.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair and the result of the current code. Note specifically *how* the current code's output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for common elements or patterns in the *correct* transformations.
3.  **Revise the Natural Language Program:** Develop a new, generalized natural language program that accounts for the behavior in *all* training examples. Focus on describing the fundamental operations (like mirroring, duplication, or other geometric manipulations) and any conditional aspects that may be present.
4. **Preserve Structure When Possible**: It is preferred to perform a minimal update.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate:** For every pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
2.  **Conditional Mirroring:**
    *   If the input grid has more than one row AND more than one column, perform both horizontal and vertical mirroring of the duplicated grid, followed by horizontal and vertical concatenation as in the initial program.
    *   If the input grid has only one row, perform only horizontal mirroring of the duplicated grid, and horizontal concatenation (no vertical mirroring).
    *   If the input grid has only one column, perform only vertical mirroring of the duplicated grid, and vertical concatenation (no horizontal mirroring).
3. **Concatenation**:
    * The duplicated blocks are concatenated with their mirrored counterparts


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
