**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a relationship between the blue (1) and gray (5) pixels. Specifically, it appears the blue pixels in the input are "transferred" to the bottom row of the output, replacing gray pixels where a blue pixel exists in the corresponding column of input grid above.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      cell_values: [0, 1, 5]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        blue: 1
        gray: 5
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: transfer_color
    description:  Moves blue pixels to the bottom row, replacing gray.
    parameters:
      source_color: 1
      target_color: 5
      target_row: last_row

relationships:
  - type: column_alignment
    description: Output blue pixels align vertically with input blue pixels.
  - type: replacement
    description: Blue pixels in the output replace gray pixels in the input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** column containing a blue pixel:
    *   **Find** the gray (5) pixel at the bottom row in the same column of the output grid.
    *   **Change** gray pixel color to blue pixel color.
3.  **All** other pixels in the input that are not blue, maintain color and position in the output.
4. The pixels in the input grid that are above an identified blue, are changed to white (0) in the output.

In essence, the blue pixels "drop down" to the bottom row, replacing the gray pixels, the gray pixels maintain position. All other pixels maintain color and position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
