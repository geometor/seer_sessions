The blue pixels form a cross-like shape.  There are individual red pixels scattered around.\n*   **Output:**  The grid is the same size as the input. The blue cross in the top center area remains. New blue (1) pixels, are placed in a symmetrical pattern that mimics original red pixels (2), but where it is blue (1), and it mirrors the red (2) position, by reflecting the red (2) pixels at the same position relative to the blue(1) cross.\n* **Transformation:** The core blue cross stays the same. The red pixels are \"mirrored\" or \"reflected\" across the center *blue cross* creating a set of \"mirror\" blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"

The mirrored position has the same row/column offsets from the cross's center, but on the opposite sides.\n    * **IF** mirrored location within grid\n        * **Change** the pixel at mirrored position.
