Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, assuming a reflection of red pixels across a central blue cross, turning mirrored white pixels blue. The results on the subsequent training examples reveal that this assumption is not entirely correct. Some examples work, but the one that fails highlights a key flaw: the transformation doesn't correctly handle the case where the mirrored position of a red pixel is occupied by a blue pixel.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Analysis:** Examine each example, paying close attention to the input, expected output, and actual output. Identify specific discrepancies.
2.  **Refine the Program:** Focus on cases that the original logic fails. Modify the natural language program to describe a complete rule that accounts for all observations.
3.  **Update the code:**. Modify the `transform` function to reflect the updated natural language program.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To better understand the results, let's execute some code to obtain detailed reports of the example.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_blue_cross_center(grid):
    blue_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 1)
    if blue_pixels.size == 0:
        return None
    center_row = int(np.mean(blue_pixels[:, 0]))
    center_col = int(np.mean(blue_pixels[:, 1]))
    return (center_row, center_col)

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    cross_center = find_blue_cross_center(input_grid)
    red_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)
    diff = expected_output != actual_output

    print("Cross Center:", cross_center)
    print("Red Pixels:", red_pixels)
    print("Differences:", np.argwhere(diff))
    print("Difference values (expected, actual):", [(expected_output[r,c], actual_output[r,c]) for r, c in np.argwhere(diff)])

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Blue Cross:** Find the central blue cross shape within the grid. The center of this cross serves as the reflection axis.

2.  **Locate Red Pixels:** Identify the red pixels.

3.  **Mirror Reflection (with a Condition):** There are no red pixels, therefore no mirroring, so the output is the same as the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
