objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 2x2, 2x3, 3x3)
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: derived from input_grid (input_rows + 2) x (input_cols + 2)
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors, including '0' for padding

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixels
    description: Each pixel in the input_grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically.
  - name: add_padding
    description: A border of '0' (white) pixels is added around the duplicated grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid is derived from input_grid
  - pixel_duplication: input_grid pixels are expanded 2x2 in output_grid
  - padding: output_grid has a '0' border of one pixel width
