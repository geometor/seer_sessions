Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expands each pixel of the input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid,
maintaining the original color. Adds a one-pixel wide white (0) border around
the entire output grid and between the 2x2 blocks.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as 4x4 with all zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # iterate through input grid
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            # expand each pixel to a 2x2 block in output, separated by zeros
            output_grid[2*i + 1, 2*j + 1] = input_grid[i, j]
            output_grid[2*i, 2*j+1] = input_grid[i,j]
            output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j] = input_grid[i,j]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and devise a strategy for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a pixel expansion with a white border. However, the provided code and description does not properly manage the size of output grid. The output grid needs to be dynamically sized based on the input grid's dimensions, accounting for both the 2x2 expansion of each pixel and the white borders. The current code appears to hard code a 4x4 output grid and incorrectly fills in values resulting in index out of bound errors for the input grids that are not 1x1 size.

The core issue is that the output grid's size is not calculated based on the input grid size. It should be `(2 * input_height + 1, 2 * input_width + 1)`. The placement logic of 2x2 blocks is also flawed, it uses `2*i + 1, 2*j + 1` which starts at index 1, and it needs to calculate it with more nuance to achieve a border effect.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Calculate the correct output grid size.
2.  **Correct Placement:** Modify the placement logic to correctly position the 2x2 blocks within the white border.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution, since actual execution isn't available in this turn):**

Since I cannot execute the `transform` function here, I will simulate the results and note down the key problems. Let's assume we have the following examples (represented concisely):

*   **Example 1:** Input: `[[1]]` Output: `[[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]` (Correctly handled according to the old problem statement, but now that does not have surrounding border.)
*   **Example 2:** Input: `[[2,3]]` Output: `[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,3,3],[0,2,2,3,3],[0,0,0,0,0]]` (Incorrect: size and values need border, hardcoded size).
*   **Example 3:** Input:
    ```
    [[4, 5],
     [6, 7]]
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
     [0,4,4,0,5,5,0],
     [0,4,4,0,5,5,0],
     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
     [0,6,6,0,7,7,0],
     [0,6,6,0,7,7,0],
     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
    ```
    (Incorrect: size and values. Old code would have an index out of bounds error).

**Hypothetical Code Execution Results Analysis:**

| Example | Input Shape | Expected Output Shape        | Actual Output Shape (Hypothetical Old Code) | Issues                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | (1, 1)      | (3, 3)                        | (4,4)                | border definition, size      |
| 2       | (1, 2)      | (3, 5)                         | (4,4)                  | Incorrect size, border, placement of expanded pixels, hardcoded indexes                                  |
| 3       | (2, 2)      | (5, 5)                        |  (4,4)                                   | Incorrect size, border, placement of expanded pixels, hardcoded indexes, out of bounds error |

**YAML Block (Facts)**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains: pixels (integers 0-9)
      - dimensions: variable (height, width)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains: pixels (integers 0-9)
      - dimensions: derived from input_grid (2*height + 1, 2*width + 1)
      - border: 1-pixel wide, color 0 (white)
  - action: pixel_expansion
    description: Each pixel in input_grid is expanded to a 2x2 block in output_grid.
  - action: border_addition
    description: A 1-pixel wide white border is added around the expanded grid.
  - constraint: white_separation
    description: 2x2 expanded blocks are separated by a single white pixel in output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Calculate the dimensions of the output grid. The output grid's height will be twice the input grid's height plus one, and the output grid's width will be twice the input grid's width plus one.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a new grid (output\_grid) of the calculated dimensions, filled entirely with zeros (white pixels).
3.  **Iterate Input Pixels:** Loop through each pixel of the input grid using nested loops (row by row, column by column).
4.  **Expand and Place:** For each input pixel at position (i, j), place a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 2x2 block should be at position (2i+1, 2j+1) in the output grid. This ensures a one-pixel white border around and between expanded blocks.

This improved natural language program addresses the dynamic sizing and correct placement issues, resulting in a one-pixel white border surrounding and separating the expanded pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
