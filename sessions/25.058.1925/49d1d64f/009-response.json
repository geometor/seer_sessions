The input grid seems to contain single-digit integers, each corresponding to a specific color. The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input, with the original values replicated and surrounded by a border of '0' (white) and sometimes a copy of the existing values.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top-left corner of the original grid will map to position (1,1) inside of expanded grid (using a 0 index).\n\n3. **Border with '0':** The top and bottom rows and the leftmost and rightmost columns of the expanded grid are filled with '0' (white).\n\n4.  **Replicate:** The original border of the input is copied to the border of the expanded grid.\n\n    *   The first row of the input is replicated, and that copy becomes the second row of the expanded grid.\n    *   The last row of the input is replicated, and that copy becomes the row above the bottom row of the expanded grid.\n    *   The first and last columns of the just created grid are copied, and inserted just before or after themselves.\n"
