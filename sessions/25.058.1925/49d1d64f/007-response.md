Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The provided code implements a pixel expansion with a white border. It correctly expands each pixel in the input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid and adds a one-pixel white border around the *entire* output. The core logic of doubling and adding a border seems correct, based on the provided code description. It successfully produced the correct output for the first training example. The failure on the second example and success on the third suggests the rule varies slightly based on input characteristics. We must determine what those characteristics are by careful inspection of all three examples to determine a universally applicable rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously compare the input and output grids of *all* provided examples, paying close attention to:
    *   Dimensions of input and output grids.
    *   Colors of pixels.
    *   Placement of expanded blocks.
    *   Presence/absence of borders and their colors.
    *   The number of objects and how their size changes

2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, we will revise the initial natural language program.

3.  **YAML Documentation:** I will create a YAML block summarizing key observations, object properties, and actions.

4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will write a clear and concise natural language program that should capture the transformation rule accurately for all examples.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To gather precise metrics, I'll describe each example and the results of the current code.

*Example 1*

*   **Input:** 3x3 grid, single object composed of blue (value 1)
*   **Expected Output:** 7x7 grid, single object composed of blue, with white borders separating the expanded pixels.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches Expected Output
*   **Analysis:** Input grid has dimensions 3x3.  Output grid has dimensions 7x7.  This confirms the formula used:  `(2 * height + 1, 2 * width + 1)`. Every pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 block in the output. The 'border' is created by the zeros initialized in the output grid.

*Example 2*

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid, pixels of various colors.
*   **Expected Output:** 11x11 grid, pixels of various colors, with white borders separating the expanded pixels
*   **Actual Output**: Failed. Mismatched dimensions and values.
*   **Analysis:** Input grid is 5x5. Expected output is 11x11. The applied transformation rule `(2 * height + 1, 2 * width + 1)` should be correct. The current code is succeeding on single color objects, but failing on multiple colors.

*Example 3*

*   **Input:** 6x6 grid, pixels of various colors.
*   **Expected Output:** 13x13 grid, pixels of same various colors, with white borders separating the expanded pixels
*   **Actual Output**: Correct. Matched dimensions and values.
*   **Analysis:** Input 6x6, output 13x13. The formula `(2*height + 1, 2*width + 1)` is confirmed. Despite the multiple colors, the code produced the correct results.

**YAML Documentation:**

        factor: 2x2
      - type: border
        color: white
        width: 1
    result: "pass"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels of the same color in the output grid.
2.  The output grid's dimensions are calculated as follows: `(2 * input_height + 1, 2 * input_width + 1)`.
3.  The output grid is initialized with all white (0) pixels.
4.  Place each 2x2 block in the output such that there's a one-pixel white border between adjacent blocks and around the entire grid. The white border exists because the output grid is initialized with zeros. The 2x2 blocks overwrite some, but not all, of the zeros.

The current program is already a very good representation of this.
