            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, expanding the input grid by adding borders. However, it incorrectly adds two rows and four columns of zeros and has logic errors, especially in the expansion of output grid with replicated rows and columns. The provided test results reveal discrepancies in how the borders are handled, particularly in replicating the edge rows and columns. The core issue is that the code does not accurately reflect a consistent rule applicable to all examples.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Correct the Border Expansion Logic:** Focus on accurately replicating the edge rows and columns *once*, to all examples, rather then adding padding of zeros.\n2.  **Verify Against All Examples:** Use the `code_execution` function to rigorously test against *all* provided examples, not just the first.\n3.    **Focus on the Core Pattern**: Pay very close attention to exactly what is the position change of all the values in the grid - where the original end up in the new grid.\n4. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on a consistent, working rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the results from the `code_execution` function (as provided in the prompt, as the code is not interactive here):\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Match: `False`\n    *   Notes: initial attempt was for this example. The padding approach is wrong, but the general dimensions are not.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (4, 7)\n    *   Match: `False`\n    *   Notes: columns are incorrect.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 4)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (5, 6)\n    *   Match: `False`\n        *   Notes: columns are incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: border_expansion\n  - description: Expand input grid by replicating edge rows and columns.\n  - objects:\n      - object_name: input_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - rows: variable\n          - cols: variable\n          - values: integers (0-9)\n      - object_name: output_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - rows: input_grid.rows + 2\n          - cols: input_grid.cols + 2\n          - values: integers (0-9)\n  - actions:\n      - action_name: replicate_row\n        agent: system\n        target: input_grid\n        parameters:\n          - row_index: 0 # First row\n          - row_index: -1 # Last row\n        result: output_grid row at [row_index -1] and [row_index +1]\n\n      - action_name: replicate_col\n        agent: system\n        target: input_grid\n        parameters:\n          - col_index: 0 # First col\n          - col_index: -1 # Last col\n        result: output_grid col at [col_index -1] and [col_index +1]\n\n      - action_name: copy\n        agent: system\n        source: input_grid\n        target: output_grid\n        location: center (row+1, col+1 of output_grid)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Copy the Input:** The original input grid is copied directly into the output grid, but offset by one row and one column in each dimension. This places the input grid in the \"center\" of the output grid.\n\n2. **Expand Rows:** The top row of the *input* grid becomes the top row of the expanded *output* grid. The bottom row of the *input* grid is also replicated to be bottom row of the *output* grid.\n\n3.  **Expand Columns:** The leftmost column of the *input* grid is replicated to be the leftmost column of the *output* grid. The rightmost column of the *input* grid is replicated to be the rightmost column of the output grid.\n\nIn short, the transformation creates a border around the original grid by duplicating the edge rows and columns.\n"
