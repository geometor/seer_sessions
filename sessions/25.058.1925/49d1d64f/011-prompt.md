Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded by adding one row above, one row below, one column to the left, and one column to the right. The original grid values are placed inside the new expanded grid, with the top-left corner of the original grid mapping to position (1,1) in the expanded grid (using a 0-indexed system). The top and bottom rows and the leftmost and rightmost columns of the expanded grid are filled with '0' (white). The original border of the input is copied to the border of the expanded grid. Specifically, the first row of the input is replicated and becomes the second row of the expanded grid. The last row of the input is replicated and becomes the row above the bottom row of the expanded grid. The first and last columns of the newly created grid are copied and inserted just before or after themselves.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
