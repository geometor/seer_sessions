The colors/digits in the original grid seem to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid. The central pixel of the input grid appears to become the center of the output grid, and other input pixels are duplicated around it, creating a sort of \"expansion\" or \"reflection.\" It seems there is padding of 0 added to the edges.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
