Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and the updated natural language program, along with a YAML fact representation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single training example.  This led to a solution that works correctly only when the inner pixels adjacent to the frame are all the same color, and when that color changes to a different, single color. The additional training examples reveal that inner pixels of *different* colors can change, and they don't necessarily change to the same output color. The core logic of identifying the frame and inner pixels is correct, but the color transformation logic needs to be significantly generalized. The current implementation makes an incorrect assumption about a one-to-one color mapping for *all* inner pixels.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Execute code to meticulously compare input and output grids for *all* training examples.  This will pinpoint the exact color changes occurring for *each* inner pixel.
2.  **Generalize Transformation Rule:** Instead of assuming a single input-to-output color mapping, build a mapping that accounts for multiple input colors changing to potentially multiple output colors.  The rule should be pixel-specific based on adjacency to the frame.
3.  **Refactor `determine_transformation`:**  This function needs to create a dictionary mapping *each* input color found adjacent to the frame to its corresponding output color.
4. Update YAML facts and natural language program.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Analysis**

        neighbors.append((row, col - 1))  # Left

**Example Analysis and Results:**

```
Example 1:
{(1, 1): (3, 1), (1, 2): (3, 1), (1, 3): (3, 1), (1, 5): (3, 1), (1, 6): (3, 1), (2, 1): (3, 1), (2, 2): (3, 1), (2, 3): (3, 1), (2, 5): (3, 1), (2, 6): (3, 1)}
Example 2:
{(1, 1): (5, 0), (1, 2): (5, 0), (1, 3): (5, 0), (1, 4): (5, 0), (2, 1): (5, 0), (2, 2): (5, 0), (2, 3): (5, 0), (2, 4): (5, 0)}
Example 3:
{(1, 1): (7, 0), (1, 2): (7, 0), (1, 3): (7, 0), (2, 1): (7, 0), (2, 2): (2, 2), (2, 3): (7, 0), (3, 1): (7, 0), (3, 2): (7, 0), (3, 3): (7, 0)}
Example 4:
{(1, 1): (3, 1), (1, 2): (3, 1), (1, 3): (3, 1), (1, 4): (3, 1), (1, 5): (3, 1), (2, 1): (3, 1), (2, 2): (3, 1), (2, 3): (3, 1), (2, 4): (3, 1), (2, 5): (3, 1), (3, 1): (3, 1), (3, 2): (3, 1), (3, 3): (3, 1), (3, 4): (3, 1), (3, 5): (3, 1)}
Example 5:
{(1, 1): (4, 4), (1, 2): (4, 4), (1, 4): (2, 5), (1, 5): (2, 5)}
```

Key Observations:

*   **Consistent Frame:** All examples have an azure (8) frame.
*   **Inner Pixel Changes:** Only pixels directly adjacent to the frame change.
*   **Multiple Mappings:** Different input colors can map to different output colors (e.g., Example 3 and 5). A single input color maps to the same output color within a given example.
* Pixel position relative to other colored pixels does not seem to be important.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Frame:** The grid is surrounded by a frame of azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Identify Inner Pixels:** Locate all pixels directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the azure frame. These are the "inner pixels."

3.  **Determine Color Mapping:** For each inner pixel in the input grid, find its color and the corresponding color of the same pixel in the output grid. Create a dictionary where the keys are the input colors and the values are the corresponding output colors. If an inner pixel's color doesn't change between the input and the output, it still needs an entry in the dictionary; map the color to itself.

4.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through the inner pixels of the input grid. For each inner pixel, look up its color in the color mapping dictionary created in step 3. Change the pixel's color in the output grid to the corresponding value from the dictionary.

5.  **Preserve Frame:** The azure frame remains unchanged. The output grid is a copy of the input grid with only the inner pixels potentially modified.
