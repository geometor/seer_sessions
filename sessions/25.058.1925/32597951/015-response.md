Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a single-digit value representing a color.
*   The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and, in the output, green (3).
*   The azure (8) pixels in the input appear to be the focus of the transformation.
*   The output grid is identical to the input grid, *except* for some changes around the azure (8) pixels.
*	It looks like the azure (8) are exchanging with adjacent blue (1) pixels to green (3)

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 17
      - height: 17
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel_group
    description: Contiguous block of azure (8) pixels
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer representing a color
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

actions:
  - name: transform_adjacent
    description: Change blue to green
    parameters:
        - source_color: blue (1)
        - target_color: green (3)
        - adjacent_to:  azure (8)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Identify original blue(1) pixels adjacent to any azure pixel(8):** For each azure pixel, find the blue pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to original azure(8).

3.  **Transform Pixels:** Transform those identified blue pixels(1) into green(3)

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
