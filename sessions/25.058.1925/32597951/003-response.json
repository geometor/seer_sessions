The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3). There's a noticeable change in the central azure region where some azure pixels are replaced by green pixels in the output. The change is confined to the azure region; the blue and white areas are unaffected. The input and output grids are identical except within the continuous azure object where some pixels have changed from azure to green.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
