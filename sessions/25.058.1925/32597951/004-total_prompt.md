Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3). There's a noticeable change in the central azure region where some azure pixels are replaced by green pixels in the output. The change is confined to the azure region; the blue and white areas are unaffected. The input and output grids are identical except within the continuous azure object where some pixels have changed from azure to green.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: 17
      - width: 17
      - colors: [white, blue, azure, green]
  - type: contiguous_region
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - location: center
      - shape: irregular
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [white, blue, azure, green]

actions:
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      - from: azure
      - to: green
    constraints:
      - location: within_azure_region

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: azure region is surrounded by blue and white pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the contiguous azure region:** Locate the connected area of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Color Change:** Within the identified azure region, change some of the azure (8) pixels to green (3). Specifically, change 1's that are to the immediate left, right, above and below the central 8, to 3.
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (white, blue) remain unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation selectively modifies the color of specific azure pixels within a defined region to green, based on the provided example it seems that a pixel adjacent to the central 8 is changed to the color 3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
