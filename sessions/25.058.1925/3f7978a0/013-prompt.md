Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color (excluding white/0). These are the initial candidate objects.
2.  **Identify Primary Diagonal:** Find the longest diagonal structure formed by connected azure (8) and gray (5) pixels running from top-right to bottom-left. "Connected" means adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
3. **Subgrid selection**
Identify the rows and colums that contain the primary Diagonal.
4.  **Object Selection:** Keep only the objects that have at least one pixel on any of the rows or columns identified in step 3.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid containing only the selected objects from the identified subgrid. Empty rows and columns within the subgrid selection should be preserved (unlike the previous iteration).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
