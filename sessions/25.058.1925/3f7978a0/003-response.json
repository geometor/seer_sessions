The grids contain numerical values that represent colors. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a condensed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining only certain colored pixels and eliminating others, primarily the white (0) background. The spatial arrangement of the retained pixels seems to be preserved in a compressed form.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The resulting grid will be smaller due to the removal of all-white rows and columns.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a sub-grid containing only the non-zero pixels, removing the surrounding \"whitespace\" (pixels with value 0) while preserving the core pattern of the colored pixels.\n"
