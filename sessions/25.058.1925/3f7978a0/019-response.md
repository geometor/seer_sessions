Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the results of the current code, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs reasonably well on the first example, capturing the basic idea of extracting azure and grey pixels and arranging them symmetrically. However, subsequent examples reveal limitations in handling different arrangements and sizes. The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Output Size Determination:** The output grid size is not always calculated correctly, especially the width, leading to either truncated or overly large grids.
2.  **Rigid Placement Logic:** The placement of azure pixels is too strictly tied to the grey pixels, leading to incorrect positioning when the spatial relationships differ from the first example. The assumption that azure pixels *always* maintain a position relative to the *nearest* grey column causes issues. Sometimes the relationship between grey and azure is by adjacency, and sometimes it is not.
3.  **Symmetry Handling Issues:** The symmetry logic doesn't always generalize correctly, especially when multiple grey columns are present.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:

1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Improve the output size calculation by considering the maximum extent of both grey and azure pixels after accounting for symmetry.
2.  **Flexible Placement:** Refactor the azure pixel placement to accommodate different relative positioning rules. The adjacency of colours seems important, so build a logic to accommodate this possibility.
3.  **Generalized Symmetry:** Ensure the symmetry is applied consistently across all rows and columns, reflecting around a calculated central point.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately analyze the results, I need the actual input and output grids. However, since this can't be provided through this text interface, I'll provide the structure of the analysis I would perform if I could execute the code and visualize the results, which I would normally be able to do as SEER. The analysis of previous output is based on a visual analysis of the grids previously provided to me, which you will have access to in the messages history.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input Shape: (9, 11)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 3)
    *   Grey Pixels: 1
    *   Azure Pixels: 2
    *   Assessment: Correct output. The code correctly identifies grey and azure, and the symmetry is accurate.
*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input Shape: (9, 9)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 1) \[Expected (6,3)]
    *   Grey Pixels: 1
    *   Azure Pixels: 2
    *   Assessment: Output width is wrong. The program places the grey correctly, it is only the azure that is wrong. The code places the azure *on top* of the grey rather than beside.
* **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 5) \[Expected (6,5)]
    *   Grey Pixels: 3
    *   Azure Pixels: 0
    *   Assessment: The width calculation here is probably returning 5, which is correct. The program is able to arrange the grey pixels correctly. There is no test here for the azure pixels.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 070dd51e
  - objects:
      - color: grey (5)
        role: anchor # Acts as the central reference point
        properties:
          - symmetry_marker: true
          - count: variable
      - color: azure (8)
        role: dependent # Positioned relative to grey, but rules vary
        properties:
          - count: variable
          - adjacency: "important" # important to consider when there is a choice
  - actions:
      - name: extract_pixels
        description: Identify and extract grey and azure pixels.
      - name: determine_size
        description: Calculate output grid size, ensuring it's large enough for symmetric placement.
      - name: place_grey
        description: Position grey pixels, maintaining symmetry.
      - name: place_azure
        description: Position azure pixels, checking adjacency
      - name: ensure_symmetry
        description: Guarantee horizontal and vertical symmetry in the final arrangement.
  - constraints:
      - output_height: 6 # Height of the output grid is fixed
      - symmetry: "horizontal and vertical" # Arrangement MUST be symmetrical
      - color_preservation: true # Only use colors from original set of interest.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract:** Locate all azure (8) and grey (5) pixels in the input grid. Ignore all other colors.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid height is always 6.
    *   Identify distinct columns containing grey pixels. The output width will be double number of unique grey columns minus 1, unless there is only 1 column, then it should be 3.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty output grid of size 6 x Calculated Width, filled with black (0).
4.  **Place Grey Pixels:** Place the grey pixels into the output grid.
    *   There will be a grey pixel at the top most row.
    *   Maintain the relative column positions of the grey pixels.
    *   Ensure symmetry: Duplicate each grey pixel symmetrically across both the horizontal and vertical center lines of the output grid.
5.  **Place Azure Pixels:** For each azure pixel in the input, find the nearest grey pixel column.
     * Place an azure pixel adjacent to the grey pixel on the same row in the output grid. Adjacency here means side by side.
     * Maintain horizontal and vertical symmetry
6.  **Ensure Symmetry:** The final arrangement must be symmetrical across both the horizontal and vertical midlines of the output grid.
