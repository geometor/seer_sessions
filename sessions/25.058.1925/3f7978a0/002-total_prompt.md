**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes, containing pixels of colors representing digits 0, 5, and 8. The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids and contain only the colors corresponding to 5 and 8, with 0s filling the rest. The shape of the output seems to depend on the positioning of 5's and 8's in the input grid. It seems as though certain parts of input grids are being extracted.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 5, 8] # white, gray, azure
      - shape: variable
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 5, 8] # white, gray, azure
      - shape: variable, smaller than input_grid
  - relation: extraction
    description: The output_grid is a sub-grid extracted from the input_grid.
  - property: extraction_rule
    description: Select a subgrid that starts from the leftmost non-zero and the rightmost non-zero column, and the top non-zero row, and the bottom most non-zero row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundary Columns:** Find the leftmost and rightmost columns in the input grid that contain *any* non-zero values (either 5 or 8).
2.  **Identify Boundary Rows:** Find the topmost and bottommost rows in the input grid that contain *any* non-zero values (either 5 or 8).
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid (the output grid) by extracting the rectangular region defined by the identified boundary rows and columns. This subgrid will contain all rows and columns between (and including) the boundary rows and columns.
4. The size of output grid's width equals the index of the right most non-zero column minus the index of left most non-zero column plus 1, The size of output grid's height equals the index of the bottom most non-zero row minus the index of the top most non-zero row plus 1.

In simpler terms, the transformation identifies the smallest rectangle within the input grid that completely encloses all non-zero pixels, and extracts it to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
