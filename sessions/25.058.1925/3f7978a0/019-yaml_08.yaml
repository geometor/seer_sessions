          - symmetry_marker: true
          - count: variable
      - color: azure (8)
        role: dependent # Positioned relative to grey, but rules vary
        properties:
          - count: variable
          - adjacency: "important" # important to consider when there is a choice
  - actions:
      - name: extract_pixels
        description: Identify and extract grey and azure pixels.
      - name: determine_size
        description: Calculate output grid size, ensuring it's large enough for symmetric placement.
      - name: place_grey
        description: Position grey pixels, maintaining symmetry.
      - name: place_azure
        description: Position azure pixels, checking adjacency
      - name: ensure_symmetry
        description: Guarantee horizontal and vertical symmetry in the final arrangement.
  - constraints:
      - output_height: 6 # Height of the output grid is fixed
      - symmetry: "horizontal and vertical" # Arrangement MUST be symmetrical
      - color_preservation: true # Only use colors from original set of interest.
