"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) and grey (5) pixels within the input grid. Ignore all white (0) pixels.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the identified azure and grey pixels.
3.  **Vertical Mirror:** There is vertical plane dividing the grey pixels.
4.  **Create New Grid:** Create the smallest possible rectangular output grid.
5.  **Translate:** Place the extracted pixels into this new grid to form the output. The final structure must be mirrored vertically and horizontally to make it symmetrical.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
