Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large, mostly empty grid with a few scattered colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), azure (8), and grey (5). The output is a smaller grid containing only the azure and grey pixels, arranged in a specific way, surrounded by white pixels. The output seems to extract and condense the non-white pixels from the input, while maintaining a general spatial pattern related to the positions of the colors in a mirrored structure. The transformation involves a significant reduction in size, discarding the majority of the white pixels and focusing exclusively on the colored regions, and mirroring some object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [11, 13] # Input dimensions
      colors: [white, azure, grey]
    relations:
      - contains: [azure_pixels, grey_pixels, white_pixels]

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 5] # Output dimensions
      colors: [white, azure, grey]
    relations:
      - derived_from: input_grid

  - type: pixel_group
    name: azure_pixels
    properties:
      color: azure
      shape: irregular

  - type: pixel_group
    name: grey_pixels
    properties:
      color: grey
      shape: irregular

  - type: pixel_group
    name: white_pixels
    properties:
      color: white
      shape: background

actions:
  - action: extract
    agent: system
    target: [azure_pixels, grey_pixels]
    from: input_grid

  - action: arrange
    agent: system
    target: [azure_pixels, grey_pixels]
    to: output_grid

  - action: mirror
    agent: system
    target: grey_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) and grey (5) pixels within the input grid. Ignore all white (0) pixels.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the identified azure and grey pixels.
3.  **Vertical Mirror:** There is vertical plane dividing the grey pixels.
4.  **Create New Grid:** Create the smallest possible rectangular output grid.
5.  **Translate:** Place the extracted pixels into this new grid to form the output. The final structure must be mirrored vertically and horizontally to make it symmetrical.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
