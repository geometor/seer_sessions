Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 9x11 grid with pixels of colors white (0), azure (8), and gray (5).
*   **Output Grid:** A 5x7 grid with pixels of colors white (0), azure (8), and gray (5).
*   **Spatial Reduction:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
*   **Color Preservation:** The colors present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid. There are no new colors introduced.
* **Object Selection:** It seems like certain azure (8) and Grey (5) objects are selcted, and the other pixels are discarded.
*   **Relative Positioning:** The selected azure and grey objects in the output appear to maintain some of their relative positioning from the input, though condensed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    shape: irregular
    selection_criteria: unknown
  - color: gray (5)
    shape: irregular
    selection_criteria: unknown
  - color: white (0)
    shape: background
    selection_criteria: discarded

grid:
  input:
    dimensions: 9x11
  output:
    dimensions: 5x7

transformation:
  type: selection and reduction
  color_preservation: true

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize contiguous blocks of azure (8) and gray (5) pixels as distinct objects within the input grid.
2.  **Selection Rule:** Select specific azure and gray objects based on an unknown criterion. All white (0) pixels are discarded.
3. **Create subgrid:** Select only the rows and colums that contain the azure and gray objects.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid (5x7) using the subgrid.

The core challenge, and unknown in this transformation, is the specific selection rule used to determine WHICH of the azure and grey objects are included in the output. It's not based purely on size, position, or a simple pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
