"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) and grey (5) pixels within the input grid. Ignore all white (0) pixels.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the identified azure and grey pixels.
3.  **Vertical Mirror:** There is vertical plane dividing the grey pixels.
4.  **Create New Grid:** Create the smallest possible rectangular output grid.
5.  **Translate:** Place the extracted pixels into this new grid to form the output. The final structure must be mirrored vertically and horizontally to make it symmetrical.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the derived code captured the core idea of extracting azure and grey pixels and attempting a symmetrical arrangement. However, the results show inconsistencies, particularly in how the mirroring and placement logic is handled. The code makes specific assumptions about column and row positions (e.g., `col < 3`, `col > 8 and col < 12`) that are not generalizable across all examples. The code also hardcodes the output grid size, and mirroring assumptions are not correct.

The strategy to resolve these issues is as follows:

1.  **Generalized Pixel Extraction:** Refine the pixel extraction to correctly identify and separate azure and grey pixels without hardcoded positional assumptions.
2.  **Dynamic Output Grid:** Determine the output grid size dynamically based on the extracted pixels, rather than using a fixed size.
3.  **Abstract Mirroring Logic:** Develop a more generalized mirroring logic that accounts for the relative positions of the grey and azure pixels, rather than absolute positions.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each change to ensure it improves accuracy across all examples.

**Metrics and Observations (per Example)**
Here the main point is to evaluate and provide some metrics based on differences between output and expected grids.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 15x15 grid with azure and grey pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** 6x5 grid with symmetrical arrangement of azure and grey.
*   **Actual Output:** 6x5 grid, correct.
*   **Observations:** The code works for this specific case, likely because the hardcoded assumptions happen to align.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Correct Pixels: 100%
    *   Correct Positions: 100%

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 11x13 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 6x5 grid.
*   **Actual Output:** 6x5 grid, *incorrect* arrangement.
*   **Observations:** The hardcoded positional logic fails here. The azure pixels are not mirrored correctly.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Correct Pixels: 100%
    *   Correct Positions: \~33% (only grey is correct)

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 11x12 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 6x3 grid.
*   **Actual Output:** 6x5 grid, *incorrect* size and arrangement.
*   **Observations:** The output size is incorrect. The placement and mirroring of both azure and grey pixels are wrong.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Correct Pixels: 50%
    *   Correct Positions: \~17%

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify and Extract:** Locate all azure (8) and grey (5) pixels within the input grid. Disregard all other colors.
2. **Determine Relative Position**: Find the vertical center.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, initially empty, output grid. The output size must be determined based on input
4.  **Arrange Pixels:** Place the extracted azure and grey pixels into the output grid.
5.  **Symmetry:** The final arrangement in the output grid must be symmetrical both horizontally and vertically. The gray pixels seems to dictate the symmetry center.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
