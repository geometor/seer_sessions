Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 14x14. The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The transformation seems to involve replacing blue pixels with gray pixels, and some strategic placement and additions of gray pixels. The two solid rows of gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 14x14
    elements: pixels
    input_colors: [0, 1, 5] # white, blue, gray
    output_colors: [0, 5] # white, gray

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - 0 # white
        - 1 # blue
        - 5 # gray
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    agent: blue_pixel
    target: gray_pixel

  - type: copy
    agent: gray rows
    target: output

  - type: add
    agent: gray pixel
    target: output
    condition: based on blue pixel position

relationships:
    - type: adjacent
      description: blue pixels adjacent to each other are turned into grey and merged to form gray areas.
    - type: unchanged
      description: two rows of gray pixels are copied unchanged to output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Base:** Copy the two solid rows of gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.

2.  **Replace and Expand:**
    *   Iterate through the input grid.
    *   If a pixel is blue (1), change it to gray (5) in the output grid.
    *   If blue pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally, group them to create bigger gray shapes in corresponding locations of output

3. **Remove**: All blue pixels are removed or replaced.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
