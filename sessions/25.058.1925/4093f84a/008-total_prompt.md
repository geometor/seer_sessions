The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Middle Row:** Find the middle, all-gray row in the input grid. The index of this row will be used for determining the output row.

2.  **Handle Size Differences:** If the input grid has a solid gray row, copy just that row into the output grid in the single middle row.

3. **Handle other rows:** If there isn't a solid gray row, then take all rows except for the very top and very bottom row and change all pixels to gray.

4. **Red pixel rule is no longer needed**

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a middle gray row and using it to construct the output. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The presence of an all-gray row seems to trigger a specific behavior (extracting a portion of the input centered around the gray row), while the absence of such a row triggers a different behavior (creating an output of all gray pixels, with the rows between the top and bottom rows).

The core issue is that the rule isn't as simple. We need to determine how much of the input to include in the output and its dimensions.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered using `code_execution` where applicable, and observations:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 7x11, all-gray row at index 3.
*   **Output:** 3x11, all gray rows centered around the input's gray row.
*   **Code Result:** Correct. The initial logic correctly handles this case.
*   **Observation:** extracting three rows centered at all-gray row.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 9x9, no all-gray row.
*   **Output:** 7x9, all gray.
*   **Code Result:** Correct.
*    **Observation:** output grid is a copy of the input, excluding the top and bottom rows and filled with all gray.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 13x11, all-gray row at index 6.
*   **Output:** 3x11, all gray.
*   **Code Result:** Correct.
*   **Observation:** Same transformation rule as Example 1, extracting three rows centered at all-gray row.

**Example 4:**

*   **Input:** 5x13, all-gray row at index 2.
*   **Output:** 3x13, all gray.
*   **Code Result:** Correct.
*   **Observation:** Same transformation rule as Example 1 and 3, extracting three rows centered at all-gray row.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 7x11
      output_shape: 3x11
      gray_row_present: true
      gray_row_index: 3
      output_rows_extracted: 3
      output_center_row_index: 1  # Index of the original gray row within the output
  - example_2:
      input_shape: 9x9
      output_shape: 7x9
      gray_row_present: false
      output_color: gray #all gray
  - example_3:
      input_shape: 13x11
      output_shape: 3x11
      gray_row_present: true
      gray_row_index: 6
      output_rows_extracted: 3
      output_center_row_index: 1
  - example_4:
      input_shape: 5x13
      output_shape: 3x13
      gray_row_present: true
      gray_row_index: 2
      output_rows_extracted: 3
      output_center_row_index: 1

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Check for All-Gray Row:** Examine the input grid to determine if there's a row where all pixels are gray (color value 5).

2.  **Case 1: All-Gray Row Exists:**
    *   If an all-gray row exists, create a new grid with a height of 3 and the same width as the input grid.
    *   Copy the all-gray row and the row immediately above and below it from the input grid to the new output grid.
    * All copied rows should remain gray.

3.  **Case 2: No All-Gray Row:**
    *   If no all-gray row exists, create a new grid that has same width as the input grid, and the input grid's height minus 2 (remove top and bottom row).
    *   Fill all cells in the new grid with gray (color value 5).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
