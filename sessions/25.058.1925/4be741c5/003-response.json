Here's my report on the input-output pair:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input is a large grid (14x16) composed of three distinct colored regions: yellow (4), red (2), and azure (8).  The output is a much smaller grid (1x3) with one cell of each of those colors, containing a single digit representing the color. The input grid appears to be divided into three vertical sections, each dominated by one of the colors. The order of colors in the output (yellow, red, azure) matches the left-to-right order of the dominant colors in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It appears the intent is to have three sections corresponding to the colors in the output.\n2.  **Determine Color Order:** For each vertical section, identify the most frequently occurring color (the dominant color).\n3.  **Create Output:** Construct a 1x3 output grid.  The first cell should contain the value of the dominant color from the leftmost section of the input, the second cell should contain the value of the dominant color from the middle section, and the third cell should have the value of the dominant color in the rightmost section.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the representative color of each major vertical region of the input grid and presents them in a condensed, ordered sequence.\n"
