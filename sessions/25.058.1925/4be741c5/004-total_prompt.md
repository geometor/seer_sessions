Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my report on the input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (14x16) composed of three distinct colored regions: yellow (4), red (2), and azure (8).  The output is a much smaller grid (1x3) with one cell of each of those colors, containing a single digit representing the color. The input grid appears to be divided into three vertical sections, each dominated by one of the colors. The order of colors in the output (yellow, red, azure) matches the left-to-right order of the dominant colors in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 14x16
    elements:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: red (2)
      - color: azure (8)
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 1x3
    elements:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: red (2)
      - color: azure (8)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Input grid has three vertical color regions.
  - type: correspondence
    description: Output grid colors match the dominant colors in input grid's vertical regions, in left-to-right order.
  - type: reduction
    description: output grid is much small than the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Dominant Colors:** Divide the input grid conceptually into vertical sections.  It appears the intent is to have three sections corresponding to the colors in the output.
2.  **Determine Color Order:** For each vertical section, identify the most frequently occurring color (the dominant color).
3.  **Create Output:** Construct a 1x3 output grid.  The first cell should contain the value of the dominant color from the leftmost section of the input, the second cell should contain the value of the dominant color from the middle section, and the third cell should have the value of the dominant color in the rightmost section.

In essence, the transformation extracts the representative color of each major vertical region of the input grid and presents them in a condensed, ordered sequence.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
