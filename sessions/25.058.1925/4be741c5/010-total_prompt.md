**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x576 at 0x78E5F20EEDD0>

**output:**
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x192 at 0x78E5F214A9D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 2D grid of colored pixels, with values ranging from 0-9, representing different colors. The output appears to be a condensed, single-column representation of the input, containing only unique colors present in the input, ordered in a particular way. The colors in the output grid match the unique colors that appear in the original grid, ordered from top-to-bottom, based on their first appearance.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 7] # Height, Width
      elements: pixels
      colors: [2, 8, 5]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color_id: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - name: extract_unique_colors
    description: Identify all unique colors present in the input grid.
  - name: order_colors
    description: order the colors based on their first appearance, iterating from top-to-bottom and left-to-right

  - name: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid with a single column.
    parameters:
      height: number of unique_colors
      width: 1

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple pixels of potentially different colors.
  - output_grid: contains single column, each row shows a unique color.
  - color_order: determined by the first appearance in the input grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Unique Colors:** Scan the input grid from top to bottom, and left to right. Record each unique color encountered.
2. **Order Unique Colors:** Maintain the order of the unique colors as they first appear in the scan.
3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a single column. The height of the new grid will be the number of unique colors.
4. **Populate Output:** Fill each cell of the output grid (from top to bottom) with a unique color, based on the order determined in step 2.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the unique colors from the input grid, preserving their order of first appearance, and arranges them vertically in a new, single-column grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
