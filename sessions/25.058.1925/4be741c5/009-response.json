The output appears to be a condensed, single-column representation of the input, containing only unique colors present in the input, ordered in a particular way. The colors in the output grid match the unique colors that appear in the original grid, ordered from top-to-bottom, based on their first appearance.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Record each unique color encountered.\n2. **Order Unique Colors:** Maintain the order of the unique colors as they first appear in the scan.\n3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a single column. The height of the new grid will be the number of unique colors.\n4. **Populate Output:** Fill each cell of the output grid (from top to bottom) with a unique color, based on the order determined in step 2.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the unique colors from the input grid, preserving their order of first appearance, and arranges them vertically in a new, single-column grid.\n"
