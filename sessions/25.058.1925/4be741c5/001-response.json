The output grid seems to represent a summary or deconstruction of the distinct colors present in the input grid. The spatial arrangement of colors within the input grid appears to determine the arrangement of the output. The output dimensions are significantly smaller. The output appears to list, in order, every unique color that appears in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Add a color to the unique color set if it has not been added previously.\n3. **Order unique colors** Create an ordered list of the colors in order of apperance.\n4. **Create the Output Grid:** Create output grid.\n   - if the colors are arranged in blocks that fill columns, output grid will be 1 x *n*, where *n* is the number of unique colors.\n   - if the colors are arrnaged in blocks that fill rows, the output grid will be *n* x 1.\n   - place each color from the ordered color list into the output in sequence.\n\n"
