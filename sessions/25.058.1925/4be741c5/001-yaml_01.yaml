objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: pixels (integers 0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        - dimensions: (height, width)
        - color_distribution: (unique colors and their locations)

actions:
  - identify_unique_colors:
      input: input grid
      output: set of unique color values
  - order_colors:
      input: set of colors
      output: ordered list of colors
      criteria: the order colors are encountered top to bottom, then left to right
  - create_output_grid:
      input: ordered list of colors
      output: output grid
      rule: "each unique color is represented by a single pixel in a sequence.
            Example 1 creates a 1 x 3 grid. Examples 2 & 3 create grids of 3 x 1 and 4 x 1"

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: "The output grid represents a vertical or horizontal sequence of the unique colors found in the input grid, ordered by their appearance."
