The output seems to list the colors present in the input, but only once for each distinct color, and the sequence is ordered from top to bottom based on where the color first appears. The height of each colored segment in output corresponds to how many times that number appears in the sequence when you select the first instance of each number.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Stack the numbers collected vertically.\n\nEssentially the program reads the entire input grid, determines the unique colors in the specific order they appear from top to bottom, and produces a condensed 1D grid with each number, representing the colors.\n"
