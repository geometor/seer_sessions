The most prominent visual elements are:\n\n1.  **Background:** A consistent background that is either azure (8) or white(0) that has solid filled horizontal bars, 4 rows thick.\n2. **Rectangular Shapes:** There are filled rectangles of different colors.\n3.  **Color Changes:** Certain colors within the rectangles seem to be swapped or altered.\n4.  **Consistent Grid Structure**: The overall grid dimensions and the positions of solid filled horizontal bar shape relative to rectangular shapes, remain consistent between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
