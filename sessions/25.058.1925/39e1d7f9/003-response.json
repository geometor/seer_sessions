The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), green (3), and magenta (6). There appear to be rectangular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve a color swap or a shift within some of the colored shapes, specifically, the magenta(6) and green(3) shapes in the lower right quadrant..\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
