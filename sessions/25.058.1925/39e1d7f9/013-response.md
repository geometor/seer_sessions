Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved shifting magenta rectangles one cell to the right within a green background. The subsequent tests reveal that this rule doesn't fully capture the transformation in all cases. Specifically, example 2 has revealed a flaw in the program, where the magenta object overlaps itself after the shift.

The strategy to resolve this is to carefully analyze each example where the current code fails. We'll examine the input, expected output, and actual output to identify the discrepancies. We'll then update the natural language program to incorporate the missing or incorrect logic. This will likely involve refining the conditions under which objects are moved and how overlapping is handled.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

  print(array_to_string(input_grid))
  print(f"{'expected':=<40}")

  print(f"{'actual':=<40}")
