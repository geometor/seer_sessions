Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is divided into frames by vertical azure (8) columns and horizontal azure rows.
Within each frame, identify any 3x3 blocks of yellow (4) or red (2).
Consider sets of colors that are not azure (8). Within each vertical set of frames, there are blocks that start with red (2) and yellow(4). Swap those colors, such that anything that was yellow becomes red and anything red becomes yellow. The frames themselves remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
