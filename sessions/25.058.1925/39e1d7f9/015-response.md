Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 27x27 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of colors azure (8), red (2), yellow(4) and white (0).
*   **Objects:** There appear to be distinct rectangular regions of uniform color (azure, red, yellow). The azure regions are the most common and form vertical columns of consistent width. The solid azure rows act as separators.
*   **Transformation:** Colors within the azure "frames" seem to be swapped based on some logic.

**YAML Fact Block:**

      color: yellow
      initial_position: [20, 16]
      initial_height: 3
      initial_width: 3

actions:
  - type: color_swap
    agent: red_block_1
    target: yellow_blocks # all of them
    condition: within azure frame

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: azure columns and rows creates a grid of frames.
    - type: containment
      description: red and yellow blocks are contained within individual frames formed by azure columns.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Frames:** The input grid is divided into frames by vertical azure (8) columns and horizontal azure rows.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Within each frame, identify any 3x3 blocks of yellow (4) or red (2).
3.  **Conditional Swap:** Consider sets of colors that are not azure (8). Within each vertical set of frames, there are blocks that start with red (2) and yellow(4). Swap those colors, such that anything that was yellow becomes red and anything red becomes yellow. The frames themselves remain unchanged.

In simple words - swap all reds and yellows with each other, while they stay in the same place.
