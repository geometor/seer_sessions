"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the contiguous magenta (color 6) object and the surrounding yellow (color 4) object. Consider these as a single combined object.
2.  **Expand Magenta:** Expand the magenta object by one pixel in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right). The expanded magenta pixels will occupy positions previously held by yellow.
3.  **Move Up:** Shift the resulting combined object (expanded magenta and remaining yellow) upwards by one row. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs reasonably well on the first example, which guided its initial design. However, the subsequent examples reveal limitations in the current approach. The primary issue seems to be a too-rigid definition of the "combined object."  The initial program assumes the magenta object is *always* surrounded by yellow, and the expansion and movement logic is tightly coupled to this assumption. The other examples show variations where this isn't the case, and where the object interactions are more complex. The code also has some boundary condition issues, sometimes incorrectly applying changes at the edges.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Decouple Object Identification and Expansion:** Instead of assuming magenta is always surrounded by yellow, identify each object (magenta and any adjacent colors) independently. Then, expand the magenta object.

2.  **Generalized Movement:** Instead of hardcoding a one-pixel upward shift, determine the movement rule based on a more general pattern observable across *all* examples.

3.  **Handle Boundary Conditions:** Ensure the code correctly handles cases where objects are near the edges of the grid, preventing out-of-bounds errors and ensuring correct wrapping or stopping behavior.

4. **Flexible object detection** instead of only considering yellow, look for all colors and object interactions.

**Metrics and Observations (using assumed code execution - will be replaced):**

I will structure this as if I had run code to compute these metrics, as that's the instruction. Since I cannot *actually* run code in this turn, the values are based on visual inspection and will be validated in subsequent steps.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Magenta Object: Present, expanded correctly.
    *   Yellow Object: Present, interacts with magenta as expected.
    *   Movement: Upward shift of 1, correct.
    *   Result: Success.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Magenta Object: Present, expanded correctly.
    *   Blue Object: Present. interaction needs work.
    *   Movement: Upward shift of 1, correct.
    *   Result: Partial Success - expansion correct, object handling and movement logic are failing to correctly handle interaction with blue object.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Magenta Object: Present, expanded correctly.
    *    Blue Object: Present. interaction needs work
    *   Movement: Upward shift of 1, correct.
    *   Result: Partial Success - magenta expands, but parts of the object that should move do not.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Magenta Object:** Locate the contiguous region of magenta (color 6) pixels.

2.  **Expand Magenta:** Expand the magenta object by one pixel in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right).

3. **Identify adjacent objects:** locate all objects adjacent to the magenta object, before and after expansion.

4.  **Move Combined Object:** Shift the expanded magenta object, and any objects that were adjacent to the *original* magenta object, upwards by one row. Pixels of the objects retain their original color.

5.  **Preserve Unmoved:** Any pixels not part of the moved objects should retain their original color and position in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
