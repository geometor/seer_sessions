Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and orange (7).
*   The input grid has a central object composed of red and orange pixels.
*   The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some changes in the arrangement of red and orange pixels. The general shape is retained.
*   Specifically the red square "grows" and the orange square inverts around its center.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    colors: [white, red, orange]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    colors: [white, red, orange]

  - name: red_square
    type: shape
    color: red
    initial_position: center of input_grid
    initial_size: 4x4

  - name: orange_square
    type: shape
    color: orange
    initial_position: center of red_square
    initial_size: 2x2

actions:
  - name: expand
    object: red_square
    description: The red square expands by one layer outwards in all directions, maintaining contact with the existing red and orange parts.

  - name: invert
    object: orange_square
    description: The orange square's corner pixels are swapped with the center pixels in a way such as to maintain the structure.

relationships:
  - output_grid is a transformation of input_grid
  - red_square contains orange_square
  - expansion and inversion maintain relative positions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the central red square (color 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the central orange square (color 7) within the red square.
3.  **Expand** the red square. The original red square expands by adding red color on the outside in a single layer expansion. The red area makes contact with the original shape on all sides.
4.  **Invert** the orange square. Take the orange 2x2 square and make it's corners orange, and the center red.
5.  **Combine**: The expanded red square and modified orange square form a "single object."
6. The positions relative to one another are maintained.
7.  **Place** the resulting combined shape in the center of the output grid, replacing the corresponding pixels in the input grid.
8. The background is unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
