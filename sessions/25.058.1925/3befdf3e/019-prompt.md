Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the inner blue rectangle and the outer rectangle (which can be green, red, or yellow).
2.  **Perimeter Expansion:** Expand the inner blue rectangle by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), creating an expanded region.
3.  **Property Transfer:** The expanded region takes on the color of the *outer* rectangle's border cells. The key here is considering the outer, not inner object.
4. **Output:** Combine the expanded region and the original inner rectangle, with the expanded region now colored according to step 3. The output will be a rectangle, colored the adjacent color of the original outer rectangle, containing a centered blue rectangle of the original dimensions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
