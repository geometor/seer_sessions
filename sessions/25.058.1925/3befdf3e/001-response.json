The transformation appears to operate on a central \"object\" within the grid, expanding it outwards while also shifting other pixels. The core concept seems to be an \"inner\" shape surrounded by an \"outer\" shape. The transformation expands the inner shape and adjusts the outer shape accordingly. The background (pixels with value 0) remains largely unchanged, except where the expanding shapes take over.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

The new border is same color as the original outer shape.\n\n5.  **Background Remains:** All other pixels, which represent the background (value 0), remain unchanged.\n\nIn summary, the inner shape expands by one layer, consuming the innermost layer of the outer shape. The outer shape then shifts outwards by one layer, maintaining its original color. The background (0) is preserved except where overwritten by expansion.\n"
