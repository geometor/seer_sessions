Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the inner blue rectangle and the outer green rectangle.
2.  **Perimeter Expansion:** Create a one-cell perimeter around the inner blue rectangle. This is done by expanding the inner rectangle by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
3.  **Property Transfer** The region of expansion takes the background color and copies the colors on cells adjacent to the original outer object, in this case the original outer rectangle. In the example shown, the expanded cells become green.
4.  **Output:** combine the expanded region object, the inner rectangle and the background.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, and while it worked for that specific case, it fails to generalize to other examples in the training set. The primary issue lies in the assumption that the expanded region always takes the color of the outer rectangle's adjacent cells. The other examples reveal that this is not a fixed rule. It depends on the context. It also seems like the outer rectangle is a governing concept that is not properly considered.

Here's the strategy to address these issues:

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the expansion color is determined. The outer rectangle is involved.
2.  **Identify Alternative Rules:** Instead of assuming the expansion color, consider alternative rules based on location, or other factors.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the generalized transformation rule. Be specific about the conditions under which different colors are applied.
4. **Gather Object Descriptions** Enumerate the properties of the input and output, including height, width, area, and any discovered errors.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here, I'll provide concise observations about each example. I will try to run the code in my head, and compare the `transform()` output to the actual example output.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Inner blue rectangle, outer green rectangle.
    *   Expected Output: Inner blue rectangle expanded by one cell in all directions, with the expanded area colored green.
    *   `transform()` Output: Correct.
    *   Observation: Expansion takes the color adjacent to the outer rectangle, not the inner.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Inner blue rectangle, outer red rectangle.
    *   Expected Output: Inner blue rectangle expanded by one cell, with the expanded area colored red.
    *   `transform()` Output: Incorrect. The expanded area should be red, matching the adjacent color of the outer rectangle. The code likely outputs the wrong color due to selecting the wrong object to get the adjacent colors.
    *   Observation: Expansion takes the color adjacent to the outer rectangle, not the inner.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Inner blue rectangle, outer yellow rectangle.
    *   Expected Output: Inner blue rectangle expanded, with expanded area colored yellow.
    *   `transform()` Output: Incorrect. Similar issue as Example 2.
    *   Observation: Expansion takes the color adjacent to the outer rectangle, not the inner.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the inner blue rectangle and the outer rectangle (which can be green, red, or yellow).
2.  **Perimeter Expansion:** Expand the inner blue rectangle by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), creating an expanded region.
3.  **Property Transfer:** The expanded region takes on the color of the *outer* rectangle's border cells. The key here is considering the outer, not inner object.
4. **Output:** Combine the expanded region and the original inner rectangle, with the expanded region now colored according to step 3. The output will be a rectangle, colored the adjacent color of the original outer rectangle, containing a centered blue rectangle of the original dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
