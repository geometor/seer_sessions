facts:
  - object: inner_shape
    properties:
      - color: varies (6 in example 1, 7 in example 2, 1 in example 3)
      - shape: contiguous block, typically square-like
      - location: centered within the outer_shape
    actions:
      - expands: grows outwards by one layer
  - object: outer_shape
    properties:
      - color: varies (4 in example 1, 2 in example 2, 3 in example 3)
      - shape: surrounds the inner_shape, forming a border
      - location: adjacent to the inner_shape
    actions:
      - shifts: moves outwards to accommodate the expanding inner_shape, maintaining its border shape
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - shape: fills the remaining grid space
    actions:
      - passive: remains unchanged unless overwritten by expanding shapes

  - relation: inner_outer_adjacency
    description: The outer_shape is directly adjacent to the inner_shape, forming a continuous border.

  - relation: background_fill
    description: the background occupies all the cells not containing an object
