Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the inner blue rectangle and the outer green rectangle.
2.  **Perimeter Expansion:** Create a one-cell perimeter around the inner blue rectangle. This is done by expanding the inner rectangle by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
3.  **Property Transfer** The region of expansion takes the background color and copies the colors on cells adjacent to the original outer object, in this case the original outer rectangle. In the example shown, the expanded cells become green.
4.  **Output:** combine the expanded region object, the inner rectangle and the background.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
