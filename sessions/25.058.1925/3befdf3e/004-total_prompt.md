Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain numerical values representing colors.
*   The input grid has a central shape composed of yellow (4) and magenta (6) pixels.
*   The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, with the shape shifted and expanded. Specifically, the magenta (6) seems to be expanded.
*   The background is white (0) in both input and output, and the main feature is an "object"

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static

  - name: shape_1
    color: yellow (4)
    property: encloses shape_2

  - name: shape_2
    color: magenta (6)
    property: enclosed by shape_1

actions:
    - name: expand
      target: shape_2
      description: shape_2 expands outwards by one unit in all orthogonal directions

    - name: move up
      target: combined shape
      description: shape_1 and shape_2 move upwards by one unit

relationships:
  - shape_1 contains shape_2
  - shape_1 and shape_2 are adjacent

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the inner magenta (6) shape (shape_2) and the surrounding yellow (4) shape. (shape_1).
2.  **Expand** the magenta shape (shape_2) outwards by one pixel in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The magenta shape will replace elements of the yellow shape.
3.  **Move** the entire combined shape, which now consists of expanded magenta, and the remaining yellow one row up.
4. Any rows that are above or below this area are not modified


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
