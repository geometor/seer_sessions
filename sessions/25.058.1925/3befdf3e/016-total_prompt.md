Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are green (3), blue (1), and white (0). There's a clear geometric structure: a green rectangle encloses a blue rectangle in the input. The output seems to be a modified version of this structure, with an expansion and some color changes. The transformation is not a simple rotation or reflection. It appears that it might involve an operation to expand around the perimeter of an inner object and transfer properties of adjacent objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: outer_rectangle
    type: rectangle
    color: green (3)
    initial_position: row 3-6, col 2-5
    final_position: row 1-8, col 1-7 #expanded to take the majority 
  - name: inner_rectangle
    type: rectangle
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: row 4-5, col 3-4
    final_position: row 3-6, col 2-5 #it seems the blue square remains the central object
  - name: background
    type: grid_fill
    color: white (0)
    initial_position: all other cells
    final_position: cells not occupied by other objects
  - name: perimeter
    type: expansion
    initial_object: inner_rectangle
    final_object: outer_rectangle #outer rectangle takes on perimeter shape

actions:
  - type: expansion
    target: perimeter
    description: the perimeter is created by 1 cell expansion of the inner rectangle
  - type: property_transfer
    source: initial_outer_rectangle
    target: perimeter
    properties: color
    description: The created perimeter will copy the color that makes contact with the background
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the inner blue rectangle and the outer green rectangle.
2.  **Perimeter Expansion:** Create a one-cell perimeter around the inner blue rectangle. This is done by expanding the inner rectangle by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
3.  **Property Transfer** The region of expansion takes the background color and copies the colors on cells adjacent to the original outer object, in this case the original outer rectangle. In the example shown, the expanded cells become green.
4.  **Output:** combine the expanded region object, the inner rectangle and the background.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
