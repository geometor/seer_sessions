Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary visual elements are:

*   **Colored Regions:** Groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.
*   **Shapes:** The colored regions form distinct shapes. There is one particular grey vertical line.
*    A significant portion of both grids is filled with 0 (white), acting as background.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains a vertical gray line of color 5 at x=4
  - observation: |
      The area to the left of the gray line forms colored regions.
  - observation: |
      There are some blue pixels towards the right, that are of color 1.
  - object: grey_line
    type: vertical_line
    color: 5
    x_position: 4
    description: |
      A vertical line of constant color 5, acting as a separator.
  - object: left_region
    description: |
      The region to the left of the grey_line, containing various colored shapes.
  - object: right_region
    description: |
        All values to right of grey line, including and to right of any blue
        pixels.
  - action: copy_with_modification
    description: |
       Copy and then shift the left region after the grey line, to fill the space until the next blue pixel.
       If there are no more blue pixels fill with the pattern, and repeat.
  - relationship:
      left_region is copied to the right_region, with wrapping and repetition.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Separator:** Locate the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid. This line is at a constant x-coordinate (x=4 in this example).

2.  **Define Left Region:** Consider all pixels to the left of the gray line as the "source" or "left" region.

3.  **Copy and Shift:** Copy the pattern of the left region, and place it directly to the right of the grey line.

4.   **Repeat, wrap and fill.**
    -    If there is a blue pixel in the region to the right, copy only until one
         column before.
    -    If there are no more blue pixels, or the end of the line, continue the
         pattern.
    -    Wrap if needed and continue until reaching the edge of the output.

In essence, the transformation replicates the left region's pattern to the right of the gray line, repeating and wrapping horizontally, until the end, accounting for any other objects (blue).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
