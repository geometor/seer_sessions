Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Separator:** Find a vertical line within the input grid where all pixels on that line share the same color. This is the separator.
2.  **Define Repeating Unit:** The region to the left of the separator is the "repeating unit".
3. **Copy Original Grid:** Copy all parts of original input grid to output grid, except for the separator column, which is skipped.
4.  **Repeat Pattern:** Copy the repeating unit and place it directly to the right of the separator in the output grid.
5.  **Wrap and Fill:** Continue repeating the repeating unit horizontally. When the right edge of the grid is reached, wrap to the next row down, starting at the column immediately to the right of the separator.
6. **Output Dimensions:** The output grid maintains the original dimensions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
