    properties:
      - colors: [grey, blue, red, green, orange]
      - dimensions: 9x13
      - regions:
          - name: top_left_cluster
            colors: [red, green, orange]
            shape: irregular
            location: top-left corner
          - name: grey_region
            color: grey
            shape: large rectangular area filling most of the grid

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [grey, red, green, orange]
      - dimensions: 9x13
      - regions:
        - name: replicated_cluster
          colors: [ red, green, orange]
          shape: arrangement based on top_left_cluster
actions:
  - name: replication
    description: copying and pasting a cluster multiple times to new location

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: top_left_cluster in input_grid is replicated and rearranged in output_grid
  - type: partial_match
    relation: the grey background of the original is gone in the ouput - replaced by replicated subgrids
