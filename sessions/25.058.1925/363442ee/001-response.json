There's a consistent vertical gray (5) column separating two regions within each grid. The input grids contain blue (1) pixels, seemingly at random locations, to the right of the dividing gray column. These pixels disappear in the output. The left side region relative to the separator is copied and either placed to the right of the separator column, or to both right and below it. The regions with copied colors seems to maintain shape, which is either L-shaped or a reverse L.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
