Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids contain two distinct shapes, each formed by a contiguous block of a single color. One shape is always larger and 'L' shaped, while the smaller shape comprises the output and is always a 2x2 block of the same color. The background is always white (0).  The colors of the shapes vary across examples, but the output always matches the color of the larger "L" shaped object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: LargeShape
    type: L-shaped block
    properties:
      color: variable (orange, azure, magenta, yellow)
      size: variable
      position: variable
  - name: SmallShape
    type: 2x2 square block
    properties:
      color: variable (orange, azure, magenta, yellow)
      size: fixed (2x2)
      position: variable
  - name: Background
    type: grid
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      size: variable (10x10)
      position: fixed

actions:
  - name: Extract
    description: Isolate the color of the LargeShape.

relations:
  - subject: SmallShape
    predicate: has_same_color_as
    object: LargeShape
  - subject: Output
    predicate: is
    object: SmallShape

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the LargeShape:** Find the largest contiguous block of non-white pixels forming an "L" shape.
2.  **Determine the Target Color**: Note the color value of the LargeShape.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 2x2 grid.
4.  **Color the Output:** Fill all cells in the 2x2 with the Target Color

In simpler terms: The output is a 2x2 square of pixels that has the same color as the larger L-shaped object in the input.
