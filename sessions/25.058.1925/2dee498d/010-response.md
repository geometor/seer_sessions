"""
The transformation selects three columns from the input grid to construct the output grid. The height of the grids remains the same. The selection isn't based purely on fixed column indices, but the order is consistent:

1.  The first column of the output grid is always the first column of the input grid.
2.  The second column of the output grid is always the *last* column of the input grid.
3. The third column of the output grid is a column from the input grid, that *isn't* the first or the last. In example two, this is the 2nd column; in example three this is the 6th column.
