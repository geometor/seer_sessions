Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts specific columns from the input grid to create the output grid. Specifically, it takes the first, third, and last (ninth) columns of the input grid and arranges them sequentially to form the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts the first, third, and last columns of the input grid to form the output grid.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Get the height and width of the input grid
    height, width = input_array.shape

    # Identify the columns to extract: first (0), third (2), and last (width - 1)
    selected_columns = [0, 2, width - 1]

    # Initialize an empty output grid (using a list of lists for now)
    output_grid = []

    # Iterate through the rows of the input grid
    for row in input_array:
        # Create a new row for the output grid
        output_row = []
        # Add the pixels from the selected columns to the output row
        for col_index in selected_columns:
            output_row.append(row[col_index])
        # Add the output row to the output grid
        output_grid.append(output_row)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
