**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements of this task appear to be 2D grids of colored pixels. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the width of the grid. The colors within the grid are maintained during this reduction. The height remains the same. The reduction in width isn't a simple cropping, but instead it looks like multiple columns are somehow merged or represented in a new grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: 2D grid
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (representing colors)
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
    behavior:
      - transformation: width reduction

observations:
  - input_grids:
    - grid1: {height: 3, width: 9}
    - grid2: {height: 4, width: 12}
    - grid3: {height: 2, width: 6}
  - output_grids:
    - grid1: {height: 3, width: 3}
    - grid2: {height: 4, width: 4}
    - grid3: {height: 2, width: 2}
  - transformation_rule:
    - description: The output grid's width is the input grid's width divided by 3. The height is the same.
    - operation: column_grouping

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule consistently reduces the width of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has a width that is one-third the width of the input grid, keeping three consecutive input columns and collapsing them to first one. The height of the grid remains unchanged. The program takes every three consecutive columns from the input grid, looks at first column of each group of three, then creates a new grid consisting of only those first columns.

Example:

*   **Train_1:** Input is 9x3, Output is 3x3 (9 / 3 = 3)
*    Take columns 1,2,3 and reduce to column 1
*   **Train_2:** Input is 12x4, Output is 4x4 (12 / 3 = 4)
*   **Train_3:** Input is 6x2, Output is 2x2 (6 / 3 = 2)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
