The input grid appears to be a larger, more detailed version of the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified or \"compressed\" version of the input, retaining only certain key features or pixels. The colors present are yellow (4), gray (5), and blue (1).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, it takes the first, third, and last (ninth) columns of the input grid and arranges them sequentially to form the output grid. This effectively performs a very specific type of down-sampling or feature extraction, where the \"feature\" is the presence of pixels in selected columns.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Columns:** From the input grid, select columns at indices 0, 2, and 8 (starting index is 0).\n2.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid consisting only of the selected columns, preserving their original row order.\n3.  **Result:**  The output grid is a 3x3 grid composed of the values in the identified columns.\n"
