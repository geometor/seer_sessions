**input:**
```
2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x256 at 0x78E5F20733D0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x78E5F20701D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grid is wider than the output grid. It appears that the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid, retaining only the leftmost portion. The colors and their relative positions within the retained section seem to be preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array of pixels
      - colors: integers representing colors (0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 4: yellow)
    actions:
      - cropping: reducing the width of the grid
    relationships:
      - input_grid: larger grid
      - output_grid: smaller, cropped grid derived from input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the width of the output grid.
3.  **Crop** the input grid, keeping only the columns from the left edge up to the width of the output grid.
4.  **Output** the cropped portion as the new grid.

In essence, the transformation is a simple cropping operation, preserving the leftmost part of the input grid and discarding the rest. The width is reduced, while the height remains constant.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
