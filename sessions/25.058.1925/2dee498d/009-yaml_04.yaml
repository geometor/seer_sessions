facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid consistently has a width of 3, while the input grid width varies.
  - observation: |
      Not all colors present in the input grid appear in the output grid.  This suggests a filtering or selection process based on color or column content.
  - observation: |
    The height of the output grid always matches height of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      In the first example, the 1st, 3rd, and last input columns formed the output.
  - observation: |
      In the second example, the 1st, 2nd, and last input columns *almost* form the output, but the order is important: input columns 1, last, then 2, form the output columns 1, 2, and 3.
  - observation: |
     In the third example, the order is important: columns 1, last, then 6 form the output columns 1, 2, and 3.
