Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation selects three columns from the input grid to construct the output grid. The height of the grids remains the same. The selection isn't based purely on fixed column indices, but the order is consistent:

1.  The first column of the output grid is always the first column of the input grid.
2.  The second column of the output grid is always the *last* column of the input grid.
3. The third column of the output grid is a column from the input grid, that *isn't* the first or the last. In example two, this is the 2nd column; in example three this is the 6th column.

    first_column = input_array[:, 0]

    # 2. Get the last column of the input

    # 3. Determine the "middle" column to select (placeholder logic)
    # This part needs further refinement based on the test example.
    # For now, prioritize examples 2 and 3

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
