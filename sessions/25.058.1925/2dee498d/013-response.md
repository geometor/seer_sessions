Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grid is wider than the output grid. It appears that the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid, retaining only the leftmost portion. The colors and their relative positions within the retained section seem to be preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array of pixels
      - colors: integers representing colors (0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 4: yellow)
    actions:
      - cropping: reducing the width of the grid
    relationships:
      - input_grid: larger grid
      - output_grid: smaller, cropped grid derived from input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the width of the output grid.
3.  **Crop** the input grid, keeping only the columns from the left edge up to the width of the output grid.
4.  **Output** the cropped portion as the new grid.

In essence, the transformation is a simple cropping operation, preserving the leftmost part of the input grid and discarding the rest. The width is reduced, while the height remains constant.
