The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the width of the grid. The colors within the grid are maintained during this reduction. The height remains the same. The reduction in width isn't a simple cropping, but instead it looks like multiple columns are somehow merged or represented in a new grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, the output grid has a width that is one-third the width of the input grid, keeping three consecutive input columns and collapsing them to first one. The height of the grid remains unchanged. The program takes every three consecutive columns from the input grid, looks at first column of each group of three, then creates a new grid consisting of only those first columns.\n\nExample:\n\n*   **Train_1:** Input is 9x3, Output is 3x3 (9 / 3 = 3)\n*    Take columns 1,2,3 and reduce to column 1\n*   **Train_2:** Input is 12x4, Output is 4x4 (12 / 3 = 4)\n*   **Train_3:** Input is 6x2, Output is 2x2 (6 / 3 = 2)\n"
