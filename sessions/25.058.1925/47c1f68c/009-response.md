Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a modified, perhaps rotated or reflected, version of a subset of elements of the input grid. It mainly contains azure(8) and white (0). The positions of non-zero colors look strategically, or geometrically, transformed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains various colors, with notable presence of green(3) and azure(8) in specific shapes.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains mostly azure(8) and white(0), appears to derive from the input_grid in a patterned way.
  - object: cross_shape
    type: structure in input grid
    description: Formed by azure (8) pixels in the input. It's a centered cross.
  - object: green_block
    type: structure
    description: top left corner of the input grid
  - action: transformation
    type: geometric/positional
    description: Select the azure(8) colored cells and transpose them based on their position in the cross to build the output. The green is removed, and there is a type of X pattern in the placement of the 8's in output.
  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived by extracting and restructuring the azure(8) cells and potentially inverting/flipping the layout to create the pattern in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the cross shape formed by the azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid. This cross is defined by a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at the center.

2. **Remove non-cross:** Remove all colors that are not a part of the cross.

3.  **Transpose/Flip:** Create an X shape. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, mirroring the cross shape from azure to white, except every other pixel on each of the four lines are azure colored.

4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with white (0).
