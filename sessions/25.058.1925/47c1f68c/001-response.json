The most prominent feature is a cross-like structure formed by a single color in each input grid. This cross is consistently present but changes in color and position across the examples. The transformation seems to involve rotating or mirroring this cross and potentially reducing its size or \"thickness\". The background, represented by '0' (white), is also a crucial element, as the cross's transformation modifies it. There are also isolated colored regions separate from the main cross.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This is defined as a continuous horizontal and vertical line of the same non-zero color intersecting at a single point.\n2. **Remove Other Objects** Remove any single or multi-colored objects that do not form part of the cross structure.\n3.  **Rotate:** Rotate the cross 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. **Maintain Cross, Reduce thickness.** The output is a cross structure, however, the thickness should be at most one cell. In other words, the output should be a rotated cross with no 2x2 same colored cells, besides white(0).\n5.  **Output:** Generate the output grid with the rotated and potentially resized cross.\n"
