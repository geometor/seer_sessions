facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains various colors, with notable presence of green(3) and azure(8) in specific shapes.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains mostly azure(8) and white(0), appears to derive from the input_grid in a patterned way.
  - object: cross_shape
    type: structure in input grid
    description: Formed by azure (8) pixels in the input. It's a centered cross.
  - object: green_block
    type: structure
    description: top left corner of the input grid
  - action: transformation
    type: geometric/positional
    description: Select the azure(8) colored cells and transpose them based on their position in the cross to build the output. The green is removed, and there is a type of X pattern in the placement of the 8's in output.
  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived by extracting and restructuring the azure(8) cells and potentially inverting/flipping the layout to create the pattern in the output.
