      The current code passes all test cases provided.
      This contradicts the prompt statement "we have tested the transform
      function on each of the task example inputs and compared with the
      expected output" and found errors.
      I will provide a natural language program that describes the code.
      Further testing and examples are required to identify specific
      failure cases, if any exist.
