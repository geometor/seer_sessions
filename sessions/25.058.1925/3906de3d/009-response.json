The dominant colors are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grid contains a blue shape at the top and a disjointed red shape at the bottom. The output grid seems to consolidate the red into the blue shape, seemingly \"transferring\" the red color upwards. The overall grid size remains the same.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The remaining pixels are white (color 0).\n\n2.  **Locate Red:** Find the red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.\n\n3.  **Transfer:**  For each red pixel in the input, find the closest blue pixel (color 1) located vertically upwards from the original red position and change that pixel and possibly some of the pixels below to be 2. If a blue pixel already has a red color, just change the blue pixels upwards from that position, too. If there is no blue pixel to find, traverse up to the same height as where the blue region started and find the nearest blue pixel.\n\n4.  **Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Copy the original blue and white pixels from the input to the output. Then set pixels based on previous step.\n\nIn simpler term, move all reds upwards within or adjacent to the original outline of blue pixels, creating a contiguous red shape. The blue pixels are changed to be red until the height of input red is reached.\n"
