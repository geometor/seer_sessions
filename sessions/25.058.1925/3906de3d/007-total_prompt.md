Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Find the blue rectangle. This object does not move.
2.  **Identify moving objects:** Identify other rectangular objects and vertical lines, and their colors.
3.  **Move Objects:** All rectangular objects of other colors below the blue rectangle should move, with the object closest to the blue one positioned immediately beneath it. The relative vertical positions of these moved objects should be maintained. Any vertical lines of other colors should move to maintain vertical order.
4.  **Background Remains:** The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
