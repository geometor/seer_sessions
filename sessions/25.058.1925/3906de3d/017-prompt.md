Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into two regions: a "blue region" in the top-left and a "red region" in the bottom-right.
2. **Color Swap, Blue with white:** Scan the original "Blue Region". Inside that region, search for white pixels (0). If some are to the right of the blue pixels and above the main horizontal center, then change the blue pixel to it's right, to red (2)
3.  **Color Swap, Blue with Red:**. Scan the original "Red Region". Inside that region, search for white pixels (0). If some are to the left of red pixels (2), swap the color of those red pixel for blue.
4. Leave the rest as is

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
