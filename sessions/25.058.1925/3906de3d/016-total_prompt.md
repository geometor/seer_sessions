Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves two 10x10 grids. The input grid contains three distinct colors: white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid also contains the same three colors but in a different arrangement. It appears the transformation involves a color swap and possibly some movement or shifting of colored regions based on location. I need to find what triggers those shifts.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 1, 2]
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            2: red

  - name: blue_region
    type: object
    properties:
     - shape: irregular
     - location: top-left quadrant

  - name: red_region
    type: object
    properties:
        -shape: irregular
        - location: bottom-right quadrant

actions:
  - name: color_swap
    type: transformation
    description: Swaps colors of pixels based on a certain rule.
    parameters:
      - original_color: [0,1,2]
      - target_color: [0,1,2]

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: The blue and red regions are initially separated.
     elements:
        - blue_region
        - red_region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into two regions: a "blue region" in the top-left and a "red region" in the bottom-right.
2. **Color Swap, Blue with white:** Scan the original "Blue Region". Inside that region, search for white pixels (0). If some are to the right of the blue pixels and above the main horizontal center, then change the blue pixel to it's right, to red (2)
3.  **Color Swap, Blue with Red:**. Scan the original "Red Region". Inside that region, search for white pixels (0). If some are to the left of red pixels (2), swap the color of those red pixel for blue.
4. Leave the rest as is

In summary, colors 0 and 1 seems to swap places inside the "blue region" on top, and colors 2 and 0 swap places inside the "red region"

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
