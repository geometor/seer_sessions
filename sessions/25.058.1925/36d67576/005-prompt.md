Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color in the input grid.

2.  **Blue Object Mirroring:** Identify the two blue (color 1) objects shaped like an "L", which are at row 2 and at row 10. Mirror the position of the object in row 2, to become row 10. Mirror the blue object in row 10 to become row 2.

3. **Color Insertion near 4,3:** There is a line of yellow(4) pixels and a set of 3 green(3) pixels in a horizontal arrangement. A green pixel appears at the right of this line of yellow pixels, only if there is yellow adjacent to green.

4.  **Color Insertion near 4,2:** There is a line of yellow(4) pixels and one red(2) pixel. A red pixel is placed above the single yellow pixel adjacent to red, only if there is yellow adjacent to red.

5. **Isolated single pixel color swapping**:
    - In the input, there is a green(3) pixel at (4,9) and a yellow(4) pixel at (8,9). Swap their color, the output has the yellow pixel at (4,9), and green pixel at (8,9).
    - In the input, there is a blue(1) pixel at (4,11) and a yellow(4) pixel at (6,10). Swap their color, the output has the yellow pixel at (4,11) and blue pixel at (6,10).

6.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels retain their original colors and positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
