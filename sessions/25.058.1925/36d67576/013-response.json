            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a plan to improve the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code made significant progress but failed to generalize across all training examples. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Conditional Shape Logic:** The \"L\"-shaped addition logic is overly specific to the first example and doesn't adapt to other scenarios. It's based on grid size and the existence of a separate green shape, which isn't a universally applicable rule.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The code identifies the largest yellow shape, which is a good start, but the added shapes are dependent on the largest green shape in the cases of the \"L\".\n3.  **Hardcoded Positions:** The placement of the inserted blue and green pixels within the yellow shape, as well as blue and green outside of the yellow shape, is based on row offsets from the top and bottom. This is not robust, it needs to account for yellow shapes of size 1 and the relative position of the blue and green within the shape.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Instead of just finding the *largest* yellow shape, the algorithm will locate the *yellow* shape.\n2.  **Abstract the \"L\" shape rule:** Instead of relying on the existence of a pre-existing green shape, add the \"L\" in a way that will pass all the training examples.\n3. **Parameterize positions of interior colors**: Use a consistent positioning rule of one blue and two greens relative to each other, as well as one blue and two greens added adjacent to the yellow shape, and always relative to the yellow shape.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, the expected output, and the actual output from the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef show_result(example_number, input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):\n    print(f\"Example {example_number}:\")\n    print(\"Input:\")\n    print(input_grid)\n    print(\"Expected Output:\")\n    print(expected_output)\n    print(\"Actual Output:\")\n    print(actual_output)\n    print(\"Match:\", np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Example Grids (replace with actual data from the task)\nexample_1_in = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\nexample_1_out = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\nexample_2_in = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\nexample_2_out = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0]])\nexample_3_in = np.array([[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\nexample_3_out = np.array([[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1],\n       [4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [4, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]])\nexample_4_in = np.array([[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n                          [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]])\nexample_4_out = np.array([[4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 1],\n        [4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n        [4, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n        [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n        [3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0]])\n\n# Assuming you have your `transform` function defined as before\n\nactual_output_1 = transform(example_1_in)\nshow_result(1, example_1_in, example_1_out, actual_output_1)\n\nactual_output_2 = transform(example_2_in)\nshow_result(2, example_2_in, example_2_out, actual_output_2)\n\nactual_output_3 = transform(example_3_in)\nshow_result(3, example_3_in, example_3_out, actual_output_3)\n\nactual_output_4 = transform(example_4_in)\nshow_result(4, example_4_in, example_4_out, actual_output_4)\n\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\n- task: \"0b148d64\"\n  examples:\n    -

If no yellow object exists, terminate.\n\n2.  **Insert Colors Inside Yellow Object:**\n    *   Locate the second row from the bottom of the yellow object. Insert a blue (1) pixel in this row, maintaining the original column.\n    *   Locate the third row from the top of the yellow object. Insert a green (3) pixel in this row, maintaining the original column.\n\n3.  **Add Colors Adjacent to Yellow Object:**\n      * Find the top row and rightmost column of the yellow shape. Add a blue pixel directly above the yellow shape at this position.\n    *   Find top row of the leftmost column of the yellow shape.  Add a green(3) pixel directly above this.\n    *   Find the bottom row of the leftmost column of the yellow shape.  Add a green(3) pixel directly below.\n\n4.  **Add \"L\" shape:** Add an \"L\"-shaped object consisting of green(3) and yellow(4) pixels to the bottom left of the image. The \"L\" should consist of two rows, the yellow pixels should be adjacent, and the green should be adjacent.\n\n**Reasoning for Natural Language Program Changes**\n\n*   **Object Identification:** Changed \"largest yellow object\" to \"yellow object\".\n* **Removed dependence on other objects:** Added \"L\" is now dependent on the image.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Improved wording for better understanding and removed example-specific details.\n*    **Generalized \"L\":** Consistent positioning in relation to the image.\n*  **Interior Positions**: Consistent relative placement within the yellow.\n*  **Adjacent positions**: relative to the top and bottom edges of the yellow, and consistently placed.\n"
