facts:
  - observation: |
      Grids are 13x13.
  - observation: |
      Colors represent digits 0-9.
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Some colored objects/regions change between input and output.
  - observation: |
     Some changes involve position or small shape shifts
  - observation: |
      Some colors appear to be added or propagate, dependent on the location and values in the input.
  - observation: |
      In example 1, Blue(1) pixels shift, green(3) pixels appear near other colors, and orange(4) lines are slightly altered.
  - observation: |
      In example 2, a similar change of shape/position. Orange areas are modified by green and blue values.
  - observation: |
      In example 3, a green object moves, and a blue pixel appears near other pixels.
  - relationship:
      There appears to be an order of importance/precedence of colors that influences the final output.
