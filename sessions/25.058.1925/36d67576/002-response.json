Consider these as distinct objects.\n2.  **Observe Changes:** Compare the input and output grids. Note which objects have changed in color, position, or slightly changed in shape.\n3.  **Prioritize Actions**:\n    *   If there is a single Blue(1) pixel within an orange(4) object, change that orange pixel at the location to Blue(1)\n    *   If there is a Green(3) object adjacent to an Orange(4) or Blue(1) objects, change the color of adjacent pixels to match the Orange(4) or Blue(1)\n    *   The single Red(2) pixel does not appear to move\n4.  **Apply Changes:** Iterate through the grid, applying the color and shape changes based on the rules identified above, prioritizing rules in that order.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, obj):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        obj.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, obj)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, obj)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, obj)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, obj)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] != 0 and not visited[row, col]:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], obj)\n                objects.append((grid[row,col], obj)) #store color with the object\n    return objects\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n  \"\"\"get the neighbors of a given cell\"\"\"\n  neighbors = []\n  for i in range(-1,2):\n      for j in range(-1,2):\n        if (i==0 and j==0):\n            continue\n        n_row = row + i\n        n_col = col + j\n        if (0 <= n_row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= n_col < grid.shape[1]):\n          neighbors.append((n_row, n_col))\n  return neighbors\n    \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Apply rule: Blue(1) pixel within Orange(4) object takes precedence\n    for color, obj in objects:\n        if color == 1: # Blue\n            for r, c in obj:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r,c)\n                for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                    if input_grid[nr,nc] == 4:\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = 1\n\n\n    # Apply Rule: Green(3) near Orange(4)/Blue(1) modifies those\n    for color, obj in objects:\n        if color == 3:\n            for r, c in obj:\n              neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r,c)\n              for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                  if input_grid[nr,nc] == 4 or input_grid[nr,nc] ==1 :\n                      output_grid[r,c]= input_grid[nr,nc]\n    \n    # Apply Rule: Blue near an object changes the color\n    for color, obj in objects:\n        if color == 1:\n            for r, c in obj:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n                for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                    if (input_grid[nr,nc] != 0 and output_grid[nr,nc]!= 1) : # If neighbor not blank\n                        output_grid[nr,nc] = input_grid[nr, nc]\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
