The input and output grids have the same dimensions (13x13). Several distinct colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color) are present. The primary colors observed are blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and white (0). Some objects appear to move or change color between the input and output. Specifically, there appears to be some interaction between colors, possibly involving the insertion of another color between two existing pixels. There are also some isolated pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Mirror the position of the object in row 2, to become row 10. Mirror the blue object in row 10 to become row 2.\n\n3. **Color Insertion near 4,3:** There is a line of yellow(4) pixels and a set of 3 green(3) pixels in a horizontal arrangement. A green pixel appears at the right of this line of yellow pixels, only if there is yellow adjacent to green.\n\n4.  **Color Insertion near 4,2:** There is a line of yellow(4) pixels and one red(2) pixel. A red pixel is placed above the single yellow pixel adjacent to red, only if there is yellow adjacent to red.\n\n5. **Isolated single pixel color swapping**:\n    - In the input, there is a green(3) pixel at (4,9) and a yellow(4) pixel at (8,9). Swap their color, the output has the yellow pixel at (4,9), and green pixel at (8,9).\n    - In the input, there is a blue(1) pixel at (4,11) and a yellow(4) pixel at (6,10). Swap their color, the output has the yellow pixel at (4,11) and blue pixel at (6,10).\n\n6.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels retain their original colors and positions.\n\n"
