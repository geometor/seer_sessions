Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels. Consider each of these as a distinct object.

2.  **Locate Target Object:** Locate the objects that are yellow in the input grid.

3.  **Perform Modification**: The last two rows (from bottom to top) of yellow object are replaced with blue.
    If there is one isolated pixel of yellow color, that yellow pixel is going to change to green.

4.  **Reconstruct Grid:** Preserve all unchanged. Place modified object from input into the new output grid.

5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
