facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - observation: Output grids are smaller and contain a subset of colors from the input, excluding 0 (white) and 5 (grey).
  - observation: Output grids seem to represent a single colored "object" extracted from the input.
  - observation: An "object" is defined by a group of contiguous pixels of the same color, excluding 0 and 5.
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - size: variable, 10x10 in examples
      - colors: 0-9
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - size: variable, 3x3 in examples
      - colors: subset of input grid colors, excluding 0 and 5
  - action: Extraction
    description: A specific non-white, non-grey object is extracted from the input grid.
  - relationship: Input grid is transformed into output grid by object extraction.
