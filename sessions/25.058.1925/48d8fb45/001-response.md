Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids contain various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), with white (0) being the most prevalent, acting likely as a background. The output grids seem to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colored objects within the input, while ignoring the white background and the grey (5) pixels. It appears that a non-white, non-grey object is extracted. It seems like only one colored shape/object besides 0 and 5 is extracted. There may be more than one distinct object of the same color.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - observation: Output grids are smaller and contain a subset of colors from the input, excluding 0 (white) and 5 (grey).
  - observation: Output grids seem to represent a single colored "object" extracted from the input.
  - observation: An "object" is defined by a group of contiguous pixels of the same color, excluding 0 and 5.
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - size: variable, 10x10 in examples
      - colors: 0-9
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - size: variable, 3x3 in examples
      - colors: subset of input grid colors, excluding 0 and 5
  - action: Extraction
    description: A specific non-white, non-grey object is extracted from the input grid.
  - relationship: Input grid is transformed into output grid by object extraction.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to identify contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, excluding color 0 (white) and color 5 (grey).
2.  **Select Target Object:** Choose the object that is not white(0) or grey(5).
3. **Extract Bounding Box:** Determine the minimum bounding box for the target shape, encompassing all pixels of that object's color, while maintaining the input spatial arrangement.
4.  **Generate Output:** Create a new grid containing only the selected object's pixels within the bounding box area. All other pixels outside this region or pixels which are 0 or 5, should be color 0. The arrangement and positions of colors extracted in the bounding box should be same as in input grid.
