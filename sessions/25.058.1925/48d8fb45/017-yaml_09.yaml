objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - cells: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - colors: Represented by integers, mapped to colors

  - name: red_cluster
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - contiguous: pixels are adjacent (up, down, left, or right)
      - bounding_box: smallest rectangle enclosing the cluster
