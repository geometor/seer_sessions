Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 14x14 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid.
*   The input grid contains primarily 0 (white) pixels, with some 8 (azure) and 2 (red) pixels.
*   The 8 (azure) pixels in the input seem to form disconnected clusters or shapes, possibly distinct objects.
*   The output grid consists only of 8 (azure) and 0 (white) pixels.
*    The output appears to be a highly simplified, or abstracted "map" of the location of the azure colored sections.
*    The red objects in the lower left corner do not seem to be represented in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [14, 14]
    elements:
      - color: white  # 0
        role: background
      - color: azure  # 8
        role: object
        properties:
          - clustered
      - color: red #2
        role: object

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements:
      - color: white  # 0
        role: background
      - color: azure  # 8
        role: representation_of_input_object

  - relation:
      type: transformation
      description: input grid transforms to output grid
      rule: "The positions of azure(8) clusters are summarized in smaller output"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Locate all clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A cluster is defined as one or more adjacent azure pixels. Adjacency includes diagonals.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Cell:** For each 3x3 or 4x4 section of the input grid, an azure pixel exists in that section, if place an azure pixel in the output grid, otherwise a white pixel goes to the output grid.
3. **Ignore other colors.** Red (2) are not considered.

In simpler terms: The output grid is a 3x3 representation where each cell corresponds to approximately a section of the original image. An azure pixel is present in the output if the relative section contained one or more azure pixels. Red pixels in the input are disregarded.
