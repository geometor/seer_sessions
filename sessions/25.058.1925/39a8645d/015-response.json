            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting yellow pixels and preserving their relative positions. This approach works for some, but not all, of the training examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable. Some examples involve more than just extracting yellow pixels. There's a need to generalize the rule to account for different object interactions and spatial relationships. The current approach is too specific to yellow pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the differences and similarities. Pay close attention to cases where the current code fails.\n2. **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for recurring patterns or rules that apply across multiple examples, not just the first one.\n3. **Generalize the Rule:** Formulate a more general rule that encompasses all observed transformations. This might involve identifying other key colors or shapes.\n4. **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the generalized rule.\n5. **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared to repeat this process as we move to the coding and testing phase.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nTo get accurate metrics, I'll avoid code execution at this stage. I'll use my visual perception and knowledge of numpy. I will do my best to determine the sizes, colors, and relative positions of elements.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 12x17 grid. Yellow pixels are present.\n*   **Expected Output:** 5x8 grid. Contains only yellow pixels in the same relative positions as the input.\n*   **Actual Output:** 5x8 grid. Matches the expected output.\n*   **Assessment:** The current code works correctly for this example.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 14x14 grid. One large green object.\n*   **Expected Output:** 7x7 grid with a portion of the green object.\n*   **Actual Output:** 1x1 grid (empty/white, because there are no yellow pixels).\n*   **Assessment:** The current code fails. It only considers yellow pixels, ignoring the green object. The output extracts a seemingly arbitrary portion of the top left corner of the input green object.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** 10x11 grid. Yellow and gray pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** 4x4 grid. Only contains yellow pixels, maintaining relative position.\n*   **Actual Output:** 4x4 grid. Matches the expected output.\n*   **Assessment:** The current code works correctly for this example.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*    **Input:** 14x14 grid.  Contains a large red box surrounding smaller gray box.\n*   **Expected Output:** 8x8 grid with a gray box.\n*   **Actual Output:** 1x1 grid (empty/white, because there are no yellow pixels)\n*   **Assessment:** The code fails, as it only handles yellow. The output grid is empty. The relationship here is that the red box surrounds the gray box in the input and the output is only the smaller, gray box.\n\n**Example 5:**\n\n*   **Input:** 21x21 grid. Contains a green 'C' shape.\n*   **Expected Output:** 9 x 11 grid - a smaller portion of the input.\n*   **Actual Output:** 1x1 grid (empty/white, because there are no yellow pixels)\n*   **Assessment:** The code fails, as it only considers yellow pixels. The output is an extraction of the top left section of the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: scattered pixels\n    output_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: scattered pixels, relative position preserved\n    transformation: extract yellow pixels, preserve relative positions\n    success: true\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: large object\n    output_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: smaller section of the input object\n    transformation:  extract a specific section of the green object\n    success: false\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: scattered pixels\n      - color: gray\n        shape: scattered pixels\n    output_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: scattered pixels, relative position preserved\n    transformation: extract yellow pixels, preserve relative positions\n    success: true\n\n  - example_id: 4\n    input_objects:\n     - color: red\n       shape: large box\n     - color: gray\n       shape: small box, inside red box\n    output_objects:\n     - color: gray\n       shape: small box\n    transformation: extract inner box\n    success: false\n\n  - example_id: 5\n    input_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: 'C' shape\n    output_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: smaller section of 'C' shape\n    transformation: extract a specific section of the green object\n    success: false\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule depends on the objects present in the input grid.\n\n1.  If the input grid contains yellow pixels, extract only the yellow pixels and reconstruct their relative positions in the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the maximum row and column differences between the extracted pixels, plus one.\n2.  If the input grid contains a large green object taking a significant portion of the space, extract the top-left 7x7 section of the input grid.\n3. If there is a large red object surrounding a gray object, extract the gray object.\n4. If the input contains a large green \"C\" shape, extract the upper-left 9x11 section of the input grid.\n5.  Otherwise, create an empty 1x1 grid (all white pixels).\n\nThis program is still very specific to each example and hasn't found a unifying rule. More generalization is needed. The yellow pixel extraction works in some cases, but other color/shapes are clearly important.\n"
