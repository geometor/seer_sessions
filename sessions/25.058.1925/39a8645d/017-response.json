The input grid contains multiple colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color). It appears the output grid focuses on a single object within the input, specifically the azure (color 8) object in the top-left of input. The magenta (color 6) object appears to be ignored, along with blank areas and edges. The output is a zoomed-in, isolated view of a selected object. The shape of the extracted object seems to be preserved, with some additional \"background\" or \"padding\".\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
