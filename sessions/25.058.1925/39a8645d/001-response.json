The colors include white (0), azure (8), red (2), blue (1), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The output grids are consistently 3x3, while the input grids vary in size but are always rectangular. The transformation seems to focus on a specific colored object within the input grid.  Empty space, represented by 0 (white), acts as a background and is seemingly ignored in some cases but influences the object's shape. It's crucial to understand which object is *selected*.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore single, isolated pixels of any color. There appears to be only one prominent object/color combination per example provided.\n2. **Determine the Bounding Box:** Find the minimal rectangular area (bounding box) that fully encompasses the target object identified.\n3. **Extract 3x3 Centered Output:** Extract a 3x3 grid. The objective is to reproduce the core shape of the object. Populate that 3x3 grid with values from the input grid. If the selected color value is not present at the corresponding location in the input grid, use 0.\n4. Recreate the \"core\" of the selected shape.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies the largest \"blob\" of a single color (ignoring single pixels) and creates a 3x3 representation of it.\n"
