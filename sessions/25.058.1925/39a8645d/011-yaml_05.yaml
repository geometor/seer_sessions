objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [14 x 14]
        elements: [0, 1, 2, 4]
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [3 x 3]
        elements: [0, 4]
  - type: color_blob
    properties:
        - color: yellow (4)
          shape: varies (single pixels, 2x1 blocks, 2x2 blocks)
          locations: dispersed throughout the input_grid
        - color: blue(1)
        - color: red(2)
        - color: white(0)

actions:
  - extract: Select a specific color (4)
  - summarize:  Condense the input grid based on locations of the color yellow
  - reconstruct: Create output grid with yellow objects at right places and background with white

relationships:
  - input_grid *contains* multiple color_blobs
  - output_grid *represents* a summarized version of the input_grid, focusing on yellow color_blobs
