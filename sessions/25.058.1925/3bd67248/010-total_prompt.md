**input:**
```
5 0 0
5 0 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x78E5F99B60D0>

**output:**
```
5 0 2
5 2 0
5 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x78E5F99B7850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two colors: gray (5) and white (0). The output grid introduces two new colors: red (2) and yellow (4), while retaining some of the original colors in specific locations. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple replacement of all pixels of one color with another, but rather a more localized change. The white pixels are replaced based on their proximity to gray.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - gray (5)
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
        - yellow (4)
      location:
        - row: [0-2]
          column: [0-2]

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    agent: transformation_rule
    target: pixel
    condition:
      - proximity to gray pixel
    parameters:
      new_color:
          - red (2)
          - yellow(4)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: pixels
    properties:
        - side-by-side
        - diagonal

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are gray (value 5). These are the "anchor" or "source" pixels for the transformation.

2.  **Conditional White Pixel Replacement:** Iterate through the white (value 0) pixels in the input grid.
  * if a white pixel is at the top right corner, replace with red.
  * if a white pixel is below a gray pixel AND to the right of a gray pixel, replace with yellow
  * if a white pixel is to the right of a gray AND above a yellow, replace with red.
  * if a white pixel is under a gray AND to the left of a yellow, replace with red.

3.  **Preserve Gray Pixels:** The gray pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
