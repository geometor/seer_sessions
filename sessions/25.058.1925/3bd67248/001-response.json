The primary visual elements are:\n\n*   **Vertical Lines:** A solid vertical line of a single non-zero color appears on the left edge of the input grids.\n*   **Diagonal Line:** A diagonal line of '2' (red) appears in the output, starting from the top right corner and moving down and to the left.\n*   **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of '4' (yellow) fills the bottom row of the output grid. The input grids seem to trigger changes where the other values are 0's.\n*  **Background:** 0 (white) is the background\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It goes one position to the left for each row down. The number of cells colored matches the height of the input grid.\n3. **Horizontal Fill.** Replace all the values in the bottom row with 4.\n\nEssentially, a vertical line of a single color on the left of the input grid triggers two actions on a background grid:\n\n*   The creation of a diagonal line of '2' (red) from the top-right.\n*   The creation of a horizontal line of color '4' (yellow) on the last row.\n"
