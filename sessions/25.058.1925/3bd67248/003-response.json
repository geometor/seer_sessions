The input grid consists primarily of 0s (white) and 6s (magenta) along the left edge. The output grid introduces 2s (red) in a diagonal pattern moving from the top-right towards the bottom-left, and 4s (yellow) in a horizontal line at the bottom. The shape/size of the grid appears constant from input to output (15x15).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
