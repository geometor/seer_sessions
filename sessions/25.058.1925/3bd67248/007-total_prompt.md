Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Determine Output Grid Height: The output grid's height is either equal to the input grid's height or one less.
2. Remove Magenta: Remove all magenta (6) pixels from the input.
3. Create Red Diagonal: Create a diagonal line of red (2) pixels. The line starts at the top-right corner of the *output* grid.  It extends diagonally down and to the left, one cell at a time. The length appears to be governed by the height.
4. Fill Below Red with Yellow: Fill all cells directly below the red (2) pixels with yellow (4) pixels, extending to the bottom of the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
