**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary visual elements are:

*   **Vertical Lines:** A solid vertical line of a single non-zero color appears on the left edge of the input grids.
*   **Diagonal Line:** A diagonal line of '2' (red) appears in the output, starting from the top right corner and moving down and to the left.
*   **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of '4' (yellow) fills the bottom row of the output grid. The input grids seem to trigger changes where the other values are 0's.
*  **Background:** 0 (white) is the background

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: VerticalLine
    type: line
    properties:
      color: variable # The color of the initial vertical line (6, 5, or 8)
      position: left_edge
      orientation: vertical
  - name: DiagonalLine
    type: line
    properties:
      color: 2 #red
      position: top_right_to_bottom_left
      orientation: diagonal
  - name: HorizontalLine
    type: line
    properties:
      color: 4 #yellow
      position: bottom_row
      orientation: horizontal
  - name: Background
    type: color_fill
    properties:
      color: 0 #white

actions:
  - name: create_diagonal
    object: DiagonalLine
    trigger: presence of VerticalLine
  - name: create_horizontal
    object: HorizontalLine
    trigger: presence of VerticalLine

relationships:
   - type: triggers
     from: VerticalLine
     to: DiagonalLine
   - type: triggers
     from: VerticalLine
     to: HorizontalLine
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Diagonal Placement:** For every row, place the color "2" in a cell moving diagonally, top right to bottom left. It goes one position to the left for each row down. The number of cells colored matches the height of the input grid.
3. **Horizontal Fill.** Replace all the values in the bottom row with 4.

Essentially, a vertical line of a single color on the left of the input grid triggers two actions on a background grid:

*   The creation of a diagonal line of '2' (red) from the top-right.
*   The creation of a horizontal line of color '4' (yellow) on the last row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
