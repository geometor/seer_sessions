Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The primary objects are rectangular blocks of uniform color.
*   **Background:** The background is consistently white (color 0).
*   **Object Properties:** Objects are defined by their color and rectangular shape. They have a solid fill in the input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves "hollowing out" the filled rectangles, leaving only their outer border. The border thickness appears to be one pixel.
*    The color of the border is maintained.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      color: varied (non-white)
      fill: solid
    transformation:
      action: hollow
      result: border_only
      border_thickness: 1
      color: maintained

background:
    color: white

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous rectangular regions of non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the objects.
2.  For each identified rectangular object:
    *   **Retain** the pixels forming the outer border of the rectangle. The border is one pixel thick.
    *    **Change** the color all the pixels that composed the solid inner to match the background.
    *   **Keep** the original color of border pixels.
3.  All other pixels (the background) remain unchanged.

Essentially the program says - iterate the objects, replace their insides with
the background color.
