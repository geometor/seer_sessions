Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The colors include white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), magenta (6), and azure (8). There appear to be two primary objects in each input grid: a connected shape of blue (1) pixels and a single pixel of a different color (red, green, magenta, or azure). The output grids seem to highlight where these two types of objects would overlap if overlaid. If the single colored pixel falls inside the blue object, then the blue object in the output becomes filled with the color of the single pixel. If the blue pixels border on zeros, those zeros also get changed to be the color of the single pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: connected_shape
    color: blue (1)
    description: A contiguous region of blue pixels.
  - type: single_pixel
    colors: [red (2), green (3), magenta (6), azure (8)]
    description: A single pixel of a color other than blue or white.
  - type: background
    color: white(0)
    description: fills the rest of the canvas, may border other shapes

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Change the color of pixels within a region.
  - name: border_fill
    description: Change the color of the bordering pixels.

relationships:
  - subject: single_pixel
    relation: contained_within
    object: connected_shape
    description: The single_pixel's coordinates are within the bounds of the connected_shape.
  - subject: connected_shape
    relation: adjacent_to
    object: background
    description: Blue pixels next to white pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the connected shape of blue (1) pixels and the single pixel of another color (2, 3, 6, or 8).

2.  **Check Containment:** Determine if the single pixel is located *within* the blue shape. Consider a pixel to be within the shape if it's part of the contiguous blue region.

3.  **Fill (If Contained):** If the single pixel is within the blue shape, change all the blue pixels to the single pixel color that is inside the blue shape.

4.  **Border Fill:** Where the blue shape from the original input borders the white background, change the white pixels to be the color of the single pixel color that is inside the blue shape.

5. **Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels, including the single pixel itself from input, retain their original colors. If original color was white(0), then pixels remain white unless filled as a border.
