The input grid contains pixels of colors primarily white (0), blue (1), magenta (6), and azure (8). The output grid seems to retain some elements of the input grid (the blue (1) areas and the overall shape) but modifies the magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels based on their location and neighboring colors. There's a clear interaction: the magenta pixel seems to \"expand\" or \"fill\" the blue area above where it occurrs originally and the azure does this for the blue area below it.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
