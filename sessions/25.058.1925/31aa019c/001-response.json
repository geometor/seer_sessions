The most obvious change is that many of the colored pixels in the input disappear in the output. A specific region, however, seems to be highlighted and potentially altered in color. It appears there's some concept of a \"background\" (represented by 0, or white) and \"foreground\" objects. The outputs all share a red object composed by a 3x3 block in the same place, replacing an object of any color on the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
