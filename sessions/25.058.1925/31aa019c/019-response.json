Specifically, place it at the same location where color '3'(green) was found in the input.\n4.  **Overwrite:** Set the pixel at the center of the red square to '3' (green).\n5. **Clear:** All other pixels in the output grid are set to '0' (white).\n\nEssentially, the transformation isolates a specific colored pixel (green '3'), creates a red square around a corresponding location in the output grid, and then places the isolated color at the center of this square. All other locations are blanked.\n"
