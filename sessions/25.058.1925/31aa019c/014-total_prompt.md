Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 10x10 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color.
*   The output is also a 10x10 grid, mostly filled with 0s (white), but with a small 3x3 block of 2s (red) and a single 6 (magenta) within it.
*   The location of the colored block in the output doesn't seem to directly correspond to any specific colored region in the input.
*    The colored block in the output is in the top right corner, next to the boarder, so the block location is important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_block
    type: subgrid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 2 #red
        count: 8
      - value: 6 #magenta
        count: 1
    location: top-right

relationships:
    - input_grid contains many colors
    - output_grid contains mostly 0, and one colored block
    - output_block is located adjacent to border

actions:
  - identify_location: find a 3x3 space adjacent to top and right borders in output grid
  - fill: fill this location with some specification
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Target Area:** Identify a 3x3 region in the output grid that is adjacent to the top and right borders.

2.  **Fill the Block:**
    *   Fill the identified 3x3 area with the color red (2).
    *   Change the center pixel of the 3x3 block to magenta (6).

3.  **Clear Remainder:** Set all other pixels in the output grid to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
