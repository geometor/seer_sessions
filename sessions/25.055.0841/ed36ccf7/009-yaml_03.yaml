example_1:
  input:
    shape: (5, 5)
    colors: {0: 24, 6: 1}
    magenta_indices: [(2, 2)]
  output:
    shape: (5, 5)
    colors: {0: 24, 6: 1}
    magenta_indices: [(2, 2)]
  transformation:
    type: rotation with magenta preservation
    details: "90-degree clockwise rotation. Magenta pixel remains at the same coordinates after rotation"

example_2:
  input:
    shape: (7, 7)
    colors: {0: 48, 6: 1}
    magenta_indices: [(3, 3)]
  output:
    shape: (7, 7)
    colors: {0: 48, 6: 1}
    magenta_indices: [(3, 3)]
  transformation:
    type: "Possibly rotation or other transformation centered around magenta"
    details: "Magenta pixel does not change position. Input may be rotating or reflecting around the magenta"

example_3:
  input:
    shape: (11, 11)
    colors: {0: 119, 6: 2}
    magenta_indices: [(5, 2), (5, 8)]
  output:
    shape: (11, 11)
    colors:  {0: 119, 6: 2}
    magenta_indices:  [(2, 5), (8, 5)]
  transformation:
    type: "complex transformation likely related to the two magenta pixels"
    details: "Two magenta pixels. It appears input is flipped horizontally and vertically around the center point. Magenta pixels positions are swapped in the flip"

example_4:
  input:
    shape: (5, 5)
    colors: {0: 22, 3: 2, 6: 1}
    magenta_indices: [(2, 2)]
  output:
    shape: (5, 5)
    colors: {0: 22, 3: 2, 6: 1}
    magenta_indices: [(2, 2)]
  transformation:
    type: unknown
    details: "Magenta pixel remains in place. Other pixels (green) do not change position either."
