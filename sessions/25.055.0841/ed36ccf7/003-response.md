Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified transformation rule. The results from the additional training examples reveal that the actual transformation is more specific about *where* the 1x2 white block originates (top-right) and consistently places it at the top-left, filling the rest of the 3x3 grid with maroon. The generated code happens to work for more of the examples than might be expected, but the natural language program is not completely accurate and the error in example_3 confirms it needs revision. The core issue is a premature generalization from a single observation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Observation:** Carefully examine *all* input-output pairs, noting the precise location and orientation of the 1x2 white block in the input and its consistent placement in the output.
2.  **Refine Description:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed "move" of the white block and the filling of remaining cells.
3. **Confirm**: re-run to confirm that error rate is now zero.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To accurately describe what's happening, I'll create small reports of what is in the input, and what is in the output.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid, grid_name):
    """Describes the contents of a grid."""

    print(f"Grid: {grid_name}")
    white_pixels = np.where(grid == 0)
    if len(white_pixels[0]) > 0:
        print(f"  White Pixels: {list(zip(white_pixels[0], white_pixels[1]))}")
    else:
        print("  White Pixels: None")
    maroon_pixels = np.where(grid == 9)
    if len(maroon_pixels[0]) > 0:
      print(f"  Maroon Pixels: {list(zip(maroon_pixels[0], maroon_pixels[1]))}")
    else:
      print("  Maroon Pixels: None")

    print(f"{grid_name} shape: {grid.shape}")


# input and output grid values from prompt history
example_grids = {
    "example_0_input": np.array([[9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_0_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_1_input": np.array([[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 0]]),
    "example_1_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_2_input": np.array([[9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_2_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_3_input": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_3_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
}

for grid_name, grid in example_grids.items():
    describe_grid(grid, grid_name)

```
