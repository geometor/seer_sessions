Each pixel has a color value represented by an integer (0 or 6 in this case). The input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a change in the position of colors/values, a vertical flip, and a specific replacement rule based on position.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
