## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A64130>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3979F00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The primary colors involved are maroon (9) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a change in the position of the white and maroon pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 9]
          mapping:
            0: white
            9: maroon

observations:
  - input:
      description: Maroon pixels occupy most of the grid except for two white pixels at the top right.
      positions:
        white: [(0,1), (0,2)]
        maroon: [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
  - output:
      description: Maroon pixels occupy most of the grid except for two white pixels at the top left.
      positions:
        white: [(0,0), (1,0)]
        maroon: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]

actions:
  - type: color_repositioning
    description: The positions of white and maroon pixels are changed.
    details: >
        Specifically the position of white pixels and maroon is getting changed from input to output

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of white pixels change from top-right to top-left.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the white pixels (value 0) in the input grid.
2.  Identify the maroon pixels (value 9) in the input grid.
3.  In the output grid:
    *   Place white pixels in the top-left corner, spanning two rows vertically.
    *   Fill the rest of the grid with maroon pixels.

Essentially, the program "moves" a block of white pixels in a specific manner, and it can be conceptualized as moving the white pixels from the top right corner to the top left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
