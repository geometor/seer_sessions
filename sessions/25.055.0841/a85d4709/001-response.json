The input grid contains the value '0' (white) and '5' (gray). The output grid contains values '3' (green), '4' (yellow), and '2' (red). There's a clear positional correspondence: the transformation replaces every element, and the relative position of each element remains the same. The core of the task is to figure out the rule determining *which* color in the input becomes *which* other color in the output. The transformation appears to be a simple mapping or substitution of color values, not a spatial or geometric manipulation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
