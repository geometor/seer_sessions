The input grid seems to have a pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output is a single blue (1) pixel. The core challenge is to determine the rule that decides when the output is blue (1), based on the arrangement of colors in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each pixel has a color value, either 0 (white) or 5 (gray).\n  - observation: |\n      The output is a 1x1 grid, containing a single pixel with a color value of 1 (blue).\n  - relationship: |\n      The output color (blue) does not appear in the input grid.\n  - hypothesis: |\n      The transformation rule likely counts or assesses the presence of specific colors or patterns.\n  - hypothesis: |\n    the output might represent the number of times a specific object is detected.\n  - hypothesis: |\n       it could be based on the positions/relationships of different colors within the input\n```"

Output the color blue if count of Gray pixel is greater than the count of white pixels.\n\nAlternative Program (Less Likely):\n\n1. Count Object: Count contiguous blocks of color 5\n2. Output: Blue if this count > 1\n\nBased on the prior of `Objectness`, the first program seems the best possible transformation, based on just a single example.\n"
