The colors are represented by single digits. The input grid has a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors to just two (blue and gray).  The blue (1) color seems to be preserved. The key seems to be replacing non-blue colors with grey (5).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
