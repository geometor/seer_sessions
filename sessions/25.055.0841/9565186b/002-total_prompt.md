## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A64490>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A659C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid has a distinct pattern: the top row is all red (2), and the center pixel is blue (1), while there is one red and two azure (8) pixels in the right lower corner. The output grid retains the red pixels (2) in the same positions but changes the blue (1) and azure (8) pixels to gray (5).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 3x3 array of pixels
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - data_type: integer (representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - position: row and column index within the grid

  - observation: input_grid
    details: Contains red, blue and azure pixels.
    positions:
      red:   [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0)]
      blue:  [(1, 1)]
      azure: [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]

  - observation: output_grid
    details: Retains red pixels from input, other pixels become gray.
    positions:
      red:   [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0)]
      gray:  [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]

  - action: color_change
    description: Specific colors in the input are replaced by gray in the output.
    details:
      - input_colors: [1, 8]  # Blue, Azure
      - output_color: 5   # Gray
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid. Identify pixels that have the color blue (1) or azure (8).
2.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified pixels (blue and azure) to gray (5).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:**  All other pixels, specifically the red (2) pixels, retain their original color values.
4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the modified pixel colors.

In essence, the transformation rule is: "Replace blue and azure pixels with gray pixels, leaving red pixels unchanged."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
