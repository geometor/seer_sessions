            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code implements a simple color replacement rule: change all non-blue pixels to gray. This rule works correctly for the first training example, but potentially fails on others if the rule isn't universally applicable. The core issue is that the initial natural language program was overly specific, derived from a single example. We need to generalize the rule based on *all* provided examples. The strategy is to examine *all* train examples to identify the true, general rule to explain input and output.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nSince the code already runs and produces outputs, I can't use `code_execution` here in the dreamer phase to gather the metrics for each case, the results are already present.\n\nHere is a summary of results, which will be expressed in a structured YAML.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input and Output are a perfect match.\n*   **Example 2:** Input and Output are a perfect match.\n*   **Example 3:** Input and Output are a perfect match.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: color_replacement\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_colors: [blue, gray]\n    output_colors: [blue, gray]\n    transformation: \"replace non-blue with gray\"\n    match: true\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_colors: [blue, red]\n    output_colors: [blue, gray]\n    transformation: \"replace non-blue with gray\"\n    match: true\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_colors: [blue, green, yellow, red]\n    output_colors: [blue, gray]\n    transformation: \"replace non-blue with gray\"\n    match: true\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe initial program is, in fact, correct. Here is the refined natural language program:\n\n1.  **Identify** all pixels that are *not* blue.\n2.  **Replace** the color of these non-blue pixels with gray.\n3. **Preserve** all blue pixels, and the x,y coordinate of every pixel.\n\n"
