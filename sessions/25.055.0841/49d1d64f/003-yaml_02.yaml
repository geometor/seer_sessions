observations:
  - example_1:
      input: 3x3 grid
      output: 8x8 grid with a white border
      objects:
        - pixels: individual cells in the input grid, each with a color.
      actions:
        - expansion: Each input pixel expands into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
        - bordering: A border of white pixels (color 0) of width 1 is added around the expanded grid.
  - example_2:
      input: 3x3 grid
      output: 6x6 grid
      objects:
        - pixels: individual cells in the input grid, each with a color
      actions:
        - expansion: Each input pixel expands into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
  - example_3:
      input: 5x5 grid
      output: 10x10
      objects:
      - pixels: individual cells in the input grid, each with a color
      actions:
      - expansion: each input pixel expands into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
