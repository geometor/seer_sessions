The original colors and their positions in the input grid appear to be replicated and expanded in the output grid. There's also the addition of a new color (white, represented by 0) in the output grid that wasn't present in the input. The transformation seems to involve a doubling of both the rows and columns, creating a 2x2 block for each original pixel. The white pixels are added as borders above and below, and to the left and right of the expanded matrix.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
