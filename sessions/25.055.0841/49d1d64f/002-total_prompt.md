## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 2
3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7126B3714A60>

**output:**
```
0 1 2 0
1 1 2 2
3 3 8 8
0 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7126B3BC6B60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (2x2) of colored squares into a larger grid (4x4) of colored squares. The original colors and their positions in the input grid appear to be replicated and expanded in the output grid. There's also the addition of a new color (white, represented by 0) in the output grid that wasn't present in the input. The transformation seems to involve a doubling of both the rows and columns, creating a 2x2 block for each original pixel. The white pixels are added as borders above and below, and to the left and right of the expanded matrix.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    dimensions: [2, 2]
    elements:
      - color: blue  # 1
        position: [0, 0]
      - color: red   # 2
        position: [0, 1]
      - color: green # 3
        position: [1, 0]
      - color: azure # 8
        position: [1, 1]

  - type: output_grid
    dimensions: [4, 4]
    elements:
      - color: white # 0
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [3,0], [3,3]]
      - color: blue  # 1
        positions: [[1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 0], [2, 1]]
      - color: red   # 2
        positions: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 2], [2, 3]]
      - color: green # 3
        positions: [[2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
      - color: azure # 8
        positions: [[2, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2]]

  - type: transformation
    description: "Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. The entire expanded matrix is surrounded by white borders."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the height and width of the input grid plus two additional units, to account for borders. Fill all the elements of the ouput grid with white (0)

2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Determine its color.
    *   Find the corresponding position in the output grid, by multplying both, the row and column coordinates by two, and adding 1 to account for borders.
    *   Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid starting at that position with the same color.
    *   The block has the points: \[row, col], \[row + 1, col] , \[row, col+ 1], \[row + 1, col + 1]

3.  **Border:** The output grid is initialize with zero, which generates the white border.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
