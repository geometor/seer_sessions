## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 8 4
8 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x128 at 0x7126B386F4C0>

**output:**
```
0 1 8 4 0
1 1 8 4 4
8 8 3 8 8
0 8 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x256 at 0x7126B386F670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to contain single-digit integers representing colors.  The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input, with some form of padding or mirroring, and the addition of zeros (white) in specific locations. The core colors/numbers from the input are preserved in the output, but their positions and repetitions seem to follow a specific rule. The output dimensions are larger than the input dimensions, and are not simple multiples.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 2
      - width: 3
      - cell_values: integers (1, 8, 4, 8, 3, 8) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 4
      - width: 5
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
    - related_to: input_grid # relationship
  - action: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to create the output grid.
  - action: mirror_and_pad
    description: combines mirroring of values and padding with 0 (white)
  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description:  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by a defined set of operations.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a new, empty output grid with dimensions (2 * input_height) x (2 * input_width - 1).

2.  **Horizontal Mirroring (with central column preservation).** Copy each row of input into the output grid _twice_., but for the _first_ copy, insert it into output at column position equal to original column index, and for the second copy insert it into output starting at the column index equal to (2*input_width) - original column index - 1, so it is inserted in reverse order relative to the right edge.

3. **Vertical Mirroring (with overlap):** The first row is copied to the first two rows and the second row to the last two rows.

4. **Padding:** Insert 0 (white) at four positions: output\[0]\[0], output[0][4], output[3][0], output[3][4]

In more detailed pseudo-code:


```
input_height = height of input grid
input_width = width of input grid
output_height = 2 * input_height
output_width = 2 * input_width - 1
create output_grid of size (output_height, output_width) filled with null or default values

#copy rows of input to output
for each row in input_grid:
    for each col in input_grid:
        output_grid[row][col] = input_grid[row][col]
        output_grid[row][output_width -1 - col] = input_grid[row][col]

#duplicate rows
for row from 0 to input_height - 1:
   output_grid[output_height-1-row] = output_grid[row]

# pad with zeros
output_grid[0][0] = 0
output_grid[0][output_width - 1] = 0
output_grid[output_height - 1][0] = 0
output_grid[output_height - 1][output_width - 1] = 0

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
