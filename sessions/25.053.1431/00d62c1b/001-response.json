The input grid transforms into the output grid. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), green (3), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve a localized change, specifically affecting the green pixels and their immediate neighbors. It appears to be a form of cellular automata or a local neighborhood operation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
