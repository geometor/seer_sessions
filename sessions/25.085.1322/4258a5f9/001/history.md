*   **Perception:**
    The input grids contain a white background (0) with a few scattered gray pixels (5). The output grids retain the original gray pixels but add blue pixels (1) in the immediate 3x3 neighborhood around each gray pixel, effectively forming a hollow blue square centered on each gray pixel. The original gray pixel occupies the center of this 3x3 area.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size: consistent 9x9 for the provided examples.
      background_color: white (0).
      primary_object_color: gray (5).
      secondary_object_color: blue (1).

    identified_objects:
      - type: pixel
        color: gray (5)
        role: center_marker
        attributes:
          - isolated: appear individually, not connected to other gray pixels.
          - position: variable coordinates within the grid.

    actions_observed:
      - identify: Locate all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
      - create_neighborhood: For each gray pixel, define its 3x3 surrounding area (including the pixel itself).
      - fill_pattern: Fill the cells within the 3x3 neighborhood, excluding the center cell, with blue (1).
      - preserve_center: Ensure the original gray (5) pixel remains unchanged in its position.
      - maintain_background: All other pixels not part of these 3x3 neighborhoods remain white (0).

    relationships:
      - centered_around: The blue pattern is always centered on a gray pixel from the input.
      - adjacency: The blue pixels are placed in the 8 cells directly adjacent (including diagonals) to the gray pixel.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
    3.  If a cell contains a gray (5) pixel:
        a.  Identify the 8 neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent) around this gray pixel.
        b.  For each valid neighbor (within the grid boundaries):
            i.  If the neighbor cell in the input grid is white (0), change its color to blue (1) in the output grid.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
