Identify the sequence of non-white pixels in the middle row (row 1) \n       as the 'pattern', preserving their order.\n    2. Determine the 'initial block' of the middle row, which is the segment \n       starting from the first column up to and including the column where the \n       last pattern pixel appears.\n    3. Initialize the output grid's middle row by copying this 'initial block'.\n    4. Calculate the initial number of white spaces to insert: num_spaces = len(pattern) - 1.\n    5. Repeatedly perform the following until the output middle row reaches the \n       input grid's width:\n       a. Append 'num_spaces' white pixels (0). Stop if the row reaches the target width.\n       b. If the row is not yet full, append the next pixel from the 'pattern' sequence \n          (cycling back to the start of the pattern if necessary). Stop if the row \n          reaches the target width.\n       c. Increment 'num_spaces' by 1 for the next iteration.\n    6. The top (row 0) and bottom (last row) rows of the grid remain unchanged \n       (assumed to be all white based on examples).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a numpy array for easier handling\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Create the output grid, starting as a copy of the input\n    output_np = np.copy(input_np) \n\n    # The transformation logic applies only to the middle row (index 1)\n    # Assuming grid height is always 3 based on examples\n    if height != 3:\n        # If height is not 3, return the input unchanged as the logic is specific\n        # print(\"Warning: Grid height is not 3.
