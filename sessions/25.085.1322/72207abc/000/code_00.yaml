Task: Repeat pattern elements with increasing spacing

Input Grid Properties:
  - height: 3
  - width: variable
  - pixels: integers 0-9
  - row_0: all white (0)
  - row_1: contains initial pattern sequence followed by white (0) pixels
  - row_2: all white (0)

Output Grid Properties:
  - height: 3 (same as input)
  - width: variable (same as input)
  - row_0: all white (0)
  - row_1: transformed sequence based on input row_1
  - row_2: all white (0)

Transformation Focus:
  - Occurs only on the middle row (row_1).

Key Elements & Actions:
  - Initial Block:
    - location: start of input row_1
    - definition: sequence of pixels from column 0 until the first occurrence of two or more consecutive white pixels, or the end of the row.
    - action: copied directly to the start of output row_1.
  - Pattern Pixels:
    - definition: sequence of non-white pixels extracted from the Initial Block, maintaining their relative order.
    - role: elements to be repeated.
  - Spacing:
    - type: white pixels (0) inserted between repeated Pattern Pixels.
    - initial_count: (number of Pattern Pixels) - 1
    - progression: increases by 1 for each subsequent insertion.
  - Repetition:
    - process: append Pattern Pixels cyclically.
    - order: maintain original relative order from Pattern Pixels.
  - Termination:
    - condition: stop appending when the length of the generated output row_1 equals the input width.
    - action: truncate if necessary.

Relationships:
  - Output row_1 depends entirely on input row_1.
  - The number of initial spaces depends on the count of Pattern Pixels.
  - The spacing increases incrementally with each appended Pattern Pixel.
  - The output width is constrained by the input width.
