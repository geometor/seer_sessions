Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids always have 3 rows. The top and bottom rows are consistently filled with 'white' (0) pixels in both input and output.
2.  **Focus Row:** All the changes occur in the middle row (row index 1).
3.  **Initial Sequence:** The middle row of the input starts with a sequence of pixels, which can include non-white and potentially some white pixels. This initial sequence seems important.
4.  **Pattern Extraction:** The core pattern appears to be derived from the *non-white* pixels within the initial part of the input's middle row.
5.  **Output Generation:** The output's middle row starts by exactly replicating the initial sequence from the input's middle row.
6.  **Repeating Pattern:** After the initial sequence, the non-white pixels identified in step 4 are appended one by one, in their original order, cycling back to the beginning when the sequence is exhausted.
7.  **Increasing Spacing:** Crucially, between each appended non-white pixel, a sequence of white pixels is inserted. The number of white pixels inserted increases by 1 each time a pixel is appended.
8.  **Starting Space Count:** The number of white pixels inserted before the *first* appended pixel seems related to the number of non-white pixels in the extracted pattern. Specifically, it appears to be `(number of non-white pixels in pattern) - 1`.
9.  **Grid Size Preservation:** The output grid retains the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid. The generated middle row is truncated if it exceeds the original width.
10. **Identifying the "Initial Sequence":** The initial sequence in the input's middle row seems to be the block of pixels from the start until the first occurrence of two or more consecutive white pixels, or the end of the row.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Repeat pattern elements with increasing spacing

Input Grid Properties:
  - height: 3
  - width: variable
  - pixels: integers 0-9
  - row_0: all white (0)
  - row_1: contains initial pattern sequence followed by white (0) pixels
  - row_2: all white (0)

Output Grid Properties:
  - height: 3 (same as input)
  - width: variable (same as input)
  - row_0: all white (0)
  - row_1: transformed sequence based on input row_1
  - row_2: all white (0)

Transformation Focus:
  - Occurs only on the middle row (row_1).

Key Elements & Actions:
  - Initial Block:
    - location: start of input row_1
    - definition: sequence of pixels from column 0 until the first occurrence of two or more consecutive white pixels, or the end of the row.
    - action: copied directly to the start of output row_1.
  - Pattern Pixels:
    - definition: sequence of non-white pixels extracted from the Initial Block, maintaining their relative order.
    - role: elements to be repeated.
  - Spacing:
    - type: white pixels (0) inserted between repeated Pattern Pixels.
    - initial_count: (number of Pattern Pixels) - 1
    - progression: increases by 1 for each subsequent insertion.
  - Repetition:
    - process: append Pattern Pixels cyclically.
    - order: maintain original relative order from Pattern Pixels.
  - Termination:
    - condition: stop appending when the length of the generated output row_1 equals the input width.
    - action: truncate if necessary.

Relationships:
  - Output row_1 depends entirely on input row_1.
  - The number of initial spaces depends on the count of Pattern Pixels.
  - The spacing increases incrementally with each appended Pattern Pixel.
  - The output width is constrained by the input width.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Retain the input grid's dimensions (height and width) for the output grid.
2.  Copy the top row (all white) and bottom row (all white) from the input to the output grid.
3.  Focus on the middle row (row index 1) of the input grid.
4.  Identify the "Initial Block" in the input's middle row: this is the sequence of pixels starting from the first column up to, but not including, the first occurrence of two or more consecutive white pixels (0), or until the end of the row if no such pair exists.
5.  Extract the "Pattern Pixels" from the "Initial Block": create a new sequence containing only the non-white pixels from the Initial Block, preserving their order.
6.  Initialize the output grid's middle row by copying the "Initial Block".
7.  Calculate the initial number of spaces to insert: `num_spaces = length of Pattern Pixels - 1`.
8.  Initialize a counter `pattern_index` to 0, pointing to the first element in "Pattern Pixels".
9.  Repeatedly perform the following steps as long as the current length of the output middle row is less than the input grid's width:
    a.  Insert `num_spaces` white pixels (0) into the output middle row. If doing so exceeds the target width, insert only enough white pixels to reach the target width and stop.
    b.  If the target width has not been reached after inserting spaces, take the pixel at `Pattern Pixels[pattern_index]`.
    c.  Append this pixel to the output middle row. If doing so exceeds the target width, do not append it and stop.
    d.  Increment `pattern_index`. If `pattern_index` equals the length of "Pattern Pixels", reset `pattern_index` to 0.
    e.  Increment `num_spaces` by 1.
10. Ensure the final output middle row has the exact same width as the input middle row (it should be correctly truncated by the process in step 9).
11. Assemble the final output grid using the copied top/bottom rows and the generated middle row.
