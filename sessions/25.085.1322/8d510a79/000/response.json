This line divides the grid into an upper region (rows 0-4) and a lower region (rows 6-9).\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are individual pixels of blue (color 1) and red (color 2) scattered on a white background (color 0), distinct from the gray line.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding new pixels of the same color (blue or red) vertically, creating vertical lines originating from the initial colored pixels.\n5.  **Color-Specific Behavior:**\n    *   **Red Pixels:** Appear to extend vertically *towards* the central gray line. If a red pixel is above the gray line, it fills downwards until the row just above the gray line. If it's below the gray line, it fills upwards until the row just below the gray line. The original red pixel remains.\n    *   **Blue Pixels:** Appear to extend vertically *towards* the nearest horizontal edge of the grid (top edge - row 0, or bottom edge - row 9). If a blue pixel is closer to the top edge, it fills upwards to row 0. If it's closer to the bottom edge, it fills downwards to row 9. The original blue pixel remains.\n6.  **Static Elements:** The white background pixels and the gray line remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
