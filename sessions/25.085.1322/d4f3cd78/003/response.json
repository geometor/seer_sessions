The fill expands to adjacent white pixels and stops only at gray pixels or grid boundaries.\n\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify 'outside' non-gray pixels: Perform a BFS starting from all non-gray border pixels. Mark all reachable non-gray pixels as 'visited'. Gray pixels act as barriers.\n3. Identify 'seed' pixels: Iterate through the input grid. Any white pixel (0) that was *not* marked as 'visited' in the previous step is a seed pixel for the fill.\n4. Initialize a second BFS queue (`q_fill`) and add all identified seed pixels to it. Immediately change the color of these seed pixels in the output grid to azure (8).\n5. Perform the fill BFS: While `q_fill` is not empty, dequeue a pixel (r, c). For each 4-way neighbor (nr, nc):\n    a. Check if the neighbor is within bounds.\n    b. Check if the neighbor was originally white (`input_grid[nr, nc] == WHITE`).\n    c. Check if the neighbor is currently white in the output grid (`output_grid[nr, nc] == WHITE`), meaning it hasn't been filled yet.\n    d. If all conditions are met, change the neighbor's color in the output grid to azure (8) and enqueue it.\n6. Return the final modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a flood fill transformation starting from enclosed white regions.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Colors\n    WHITE = 0\n    GRAY = 5\n    AZURE = 8\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Initialize output grid ---\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Identify 'outside' non-gray pixels ---\n    \n    # Use a boolean grid to mark visited pixels during the border BFS\n    visited_from_border = np.zeros_like(input_grid, dtype=bool) \n    q_border = deque()\n\n    # Add all border non-gray pixels to the queue and mark them as visited\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols - 1]:\n            if input_grid[r, c] != GRAY and not visited_from_border[r, c]:\n                visited_from_border[r, c] = True\n                q_border.append((r, c))\n    for c in range(cols):\n        for r in [0, rows - 1]:\n            # Avoid adding corners twice\n            if input_grid[r, c] != GRAY and not visited_from_border[r, c]:\n                visited_from_border[r, c] = True\n                q_border.append((r, c))\n\n    # Perform BFS from border non-gray pixels\n    while q_border:\n        r, c = q_border.popleft()\n        \n        # Check 4-way neighbors\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if neighbor is not gray and not yet visited\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] != GRAY and not visited_from_border[nr, nc]:\n                    visited_from_border[nr, nc] = True\n                    q_border.append((nr, nc))\n\n    # --- Step 3 & 4: Identify 'seed' pixels and initialize the fill BFS ---\n    \n    q_fill = deque()\n    seeds_found = False # Flag to check if any seeds were identified\n    \n    # Iterate through the grid to find starting points (seeds) for the fill\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If a pixel is white and NOT reachable from the border (not visited), it's a seed\n            if input_grid[r, c] == WHITE and not visited_from_border[r, c]:\n                # Check if it's not already filled (relevant if seeds overlap, though unlikely here)\n                if output_grid[r, c] == WHITE: \n                    output_grid[r, c] = AZURE\n                    q_fill.append((r, c))\n                    seeds_found = True\n\n    # Optimization: If no seeds were found, the output is same as input\n    # This handles cases where there are no enclosed areas.\n    if not seeds_found:\n        return output_grid # Return the original copy\n\n    # --- Step 5: Perform the main flood fill with AZURE color ---\n    \n    while q_fill:\n        r, c = q_fill.popleft()\n        \n        # Check 4-way neighbors\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check bounds (Condition i)\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if neighbor was originally white (Condition ii)\n                # AND check if neighbor is currently white in output (Condition iii)\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] == WHITE and output_grid[nr, nc] == WHITE:\n                    # Fill with azure and enqueue (Condition iv)\n                    output_grid[nr, nc] = AZURE\n                    q_fill.append((nr, nc))\n                    \n    # --- Step 6: Return the result ---\n    return output_grid\n```"
