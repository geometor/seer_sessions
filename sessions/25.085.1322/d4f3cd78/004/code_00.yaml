task_context:
  description: The task involves filling specific regions of white pixels based on their relationship to gray boundaries.
  input_colors: [white, gray]
  output_colors: [white, gray, azure]
  transformation_type: flood_fill_conditional

grid_properties:
  size: variable (examples are 10x10)
  background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - object_type: boundary
    color: gray (5)
    description: Forms shapes that delineate regions within the grid. These shapes may be closed or open, and may touch the grid borders.
  - object_type: fillable_area
    color: white (0)
    description: Regions of white pixels. Some are connected to the grid border via paths of only white pixels, others are enclosed by gray boundaries.
  - object_type: filled_area
    color: azure (8)
    description: Represents the white pixels that were determined to be enclosed by the gray boundary and were subsequently filled.

actions:
  - action: identify_exterior_white_pixels
    description: Find all white pixels that can reach the grid border by traversing only adjacent white pixels. Gray pixels act as impenetrable barriers.
    method: Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all white border pixels.
  - action: identify_interior_white_pixels
    description: Identify all white pixels that were *not* reached by the BFS starting from the border white pixels. These are considered 'interior' or 'enclosed'.
  - action: fill_interior_white_pixels
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: azure (8)
    target: Interior white pixels identified in the previous step.
    description: Change the color of all identified interior white pixels to azure.

relationships:
  - relationship: enclosure
    object1: white pixel
    object2: gray boundary
    description: A white pixel is considered enclosed if it cannot reach the grid border via a path of only white pixels due to obstruction by the gray boundary.
  - relationship: connectivity
    object_type: white pixel
    description: White pixels are connected if they are adjacent (4-directionally). Connectivity forms regions.
