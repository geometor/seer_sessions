Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code consistently fails to modify the input grid, returning a copy of the input instead of the expected output. The core issue appears to be in the logic for identifying the white pixels that should be filled. The previous assumption was that "enclosed" white pixels are those *not* reachable by a flood fill starting from non-gray border pixels, where gray pixels act as barriers. However, the examples show that the gray shapes can touch the border or have gaps, allowing the border flood fill (as implemented) to reach *all* white pixels, thus identifying no seeds for the azure fill.

The strategy needs to be revised. We should focus on identifying white regions based on their relationship *only* to other white pixels and the gray boundaries, rather than their direct connectivity to the border *around* the gray shapes. A potential approach is:

1.  Identify all white pixels connected to the border via paths consisting *only* of white pixels. Gray pixels block these paths.
2.  Any white pixel *not* identified in step 1 is considered "internal" or "enclosed" relative to the gray boundaries.
3.  Fill these "internal" white pixels with azure.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's examine the pixel counts for each example to understand the transformations better.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Exterior White Pixels:**
    *   Create a 'visited' map, initially all false.
    *   Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    *   Add all white (0) pixels located on any border (top, bottom, left, right) of the grid to the queue and mark them as 'visited'.
    *   Perform the BFS: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a pixel location. For each of its 4-directional neighbors:
        *   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        *   Check if the neighbor is white (0) in the *input* grid.
        *   Check if the neighbor has *not* been 'visited'.
        *   If all conditions are true, mark the neighbor as 'visited' and enqueue it.
3.  **Fill Interior White Pixels:**
    *   Iterate through every pixel location (row, column) in the grid.
    *   If the pixel at the current location is white (0) in the *input* grid AND it has *not* been marked as 'visited' during the previous BFS step, then change the color of this pixel in the *output* grid to azure (8).
4.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
