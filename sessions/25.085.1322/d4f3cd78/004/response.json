            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code consistently fails to modify the input grid, returning a copy of the input instead of the expected output. The core issue appears to be in the logic for identifying the white pixels that should be filled. The previous assumption was that \"enclosed\" white pixels are those *not* reachable by a flood fill starting from non-gray border pixels, where gray pixels act as barriers. However, the examples show that the gray shapes can touch the border or have gaps, allowing the border flood fill (as implemented) to reach *all* white pixels, thus identifying no seeds for the azure fill.\n\nThe strategy needs to be revised. We should focus on identifying white regions based on their relationship *only* to other white pixels and the gray boundaries, rather than their direct connectivity to the border *around* the gray shapes. A potential approach is:\n\n1.  Identify all white pixels connected to the border via paths consisting *only* of white pixels. Gray pixels block these paths.\n2.  Any white pixel *not* identified in step 1 is considered \"internal\" or \"enclosed\" relative to the gray boundaries.\n3.  Fill these \"internal\" white pixels with azure.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's examine the pixel counts for each example to understand the transformations better.\n\n"
