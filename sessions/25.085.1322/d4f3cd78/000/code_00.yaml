Context:
  Input_Grid: A 2D grid containing pixels of white (0) and gray (5).
  Output_Grid: A 2D grid derived from the input, containing white (0), gray (5), and azure (8) pixels.
  Transformation_Type: Flood fill / Region coloring.

Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Color: White (0)
    Role: Represents areas that can potentially be filled.
  - Name: Boundary
    Color: Gray (5)
    Role: Acts as an impenetrable barrier for the fill process. Defines regions.
  - Name: Fill
    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Replaces certain white pixels in the output.

Relationships:
  - Type: Spatial
    Description: The gray (5) boundary encloses some white (0) pixels, separating them from other white (0) pixels connected to the grid border.
  - Type: Connectivity
    Description: White (0) pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (4-way connectivity).
  - Type: Transformation
    Description: The fill (azure 8) starts from the white (0) pixels enclosed by the gray (5) boundary.

Actions:
  - Action: Identify_Regions
    Input: Input Grid
    Output: Classification of white (0) pixels into 'inside' (enclosed by gray 5) and 'outside' (reachable from border without crossing gray 5).
    Method: Perform a flood fill from border white (0) pixels; any unreached white (0) pixels are 'inside'.
  - Action: Flood_Fill
    Input: Input Grid, 'Inside' white (0) pixel locations
    Parameters: Fill_Color (Azure 8), Boundary_Color (Gray 5), Connectivity (4-way)
    Output: Output Grid
    Description: Starting from the 'inside' white pixels, change all reachable white (0) pixels to azure (8), stopping at gray (5) pixels or grid boundaries.

Properties:
  - Property: Grid_Size
    Value: Consistent between input and output.
  - Property: Boundary_Integrity
    Value: The gray (5) boundary shape and position are preserved in the output.
