            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background and a single object made of gray (5) pixels. This gray object generally forms a closed or partially closed boundary, like a 'C' shape or an upside-down 'U'.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original gray (5) shape. The key difference is that some of the white (0) pixels from the input grid have been changed to azure (8).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a \"flood fill\" operation. The gray (5) pixels act as barriers or walls. The fill color is azure (8).\n4.  **Fill Origin:** The fill seems to originate from the white (0) pixels that are enclosed or \"inside\" the area defined by the gray (5) shape.\n5.  **Fill Propagation:** The azure (8) fill spreads to all connected white (0) pixels, using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right). The fill stops when it hits a gray (5) pixel or the edge of the grid.\n6.  **\"Escape\" Phenomenon:** Crucially, if there is a path of connected white (0) pixels leading from the \"inside\" area to the \"outside\", the azure (8) fill will follow this path and color pixels outside the initial enclosed region. This was observed in both examples where the fill extended vertically upwards (train_1) or downwards (train_2) through a gap in the gray boundary.\n7.  **Identifying \"Inside\":** The core challenge is reliably identifying the \"inside\" white pixels to start the fill. A potential method is to first identify all white pixels reachable from the grid's border (the \"outside\") and consider any remaining white pixels as \"inside\".\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all white (0) pixels located on the border (top, bottom, left, right edges) of the temporary grid.\n4.  Perform a flood fill (using a temporary marker or color distinct from 0-9) on the temporary grid, starting from these border white pixels. This fill should only spread to adjacent white (0) pixels (using 4-way connectivity) and must stop at gray (5) pixels or grid boundaries. Mark all reached pixels.\n5.  Create the output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.\n6.  Iterate through all pixels of the temporary grid. If a pixel is white (0) in the temporary grid (meaning it was *not* reached by the border fill), identify the corresponding pixel location in the *output* grid. These are the \"seed\" pixels for the main fill.\n7.  Perform a second flood fill on the *output* grid. Start this fill simultaneously from all the \"seed\" pixel locations identified in the previous step.\n8.  This second flood fill uses azure (8) as the fill color. It spreads to adjacent white (0) pixels (using 4-way connectivity) in the output grid. The fill stops when it encounters gray (5) pixels or the grid boundaries. Any white (0) pixel reached by this fill is changed to azure (8).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
