A white pixel is considered enclosed if it cannot reach the grid border by traversing only adjacent white pixels. Gray pixels act as barriers.\n\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify 'exterior' white pixels: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all white pixels located on the grid borders. This BFS can only traverse through other white pixels. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'visited'.\n3. Fill 'interior' white pixels: Iterate through the entire grid. If a pixel was originally white (in the input grid) but was *not* marked as 'visited' by the border BFS, change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.\n4.
