            "text": "**Metrics Confirmation:**\nThe code execution confirms the previous analysis:\n- The actual output is identical to the input in both examples.\n- The number of pixels that should have changed from white (0) to azure (8) is 18 in Example 1 and 19 in Example 2.\n- The gray pixels remain unchanged in all cases.\n\n**Revised Plan Refinement:**\nThe core idea is sound: find the \"truly inside\" white pixels and then flood fill outwards from them using azure, stopping only at gray pixels or boundaries.\n\nLet's detail the steps for identifying \"truly inside\" pixels:\n1. Create a 'visited' grid, initialized to false.\n2. Create a queue for BFS.\n3. Add all *border* pixels that are *not gray* (i.e., white in these examples) to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Perform BFS:\n   - Dequeue a pixel (r, c).\n   - For each 4-way neighbor (nr, nc):\n     - If the neighbor is within bounds, *not gray*, and *not visited*:\n       - Mark neighbor as visited.\n       - Enqueue neighbor.\n5. After the BFS completes, any white pixel in the input grid that is *not* marked as visited is a \"truly inside\" pixel.\n\nThen, proceed with the second flood fill:\n1. Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Create a queue for the second BFS.\n3. Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel (r, c) is white *and* was *not* marked as visited in the previous step (i.e., it's \"truly inside\"):\n   - Change `output_grid[r, c]` to azure (8).\n   - Add (r, c) to the second queue.\n4. Perform the second BFS:\n   - Dequeue a pixel (r, c).\n   - For each 4-way neighbor (nr, nc):\n     - If the neighbor is within bounds, *not gray* (in the input grid), and *not yet azure* (in the output grid):\n       - Change `output_grid[nr, nc]` to azure (8).\n       - Enqueue neighbor.\n5. Return the final output grid.\n\nThis looks much more robust and seems to handle the \"leaking\" behavior observed in the examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because its definition of \"enclosed\" white pixels was too restrictive. It identified white pixels reachable from the border *without* crossing gray pixels and assumed all others were \"inside\". However, in the examples, *all* white pixels are technically reachable from the border if the path can go through the gap in the gray structure. As a result, no pixels were identified as \"inside\", and the flood fill step was skipped, leading to the output being identical to the input.\n\nThe key insight is that the fill originates from white pixels that are truly enclosed (cannot reach the border without crossing gray) but then *expands* outwards, including through gaps in the gray structure, filling adjacent white pixels until it hits another gray pixel or the grid boundary.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Identify \"truly enclosed\" white pixels by performing a flood fill from the border, treating gray pixels as impassable barriers. White pixels *not* reached by this fill are the seeds.\n2.  Perform a second flood fill starting from *all* seed pixels simultaneously. This fill uses azure (8), spreads to adjacent white pixels, and is only stopped by gray pixels (5) or the grid boundaries.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided results and `tool_code` execution:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Input:** 10x10 grid, contains white (0) and gray (5). Gray pixels form a 'U' shape. White pixels count: 83. Gray pixels count: 17.\n*   **Expected Output:** 10x10 grid, contains white (0), gray (5), and azure (8). Azure fills the area inside the 'U' and extends one column above the gap. White pixels count: 65. Gray pixels count: 17. Azure pixels count: 18.\n*   **Actual Output (from previous code):** 10x10 grid, identical to input. White pixels count: 83. Gray pixels count: 17. Azure pixels count: 0.\n*   **Difference:** 18 white pixels in the input should have been converted to azure. The actual output had 0 changes.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Input:** 10x10 grid, contains white (0) and gray (5). Gray pixels form a rectangle with a gap at the bottom. White pixels count: 81. Gray pixels count: 19.\n*   **Expected Output:** 10x10 grid, contains white (0), gray (5), and azure (8). Azure fills the area inside the rectangle and extends down one column below the gap. White pixels count: 62. Gray pixels count: 19. Azure pixels count: 19.\n*   **Actual Output (from previous code):** 10x10 grid, identical to input. White pixels count: 81. Gray pixels count: 19. Azure pixels count: 0.\n*   **Difference:** 19 white pixels in the input should have been converted to azure. The actual output had 0 changes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
