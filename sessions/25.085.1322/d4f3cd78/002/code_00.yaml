observations:
  - object:
      type: color
      value: 0
      name: white
      role: background / fillable area
  - object:
      type: color
      value: 5
      name: gray
      role: boundary / wall
  - object:
      type: color
      value: 8
      name: azure
      role: fill color
  - relationships:
      - gray pixels form contiguous or near-contiguous shapes, acting as barriers.
      - these barriers may contain gaps.
      - white pixels exist both "inside" and "outside" the area defined by the gray barriers.
  - actions:
      - identify white pixels that cannot reach the grid border without crossing a gray pixel (seed pixels).
      - perform a flood fill starting from all seed pixels simultaneously.
      - the fill color is azure (8).
      - the fill spreads to adjacent (4-way) white pixels.
      - the fill stops upon encountering a gray pixel or the grid boundary.
      - the fill *does not* stop if it encounters a white pixel that *could* reach the border without crossing gray; it continues filling through gaps.
      - gray pixels remain unchanged.
      - white pixels not reached by the fill remain unchanged.
