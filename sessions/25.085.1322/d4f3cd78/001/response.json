Identify all white (0) pixels reachable from the grid's border without crossing gray (5) pixels. This is done using a flood fill (BFS) starting from all border white pixels. Mark these reachable 'outside' pixels.\n2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3.  Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that were *not* marked as 'outside' in step 1. These are the 'inside' pixels.\n4.  Perform a second flood fill (BFS) on the output grid, starting simultaneously from all identified 'inside' white pixels.\n5.  This second fill uses azure (8) as the fill color and spreads to adjacent (4-way) white (0) pixels.\n6.  The fill stops at gray (5) pixels or grid boundaries.\n7.
