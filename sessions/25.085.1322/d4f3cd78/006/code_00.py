# BFS starts from all border cells where input != GRAY (i.e., all border cells are white(0))
# queue starts with all border cells (0,0)...(0,9), (1,0),(1,9)...(9,0),(9,9)
# reachable_from_border initialized to False, set to True for border cells.

# Consider pixel (6, 3) which is white(0) in input, azure(8) in output. Should be UNREACHABLE.
# Path from border: e.g., (6, 0) -> (6, 1) -> reachable.
# Check neighbors of (6, 1): (5, 1)=0, (7, 1)=0, (6, 0)=0 (already visited), (6, 2)=5 (GRAY, stop).
# So, (6, 2) blocks path from left.
# Path from top: e.g., (0, 3) -> (1, 3) ... -> (4, 3) -> reachable.
# Check neighbors of (4, 3): (3, 3)=0, (5, 3)=5 (GRAY, stop), (4, 2)=0, (4, 4)=0.
# So, (5, 3) blocks path from top.
# Path from right: e.g., (6, 9) -> (6, 8) -> reachable.
# Check neighbors of (6, 8): (5, 8)=0, (7, 8)=0, (6, 7)=5 (GRAY, stop), (6, 9)=0 (visited).
# So, (6, 7) blocks path from right.
# Path from bottom: e.g., (9, 3) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8) -> reachable.
# Check neighbors of (9, 8): (8, 8)=0, (9, 7)=5 (GRAY, stop), (9, 9)=0 (visited).
# Path from bottom: (9, 3) -> ... wait, (9,3) is 5 (GRAY). Okay, need path around it.
# (9, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> ... We established paths from left/right/top borders can reach points near the gray shapes.
# Can we reach (6,3) from (6,1)? No, blocked by (6,2)=5.
# Can we reach (6,3) from (4,3)? No, blocked by (5,3)=5.
# Can we reach (6,3) from (6,8)? No, blocked by (6,7)=5.
# Can we reach (6,3) from (8,3)? Yes! (8,3) is white. Is (8,3) reachable?
# (8, 1) -> reachable. Neighbors: (7,1)=0, (9,1)=0, (8,0)=0, (8,2)=5 (stop).
# (9, 1) -> reachable. Neighbors: (8,1)=0, (9,0)=0, (9,2)=5 (stop).
# How to reach (8,3)? Need path like (8,1) -> ... maybe (8,1) -> (7,1) -> (7,2) -> (7,3) -> (8,3)? No, (7,2) is white. (7,3) is white. Yes!
# Is (7,2) reachable? (6,1) -> (7,1) -> (7,2). Yes.
# So, (7,2) is reachable. Its neighbor (7,3) is reachable. Its neighbor (8,3) is reachable. Its neighbor (6,3) is reachable.

MY MANUAL TRACE SHOWS (6,3) IS REACHABLE. THIS MATCHES THE TOOL CODE RESULT BUT *CONTRADICTS* THE EXPECTED OUTPUT.

What is fundamentally different between the filled and unfilled white areas?

Look at Example 1 again.
Filled: (0..4, 5), (5,5), (6,3..6), (7,3..6), (8,3..6)
Unfilled: Everywhere else that's white.

Consider the column x=5. Pixels (0,5) to (5,5) are filled.
Pixel (5,5) is adjacent to gray pixels (5,4) and (5,6).
Pixel (4,5) is adjacent to (5,5) which becomes azure(8). No gray adjacency.
Pixel (0,5) is adjacent to (1,5) which becomes azure(8). No gray adjacency.

Consider the region (6,3) to (8,6). This is bounded by gray on left (x=2), right (x=7), top (row 5), bottom (row 9). All white pixels inside this bounding box become azure.

It appears there are TWO separate fill areas in Example 1:
1. The column segment (0,5) to (5,5).
2. The rectangle (6,3) to (8,6).

And in Example 2:
1. The rectangle (3,3) to (6,6).
2. The column segment (7,5) to (9,5).

Maybe the rule is: Find white pixels that are part of a "vertical shaft" or "horizontal shaft" that is blocked at both ends by gray pixels OR borders?

Let's test this on Ex 1, pixel (4,5) (which should be filled 8):
- Vertical shaft: (0,5) to (5,5). Blocked below by gray (5,4)? No. Blocked below by (6,5)? Which is filled 8. Blocked by gray (9,5)? Yes. Blocked above by border? Yes. Blocked at both ends? Yes (border, gray). -> Fill?
- Horizontal shaft: (4,0) to (4,9). Blocked left by border? Yes. Blocked right by border? Yes. -> Fill? (This would fill everything).

Maybe only consider shafts *between* gray pixels?

Let's reconsider the reachability idea, but with a different definition of "barrier". What if the barrier is *only* gray pixels that are part of a larger gray structure? (e.g., > 1 pixel). No, that doesn't change anything here.

Could it be related to symmetry or specific shapes? Unlikely given ARC priors.

Let's simplify. The most robust pattern seems to be:
1. Gray pixels are walls.
2. Perform a flood fill from the grid border, visiting any non-gray cell. Mark visited cells.
3. Iterate through the grid. If a cell was originally WHITE and was NOT visited by the flood fill, change it to AZURE.

Why did this fail in the `tool_code` execution and my manual trace? Let's re-read the `tool_code` BFS implementation *very* carefully.
