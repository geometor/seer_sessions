"""
Identifies connected regions of non-gray pixels that are not connected to the grid border ('interior' regions). Fills the originally white pixels within these interior regions with azure (8). Gray (5) pixels act as impenetrable barriers.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Initialize a boolean grid `visited` to keep track of non-gray pixels reachable from the border.
3. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all non-gray pixels located on the grid borders.
    - The BFS traverses only through adjacent non-gray pixels (pixels with values other than 5).
    - Mark all reachable non-gray pixels as `visited`.
4. Iterate through the entire grid. If a pixel was originally white (0) in the input grid but was *not* marked as `visited` by the border BFS, it belongs to an interior region. Change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.
5. Return the modified output grid.
