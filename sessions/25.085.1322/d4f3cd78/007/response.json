Fills the originally white pixels within these interior regions with azure (8). Gray (5) pixels act as impenetrable barriers.\n\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Initialize a boolean grid `visited` to keep track of non-gray pixels reachable from the border.\n3. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all non-gray pixels located on the grid borders.\n    - The BFS traverses only through adjacent non-gray pixels (pixels with values other than 5).\n    - Mark all reachable non-gray pixels as `visited`.\n4. Iterate through the entire grid. If a pixel was originally white (0) in the input grid but was *not* marked as `visited` by the border BFS, it belongs to an interior region. Change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.\n5.
