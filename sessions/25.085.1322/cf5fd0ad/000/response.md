Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid of pixels. The output is consistently a 12x12 grid of pixels. The output dimensions are exactly 4 times the input dimensions in both height and width.
2.  **Tiling Structure:** The output grid appears to be constructed by tiling 3x3 blocks. Since the output is 12x12 and the input is 3x3, the output grid is composed of a 4x4 arrangement of these 3x3 blocks (tiles).
3.  **Tile Transformations:** Each 3x3 tile in the output grid is derived from the original 3x3 input grid, but potentially transformed. By examining the examples, there seem to be four distinct 3x3 patterns used to tile the output grid.
4.  **Tiling Pattern:** These four unique 3x3 tiles are themselves arranged in a larger 2x2 pattern within the 4x4 tile grid. Let's call the four unique transformed tiles T_A, T_B, T_C, and T_D. The output grid is structured as:
    ```

    T_A T_A T_B T_B
    T_A T_A T_B T_B
    T_C T_C T_D T_D
    T_C T_C T_D T_D
    
```
5.  **Transformation Definitions:**
    *   Let the input grid be `I`.
    *   `T_D` (bottom-right blocks) is identical to the input grid `I`.
    *   `T_A` (top-left blocks) is the input grid `I` rotated by 180 degrees.
    *   `T_B` (top-right blocks) is a specific rearrangement of the input pixels:
        ```

        Input:      T_B:
        A B C       A B C
        D E F       H E D
        G H I       I F G
        
```
    *   `T_C` (bottom-left blocks) is another specific rearrangement:
        ```

        Input:      T_C:
        A B C       G F I
        D E F       D E H
        G H I       A B C
        
```
    These transformations and the tiling pattern hold true across all provided training examples.

task_description: Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 12x12 output grid by tiling transformed versions of the input.

elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      pixels: varying colors (represented by integers 0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 12
      width: 12
      structure: Composed of a 4x4 arrangement of 3x3 tiles.

  - name: tile
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      derivation: Each tile is a transformation of the input_grid.
      count: 16 tiles in the output_grid.

transformations:
  - name: T_A (Rotation 180)
    input: input_grid
    output: 3x3 tile
    rule: Rotate input_grid by 180 degrees.
    position: Top-left 2x2 block of tiles (rows 0-1, cols 0-1 in the 4x4 tile grid).

  - name: T_B (Custom Transform 1)
    input: input_grid
    output: 3x3 tile
    rule: Rearrange pixels as defined: row0=input_row0, row1=[input(2,1), input(1,1), input(1,0)], row2=[input(2,2), input(1,2), input(2,0)].
    position: Top-right 2x2 block of tiles (rows 0-1, cols 2-3 in the 4x4 tile grid).

  - name: T_C (Custom Transform 2)
    input: input_grid
    output: 3x3 tile
    rule: Rearrange pixels as defined: row0=[input(2,0), input(1,2), input(2,2)], row1=[input(1,0), input(1,1), input(2,1)], row2=input_row0.
    position: Bottom-left 2x2 block of tiles (rows 2-3, cols 0-1 in the 4x4 tile grid).

  - name: T_D (Identity)
    input: input_grid
    output: 3x3 tile
    rule: No transformation; tile is identical to input_grid.
    position: Bottom-right 2x2 block of tiles (rows 2-3, cols 2-3 in the 4x4 tile grid).

relationships:
  - The output_grid is 4 times the height and 4 times the width of the input_grid.
  - The output_grid is constructed by placing the transformed tiles (T_A, T_B, T_C, T_D) in a specific 4x4 pattern, where each transformation type occupies a 2x2 block of tiles.
