"""
Performs a flood fill transformation starting from existing Maroon (9) pixels.
The fill propagates outwards using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).
Only Azure (8) pixels encountered during the propagation are changed to Maroon (9).
All other pixels, including initial Maroon pixels and pixels of other colors, remain unchanged.
Pixels that are not Azure (8) or Maroon (9) act as barriers to the propagation.
