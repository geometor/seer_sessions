*   **Perception**
    *   The input and output are grids of pixels with different colors.
    *   The primary colors involved in the transformation appear to be Azure (8) and Maroon (9). Other colors like White (0) and Orange (7) are present but seem to act as boundaries or remain unchanged.
    *   The transformation involves changing some, but not all, Azure (8) pixels to Maroon (9).
    *   Maroon (9) pixels already present in the input grid seem to be the starting points or "seeds" for the transformation.
    *   The change propagates outwards from the initial Maroon (9) pixels, converting adjacent (including diagonally adjacent) Azure (8) pixels to Maroon (9).
    *   This propagation continues iteratively: newly converted Maroon pixels can then cause adjacent Azure pixels to change in the next step.
    *   The propagation stops when it hits the grid boundaries or pixels that are not Azure (8). It effectively performs a flood fill originating from the initial Maroon pixels, but only filling Azure areas.

*   **Facts**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - type: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: An integer from 0-9 (White, Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Gray, Magenta, Orange, Azure, Maroon).
          - position: (row, column) coordinates.
          - adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (8-way connectivity).
      - type: object
        description: Implicit objects formed by contiguous pixels of the same color.
        properties:
          - color
          - shape
          - location
    
    initial_state:
      - description: The input grid contains pixels of various colors.
      - key_feature: Presence of specific 'source' Maroon (9) pixels.
      - key_feature: Presence of Azure (8) pixels, some potentially adjacent to source Maroon pixels.
      - key_feature: Presence of other colors (e.g., White 0, Orange 7) that act as boundaries.
    
    transformation:
      - action: Identify all initial Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
      - action: Identify all Azure (8) pixels directly adjacent (8-way connectivity) to any currently identified Maroon (9) pixel.
      - action: Mark these adjacent Azure (8) pixels for transformation.
      - action: Iteratively repeat the process: Identify Azure (8) pixels adjacent to newly marked pixels and mark them as well.
      - condition: The iteration continues until no new Azure (8) pixels adjacent to marked pixels can be found.
      - action: Change the color of all marked pixels to Maroon (9) in the output grid.
      - constraint: Only Azure (8) pixels are affected by the transformation.
      - constraint: Pixels of colors other than Azure (8) act as barriers to the propagation.
    
    final_state:
      - description: The output grid reflects the input grid with specific Azure (8) pixels changed to Maroon (9).
      - relationship_to_input: The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the Azure (8) pixels that were reachable by propagation from the initial Maroon (9) pixels, which are now Maroon (9).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Initialize a set of "active" Maroon pixels with the coordinates of all pixels that are initially Maroon (9) in the input grid.
    2.  Initialize an empty set to store the coordinates of Azure (8) pixels that need to be changed to Maroon (9).
    3.  Start an iterative process:
        a.  Create an empty set to store the coordinates of Azure (8) pixels found in the current iteration.
        b.  For each "active" Maroon pixel (from the initial set or changed in a previous iteration):
            i.  Examine all its 8 neighbors (adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
            ii. For each neighbor:
                1.  If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries, is currently Azure (8) in the *input* grid, and has *not* already been marked for change (i.e., is not in the set of pixels to change), add its coordinates to the set of newly found Azure pixels for this iteration.
        c.  If the set of newly found Azure pixels is empty, stop the iterative process.
        d.  Otherwise, add all coordinates from the newly found set to the main set of pixels to change. Update the set of "active" Maroon pixels to be the coordinates just added in this iteration. Repeat from step 3a.
    4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    5.  For each coordinate in the final set of pixels to change, update the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to Maroon (9).
    6.  Return the final output grid.
