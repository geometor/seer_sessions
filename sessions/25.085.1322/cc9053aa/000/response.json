Other colors like White (0) and Orange (7) are present but seem to act as boundaries or remain unchanged.\n    *   The transformation involves changing some, but not all, Azure (8) pixels to Maroon (9).\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels already present in the input grid seem to be the starting points or \"seeds\" for the transformation.\n    *   The change propagates outwards from the initial Maroon (9) pixels, converting adjacent (including diagonally adjacent) Azure (8) pixels to Maroon (9).\n    *   This propagation continues iteratively: newly converted Maroon pixels can then cause adjacent Azure pixels to change in the next step.\n    *   The propagation stops when it hits the grid boundaries or pixels that are not Azure (8). It effectively performs a flood fill originating from the initial Maroon pixels, but only filling Azure areas.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
