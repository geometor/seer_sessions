```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

"""
Performs a flood fill transformation starting from existing Maroon (9) pixels.
The fill propagates outwards using 4-way cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right).
Only Azure (8) pixels encountered during the propagation are changed to Maroon (9).
Existing Maroon (9) pixels allow the propagation to continue through them.
All other pixels (colors 0-7) act as barriers and stop the propagation.
The initial Maroon pixels remain Maroon. Pixels not reached by the fill remain unchanged.
