            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid consists of pixels primarily colored white (0) and red (2). Crucially, there's a single, complete horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels roughly in the middle of each grid.\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid consists only of white (0) and green (3) pixels.\n3.  **Dimensionality:**\n    *   All input grids are 13 rows by 5 columns.\n    *   All output grids are 6 rows by 5 columns.\n    *   The yellow line in the input is always at row index 6 (the 7th row).\n    *   The output grid's height (6) matches the height of the portion of the input grid *above* the yellow line. The width (5) remains the same.\n4.  **The Separator:** The yellow line acts as a separator, dividing the input grid into two distinct 6x5 sections (excluding the separator line itself): an upper section and a lower section.\n5.  **Color Transformation:** The transformation involves the upper and lower sections derived from the input. Red (2) and white (0) pixels from the input sections combine to produce either green (3) or white (0) pixels in the output.\n6.  **Pixel-wise Operation:** Comparing the upper section (Grid A), the lower section (Grid B), and the output grid (Grid O) pixel by pixel suggests a specific interaction rule:\n    *   If A[i,j] is white(0) and B[i,j] is white(0), then O[i,j] is white(0).\n    *   If A[i,j] is white(0) and B[i,j] is red(2), then O[i,j] is green(3).\n    *   If A[i,j] is red(2) and B[i,j] is white(0), then O[i,j] is green(3).\n    *   If A[i,j] is red(2) and B[i,j] is red(2), then O[i,j] is white(0).\n7.  **Logical Equivalence:** This pattern is identical to the logical XOR operation, if we map white(0) to logical 0 and red(2) to logical 1. The result 0 maps back to white(0) and the result 1 maps back to green(3).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
