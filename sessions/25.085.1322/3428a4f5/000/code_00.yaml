task_description: Pixel-wise comparison between two subgrids derived from the input determines the output pixel color.
elements:
  - type: Grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      - Contains white(0) and red(2) pixels.
      - Contains a single horizontal separator line of yellow(4) pixels.
      - Size: 13x5 in examples.
  - type: Grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      - Contains white(0) and green(3) pixels.
      - Size: 6x5 in examples.
  - type: Separator
    name: yellow_line
    properties:
      - Color: yellow(4)
      - Orientation: horizontal
      - Location: Row index 6 (7th row) in examples.
      - Function: Divides input_grid into upper and lower sections.
  - type: SubGrid
    name: upper_section (Grid A)
    properties:
      - Location: Portion of input_grid above the yellow_line.
      - Size: 6x5 in examples.
      - Pixels: white(0) and red(2).
  - type: SubGrid
    name: lower_section (Grid B)
    properties:
      - Location: Portion of input_grid below the yellow_line.
      - Size: 6x5 in examples.
      - Pixels: white(0) and red(2).
relationships:
  - type: Derivation
    source: input_grid
    target: [upper_section, lower_section]
    rule: Splitting the input_grid at the yellow_line (excluding the line itself).
  - type: Transformation
    source: [upper_section, lower_section]
    target: output_grid
    rule: Pixel-wise comparison based on color.
actions:
  - name: Find Separator
    input: input_grid
    output: row_index of yellow_line
  - name: Extract Subgrids
    input: input_grid, row_index
    output: upper_section, lower_section
  - name: Pixel-wise Comparison (XOR equivalent)
    input: pixel from upper_section, corresponding pixel from lower_section
    output: pixel color for output_grid
    logic: |
      Map white(0) -> 0, red(2) -> 1.
      Perform XOR: A_val XOR B_val.
      Map result 0 -> white(0), result 1 -> green(3).
  - name: Construct Output
    input: results of pixel-wise comparisons
    output: output_grid
