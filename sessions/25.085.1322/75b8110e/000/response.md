*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids are always 8x8, and the output grids are always 4x4.
    *   The input grids appear to be composed of four distinct 4x4 quadrants.
        *   Top-Left (rows 0-3, cols 0-3): Contains yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.
        *   Top-Right (rows 0-3, cols 4-7): Contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
        *   Bottom-Left (rows 4-7, cols 0-3): Contains magenta (6) and white (0) pixels.
        *   Bottom-Right (rows 4-7, cols 4-7): Contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels.
    *   The output grid seems to be generated by overlaying or combining information from the four input quadrants.
    *   For each position (r, c) in the 4x4 output grid, the color appears to be determined by the colors at the corresponding position (r, c) within each of the four input quadrants.
    *   There seems to be a priority order among the non-white colors (yellow, gray, magenta, maroon) that determines the output color when multiple non-white colors are present at the same relative position in the quadrants. Examining the examples suggests the priority: Gray (5) > Magenta (6) > Maroon (9) > Yellow (4). If all four corresponding input pixels are white (0), the output pixel is also white (0).

          derivation: Pixel-wise combination of input quadrants.

    transformation:
      - action: split_input
        details: Divide the 8x8 input grid into four 4x4 quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR).
      - action: generate_output_pixel
        details: For each coordinate (r, c) from (0,0) to (3,3):
          - inputs: pixels at TL[r, c], TR[r, c], BL[r, c], BR[r, c].
          - logic: Identify non-white colors among the four input pixels.
          - rule: Select the output color based on the highest priority present:
              1. Gray (5)
              2. Magenta (6)
              3. Maroon (9)
              4. Yellow (4)
          - condition: If no non-white colors are present, the output is white (0).
          - output: Set the pixel at output_grid[r, c] to the selected color.

    color_priority:
      - Gray (5)
      - Magenta (6)
      - Maroon (9)
      - Yellow (4)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty 4x4 output grid.
    2.  Divide the 8x8 input grid into four 4x4 subgrids (quadrants):
        *   `TL`: Input rows 0-3, columns 0-3.
        *   `TR`: Input rows 0-3, columns 4-7.
        *   `BL`: Input rows 4-7, columns 0-3.
        *   `BR`: Input rows 4-7, columns 4-7.
    3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to 3 and each column `c` from 0 to 3.
    4.  For the current `(r, c)`, retrieve the colors from the corresponding positions in the four quadrants: `color_tl = TL[r, c]`, `color_tr = TR[r, c]`, `color_bl = BL[r, c]`, `color_br = BR[r, c]`.
    5.  Check if Gray (5) is present among `color_tl`, `color_tr`, `color_bl`, `color_br`. If yes, set the output grid pixel `output[r, c]` to 5 and continue to the next `(r, c)`.
    6.  If Gray (5) is not present, check if Magenta (6) is present. If yes, set `output[r, c]` to 6 and continue to the next `(r, c)`.
    7.  If neither Gray (5) nor Magenta (6) is present, check if Maroon (9) is present. If yes, set `output[r, c]` to 9 and continue to the next `(r, c)`.
    8.  If none of the above are present, check if Yellow (4) is present. If yes, set `output[r, c]` to 4 and continue to the next `(r, c)`.
    9.  If none of the colors 4, 5, 6, or 9 are present (meaning all four corresponding input pixels are white), set `output[r, c]` to 0 (white).
    10. After iterating through all `(r, c)`, return the completed 4x4 output grid.
