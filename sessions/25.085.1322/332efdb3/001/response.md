"""
Get the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same height and width.
For each cell in the output grid, identified by its row index `r` and column index `c` (starting from 0):
  a. Check if the row index `r` is even.
  b. If `r` is even, set the cell's color to blue (1).
  c. If `r` is odd:
      i. Check if the column index `c` is even.
      ii. If `c` is even, set the cell's color to blue (1).
      iii.If `c` is odd, set the cell's color to white (0).
Return the completed output grid.
