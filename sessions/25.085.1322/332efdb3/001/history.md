Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Analysis:** The input grids in all examples are completely filled with the color white (0). The size of the input grid varies (5x5, 7x7, 9x9).
2.  **Output Analysis:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They are filled with a pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The pattern in the output grid seems dependent on the row and column indices.
    *   Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).
    *   Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) have an alternating pattern: blue (1) at even column indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and white (0) at odd column indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
4.  **Transformation Hypothesis:** The transformation ignores the content of the input grid (which is uniformly white) and generates a patterned output grid based solely on the grid dimensions and the parity (evenness or oddness) of the row and column indices. The dimensions of the output grid match the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Content: Uniformly white (0) pixels
      Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 5x5, 7x7, 9x9)
    Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Content: Pattern of blue (1) and white (0) pixels
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Pattern:
        - Rows with even indices are entirely blue (1).
        - Rows with odd indices contain alternating pixels:
          - Blue (1) at even column indices.
          - White (0) at odd column indices.
Relationship:
  - The transformation generates a grid pattern based on coordinate parity.
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the input grid dimensions.
  - The input grid's pixel values (all white) do not directly influence the output pattern's colors or structure, only its size.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Get the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same height and width.
3.  For each cell in the output grid, identified by its row index `r` and column index `c` (starting from 0):
    a.  Check if the row index `r` is even.
    b.  If `r` is even, set the cell's color to blue (1).
    c.  If `r` is odd:
        i.  Check if the column index `c` is even.
        ii. If `c` is even, set the cell's color to blue (1).
        iii.If `c` is odd, set the cell's color to white (0).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
