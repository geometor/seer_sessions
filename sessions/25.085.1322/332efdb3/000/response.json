The size of the input grid varies (5x5, 7x7, 9x9).\n2.  **Output Analysis:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They are filled with a pattern using blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The pattern in the output grid seems dependent on the row and column indices.\n    *   Rows with even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are entirely filled with blue (1).\n    *   Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) have an alternating pattern: blue (1) at even column indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and white (0) at odd column indices (1, 3, 5, ...).\n4.  **Transformation Hypothesis:** The transformation ignores the content of the input grid (which is uniformly white) and generates a patterned output grid based solely on the grid dimensions and the parity (evenness or oddness) of the row and column indices. The dimensions of the output grid match the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
