Examples:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Content: Uniformly white (0) pixels
      Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 5x5, 7x7, 9x9)
    Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array (Matrix)
      Content: Pattern of blue (1) and white (0) pixels
      Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
      Pattern:
        - Rows with even indices are entirely blue (1).
        - Rows with odd indices contain alternating pixels:
          - Blue (1) at even column indices.
          - White (0) at odd column indices.
Relationship:
  - The transformation generates a grid pattern based on coordinate parity.
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the input grid dimensions.
  - The input grid's pixel values (all white) do not directly influence the output pattern's colors or structure, only its size.
