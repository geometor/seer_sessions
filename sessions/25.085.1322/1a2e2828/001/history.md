Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

The task requires transforming an input grid, which typically features horizontal and vertical lines or segments of different colors against a white background, into a single-pixel output grid containing just one color. The core challenge is to identify the rule that determines which color from the input grid becomes the output color.

Inputs often show multiple lines, some spanning the full width/height, others interrupted by lines of different colors or white space. Lines can be repeated (multiple rows/columns of the same color pattern).

The output is always a 1x1 grid, indicating a selection process based on some property of the lines or colors present in the input.

**Analysis of Transformation:**

I observed two primary types of relevant "lines" in the inputs:

1.  **Solid Lines:** Rows or columns composed *entirely* of a single non-white color. No white pixels or pixels of other colors are present in that row/column.
2.  **Mono-color Lines:** Rows or columns where all *non-white* pixels share the same color. These lines *can* contain white pixels.

Based on the examples, the selection logic seems to prioritize Solid Lines first, and then considers Mono-color Lines if the Solid Line rules don't yield a result. There also appears to be a precedence order (Horizontal then Vertical for Solid, but Vertical then Horizontal for Mono-color uniqueness).

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Identify Solid Lines:**
    *   Scan each row. If a row consists entirely of a single non-white color `C`, mark `C` as a "Solid H Color".
    *   Scan each column. If a column consists entirely of a single non-white color `C`, mark `C` as a "Solid V Color".
2.  **Analyze Solid Lines:**
    *   Count the occurrences of each unique Solid H Color. Find colors that appear exactly once ("Unique Solid H Colors").
    *   Count the occurrences of each unique Solid V Color. Find colors that appear exactly once ("Unique Solid V Colors").
    *   **Rule 1:** If there is exactly one Unique Solid H Color, the output is that color.
    *   **Rule 2:** Else if there is exactly one Unique Solid V Color, the output is that color.
    *   **Rule 3:** Else if only one distinct color forms *any* Solid H Lines (even if multiple lines of that color exist), the output is that color.
    *   **Rule 4:** Else if only one distinct color forms *any* Solid V Lines (even if multiple lines of that color exist), the output is that color.
3.  **If No Solid Line Rule Applied, Identify Mono-color Lines:**
    *   Scan each row. If all non-white pixels in the row have the same color `C`, mark `C` as a "Mono H Color".
    *   Scan each column. If all non-white pixels in the column have the same color `C`, mark `C` as a "Mono V Color".
4.  **Analyze Mono-color Lines:**
    *   Count the occurrences of each unique Mono H Color. Find colors that appear exactly once ("Unique Mono H Colors").
    *   Count the occurrences of each unique Mono V Color. Find colors that appear exactly once ("Unique Mono V Colors").
    *   **Rule 5:** If there is exactly one Unique Mono V Color, the output is that color.
    *   **Rule 6:** Else if there is exactly one Unique Mono H Color, the output is that color.

This sequence of rules consistently explains the transformation for all provided training examples.
