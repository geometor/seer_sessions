## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of a small input grid (3x3 in all training cases) and a larger output grid. The output grid dimensions are always multiples of the input grid dimensions.
2.  **Transformation Type:** The output grid is clearly formed by repeating or tiling the input grid pattern.
3.  **Tiling Factor:** The number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically (the tiling factor) varies between examples.
    *   Examples 1 & 2: Input is tiled 2x2 times.
    *   Example 3: Input is tiled 4x4 times.
    *   Examples 4 & 5: Input is tiled 3x3 times.
4.  **Determining the Factor:** The key is to determine *how* the tiling factor is derived from the input grid. By analyzing the unique pixel values (colors) present in each input grid, a consistent pattern emerges:
    *   Example 1: Unique colors {orange(7), red(2)}. Count = 2. Tiling factor = 2.
    *   Example 2: Unique colors {green(3), yellow(4)}. Count = 2. Tiling factor = 2.
    *   Example 3: Unique colors {azure(8), red(2), blue(1), green(3)}. Count = 4. Tiling factor = 4.
    *   Example 4: Unique colors {red(2), green(3), blue(1)}. Count = 3. Tiling factor = 3.
    *   Example 5: Unique colors {maroon(9), orange(7), magenta(6)}. Count = 3. Tiling factor = 3.
    The tiling factor consistently matches the count of unique colors present in the input grid.
5.  **Conclusion:** The transformation involves calculating the number of distinct colors in the input grid and then tiling the input grid that many times in both the horizontal and vertical directions to produce the output grid.

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  type: grid
  description: A small rectangular grid of pixels with various colors (values 1-9). In the examples, all inputs are 3x3.

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A larger rectangular grid composed of repetitions of the input grid pattern.

Transformation:
  type: Tiling
  input_object: The entire input grid pattern.
  parameters:
    - name: tiling_factor
      description: The number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically.
      derivation: Calculated as the count of unique pixel values (colors) present in the input grid.
  process:
    - Step 1: Analyze the input grid to identify all unique pixel values (colors).
    - Step 2: Count the number of unique values found in Step 1. This count is the 'tiling_factor'.
    - Step 3: Construct the output grid by repeating the input grid 'tiling_factor' times horizontally and 'tiling_factor' times vertically.

Relationships:
  - The dimensions of the output grid are the dimensions of the input grid multiplied by the 'tiling_factor'.
    (output_height = input_height * tiling_factor, output_width = input_width * tiling_factor)
  - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the content and unique colors of the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify all the distinct numerical values (colors) present in the pixels of the input grid.
3.  Count the total number of these distinct values. Let this count be `F`.
4.  Create a new output grid whose height is `F` times the input grid's height and whose width is `F` times the input grid's width.
5.  Fill the output grid by tiling the input grid pattern `F` times horizontally and `F` times vertically. For any pixel at `(row, col)` in the output grid, its value is determined by the pixel at `(row % input_height, col % input_width)` in the input grid, where `input_height` and `input_width` are the dimensions of the input grid.
