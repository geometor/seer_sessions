Input:
  type: grid
  description: A small rectangular grid of pixels with various colors (values 1-9). In the examples, all inputs are 3x3.

Output:
  type: grid
  description: A larger rectangular grid composed of repetitions of the input grid pattern.

Transformation:
  type: Tiling
  input_object: The entire input grid pattern.
  parameters:
    - name: tiling_factor
      description: The number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically.
      derivation: Calculated as the count of unique pixel values (colors) present in the input grid.
  process:
    - Step 1: Analyze the input grid to identify all unique pixel values (colors).
    - Step 2: Count the number of unique values found in Step 1. This count is the 'tiling_factor'.
    - Step 3: Construct the output grid by repeating the input grid 'tiling_factor' times horizontally and 'tiling_factor' times vertically.

Relationships:
  - The dimensions of the output grid are the dimensions of the input grid multiplied by the 'tiling_factor'.
    (output_height = input_height * tiling_factor, output_width = input_width * tiling_factor)
  - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the content and unique colors of the input grid.
