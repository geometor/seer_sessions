The output grid dimensions are always multiples of the input grid dimensions.\n2.  **Transformation Type:** The output grid is clearly formed by repeating or tiling the input grid pattern.\n3.  **Tiling Factor:** The number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically (the tiling factor) varies between examples.\n    *   Examples 1 & 2: Input is tiled 2x2 times.\n    *   Example 3: Input is tiled 4x4 times.\n    *   Examples 4 & 5: Input is tiled 3x3 times.\n4.  **Determining the Factor:** The key is to determine *how* the tiling factor is derived from the input grid. By analyzing the unique pixel values (colors) present in each input grid, a consistent pattern emerges:\n    *   Example 1: Unique colors {orange(7), red(2)}. Count = 2. Tiling factor = 2.\n    *   Example 2: Unique colors {green(3), yellow(4)}. Count = 2. Tiling factor = 2.\n    *   Example 3: Unique colors {azure(8), red(2), blue(1), green(3)}. Count = 4. Tiling factor = 4.\n    *   Example 4: Unique colors {red(2), green(3), blue(1)}. Count = 3. Tiling factor = 3.\n    *   Example 5: Unique colors {maroon(9), orange(7), magenta(6)}. Count = 3. Tiling factor = 3.\n    The tiling factor consistently matches the count of unique colors present in the input grid.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transformation involves calculating the number of distinct colors in the input grid and then tiling the input grid that many times in both the horizontal and vertical directions to produce the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
