task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: rectangle
      color: gray (5)
      properties:
        - variable_size
        - variable_position
        - solid_fill_in_input
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: [white (0), gray (5), red (2)]
        - position: (row, column)
        - neighborhood: 8 adjacent pixels (Moore neighborhood)
  actions:
    - identify: locate all gray (5) pixels.
    - analyze_neighborhood: for each gray pixel, check the color of its 8 neighbors.
    - modify_color: change the color of a gray pixel to red (2) if all its 8 neighbors are also gray (5).
  relationships:
    - spatial: adjacency between pixels (including diagonals).
    - containment: inner pixels are surrounded by border pixels within the gray rectangle object.
