Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (10x10 for both train_1 and train_2).
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background, gray (5) forming shapes, and red (2) appearing in the output.
3.  **Shapes:** The input grids contain one or more solid gray rectangles of varying sizes and positions.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to modify the gray rectangles. The outer layer (or border) of the gray rectangles remains gray in the output. The inner pixels of the gray rectangles, those completely surrounded by other gray pixels, are changed to red.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds for both rectangles in train_1 and both rectangles in train_2. The definition of "inner pixels" seems consistent: a gray pixel is changed to red if, and only if, all 8 of its immediate neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) are also gray in the input grid. Pixels on the edge of a gray rectangle will have at least one neighbor that is not gray (either white background or outside the grid), so they remain gray.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color: white (0)
  objects:
    - type: rectangle
      color: gray (5)
      properties:
        - variable_size
        - variable_position
        - solid_fill_in_input
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: [white (0), gray (5), red (2)]
        - position: (row, column)
        - neighborhood: 8 adjacent pixels (Moore neighborhood)
  actions:
    - identify: locate all gray (5) pixels.
    - analyze_neighborhood: for each gray pixel, check the color of its 8 neighbors.
    - modify_color: change the color of a gray pixel to red (2) if all its 8 neighbors are also gray (5).
  relationships:
    - spatial: adjacency between pixels (including diagonals).
    - containment: inner pixels are surrounded by border pixels within the gray rectangle object.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid at position (row, column).
3.  Check the color of the current pixel in the input grid.
4.  If the pixel color is gray (5):
    a.  Examine all 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals) relative to the current pixel's position. Ensure neighbor coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
    b.  Count how many of these valid neighbors are also gray (5).
    c.  If all 8 neighbors are within the grid and are all gray (5), set the color of the corresponding pixel at (row, column) in the *output* grid to red (2).
    d.  Otherwise (if fewer than 8 neighbors are gray, or if any neighbor is outside the grid boundary, or if any neighbor is not gray), keep the color of the corresponding pixel at (row, column) in the *output* grid as gray (5).
5.  If the pixel color in the input grid is not gray (5) (e.g., it's white (0)), copy its color directly to the corresponding pixel at (row, column) in the *output* grid.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
