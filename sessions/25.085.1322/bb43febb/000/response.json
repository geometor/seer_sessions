The outer layer (or border) of the gray rectangles remains gray in the output. The inner pixels of the gray rectangles, those completely surrounded by other gray pixels, are changed to red.\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds for both rectangles in train_1 and both rectangles in train_2. The definition of \"inner pixels\" seems consistent: a gray pixel is changed to red if, and only if, all 8 of its immediate neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) are also gray in the input grid. Pixels on the edge of a gray rectangle will have at least one neighbor that is not gray (either white background or outside the grid), so they remain gray.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
