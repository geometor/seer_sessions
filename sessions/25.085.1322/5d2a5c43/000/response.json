This column seems to act as a separator.\n    *   The blue separator divides the input grid into two distinct 6x4 subgrids: one to its left (columns 0-3) and one to its right (columns 5-8).\n    *   The output grid's dimensions (6x4) match the dimensions of these left and right subgrids.\n    *   Comparing the left subgrid, right subgrid, and the output grid position by position suggests a combination rule.\n    *   Specifically, a pixel in the output grid appears to be azure (8) if the corresponding pixel in *either* the left subgrid *or* the right subgrid of the input is yellow (4).\n    *   If the corresponding pixels in both the left and right subgrids are white (0), the output pixel is white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
