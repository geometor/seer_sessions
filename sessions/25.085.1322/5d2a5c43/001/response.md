"""
Combines two subgrids extracted from the input grid based on the presence of yellow (4) pixels.

The input grid is expected to have a vertical blue (1) line at column index 4, separating it into a left 6x4 subgrid and a right 6x4 subgrid.
The output grid is 6x4. For each pixel position (r, c), the output pixel is set to azure (8) if the corresponding pixel in either the left subgrid or the right subgrid is yellow (4). Otherwise (if both corresponding input pixels are white (0)), the output pixel is set to white (0).
