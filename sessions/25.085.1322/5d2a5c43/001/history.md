*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids consistently have a width of 9 and a height of 6.
    *   The output grids consistently have a width of 4 and a height of 6.
    *   The input grids contain pixels of white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4).
    *   The output grids contain pixels of white (0) and azure (8).
    *   A prominent feature in all input grids is a single vertical column of blue (1) pixels located at the 5th column (index 4). This column seems to act as a separator.
    *   The blue separator divides the input grid into two distinct 6x4 subgrids: one to its left (columns 0-3) and one to its right (columns 5-8).
    *   The output grid's dimensions (6x4) match the dimensions of these left and right subgrids.
    *   Comparing the left subgrid, right subgrid, and the output grid position by position suggests a combination rule.
    *   Specifically, a pixel in the output grid appears to be azure (8) if the corresponding pixel in *either* the left subgrid *or* the right subgrid of the input is yellow (4).
    *   If the corresponding pixels in both the left and right subgrids are white (0), the output pixel is white (0).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the vertical line composed entirely of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This line serves as a separator.
    2.  Extract the subgrid located to the left of the blue separator (columns 0 through 3). Call this the `left_grid`.
    3.  Extract the subgrid located to the right of the blue separator (columns 5 through 8). Call this the `right_grid`.
    4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the `left_grid` and `right_grid` (6 rows, 4 columns).
    5.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `5` and `c=0` to `3`.
    6.  At each position (`r`, `c`), examine the pixel value in the `left_grid` and the pixel value in the `right_grid`.
    7.  If the pixel value at (`r`, `c`) in `left_grid` is yellow (4), OR the pixel value at (`r`, `c`) in `right_grid` is yellow (4), then set the pixel value at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to azure (8).
    8.  Otherwise (meaning both pixel values at (`r`, `c`) in `left_grid` and `right_grid` are white (0)), set the pixel value at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to white (0).
    9.  Return the generated output grid.
