```python
"""
Identifies a horizontal and a vertical line in the input grid, determines their intersection point, and modifies a 3x3 area centered at this intersection. The 3x3 area is initially filled with yellow (4). Then, certain pixels within this area are restored to their original input colors based on the colors of the intersecting lines:
1. The center pixel is restored unless the vertical line's color is green (3).
2. The horizontal neighbors of the center pixel are restored unless the horizontal line's color is azure (8).
