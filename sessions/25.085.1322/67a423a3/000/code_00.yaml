task_description: Modifies a 3x3 area around the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line based on the specific colors of those lines.

elements:
  - object: horizontal_line
    description: A continuous horizontal line of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: color_h (The color of the horizontal line, e.g., 8, 2, 9)
      - row_index: r (The row index of the horizontal line)
  - object: vertical_line
    description: A continuous vertical line (or distinct vertical elements in a single column) of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: color_v (The color of the vertical line, e.g., 6, 3, 1)
      - column_index: c (The column index of the vertical line)
  - object: intersection
    description: The single pixel where the conceptual horizontal and vertical lines cross.
    properties:
      - coordinates: (r, c)
  - object: modification_area
    description: A 3x3 square grid region centered at the intersection point (r, c).
  - object: fill_color
    description: The primary color used to modify the area.
    properties:
      - color_value: 4
      - color_name: yellow

transformation_logic:
  - step: Identify Lines and Intersection
    details: Find the horizontal line (color `color_h`, row `r`) and vertical line (color `color_v`, column `c`). The intersection is at `(r, c)`.
  - step: Initialize Output
    details: Create the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
  - step: Fill Area Yellow
    details: Iterate through all coordinates `(i, j)` within the 3x3 square centered at `(r, c)`. If `(i, j)` is within the grid bounds, set `output[i, j]` to yellow (4).
  - step: Conditional Restoration (Center)
    details: Check the vertical line color `color_v`. If `color_v` is NOT green (3), restore the pixel at the intersection `(r, c)` in the output grid to its original color from the input grid (`input[r, c]`).
  - step: Conditional Restoration (Horizontal Neighbors)
    details: Check the horizontal line color `color_h`. If `color_h` is NOT azure (8), restore the pixels at the horizontal neighbors `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` in the output grid to their original colors from the input grid (`input[r, c-1]` and `input[r, c+1]`, respectively), provided these coordinates are within the grid bounds.

assumptions:
  - Each input grid contains exactly one discernible horizontal line and one vertical line/structure made of non-background colors.
  - These lines intersect at exactly one point.
  - The 3x3 modification area calculation respects grid boundaries.
