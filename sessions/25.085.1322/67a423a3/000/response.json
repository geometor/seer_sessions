            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains exactly one continuous horizontal line and one continuous vertical line (or vertically aligned elements that clearly define a column) of solid, non-white colors. The rest of the grid is typically white (0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid, except for modifications within a 3x3 area.\n3.  **Intersection:** The horizontal and vertical lines intersect at a single point in each example.\n4.  **Modification Area:** A 3x3 square area centered on the intersection point is the focus of the transformation.\n5.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change is filling the 3x3 area with yellow (4).\n6.  **Conditional Preservation:** Some pixels within the 3x3 area retain their original colors from the input grid, overriding the yellow fill. This preservation depends on:\n    *   The position of the pixel relative to the intersection center (center, horizontal neighbor, vertical neighbor, corner).\n    *   The specific colors of the original horizontal and vertical lines.\n7.  **Specific Color Rules:**\n    *   The center pixel `(r, c)` retains its original input color *unless* the vertical line's color is green (3). If the vertical line is green, the center becomes yellow.\n    *   The horizontal neighbors `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` retain their original input colors *unless* the horizontal line's color is azure (8). If the horizontal line is azure, these neighbors become yellow.\n    *   The vertical neighbors `(r-1, c)` and `(r+1, c)` and the corner pixels within the 3x3 area always become yellow (or stay yellow if filled).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each pixel `(i, j)` within this 3x3 area (from `r-1` to `r+1` and `c-1` to `c+1`), if `(i, j)` is within the grid's boundaries, set the color of `output_grid[i, j]` to yellow (4).\n4.  **Check Center Pixel:** Examine the vertical line's color, `color_v`. If `color_v` is not equal to green (3), then set the color of the center pixel `output_grid[r, c]` back to its original value from `input_grid[r, c]`.\n5.  **Check Horizontal Neighbors:** Examine the horizontal line's color, `color_h`.
