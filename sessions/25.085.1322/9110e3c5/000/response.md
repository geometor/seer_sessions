Okay, the total count of non-white pixels doesn't seem to directly correlate with the output pattern in a simple way (like modulo arithmetic).

**Hypothesis 2: Specific Color Counts**

Let's try counting specific colors. Maybe the count of a particular color matters? Or the counts of pairs of colors?

Let's analyze the counts of each color (1-9) for each input and see if there's a pattern related to the output pattern A, B, or C.

``` python
import numpy as np

inputs = [
    np.array([[1, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0], [1, 1, 9, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1], [0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8], [0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1]]),
    np.array([[0, 3, 0, 3, 5, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 4, 3, 9, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 9, 3, 1, 3, 3], [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]]),
    np.array([[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3], [0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 6], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [5, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2, 2]]),
    np.array([[2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 8], [2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]]),

```
Okay, looking at the counts of specific colors, or combinations, doesn't reveal an obvious simple rule either.

Let's re-examine the patterns A, B, C and the relationship `Total non-white count mod 3`.

*   Pattern A: `[[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]` -> Total count mod 3 is always 2.
*   Pattern B: `[[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]` -> Total count mod 3 is 0 or 2.
*   Pattern C: `[[0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]` -> Total count mod 3 is 2 or 0.

This still doesn't perfectly distinguish the patterns. Maybe the modulo result isn't the *only* factor.

Let's revisit the counts:
Pattern A inputs: 23, 23 (Mod 3: 2, 2)
Pattern B inputs: 24, 29 (Mod 3: 0, 2)
Pattern C inputs: 29, 18, 26 (Mod 3: 2, 0, 2)

It seems the rule is:
1.  Calculate the total number of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the 7x7 input grid. Let this be `N`.
2.  Calculate `M = N mod 3`.
3.  If `M` is 0, the output is Pattern B or Pattern C.
4.  If `M` is 1, (This doesn't happen in the examples, maybe it maps to a fourth pattern or is invalid?)
5.  If `M` is 2, the output is Pattern A, Pattern B, or Pattern C.

This is not specific enough. What distinguishes B from C when M=0? What distinguishes A, B, and C when M=2?

Let's look at the total counts again, grouped by pattern:
A: [23, 23]
B: [24, 29]
C: [29, 18, 26]

Notice:
*   If Count mod 3 == 0:
    *   If Count == 24 -> Pattern B
    *   If Count == 18 -> Pattern C
*   If Count mod 3 == 2:
    *   If Count == 23 -> Pattern A
    *   If Count == 29 -> Pattern B *or* Pattern C (Examples have one of each)
    *   If Count == 26 -> Pattern C

This is still messy. Let's refine the Modulo 3 rule possibility.

*   If N mod 3 == 0, output is Pattern C (`[[0,0,0],[8,8,8],[0,0,0]]`) ?
    *   No, train_2 has N=24 (mod 3 = 0) but outputs Pattern B.
    *   train_4 has N=18 (mod 3 = 0) and outputs Pattern C.
*   If N mod 3 == 1, (no examples)
*   If N mod 3 == 2, output is Pattern A (`[[0,0,8],[8,8,0],[0,8,0]]`) ?
    *   No, train_1 and train_7 have N=23 (mod 3 = 2) and output Pattern A.
    *   train_5 has N=29 (mod 3 = 2) but outputs Pattern B.
    *   train_3 has N=29 (mod 3 = 2) but outputs Pattern C.
    *   train_6 has N=26 (mod 3 = 2) and outputs Pattern C.

It seems the mapping is:
*   N mod 3 == 0 -> Pattern C (e.g., 18) **OR** Pattern B (e.g., 24)
*   N mod 3 == 2 -> Pattern A (e.g., 23) **OR** Pattern B (e.g., 29) **OR** Pattern C (e.g., 26, 29)

There must be another condition.

Maybe it's `(N // 3) mod 3`?
A: [23 // 3 = 7 (mod 3 = 1), 23 // 3 = 7 (mod 3 = 1)] -> Result 1 -> Pattern A?
B: [24 // 3 = 8 (mod 3 = 2), 29 // 3 = 9 (mod 3 = 0)] -> Result 2 or 0 -> Pattern B?
C: [29 // 3 = 9 (mod 3 = 0), 18 // 3 = 6 (mod 3 = 0), 26 // 3 = 8 (mod 3 = 2)] -> Result 0 or 2 -> Pattern C?

Let's combine `N mod 3` and `(N // 3) mod 3`:
Index = `(N mod 3) * 3 + (N // 3) mod 3` ? No, that doesn't make sense.

Let's define the three output patterns numerically:
Pattern A = `[[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`
Pattern B = `[[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`
Pattern C = `[[0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`

Consider `N mod 9`:
A: [23 mod 9 = 5, 23 mod 9 = 5]
B: [24 mod 9 = 6, 29 mod 9 = 2]
C: [29 mod 9 = 2, 18 mod 9 = 0, 26 mod 9 = 8]

This looks promising!
*   If N mod 9 == 5 -> Pattern A
*   If N mod 9 == 6 -> Pattern B
*   If N mod 9 == 2 -> Pattern B *or* Pattern C (train_5 -> B, train_3 -> C)
*   If N mod 9 == 0 -> Pattern C
*   If N mod 9 == 8 -> Pattern C

Still ambiguity when N mod 9 == 2. What distinguishes train_5 (N=29, mod 9 = 2 -> B) from train_3 (N=29, mod 9 = 2 -> C)?

Let's check the color counts again for train_3 and train_5.
Train 3 (C): {1: 1, 2: 20, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 0, 9: 1} (N=29, mod 9 = 2)
Train 5 (B): {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 21, 4: 4, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 1, 8: 0, 9: 0} (N=29, mod 9 = 2)

Difference:
*   Train 3 has many red (2), few green (3).
*   Train 5 has few red (2), many green (3).

Let's define the rule based on N mod 9, and use a secondary condition for N mod 9 = 2.

Rule attempt:
1. Count non-white pixels `N`.
2. Calculate `M = N mod 9`.
3. If `M` = 5, output Pattern A.
4. If `M` = 6, output Pattern B.
5. If `M` = 0, output Pattern C.
6. If `M` = 8, output Pattern C.
7. If `M` = 2:
    a. Count red pixels (color 2), `R`.
    b. Count green pixels (color 3), `G`.
    c. If `R > G`, output Pattern C (like train_3: R=20, G=1).
    d. If `G > R`, output Pattern B (like train_5: R=1, G=21).

Let's check this rule against all examples:
*   train_1: N=23. M=5. Output A. Correct.
*   train_2: N=24. M=6. Output B. Correct.
*   train_3: N=29. M=2. R=20, G=1. R > G. Output C. Correct.
*   train_4: N=18. M=0. Output C. Correct.
*   train_5: N=29. M=2. R=1, G=21. G > R. Output B. Correct.
*   train_6: N=26. M=8. Output C. Correct.
*   train_7: N=23. M=5. Output A. Correct.

This rule seems consistent with all training examples.

**Final Plan:**
1.  **Perception**: The task involves mapping a 7x7 input grid to one of three possible 3x3 output grids composed of white (0) and azure (8). The specific output pattern depends on the properties of the input grid.
2.  **Facts**:
    *   Input grids are 7x7.
    *   Output grids are 3x3.
    *   Output grids only contain white (0) and azure (8).
    *   There are three distinct output patterns (A, B, C).
    *   The selection of the output pattern depends on the total count (`N`) of non-white pixels in the input.
    *   The primary rule involves `N mod 9`.
    *   A secondary rule, comparing the counts of red (2) and green (3) pixels, is needed when `N mod 9 == 2`.
3.  **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Define the three possible output patterns:
        *   Pattern A: `[[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`
        *   Pattern B: `[[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`
        *   Pattern C: `[[0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`
    2.  Count the total number of pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0). Let this count be `N`.
    3.  Calculate the remainder `M` when `N` is divided by 9 (`M = N mod 9`).
    4.  Determine the output pattern based on `M`:
        *   If `M` is 5, the output is Pattern A.
        *   If `M` is 6, the output is Pattern B.
        *   If `M` is 0 or 8, the output is Pattern C.
        *   If `M` is 2:
            a. Count the number of red pixels (value 2) in the input grid. Let this be `R`.
            b. Count the number of green pixels (value 3) in the input grid. Let this be `G`.
            c. If `R` is greater than `G`, the output is Pattern C.
            d. Otherwise (if `G` is greater than or equal to `R`), the output is Pattern B.
    5. Return the selected 3x3 output pattern.**Perception of Task Elements**

The task requires transforming a 7x7 input grid containing various colors (pixels 0-9) into a fixed-size 3x3 output grid. The output grids consist solely of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. There are exactly three distinct 3x3 patterns observed across all training outputs. The core challenge lies in identifying the rule within the input grid that determines which of these three specific 3x3 patterns should be generated. The rule appears to be based on numerical properties derived from the counts of pixels in the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - item: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - content: pixels with values 0-9 (various colors)
  - item: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - content: pixels with values 0 (white) and 8 (azure) only
      - type: categorical, one of three predefined patterns
        patterns:
          - name: Pattern A
            grid: [[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]
          - name: Pattern B
            grid: [[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]
          - name: Pattern C
            grid: [[0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]
transformation:
  - rule: pattern_selection
    based_on: numerical properties of the input grid
    steps:
      - count total non-white pixels (N)
      - calculate N modulo 9 (M)
      - use M as the primary selector for the output pattern
      - when M results in ambiguity (M=2), use a secondary condition:
          - count red pixels (R)
          - count green pixels (G)
          - compare R and G to resolve ambiguity
relationship:
  - The total count of non-white pixels (N) in the input grid, specifically its value modulo 9, dictates which of the three predefined 3x3 output patterns is produced. A tie-breaking rule based on the relative counts of red and green pixels is used when N modulo 9 equals 2.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Define the three possible 3x3 output patterns:
    *   `Pattern A` consists of azure pixels at (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) and white pixels elsewhere.
    *   `Pattern B` consists of azure pixels at (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1) and white pixels elsewhere.
    *   `Pattern C` consists of azure pixels at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) and white pixels elsewhere.
2.  Analyze the input 7x7 grid. Count the total number of pixels whose value is not 0 (white). Let this total count be `N`.
3.  Calculate the remainder `M` when `N` is divided by 9 (`M = N % 9`).
4.  Select the output pattern based on the value of `M`:
    *   If `M` is 5, choose `Pattern A`.
    *   If `M` is 6, choose `Pattern B`.
    *   If `M` is 0 or 8, choose `Pattern C`.
    *   If `M` is 2:
        a. Count the number of pixels with value 2 (red) in the input grid. Let this count be `R`.
        b. Count the number of pixels with value 3 (green) in the input grid. Let this count be `G`.
        c. Compare `R` and `G`. If `R` is strictly greater than `G`, choose `Pattern C`.
        d. Otherwise (if `R` is less than or equal to `G`), choose `Pattern B`.
5.  Return the chosen 3x3 pattern as the output grid.
