If `M` is 2, the output is Pattern A, Pattern B, or Pattern C.\n\nThis is not specific enough. What distinguishes B from C when M=0? What distinguishes A, B, and C when M=2?\n\nLet's look at the total counts again, grouped by pattern:\nA: [23, 23]\nB: [24, 29]\nC: [29, 18, 26]\n\nNotice:\n*   If Count mod 3 == 0:\n    *   If Count == 24 -> Pattern B\n    *   If Count == 18 -> Pattern C\n*   If Count mod 3 == 2:\n    *   If Count == 23 -> Pattern A\n    *   If Count == 29 -> Pattern B *or* Pattern C (Examples have one of each)\n    *   If Count == 26 -> Pattern C\n\nThis is still messy.

Count non-white pixels `N`.\n2. Calculate `M = N mod 9`.\n3. If `M` = 5, output Pattern A.\n4. If `M` = 6, output Pattern B.\n5. If `M` = 0, output Pattern C.\n6. If `M` = 8, output Pattern C.\n7. If `M` = 2:\n    a. Count red pixels (color 2), `R`.\n    b. Count green pixels (color 3), `G`.\n    c. If `R > G`, output Pattern C (like train_3: R=20, G=1).\n    d. If `G > R`, output Pattern B (like train_5: R=1, G=21).\n\nLet's check this rule against all examples:\n*   train_1: N=23. M=5. Output A. Correct.\n*   train_2: N=24. M=6. Output B. Correct.\n*   train_3: N=29. M=2. R=20, G=1. R > G. Output C. Correct.\n*   train_4: N=18. M=0. Output C. Correct.\n*   train_5: N=29. M=2. R=1, G=21. G > R. Output B. Correct.\n*   train_6: N=26. M=8. Output C. Correct.\n*   train_7: N=23. M=5. Output A. Correct.\n\nThis rule seems consistent with all training examples.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n1.  **Perception**: The task involves mapping a 7x7 input grid to one of three possible 3x3 output grids composed of white (0) and azure (8). The specific output pattern depends on the properties of the input grid.\n2.  **Facts**:\n    *   Input grids are 7x7.\n    *   Output grids are 3x3.\n    *   Output grids only contain white (0) and azure (8).\n    *   There are three distinct output patterns (A, B, C).\n    *   The selection of the output pattern depends on the total count (`N`) of non-white pixels in the input.\n    *   The primary rule involves `N mod 9`.\n    *   A secondary rule, comparing the counts of red (2) and green (3) pixels, is needed when `N mod 9 == 2`.\n3.  **Natural Language Program**:\n    1.  Define the three possible output patterns:\n        *   Pattern A: `[[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`\n        *   Pattern B: `[[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`\n        *   Pattern C: `[[0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    2.  Count the total number of pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0). Let this count be `N`.\n    3.  Calculate the remainder `M` when `N` is divided by 9 (`M = N mod 9`).\n    4.  Determine the output pattern based on `M`:\n        *   If `M` is 5, the output is Pattern A.\n        *   If `M` is 6, the output is Pattern B.\n        *   If `M` is 0 or 8, the output is Pattern C.\n        *   If `M` is 2:\n            a. Count the number of red pixels (value 2) in the input grid. Let this be `R`.\n            b. Count the number of green pixels (value 3) in the input grid. Let this be `G`.\n            c. If `R` is greater than `G`, the output is Pattern C.\n            d. Otherwise (if `G` is greater than or equal to `R`), the output is Pattern B.\n    5. Return the selected 3x3 output pattern.**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nThe task requires transforming a 7x7 input grid containing various colors (pixels 0-9) into a fixed-size 3x3 output grid. The output grids consist solely of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. There are exactly three distinct 3x3 patterns observed across all training outputs. The core challenge lies in identifying the rule within the input grid that determines which of these three specific 3x3 patterns should be generated. The rule appears to be based on numerical properties derived from the counts of pixels in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
