These regions are not perfect geometric shapes and often have pixels of other colors interspersed within or along their boundaries. The background color is white (0).\n2.  **Output Analysis**: The output is always a 1-dimensional grid (either a single row or a single column).\n3.  **Color Mapping**: The colors present in the output grid are precisely the unique non-background colors found in the input grid.\n4.  **Ordering and Orientation**: The order of colors in the output grid corresponds to the spatial arrangement of the color regions in the input grid. If the color regions are primarily stacked vertically (top-to-bottom), the output is a column vector sorted by the vertical position of the colors. If the color regions are primarily arranged horizontally (left-to-right), the output is a row vector sorted by the horizontal position of the colors.\n5.  **Determining Orientation**: The primary axis (vertical or horizontal) can be determined by analyzing the average positions (centroids) of each non-background color. If the vertical spread (range of average row indices) is greater than or equal to the horizontal spread (range of average column indices), the primary axis is vertical. Otherwise, it's horizontal.\n6.  **Sorting**: Colors are sorted based on their average coordinate along the determined primary axis (average row for vertical, average column for horizontal).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Calculate the centroid (average row, average column) for each unique non-background color using the stored sums and counts. Store these centroids along with their corresponding colors.\n7.  Determine the range of average row indices (max_avg_row - min_avg_row) and the range of average column indices (max_avg_col - min_avg_col) across all calculated centroids.\n8.  Compare the ranges:\n    a.  If the row range is greater than or equal to the column range, set the primary axis to vertical and sort the colors based on their average row index in ascending order.\n    b.  Otherwise (column range is greater than row range), set the primary axis to horizontal and sort the colors based on their average column index in ascending order.\n9.  Construct the output grid:\n    a.  If the primary axis is vertical, create a grid with `N` rows and 1 column, where `N` is the number of unique non-background colors. Populate the column with the sorted colors.\n    b.  If the primary axis is horizontal, create a grid with 1 row and `N` columns. Populate the row with the sorted colors.\n10. Return the constructed output grid."
