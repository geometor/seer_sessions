task_description: Identify unique non-background colors, determine their dominant spatial arrangement (vertical or horizontal), sort them accordingly, and output them as a 1D grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: color_region
    description: A collection of pixels of the same non-background color in the input grid. Often large but irregularly shaped.
  - element: background_color
    value: 0
    description: The color white (0), which is ignored in the processing.
  - element: non_background_color
    description: Any color other than white (0) present in the input grid.
  - element: centroid
    description: The average position (row, column) of all pixels belonging to a specific non_background_color.
  - element: primary_axis
    description: The dominant direction (vertical or horizontal) along which the color_regions are arranged, determined by comparing the range of centroids' coordinates.
  - element: output_grid
    description: A 1D grid (single row or single column) containing the sorted non_background_colors.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_arrangement
    description: The non_background_colors (represented by their centroids) are arranged primarily either vertically or horizontally in the input grid.
  - type: sorting
    description: The non_background_colors are sorted based on their centroid coordinate along the primary_axis.
  - type: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into a 1D output_grid containing the sorted unique non_background_colors.
  - type: orientation_dependency
    description: The orientation of the output_grid (row or column) depends on the primary_axis of the input color_regions.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Find all unique non-background colors in the input grid.
  - action: calculate_centroids
    description: For each unique non-background color, compute the average row and column index of its pixels.
  - action: determine_primary_axis
    description: Calculate the range of average row indices and average column indices across all identified colors. Compare the ranges to determine if the primary axis is vertical (y-range >= x-range) or horizontal (x-range > y-range).
  - action: sort_colors
    description: Sort the identified non-background colors based on their average coordinate along the primary_axis (row index for vertical, column index for horizontal).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a 1D grid (column if vertical axis, row if horizontal axis) containing the sorted colors.
