**Perception**

1.  **Input Analysis**: The input grids contain large regions of distinct colors. These regions are not perfect geometric shapes and often have pixels of other colors interspersed within or along their boundaries. The background color is white (0).
2.  **Output Analysis**: The output is always a 1-dimensional grid (either a single row or a single column).
3.  **Color Mapping**: The colors present in the output grid are precisely the unique non-background colors found in the input grid.
4.  **Ordering and Orientation**: The order of colors in the output grid corresponds to the spatial arrangement of the color regions in the input grid. If the color regions are primarily stacked vertically (top-to-bottom), the output is a column vector sorted by the vertical position of the colors. If the color regions are primarily arranged horizontally (left-to-right), the output is a row vector sorted by the horizontal position of the colors.
5.  **Determining Orientation**: The primary axis (vertical or horizontal) can be determined by analyzing the average positions (centroids) of each non-background color. If the vertical spread (range of average row indices) is greater than or equal to the horizontal spread (range of average column indices), the primary axis is vertical. Otherwise, it's horizontal.
6.  **Sorting**: Colors are sorted based on their average coordinate along the determined primary axis (average row for vertical, average column for horizontal).

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify unique non-background colors, determine their dominant spatial arrangement (vertical or horizontal), sort them accordingly, and output them as a 1D grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: color_region
    description: A collection of pixels of the same non-background color in the input grid. Often large but irregularly shaped.
  - element: background_color
    value: 0
    description: The color white (0), which is ignored in the processing.
  - element: non_background_color
    description: Any color other than white (0) present in the input grid.
  - element: centroid
    description: The average position (row, column) of all pixels belonging to a specific non_background_color.
  - element: primary_axis
    description: The dominant direction (vertical or horizontal) along which the color_regions are arranged, determined by comparing the range of centroids' coordinates.
  - element: output_grid
    description: A 1D grid (single row or single column) containing the sorted non_background_colors.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_arrangement
    description: The non_background_colors (represented by their centroids) are arranged primarily either vertically or horizontally in the input grid.
  - type: sorting
    description: The non_background_colors are sorted based on their centroid coordinate along the primary_axis.
  - type: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into a 1D output_grid containing the sorted unique non_background_colors.
  - type: orientation_dependency
    description: The orientation of the output_grid (row or column) depends on the primary_axis of the input color_regions.

actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    description: Find all unique non-background colors in the input grid.
  - action: calculate_centroids
    description: For each unique non-background color, compute the average row and column index of its pixels.
  - action: determine_primary_axis
    description: Calculate the range of average row indices and average column indices across all identified colors. Compare the ranges to determine if the primary axis is vertical (y-range >= x-range) or horizontal (x-range > y-range).
  - action: sort_colors
    description: Sort the identified non-background colors based on their average coordinate along the primary_axis (row index for vertical, column index for horizontal).
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a 1D grid (column if vertical axis, row if horizontal axis) containing the sorted colors.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store unique non-background colors found in the input grid.
2.  Initialize a dictionary or similar structure to store the sum of row indices, sum of column indices, and count for each color.
3.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid.
4.  If the pixel's color is not the background color (0):
    a.  If the color is not already in the list of unique colors, add it.
    b.  Update the sums of row/column indices and the count for this color in the dictionary.
5.  If no non-background colors are found, return an empty grid or handle as an edge case.
6.  Calculate the centroid (average row, average column) for each unique non-background color using the stored sums and counts. Store these centroids along with their corresponding colors.
7.  Determine the range of average row indices (max_avg_row - min_avg_row) and the range of average column indices (max_avg_col - min_avg_col) across all calculated centroids.
8.  Compare the ranges:
    a.  If the row range is greater than or equal to the column range, set the primary axis to vertical and sort the colors based on their average row index in ascending order.
    b.  Otherwise (column range is greater than row range), set the primary axis to horizontal and sort the colors based on their average column index in ascending order.
9.  Construct the output grid:
    a.  If the primary axis is vertical, create a grid with `N` rows and 1 column, where `N` is the number of unique non-background colors. Populate the column with the sorted colors.
    b.  If the primary axis is horizontal, create a grid with 1 row and `N` columns. Populate the row with the sorted colors.
10. Return the constructed output grid.
