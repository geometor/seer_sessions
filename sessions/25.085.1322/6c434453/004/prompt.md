"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify "interior" white pixels (0) - those belonging to a contiguous area of white pixels that does not touch any edge of the grid.
2. Change these interior white pixels to red (2).
3. Identify all blue pixels (1) that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any of the identified interior white pixels.
4. Change these adjacent blue pixels to red (2).
5. All other pixels retain their original color.
