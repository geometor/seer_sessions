Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: error:
No module named 'scipy'
Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine our understanding.

## General Assessment and Strategy

1.  **Assessment**: The primary issue is a code execution failure due to a missing dependency (`scipy`). This means we cannot validate the correctness of the *previous* Python code logic against the examples using the provided results. The `scipy.ndimage.label` function was intended to identify connected components, specifically to find white areas not connected to the grid border ("interior" white pixels).
2.  **Strategy**:
    *   **Ignore Execution Results**: Since the code failed to run, the error report provides no information about the logic's validity.
    *   **Re-evaluate Logic**: We need to re-examine the *intended* logic of the Python code, particularly the `find_interior_white_pixels` and the neighbor transformation rules, in light of *all* training examples.
    *   **Manual/Simulated Analysis**: We must manually trace the intended logic or use tools (if applicable, perhaps using numpy without scipy for simpler cases if possible) on each training pair to see if the described transformation holds true.
    *   **Dependency Consideration**: We need to either find a way to implement the core logic (like finding enclosed areas) without `scipy` or ensure `scipy` is available in the execution environment for the Coder phase. Given the constraints, aiming for a `numpy`-only solution or standard Python libraries might be preferable. A flood-fill algorithm from the borders could potentially replace `scipy.ndimage.label`.
    *   **Refine Rules**: Based on the analysis of all examples, update the description of objects, actions, and the overall transformation rule.

## Metrics Gathering

    # Add other examples here when available

## Facts (Based on Initial Logic and Example 0 Analysis)


```yaml
task_description: Transforms a grid based on interactions between white and blue pixels.

grid_properties:
  - The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2).

objects:
  - name: Interior White Pixels
    description: White pixels (0) that are not reachable from the border of the grid through a path of contiguous white pixels (using 4 or 8 connectivity - 4 seems safer for flood fill from border). Requires checking neighbors. In example 0, these form a 2x2 square.
    identified_by: Flood fill from border white pixels; any white pixels not reached are interior.
  - name: Blue Border Pixels
    description: Blue pixels (1) that form a boundary around the interior white pixels.
  - name: Neighboring Blue Pixels
    description: Blue pixels (1) that are adjacent (8-directionally) to any Interior White Pixel.

actions:
  - action: Color Change (White to Red)
    objects: Interior White Pixels
    condition: Always applied to all identified Interior White Pixels.
    result: These pixels become red (2) in the output grid.
  - action: Color Change (Blue to Red)
    objects: Neighboring Blue Pixels
    condition: The blue pixel is 4-directionally adjacent (shares an edge) with at least one Interior White Pixel.
    result: These pixels become red (2) in the output grid.
  - action: Color Change (Blue to White)
    objects: Neighboring Blue Pixels
    condition: The blue pixel is only diagonally adjacent (shares a corner) with Interior White Pixels, AND it is NOT 4-directionally adjacent to ANY Interior White Pixel.
    result: These pixels become white (0) in the output grid. (This rule needs careful verification across all examples, as it wasn't observed in Example 0's output where *all* surrounding blue pixels turned red).

relationships:
  - adjacency: 4-directional (up, down, left, right) and diagonal adjacency between Interior White Pixels and Neighboring Blue Pixels determines the transformation outcome for the blue pixels.
  - enclosure: Interior White Pixels are defined by being enclosed (not connected to the border). The previous code implicitly assumes enclosure by *any* non-white color, while the description refers to blue. Example 0 has blue enclosure. This needs checking in other examples.

uncertainties:
  - Does the enclosing color *have* to be blue? The `find_interior_white_pixels` logic (using flood fill) doesn't check the enclosing color, only that the white area is enclosed.
  - The rule for changing diagonal blue neighbors to white needs validation. Example 0 shows *all* blue neighbors (including diagonals) becoming red. Perhaps the rule is simpler: *all* blue neighbors of interior white pixels become red? Or perhaps the diagonal rule applies only under specific circumstances not present in Example 0.

```


## Natural Language Program (Refined based on Example 0 and Initial Logic)

1.  **Identify Interior White Pixels**: Find all white pixels (color 0) in the input grid that are part of a contiguous area of white pixels which does not touch any edge of the grid. (This can be done using a flood-fill algorithm starting from all white pixels on the border; any white pixels not reached are "interior").
2.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create a copy of the input grid. This will be modified to become the output grid.
3.  **Transform Interior White Pixels**: Change the color of all identified Interior White Pixels to red (color 2) in the output grid.
4.  **Identify Blue Neighbors**: For each identified Interior White Pixel, examine its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid. Collect the coordinates of all neighbors that are blue (color 1).
5.  **Transform Blue Neighbors**: For each unique blue neighbor identified in the previous step:
    *   *(Hypothesis A - Simpler, matches Example 0)*: Change its color to red (color 2) in the output grid.
    *   *(Hypothesis B - Original Code Logic)*: Check if this blue neighbor is 4-directionally adjacent (shares an edge) to *any* of the Interior White Pixels.
        *   If YES, change its color to red (color 2) in the output grid.
        *   If NO (meaning it's only diagonally adjacent to all Interior White Pixels it touches), change its color to white (color 0) in the output grid.
6.  **Final Output**: The modified grid is the result.

*(Self-Correction during thought process: Hypothesis A seems more likely based solely on Example 0 provided in the metrics code, where all 12 blue pixels turned red. Hypothesis B (from the original code) would require further examples to validate the blue-to-white diagonal rule.)*

Let's proceed with **Hypothesis A** as the primary candidate based on the single example analyzed:

**Refined Natural Language Program (Hypothesis A):**

1.  **Identify Interior White Pixels**: Find all white pixels (0) that belong to a connected region of white pixels not touching the grid border.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create a copy of the input grid.
3.  **Color Interior White Pixels Red**: Change all identified Interior White Pixels to red (2) in the output grid.
4.  **Identify Affected Blue Neighbors**: Find all blue pixels (1) in the *input* grid that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one of the Interior White Pixels identified in step 1.
5.  **Color Affected Blue Neighbors Red**: Change all blue pixels identified in step 4 to red (2) in the output grid.
6.  **Final Output**: The resulting grid is the output.
