elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
  - role: shape_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    attributes:
      - forms connected components (objects)
      - can enclose background pixels
  - role: interior_background_pixel
    color: white (0)
    source: input
    attributes:
      - located at position (r, c)
      - unreachable by flood fill of white pixels starting from grid border
      - must be enclosed by shape_pixels
    target_color: red (2)
  - role: boundary_shape_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    source: input
    attributes:
      - located at position (nr, nc)
      - member of the 8-neighbor Moore neighborhood of an interior_background_pixel at (r, c)
    target_color_rules:
      - condition: is 4-directionally adjacent to (r, c)
        target_color: red (2)
      - condition: is only diagonally adjacent to (r, c)
        target_color: white (0)
  - role: other_pixel
    source: input
    attributes:
      - any pixel not classified as interior_background_pixel or boundary_shape_pixel
    target_color_rules:
      - condition: always
        target_color: same as input color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Adjacency (4-directional and 8-directional) between pixels.
  - type: topological
    description: Enclosure of white pixels by blue pixels. Reachability of white pixels from the grid border.

actions:
  - action: identify_interior_background
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: set of coordinates for interior_background_pixels
    method: Perform a flood fill on white pixels starting from all border white pixels. Any white pixel not visited is an interior_background_pixel.
  - action: transform_pixels
    inputs: input_grid, set of interior_background_pixels
    outputs: output_grid
    method:
      - Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid.
      - For each interior_background_pixel (r, c):
        - Set output_grid[r, c] = red (2).
        - Examine 8 neighbors (nr, nc) of (r, c).
        - If input_grid[nr, nc] is blue (1):
          - If (nr, nc) is 4-adjacent to (r, c), set output_grid[nr, nc] = red (2).
          - If (nr, nc) is only diagonally adjacent to (r, c), set output_grid[nr, nc] = white (0).
