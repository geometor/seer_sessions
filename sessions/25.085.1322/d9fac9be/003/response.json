Identify the two unique non-white (non-zero) colors present in the input grid. Let them be Color A and Color B, with counts Count A and Count B, respectively.\n2. Define a threshold value of 9.\n3. Check if *both* Count A and Count B are strictly less than 9.\n4. If both counts are less than 9:\n   a. Select the color with the maximum count.\n   b. If Count A equals Count B, select the color with the *lower* numerical value (e.g., if colors are 2 and 4, select 2).\n5. Otherwise (if at least one count is 9 or greater):\n   a. Select the color with the minimum count.\n   b. If Count A equals Count B, select the color with the *higher* numerical value (e.g., if colors are 3 and 8, select 8).\n6.
