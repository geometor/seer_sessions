"""
Transforms an input grid based on counts of its two non-white colors relative to a threshold.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the two unique non-white (non-zero) colors present in the input grid. Let them be Color A and Color B, with counts Count A and Count B, respectively.
2. Define a threshold value of 9.
3. Check if *both* Count A and Count B are strictly less than 9.
4. If both counts are less than 9:
   a. Select the color with the maximum count.
   b. If Count A equals Count B, select the color with the *lower* numerical value (e.g., if colors are 2 and 4, select 2).
5. Otherwise (if at least one count is 9 or greater):
   a. Select the color with the minimum count.
   b. If Count A equals Count B, select the color with the *higher* numerical value (e.g., if colors are 3 and 8, select 8).
6. The output is a 1x1 grid containing the selected color.
