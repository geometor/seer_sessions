Identify the two unique non-white (non-zero) colors present in the input grid.\n2. Count the occurrences of each of these two colors.\n3. Compare both counts to a threshold of 9.\n4. If both counts are less than 9:\n   - Select the color with the maximum count.\n   - If counts are equal, select the color with the higher numerical value.\n5. If at least one count is 9 or greater:\n   - Select the color with the minimum count.\n   - If counts are equal, select the color with the higher numerical value.\n6.
