elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of multiple colors
      - background color is white (0)
      - always contains exactly two non-white colors
  - type: color
    properties:
      - represented by integers 0-9
      - non-white colors are the focus
  - type: count
    properties:
      - frequency of each non-white color in the input grid
relationships:
  - type: selection_rule
    based_on: counts of the two non-white colors
    details:
      - rule depends on a threshold comparison (value seems to be 9)
      - if both counts < 9, select the color with the maximum count
      - otherwise (at least one count >= 9), select the color with the minimum count
output:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - size is 1x1
      - contains a single pixel
      - color is determined by the selection_rule applied to the input non-white color counts
