The background is predominantly white (0). There are scattered pixels of other colors. In all provided examples, exactly two non-white colors are present. The output is always a single pixel (a 1x1 grid) containing one of the non-white colors found in the input. The task seems to involve identifying the relevant non-white colors, counting their occurrences, and then applying a rule based on these counts to select the output color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
