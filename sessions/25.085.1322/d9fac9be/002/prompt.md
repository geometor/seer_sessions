This module defines a function to transform an input grid based on color counts.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the two unique non-white (non-zero) colors present in the input grid.
2. Count the occurrences of each of these two colors.
3. Compare both counts to a threshold of 9.
4. If both counts are less than 9:
   - Select the color with the maximum count.
   - If counts are equal, select the color with the higher numerical value.
5. If at least one count is 9 or greater:
   - Select the color with the minimum count.
   - If counts are equal, select the color with the higher numerical value.
6. The output is a 1x1 grid containing the selected color.
