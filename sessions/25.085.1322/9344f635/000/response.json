            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The tasks involve transforming input grids into output grids of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids use a limited palette of colors (0-9). There's a dominant background color, which appears to be orange (7) in all examples.\n3.  **Objects:** Non-background colors form distinct objects (contiguous pixels of the same color). These objects can be single pixels or groups of pixels.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the vertical extent (number of rows occupied) of these non-background objects.\n    *   Objects confined to a single row appear to cause that entire row in the output to be filled with the object's color.\n    *   Objects spanning multiple rows do not cause a row fill. Instead, their pixels contribute to a 'pattern' that is repeated in the rows *not* affected by single-row object fills.\n5.  **Row Filling:** If a row in the input contains one or more non-background objects, *but* all such objects are of the *same* color and *all* are confined strictly to that single row, then the entire corresponding row in the output is filled with that color.\n6.  **Pattern Replication:** If a row in the input contains no non-background objects, or contains objects spanning multiple rows, or contains single-row objects of *different* colors, it does not get filled entirely. Instead, it takes on a pattern derived from the pixels of the multi-row objects. This pattern seems to consist of placing the colors of the multi-row objects into their original column positions, against the background color.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"

Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors in the input grid.\n3.  For each object, record its color and the set of row indices it occupies.\n4.  Create a mapping to determine which rows should be filled entirely. For each row index `r` from 0 to height-1:\n    a.  Find all objects `O` such that `r` is the *only* row index occupied by `O`.\n    b.  Collect the unique colors of these objects found in step 4a.\n    c.  If exactly one unique color was collected for row `r`, mark row `r` to be filled with that color. Otherwise, mark row `r` as a pattern row.\n5.  Identify all \"template pixels\": These are the pixels belonging to objects that occupy *more than one* row index.\n6.  Create the output grid, initialized with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.\n7.  Iterate through each row index `r` of the output grid:\n    a.  If row `r` was marked for filling in step 4c, fill the entire row `r` in the output grid with its designated color.\n    b.  If row `r` was marked as a pattern row:\n        i.  Create a temporary 1D array (pattern template) of the grid's width, filled with the background color.\n        ii. For each template pixel identified in step 5, let its color be `k` and its column index be `c`. Set the element at index `c` in the pattern template to color `k`. (If multiple template pixels exist in the same column, the last one processed determines the color - based on examples, they seem to have consistent colors per column).\n        iii. Copy the contents of the pattern template into row `r` of the output grid.\n8.  Return the completed output grid."
