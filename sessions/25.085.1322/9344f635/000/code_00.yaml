Task: Row Fill or Pattern Replication based on Object Row Span

Input: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9)
Output: 2D grid of pixels (same dimensions as input)

Facts:
  - BackgroundColor: The most frequent color in the input grid (appears to be orange/7).
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-background pixels.
  - Object Properties:
      - Color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - Location: The set of (row, column) coordinates occupied by the object.
      - RowSpan: The set of unique row indices occupied by the object.
      - IsSingleRow: True if the object occupies exactly one row, False otherwise.
  - Row Analysis:
      - For each row in the input grid:
          - Identify all non-background objects intersecting that row.
          - Filter for objects where IsSingleRow is True AND their single row index matches the current row index.
          - Determine the unique colors of these filtered single-row objects.
          - If exactly one unique color exists among these filtered objects, the row is designated as a "Fill Row" with that color.
          - Otherwise, the row is designated as a "Pattern Row".
  - Template Pixels:
      - Pixels belonging to objects where IsSingleRow is False.
      - (Correction based on train_3 edge case?): Consider pixels from objects in rows designated as "Pattern Rows" due to multiple different-colored single-row objects. Let's stick to the simpler rule first: Template pixels are *only* from multi-row objects.
  - Output Construction:
      - Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with BackgroundColor.
      - For each "Fill Row": Fill the corresponding row in the output grid with its designated fill color.
      - For each "Pattern Row":
          - Create a temporary pattern row (1D array) filled with BackgroundColor.
          - For each Template Pixel (color `k` at `(r, c)`): Set the `c`-th element of the temporary pattern row to `k`.
          - Copy the temporary pattern row into the corresponding "Pattern Row" in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - An object's RowSpan determines its role: Single-row objects can trigger Row Fills, multi-row objects contribute to the Pattern Rows.
  - The designation of a row (Fill or Pattern) depends on the properties (Color, RowSpan) of the objects within it.
