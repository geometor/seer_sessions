Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The tasks involve transforming input grids into output grids of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use a limited palette of colors (0-9). There's a dominant background color, which appears to be orange (7) in all examples.
3.  **Objects:** Non-background colors form distinct objects (contiguous pixels of the same color). These objects can be single pixels or groups of pixels.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the vertical extent (number of rows occupied) of these non-background objects.
    *   Objects confined to a single row appear to cause that entire row in the output to be filled with the object's color.
    *   Objects spanning multiple rows do not cause a row fill. Instead, their pixels contribute to a 'pattern' that is repeated in the rows *not* affected by single-row object fills.
5.  **Row Filling:** If a row in the input contains one or more non-background objects, *but* all such objects are of the *same* color and *all* are confined strictly to that single row, then the entire corresponding row in the output is filled with that color.
6.  **Pattern Replication:** If a row in the input contains no non-background objects, or contains objects spanning multiple rows, or contains single-row objects of *different* colors, it does not get filled entirely. Instead, it takes on a pattern derived from the pixels of the multi-row objects. This pattern seems to consist of placing the colors of the multi-row objects into their original column positions, against the background color.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Row Fill or Pattern Replication based on Object Row Span

Input: 2D grid of pixels (colors 0-9)
Output: 2D grid of pixels (same dimensions as input)

Facts:
  - BackgroundColor: The most frequent color in the input grid (appears to be orange/7).
  - Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-background pixels.
  - Object Properties:
      - Color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - Location: The set of (row, column) coordinates occupied by the object.
      - RowSpan: The set of unique row indices occupied by the object.
      - IsSingleRow: True if the object occupies exactly one row, False otherwise.
  - Row Analysis:
      - For each row in the input grid:
          - Identify all non-background objects intersecting that row.
          - Filter for objects where IsSingleRow is True AND their single row index matches the current row index.
          - Determine the unique colors of these filtered single-row objects.
          - If exactly one unique color exists among these filtered objects, the row is designated as a "Fill Row" with that color.
          - Otherwise, the row is designated as a "Pattern Row".
  - Template Pixels:
      - Pixels belonging to objects where IsSingleRow is False.
      - (Correction based on train_3 edge case?): Consider pixels from objects in rows designated as "Pattern Rows" due to multiple different-colored single-row objects. Let's stick to the simpler rule first: Template pixels are *only* from multi-row objects.
  - Output Construction:
      - Create an output grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with BackgroundColor.
      - For each "Fill Row": Fill the corresponding row in the output grid with its designated fill color.
      - For each "Pattern Row":
          - Create a temporary pattern row (1D array) filled with BackgroundColor.
          - For each Template Pixel (color `k` at `(r, c)`): Set the `c`-th element of the temporary pattern row to `k`.
          - Copy the temporary pattern row into the corresponding "Pattern Row" in the output grid.

Relationships:
  - An object's RowSpan determines its role: Single-row objects can trigger Row Fills, multi-row objects contribute to the Pattern Rows.
  - The designation of a row (Fill or Pattern) depends on the properties (Color, RowSpan) of the objects within it.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors in the input grid.
3.  For each object, record its color and the set of row indices it occupies.
4.  Create a mapping to determine which rows should be filled entirely. For each row index `r` from 0 to height-1:
    a.  Find all objects `O` such that `r` is the *only* row index occupied by `O`.
    b.  Collect the unique colors of these objects found in step 4a.
    c.  If exactly one unique color was collected for row `r`, mark row `r` to be filled with that color. Otherwise, mark row `r` as a pattern row.
5.  Identify all "template pixels": These are the pixels belonging to objects that occupy *more than one* row index.
6.  Create the output grid, initialized with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
7.  Iterate through each row index `r` of the output grid:
    a.  If row `r` was marked for filling in step 4c, fill the entire row `r` in the output grid with its designated color.
    b.  If row `r` was marked as a pattern row:
        i.  Create a temporary 1D array (pattern template) of the grid's width, filled with the background color.
        ii. For each template pixel identified in step 5, let its color be `k` and its column index be `c`. Set the element at index `c` in the pattern template to color `k`. (If multiple template pixels exist in the same column, the last one processed determines the color - based on examples, they seem to have consistent colors per column).
        iii. Copy the contents of the pattern template into row `r` of the output grid.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
