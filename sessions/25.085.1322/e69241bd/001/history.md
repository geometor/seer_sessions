Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use colors like white (0), blue (1), red (2 - unused in examples), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), and azure (8).
3.  **Key Colors:**
    *   **White (0):** Appears to be the background or fillable space. Many white pixels in the input are colored in the output.
    *   **Gray (5):** Seems to act as static walls or boundaries. Gray pixels remain unchanged between input and output, and they appear to block the spread of other colors.
    *   **Other Colors (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8):** These colors exist as single pixels or small groups in the input. In the output, areas of white pixels adjacent to these initial colored pixels are filled with that same color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a "flood fill" or "expansion" process originating from the non-white, non-gray pixels present in the input.
5.  **Fill Behavior:**
    *   The fill starts from the initial colored pixels (seeds).
    *   The fill propagates into adjacent white (0) pixels.
    *   Adjacency includes all 8 neighbors (cardinal directions: up, down, left, right; and diagonals).
    *   The fill stops when it hits the grid boundary, a gray (5) pixel, or a pixel that is already colored (either originally or filled by this process).
    *   White pixels are changed to the color of the seed from which the fill originated.
    *   Gray pixels and the original seed pixels remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all "seed" pixels in the input grid. A seed pixel is any pixel whose color is not white (0) and not gray (5).
3.  Initialize a queue data structure for processing. For each seed pixel found, add its coordinates (row, column) and its color to the queue.
4.  Initialize a set data structure to keep track of the coordinates of white pixels that have already been visited and filled, preventing reprocessing. Add the coordinates of all initial seed pixels to this visited set.
5.  While the processing queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a pixel's coordinates `(r, c)` and its associated `fill_color`.
    b.  Examine all 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of the pixel at `(r, c)`. Let a neighbor's coordinates be `(nr, nc)`.
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        i.  Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid.
        ii. Check if the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output* grid currently has the color white (0).
        iii. Check if the coordinates `(nr, nc)` are *not* already in the visited set.
        iv. If all three conditions (i, ii, iii) are true:
            1.  Update the color of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the output grid to `fill_color`.
            2.  Add the coordinates `(nr, nc)` to the visited set.
            3.  Enqueue the neighbor's coordinates `(nr, nc)` and the `fill_color`.
6.  Once the queue is empty, all reachable white pixels have been filled. Return the modified output grid.
