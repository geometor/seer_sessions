An output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n2. \"Seed\" pixels are identified in the input grid. A seed pixel is any pixel whose color is not white (0) and not gray (5).\n3. A queue is initialized with the coordinates (row, column) and color of each seed pixel.\n4. A set is initialized to keep track of visited coordinates (initially containing seed pixel coordinates) to prevent reprocessing.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue a pixel's coordinates (r, c) and its associated fill_color.\n    b. Examine all 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of the pixel at (r, c).\n    c. For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n        i. Check if the neighbor is within the grid bounds.\n        ii. Check if the neighbor pixel in the output grid is currently white (0).\n        iii. Check if the neighbor coordinates (nr, nc) have not already been visited.\n        iv. If all conditions are met:\n            1. Update the neighbor pixel's color in the output grid to fill_color.\n            2. Add the neighbor's coordinates (nr, nc) to the visited set.\n            3. Enqueue the neighbor's coordinates (nr, nc) and the fill_color.\n6. The process continues until the queue is empty, at which point the modified output grid is returned.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a flood fill from non-white, non-gray pixels into adjacent white pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Initialize the queue for BFS and the visited set\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Identify initial seed pixels and add them to the queue and visited set\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = input_grid[r, c]\n            # Seed pixels are not white (0) and not gray (5)\n            if color != 0 and color != 5:\n                # Add (row, col, color) to the queue\n                queue.append((r, c, color))\n                # Add (row, col) to the visited set\n                visited.add((r, c))\n\n    # Define the 8 directions for neighbors (including diagonals)\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1),          (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Perform the flood fill using BFS\n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the current pixel's info\n        r, c, fill_color = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check if the neighbor is within grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if the neighbor is white (0) in the output grid\n                # and has not been visited yet\n                if output_grid[nr, nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    # Update the neighbor's color in the output grid\n                    output_grid[nr, nc] = fill_color\n                    # Mark the neighbor as visited\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    # Enqueue the neighbor for further processing\n                    queue.append((nr, nc, fill_color))\n\n    # Return the final transformed grid\n    return output_grid\n```"
