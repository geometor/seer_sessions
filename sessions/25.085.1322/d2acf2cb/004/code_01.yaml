Task: Color transformations within segments defined by yellow markers.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Markers: Pixels with yellow (4) color.
  - Horizontal_Segments: Contiguous sequences of non-yellow pixels in a row, located strictly between two adjacent yellow markers in that same row.
  - Vertical_Segments: Contiguous sequences of non-yellow pixels in a column, located strictly between two adjacent yellow markers in that same column.
  - Segment_Colors: The colors of the pixels within a segment.
  - Target_Colors_A: Orange (7), Azure (8).
  - Target_Colors_B: White (0), Magenta (6).

Transformations:
  - Type_A:
      Action: Apply to pixels within selected segments.
      Rule: Change Orange(7) to Magenta(6), Change Azure(8) to White(0).
      Trigger: If the segment contains any Orange(7) or Azure(8) pixels.
  - Type_B:
      Action: Apply to pixels within selected segments.
      Rule: Change White(0) to Azure(8), Change Magenta(6) to Orange(7).
      Trigger: If the segment contains any White(0) or Magenta(6) pixels (and does NOT contain Orange(7) or Azure(8)).

Processing_Logic:
  1. Identify all Horizontal (H) and Vertical (V) segments and their colors.
  2. Check eligibility for Transformation A (contains 7 or 8) and Transformation B (contains 0 or 6, but not 7 or 8) for all segments.
  3. Prioritize Selection:
     - Priority 1: If any H-segment is eligible for Transformation A, select *only* those H-segments for processing with Transformation A.
     - Priority 2: Else if any V-segment is eligible for Transformation A, select *only* those V-segments for processing with Transformation A.
     - Priority 3: Else if any V-segment is eligible for Transformation B, select *only* those V-segments for processing with Transformation B.
     - Priority 4: Else if any H-segment is eligible for Transformation B, select *only* those H-segments for processing with Transformation B.
     - Priority 5: Otherwise, select no segments.
  4. Apply the corresponding transformation (A or B) to all pixels within the selected segments on the output grid. Pixels not part of selected segments remain unchanged from the input.

Output:
  - Grid: Transformed 2D array.
