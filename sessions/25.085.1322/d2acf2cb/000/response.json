            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0), magenta (6), yellow (4), orange (7), and azure (8).\n2.  **Markers:** Yellow (4) pixels appear to act as markers, defining regions or boundaries.\n3.  **Regions:** The transformations occur within specific regions delineated by these yellow markers.\n4.  **Types of Regions:**\n    *   **Horizontal:** In `train_1` and `train_2`, rows starting and ending with yellow (4) have their inner segments modified.\n    *   **Vertical:** In `train_3`, two columns (3 and 7) are marked by yellow (4) at the top (row 0) and bottom (row 5). The modifications occur within these specific columns between the marker rows.\n5.  **Transformations:** There seem to be two opposing transformations:\n    *   **Transformation A:** Orange (7) becomes Magenta (6), and Azure (8) becomes White (0). This occurs in `train_1`.\n    *   **Transformation B:** White (0) becomes Azure (8), and Magenta (6) becomes Orange (7). This occurs in `train_2` and `train_3`.\n6.  **Trigger Condition:** The choice between Transformation A and B depends on the existing colors within the identified region (excluding the yellow markers). If the region contains Orange (7) or Azure (8), Transformation A is applied. If it contains White (0) or Magenta (6), Transformation B is applied.\n7.  **Scope:** Only the pixels strictly *between* the markers (in the horizontal case) or *within* the marked columns and *between* the marker rows (in the vertical case) are affected. The yellow markers themselves remain unchanged. Other pixels outside these defined regions also remain unchanged.\n8.  **Exclusivity:** The examples suggest that either horizontal regions *or* vertical regions are processed in a single grid, not both. Horizontal regions seem to take precedence if applicable.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
