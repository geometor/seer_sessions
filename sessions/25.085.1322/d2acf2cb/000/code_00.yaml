task_description: "Transforms pixels within regions defined by yellow markers based on the colors present in the region."

elements:
  - element: "pixel"
    properties:
      - color: (0-9) representing specific colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates

  - element: "marker"
    is_a: "pixel"
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
    purpose: "Define boundaries of regions to be transformed."

  - element: "region"
    properties:
      - type: "horizontal_segment" | "vertical_segments"
      - boundaries: Defined by yellow (4) markers.
      - content: Pixels within the boundaries.

transformations:
  - name: "Transformation A"
    input_colors: [orange (7), azure (8)]
    output_mapping:
      orange (7): magenta (6)
      azure (8): white (0)
    trigger: "Region contains orange (7) or azure (8)."

  - name: "Transformation B"
    input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
    output_mapping:
      white (0): azure (8)
      magenta (6): orange (7)
    trigger: "Region contains white (0) or magenta (6), and does not contain orange (7) or azure (8)."

workflow:
  - step: "Identify horizontal regions"
    details: "Find rows starting and ending with yellow(4). Region is pixels between markers."
    applies_to: Examples 1, 2
  - step: "Identify vertical regions"
    details: "Find pairs of columns (c_left, c_right) marked by yellow(4) at common top (r_top) and bottom (r_bottom) rows. Regions are pixels in c_left and c_right between r_top and r_bottom."
    applies_to: Example 3
  - step: "Determine transformation type"
    details: "Check colors within the identified region(s). Apply A if {7, 8} present, else apply B if {0, 6} present."
  - step: "Apply transformation"
    details: "Modify pixels within the region(s) in a copy of the input grid according to the determined transformation."

assumptions:
  - "Only one type of region definition (horizontal or vertical) is relevant per task instance."
  - "If horizontal regions are found, vertical regions are not processed."
  - "A region will contain either colors {7, 8} or colors {0, 6} to trigger a transformation, but not a mix that would make the choice ambiguous."
