Problem Description:
  Task: Transform pixels within specific regions of a grid based on marker pixels and content.
  Input: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
  Output: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
  Marker Pixel: Yellow (4)

Region Definitions:
  - Type: Vertical Rectangular Region
    Identification: Requires four yellow (4) marker pixels forming a rectangle, located at (r1, c1), (r1, c2), (r2, c1), and (r2, c2) where r1 < r2 and c1 < c2.
    Affected Pixels: The pixels located in columns c1 and c2, strictly between rows r1 and r2 (i.e., for row r where r1 < r < r2, the pixels at (r, c1) and (r, c2)).
    Priority: High (processed first).

  - Type: Horizontal Region
    Identification: Requires at least two yellow (4) marker pixels in the same row `r`. Let the minimum column index be `c_min` and the maximum be `c_max`.
    Affected Pixels: The pixels located in row `r`, strictly between columns `c_min` and `c_max` (i.e., for column c where c_min < c < c_max, the pixels at (r, c)).
    Priority: Low (processed only if no Vertical Rectangular Regions are found).

Transformation Rules:
  - Rule Context: Applied to the pixels within an identified region (either Vertical Rectangular or Horizontal).
  - Condition A: Check if any pixel within the identified region is orange (7) or azure (8).
    Action A: If Condition A is true, change all orange (7) pixels within the region to magenta (6) and all azure (8) pixels within the region to white (0).
  - Condition B: If Condition A is false, check if any pixel within the identified region is white (0) or magenta (6).
    Action B: If Condition B is true, change all white (0) pixels within the region to azure (8) and all magenta (6) pixels within the region to orange (7).
  - Default: If neither Condition A nor Condition B is met for a region, the pixels within that region remain unchanged.

Processing Logic:
  1. Search the entire input grid for Vertical Rectangular Regions.
  2. If one or more Vertical Rectangular Regions are found:
     a. For each such region, determine the colors of the Affected Pixels.
     b. Check if Condition A or Condition B applies based on these colors.
     c. Apply the corresponding Action (A or B) to the Affected Pixels of that region.
     d. Stop processing. The output grid is the result after applying transformations to all found Vertical Rectangular Regions.
  3. If *no* Vertical Rectangular Regions are found:
     a. Search the input grid row by row for Horizontal Regions.
     b. For each Horizontal Region found in a row:
        i. Determine the colors of the Affected Pixels.
        ii. Check if Condition A or Condition B applies based on these colors.
        iii. Apply the corresponding Action (A or B) to the Affected Pixels of that region.
     c. The output grid is the result after applying transformations to all found Horizontal Regions.
