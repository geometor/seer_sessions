## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code correctly solved Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The failure occurred because the code prioritized processing horizontal segments defined by yellow markers. In Example 3, although horizontal segments exist (in rows 0 and 5), the *correct* transformation applies to the *vertical* segments defined by the same yellow markers forming a rectangle.

The results suggest a hierarchical approach is needed:

1.  **Identify potential transformation regions:** These are defined by yellow (4) markers.
2.  **Prioritize region type:** Check for "vertical rectangular" regions first. If found, apply the transformation based on these regions and stop.
3.  **Fallback to horizontal regions:** If no vertical rectangular regions are found, check for "horizontal" regions and apply the transformation based on those.

The transformation logic itself (Transformation A: 7->6, 8->0 if region has 7 or 8; Transformation B: 0->8, 6->7 if region has 0 or 6) seems correct but needs to be applied to the correctly identified region type.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the definitions of "horizontal region" and "vertical rectangular region".
2.  Implement the check for vertical rectangular regions first.
3.  If vertical regions are found and transformed, the process finishes.
4.  If no vertical regions are found, proceed with the existing logic for horizontal regions.
5.  Verify this revised logic against all three examples.

## Metrics

Let's gather metrics for each example.


``` python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def get_grid_metrics(grid_list):
    if not grid_list:
        return {"dimensions": (0, 0), "color_counts": {}}
    grid = np.array(grid_list)
    dims = grid.shape
    colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(colors, counts))
    return {"dimensions": dims, "color_counts": color_counts}

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Problem Description:
  Task: Transform pixels within specific regions of a grid based on marker pixels and content.
  Input: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
  Output: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
  Marker Pixel: Yellow (4)

Region Definitions:
  - Type: Vertical Rectangular Region
    Identification: Requires four yellow (4) marker pixels forming a rectangle, located at (r1, c1), (r1, c2), (r2, c1), and (r2, c2) where r1 < r2 and c1 < c2.
    Affected Pixels: The pixels located in columns c1 and c2, strictly between rows r1 and r2 (i.e., for row r where r1 < r < r2, the pixels at (r, c1) and (r, c2)).
    Priority: High (processed first).

  - Type: Horizontal Region
    Identification: Requires at least two yellow (4) marker pixels in the same row `r`. Let the minimum column index be `c_min` and the maximum be `c_max`.
    Affected Pixels: The pixels located in row `r`, strictly between columns `c_min` and `c_max` (i.e., for column c where c_min < c < c_max, the pixels at (r, c)).
    Priority: Low (processed only if no Vertical Rectangular Regions are found).

Transformation Rules:
  - Rule Context: Applied to the pixels within an identified region (either Vertical Rectangular or Horizontal).
  - Condition A: Check if any pixel within the identified region is orange (7) or azure (8).
    Action A: If Condition A is true, change all orange (7) pixels within the region to magenta (6) and all azure (8) pixels within the region to white (0).
  - Condition B: If Condition A is false, check if any pixel within the identified region is white (0) or magenta (6).
    Action B: If Condition B is true, change all white (0) pixels within the region to azure (8) and all magenta (6) pixels within the region to orange (7).
  - Default: If neither Condition A nor Condition B is met for a region, the pixels within that region remain unchanged.

Processing Logic:
  1. Search the entire input grid for Vertical Rectangular Regions.
  2. If one or more Vertical Rectangular Regions are found:
     a. For each such region, determine the colors of the Affected Pixels.
     b. Check if Condition A or Condition B applies based on these colors.
     c. Apply the corresponding Action (A or B) to the Affected Pixels of that region.
     d. Stop processing. The output grid is the result after applying transformations to all found Vertical Rectangular Regions.
  3. If *no* Vertical Rectangular Regions are found:
     a. Search the input grid row by row for Horizontal Regions.
     b. For each Horizontal Region found in a row:
        i. Determine the colors of the Affected Pixels.
        ii. Check if Condition A or Condition B applies based on these colors.
        iii. Apply the corresponding Action (A or B) to the Affected Pixels of that region.
     c. The output grid is the result after applying transformations to all found Horizontal Regions.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Regions:** Scan the input grid for yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Check for Vertical Rectangular Regions:** Determine if there are sets of four yellow pixels forming the corners of a rectangle: `(r1, c1)`, `(r1, c2)`, `(r2, c1)`, `(r2, c2)` with `r1 < r2` and `c1 < c2`.
3.  **Process Vertical Regions (if found):**
    *   If one or more Vertical Rectangular Regions exist:
        *   For each such region defined by `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`:
            *   Define the "affected pixels" as those in columns `c1` and `c2` between rows `r1` and `r2` (exclusive: `r1 < row < r2`).
            *   Examine the colors of these affected pixels.
            *   If any affected pixel is orange (7) or azure (8), apply Transformation A: change all orange (7) to magenta (6) and all azure (8) to white (0) within this set of affected pixels.
            *   Otherwise, if any affected pixel is white (0) or magenta (6), apply Transformation B: change all white (0) to azure (8) and all magenta (6) to orange (7) within this set of affected pixels.
        *   Produce the output grid with these transformations applied. **Do not proceed to check for horizontal regions.**
4.  **Process Horizontal Regions (if no vertical regions found):**
    *   If no Vertical Rectangular Regions were found in step 2:
        *   Iterate through each row of the grid.
        *   If a row contains two or more yellow (4) pixels:
            *   Find the minimum column index (`c_min`) and maximum column index (`c_max`) of the yellow pixels in that row.
            *   Define the "affected pixels" as those in the current row between columns `c_min` and `c_max` (exclusive: `c_min < col < c_max`).
            *   Examine the colors of these affected pixels.
            *   If any affected pixel is orange (7) or azure (8), apply Transformation A: change all orange (7) to magenta (6) and all azure (8) to white (0) within this set of affected pixels.
            *   Otherwise, if any affected pixel is white (0) or magenta (6), apply Transformation B: change all white (0) to azure (8) and all magenta (6) to orange (7) within this set of affected pixels.
        *   Produce the output grid with these transformations applied.
