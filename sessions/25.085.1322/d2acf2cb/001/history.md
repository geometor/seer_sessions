Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0), magenta (6), yellow (4), orange (7), and azure (8).
2.  **Markers:** Yellow (4) pixels appear to act as markers, defining regions or boundaries.
3.  **Regions:** The transformations occur within specific regions delineated by these yellow markers.
4.  **Types of Regions:**
    *   **Horizontal:** In `train_1` and `train_2`, rows starting and ending with yellow (4) have their inner segments modified.
    *   **Vertical:** In `train_3`, two columns (3 and 7) are marked by yellow (4) at the top (row 0) and bottom (row 5). The modifications occur within these specific columns between the marker rows.
5.  **Transformations:** There seem to be two opposing transformations:
    *   **Transformation A:** Orange (7) becomes Magenta (6), and Azure (8) becomes White (0). This occurs in `train_1`.
    *   **Transformation B:** White (0) becomes Azure (8), and Magenta (6) becomes Orange (7). This occurs in `train_2` and `train_3`.
6.  **Trigger Condition:** The choice between Transformation A and B depends on the existing colors within the identified region (excluding the yellow markers). If the region contains Orange (7) or Azure (8), Transformation A is applied. If it contains White (0) or Magenta (6), Transformation B is applied.
7.  **Scope:** Only the pixels strictly *between* the markers (in the horizontal case) or *within* the marked columns and *between* the marker rows (in the vertical case) are affected. The yellow markers themselves remain unchanged. Other pixels outside these defined regions also remain unchanged.
8.  **Exclusivity:** The examples suggest that either horizontal regions *or* vertical regions are processed in a single grid, not both. Horizontal regions seem to take precedence if applicable.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Transforms pixels within regions defined by yellow markers based on the colors present in the region."

elements:
  - element: "pixel"
    properties:
      - color: (0-9) representing specific colors (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates

  - element: "marker"
    is_a: "pixel"
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
    purpose: "Define boundaries of regions to be transformed."

  - element: "region"
    properties:
      - type: "horizontal_segment" | "vertical_segments"
      - boundaries: Defined by yellow (4) markers.
      - content: Pixels within the boundaries.

transformations:
  - name: "Transformation A"
    input_colors: [orange (7), azure (8)]
    output_mapping:
      orange (7): magenta (6)
      azure (8): white (0)
    trigger: "Region contains orange (7) or azure (8)."

  - name: "Transformation B"
    input_colors: [white (0), magenta (6)]
    output_mapping:
      white (0): azure (8)
      magenta (6): orange (7)
    trigger: "Region contains white (0) or magenta (6), and does not contain orange (7) or azure (8)."

workflow:
  - step: "Identify horizontal regions"
    details: "Find rows starting and ending with yellow(4). Region is pixels between markers."
    applies_to: Examples 1, 2
  - step: "Identify vertical regions"
    details: "Find pairs of columns (c_left, c_right) marked by yellow(4) at common top (r_top) and bottom (r_bottom) rows. Regions are pixels in c_left and c_right between r_top and r_bottom."
    applies_to: Example 3
  - step: "Determine transformation type"
    details: "Check colors within the identified region(s). Apply A if {7, 8} present, else apply B if {0, 6} present."
  - step: "Apply transformation"
    details: "Modify pixels within the region(s) in a copy of the input grid according to the determined transformation."

assumptions:
  - "Only one type of region definition (horizontal or vertical) is relevant per task instance."
  - "If horizontal regions are found, vertical regions are not processed."
  - "A region will contain either colors {7, 8} or colors {0, 6} to trigger a transformation, but not a mix that would make the choice ambiguous."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Initialize a flag `transformation_applied` to `False`.
3.  **Process Rows for Horizontal Segments:**
    a.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid.
    b.  Find the column index `c1` of the first yellow (4) pixel in row `r`.
    c.  Find the column index `c2` of the last yellow (4) pixel in row `r`.
    d.  If both `c1` and `c2` are found and `c1 < c2`:
        i.  Define the `region` as the pixels at `(r, c)` where `c1 < c < c2`.
        ii. Examine the colors of the pixels in the `region`.
        iii. If any pixel in the `region` is orange (7) or azure (8), set `transform_type = A`.
        iv. Else if any pixel in the `region` is white (0) or magenta (6), set `transform_type = B`.
        v.  Else, set `transform_type = None`.
        vi. If `transform_type` is `A`: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the `region`, if its color is orange (7), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta (6); if its color is azure (8), change it to white (0). Set `transformation_applied = True`.
        vii. If `transform_type` is `B`: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the `region`, if its color is white (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8); if its color is magenta (6), change it to orange (7). Set `transformation_applied = True`.
4.  **If `transformation_applied` is `False`, Process Columns for Vertical Segments:**
    a.  Find all locations `(r, c)` of yellow (4) pixels.
    b.  Identify all unique pairs of rows `(r_top, r_bottom)` where `r_top < r_bottom`.
    c.  For each pair `(r_top, r_bottom)`:
        i.  Find the set of columns `C` such that a yellow (4) pixel exists at both `(r_top, c)` and `(r_bottom, c)` for all `c` in `C`.
        ii. If the set `C` contains at least two columns:
            1.  Let `c_left = min(C)` and `c_right = max(C)`.
            2.  Define `region1` as pixels at `(r, c_left)` where `r_top < r < r_bottom`.
            3.  Define `region2` as pixels at `(r, c_right)` where `r_top < r < r_bottom`.
            4.  Combine all pixels from `region1` and `region2` into a single `combined_region`.
            5.  Examine the colors of the pixels in the `combined_region`.
            6.  If any pixel in `combined_region` is orange (7) or azure (8), set `transform_type = A`.
            7.  Else if any pixel in `combined_region` is white (0) or magenta (6), set `transform_type = B`.
            8.  Else, set `transform_type = None`.
            9.  If `transform_type` is `A`: For each
