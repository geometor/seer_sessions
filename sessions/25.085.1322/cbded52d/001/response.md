"""
The transformation operates on an 8x8 grid divided into nine 2x2 blocks by white lines (rows 2, 5; columns 2, 5). 
The rule modifies only blue pixels (color 1). 
For each blue pixel at a specific relative position within its 2x2 block, the grid is scanned (block by block, in row-major order: top-left to bottom-right). 
If a non-white (0) and non-blue (1) pixel is found in another block at the *same relative position*, the original blue pixel takes on the color of that found pixel. 
The search stops for that blue pixel as soon as the first such source color is found. 
If no such source pixel is found after checking all other blocks, the blue pixel remains unchanged. 
All pixels that are not blue in the input remain unchanged in the output.
