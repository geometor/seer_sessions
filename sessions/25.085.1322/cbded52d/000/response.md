Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are always 8x8. They have a consistent structure: white pixels (0) form lines at row index 2, row index 5, column index 2, and column index 5. These lines divide the grid into nine 2x2 subgrids or "blocks".
2.  **Content:** The 2x2 blocks are primarily filled with blue pixels (1). Some blocks contain other non-white colors (green, yellow, orange, red in the examples) at specific positions within their 2x2 structure.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies *only* the blue pixels (1). Some blue pixels change their color, while others remain blue. The white pixels (0) and the initially non-blue/non-white pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Color Change Rule:** When a blue pixel at a certain position `(r, c)` changes color, its new color is adopted from a non-blue, non-white pixel located at the *corresponding relative position* within a *different* 2x2 block.
5.  **Source Prioritization:** If multiple "source" pixels (non-blue, non-white pixels at corresponding positions in other blocks) exist, the color seems to be taken from the source block encountered first when scanning the blocks in a specific order (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
Grid:
  Size: 8x8
  Structure: Divided into nine 2x2 blocks by white lines (rows 2, 5; columns 2, 5).
Blocks:
  Coordinates:
    - Block (0,0): rows 0-1, cols 0-1
    - Block (0,1): rows 0-1, cols 3-4
    - Block (0,2): rows 0-1, cols 6-7
    - Block (1,0): rows 3-4, cols 0-1
    - Block (1,1): rows 3-4, cols 3-4
    - Block (1,2): rows 3-4, cols 6-7
    - Block (2,0): rows 6-7, cols 0-1
    - Block (2,1): rows 6-7, cols 3-4
    - Block (2,2): rows 6-7, cols 6-7
  Content: Primarily blue pixels (1), sometimes containing other non-white "marker" colors.
Pixels:
  Types:
    - White (0): Structural separators, never change.
    - Blue (1): Target pixels for potential color change.
    - Other (2-9): "Source" or "Marker" pixels, determine the new color for blue pixels, never change themselves.
Transformation:
  Action: Color modification of specific blue pixels.
  Rule:
    - For each blue pixel (1) at input coordinate `(r, c)`:
      - Identify its block `(block_r, block_c)` and its relative position `(local_r, local_c)` within that block.
      - Search through all *other* blocks `(other_block_r, other_block_c)` in a fixed order (row-major: (0,0) to (2,2)).
      - Find the coordinate `(source_r, source_c)` of the pixel at the corresponding relative position `(local_r, local_c)` within the `other_block`.
      - Let `source_color` be the color at `input[source_r][source_c]`.
      - If `source_color` is not white (0) and not blue (1):
        - The output pixel at `(r, c)` becomes `source_color`.
        - Stop searching other blocks for this specific blue pixel `(r, c)`.
    - If no such source color is found after checking all other blocks, the blue pixel remains unchanged.
    - All non-blue pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the locations of the nine 2x2 blocks based on the white separator lines (rows 2, 5; columns 2, 5). Define a standard order for iterating through these blocks (e.g., row-major: top-left block first, proceeding left-to-right, then top-to-bottom).
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.
4.  If the pixel `input[r][c]` is blue (color 1):
    a.  Determine which block `(block_r, block_c)`
