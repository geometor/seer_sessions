Grid:
  Size: 8x8
  Structure: Divided into nine 2x2 blocks by white lines (rows 2, 5; columns 2, 5).
Blocks:
  Coordinates:
    - Block (0,0): rows 0-1, cols 0-1
    - Block (0,1): rows 0-1, cols 3-4
    - Block (0,2): rows 0-1, cols 6-7
    - Block (1,0): rows 3-4, cols 0-1
    - Block (1,1): rows 3-4, cols 3-4
    - Block (1,2): rows 3-4, cols 6-7
    - Block (2,0): rows 6-7, cols 0-1
    - Block (2,1): rows 6-7, cols 3-4
    - Block (2,2): rows 6-7, cols 6-7
  Content: Primarily blue pixels (1), sometimes containing other non-white "marker" colors.
Pixels:
  Types:
    - White (0): Structural separators, never change.
    - Blue (1): Target pixels for potential color change.
    - Other (2-9): "Source" or "Marker" pixels, determine the new color for blue pixels, never change themselves.
Transformation:
  Action: Color modification of specific blue pixels.
  Rule:
    - For each blue pixel (1) at input coordinate `(r, c)`:
      - Identify its block `(block_r, block_c)` and its relative position `(local_r, local_c)` within that block.
      - Search through all *other* blocks `(other_block_r, other_block_c)` in a fixed order (row-major: (0,0) to (2,2)).
      - Find the coordinate `(source_r, source_c)` of the pixel at the corresponding relative position `(local_r, local_c)` within the `other_block`.
      - Let `source_color` be the color at `input[source_r][source_c]`.
      - If `source_color` is not white (0) and not blue (1):
        - The output pixel at `(r, c)` becomes `source_color`.
        - Stop searching other blocks for this specific blue pixel `(r, c)`.
    - If no such source color is found after checking all other blocks, the blue pixel remains unchanged.
    - All non-blue pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.
