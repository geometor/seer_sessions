            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are always 8x8. They have a consistent structure: white pixels (0) form lines at row index 2, row index 5, column index 2, and column index 5. These lines divide the grid into nine 2x2 subgrids or \"blocks\".\n2.  **Content:** The 2x2 blocks are primarily filled with blue pixels (1). Some blocks contain other non-white colors (green, yellow, orange, red in the examples) at specific positions within their 2x2 structure.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies *only* the blue pixels (1). Some blue pixels change their color, while others remain blue. The white pixels (0) and the initially non-blue/non-white pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Color Change Rule:** When a blue pixel at a certain position `(r, c)` changes color, its new color is adopted from a non-blue, non-white pixel located at the *corresponding relative position* within a *different* 2x2 block.\n5.  **Source Prioritization:** If multiple \"source\" pixels (non-blue, non-white pixels at corresponding positions in other blocks) exist, the color seems to be taken from the source block encountered first when scanning the blocks in a specific order (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
