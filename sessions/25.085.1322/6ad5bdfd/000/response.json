The background is consistently white (`0`).\n2.  **Key Element (Barrier):** In each example, there's a prominent red (`2`) shape.\n    *   Example 1: Vertical red bar on the left edge.\n    *   Example 2: Horizontal red bar on the bottom edge.\n    *   Example 3: Vertical red bar on the right edge.\n    This red shape appears static; it's in the same position in both input and output. It acts as a boundary or barrier.\n3.  **Other Elements (Movable Objects):** There are other contiguous shapes (objects) made of colors other than white (`0`) or red (`2`).\n4.  **Transformation:** These other objects move within the grid until they encounter the red barrier or another object that has already stopped moving.\n    *   Example 1: Objects move left towards the left red barrier.\n    *   Example 2: Objects move down towards the bottom red barrier.\n    *   Example 3: Objects move right towards the right red barrier.\n5.  **Movement Dynamics:**\n    *   The direction of movement is dictated by the position of the red barrier (towards it).\n    *   Objects maintain their shape and color during movement.\n    *   Objects stop as a whole unit when *any part* of the object cannot move further without overlapping the barrier or another already settled object.\n    *   The space previously occupied by the moved objects becomes white (`0`).\n    *   The relative positions of the objects seem determined by proximity to the barrier along the axis of movement; objects effectively stack or pile up against the barrier and each other.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Identify the red (`2`) object(s) in the input grid. Determine if it forms a continuous barrier along the left edge, right edge, or bottom edge.\n3.  Based on the barrier's position, set the movement direction: 'left' if the barrier is on the left edge, 'right' if on the right edge, 'down' if on the bottom edge.\n4.  Copy the red barrier object(s) from the input grid to their identical positions in the output grid.\n5.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid whose color is not white (`0`) or red (`2`). These are the \"movable objects\". For each object, store its color and the set of coordinates it occupies.\n6.  Create a list of these movable objects.\n7.  Determine the processing order for the movable objects based on the movement direction to handle potential blocking correctly:\n    *   If moving 'left', sort objects primarily by the minimum column index of their pixels (ascending).\n    *   If moving 'right', sort objects primarily by the maximum column index of their pixels (descending).\n    *   If moving 'down', sort objects primarily by the maximum row index of their pixels (descending). (Secondary sort keys might be needed for tie-breaking but seem unnecessary based on examples).\n8.  Iterate through the sorted list of movable objects:\n    a.  For the current object, start with its original coordinates.\n    b.  Repeatedly attempt to move the object one step in the determined direction.\n    c.  Before confirming the move, check if *any* pixel of the object in its *new* potential position would overlap with:\n        i.  The grid boundaries.\n        ii. Any red barrier pixel already placed in the output grid.\n        iii. Any pixel belonging to *another movable object already placed* in the output grid in a previous iteration.\n    d.  If no overlap (collision) would occur, update the object's current position to the new position and repeat step 8b.\n    e.  If an overlap would occur, the object stops. Its final position is its position *before* the attempted move that caused the collision.\n    f.  Place the current object (using its color and final coordinates) onto the output grid.\n9.  After processing all movable objects, the output grid contains the final transformed state. Return the output grid."
