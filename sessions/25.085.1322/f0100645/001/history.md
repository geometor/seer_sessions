Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input and output grids have the same dimensions.
2.  **Color Palette**: The colors present in the input are the same as in the output.
3.  **Boundary Columns**: The leftmost and rightmost columns remain unchanged between input and output in both examples.
4.  **Inner Columns**: Changes occur only in the columns *between* the first and the last column.
5.  **Row-wise Transformation**: The changes appear to happen independently within each row.
6.  **Pixel Movement/Sorting**: Within each row's central segment (excluding the first and last columns):
    *   Pixels matching the color of the *leftmost* column seem to shift towards the left boundary of this central segment.
    *   Pixels matching the color of the *rightmost* column seem to shift towards the right boundary of this central segment.
    *   Pixels of the remaining color (Orange (7) in both examples) fill the space between the shifted left-color pixels and the shifted right-color pixels.
7.  **Conservation**: The count of each color within each row's central segment remains the same between input and output, just their positions change.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  - description: The task involves rearranging pixels within rows of a grid, constrained by fixed boundary columns.
  - grid_properties:
      - dimensions_preserved: True
      - palette_preserved: True

identified_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - rows
      - columns
  - element: boundary_columns
    properties:
      - position: leftmost (column 0) and rightmost (column width-1)
      - state: unchanged during transformation
      - role: define the colors to be sorted ('left_color' and 'right_color')
  - element: central_segment
    properties:
      - location: within each row, between column 1 and column width-2
      - content: pixels of 'left_color', 'right_color', and 'fill_color'
      - role: the area where the transformation occurs
  - element: pixel_types
    properties:
      - type: left_color
        definition: Color found in the leftmost column.
        behavior: Moves to the left within the central segment.
      - type: right_color
        definition: Color found in the rightmost column.
        behavior: Moves to the right within the central segment.
      - type: fill_color
        definition: The remaining dominant color within the central segment (initially).
        behavior: Occupies the space between 'left_color' and 'right_color' pixels after rearrangement.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Operate independently on each row.
  - rule: Preserve the first and last columns of each row.
  - rule: For the central segment (columns 1 to width-2) of each row:
      - Count the occurrences of 'left_color' (count_left).
      - Count the occurrences of 'right_color' (count_right).
      - Determine the required count of 'fill_color' (count_fill = segment_length - count_left - count_right).
      - Reconstruct the central segment by concatenating:
          - 'count_left' pixels of 'left_color'.
          - 'count_fill' pixels of 'fill_color'.
          - 'count_right' pixels of 'right_color'.
  - rule: Replace the original central segment in the output row with the reconstructed segment.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the color of the pixels in the first column (`left_color`).
2.  Identify the color of the pixels in the last column (`right_color`).
3.  Assume the most frequent color *not* matching `left_color` or `right_color` within the central columns (columns 1 to width-2) is the `fill_color` (In these examples, it's consistently Orange (7)).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Copy the first pixel (column 0) from the input row to the corresponding position in the output row.
    b.  Copy the last pixel (column width-1) from the input row to the corresponding position in the output row.
    c.  Extract the segment of the input row from column 1 to column `width-2`.
    d.  Count the number of `left_color` pixels (`count_left`) in this segment.
    e.  Count the number of `right_color` pixels (`count_right`) in this segment.
    f.  Calculate the length of the segment (`segment_length = width - 2`).
    g.  Calculate the number of `fill_color` pixels needed (`count_fill = segment_length - count_left - count_right`).
    h.  Construct the new central segment for the output row by placing `count_left` `left_color` pixels first, followed by `count_fill` `fill_color` pixels, followed by `count_right` `right_color` pixels.
    i.  Place this newly constructed segment into the output row from column 1 to column `width-2`.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
