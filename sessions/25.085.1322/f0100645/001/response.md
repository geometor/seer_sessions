Transformation Rule Description:

The transformation rearranges pixels within each row of the input grid, keeping the first and last columns fixed. 
For the segment of each row between the first and last columns (the 'central segment'):
1. Identify the color of the pixel in the first column ('left_color').
2. Identify the color of the pixel in the last column ('right_color').
3. Within the central segment, count the occurrences of 'left_color' (count_left) and 'right_color' (count_right).
4. Identify the 'fill_color', which is the color present in the central segment that is neither 'left_color' nor 'right_color'. Assume only one such color exists if the segment contains more than just 'left_color' and 'right_color'.
5. Calculate the number of 'fill_color' pixels needed: count_fill = length of central segment - count_left - count_right.
6. Reconstruct the central segment in the output row by concatenating:
   - 'count_left' pixels of 'left_color'.
   - 'count_fill' pixels of 'fill_color'.
   - 'count_right' pixels of 'right_color'.
7. The first and last columns of the output row remain the same as the input row.
