Identify the color of the pixel in the first column ('left_color').\n2. Identify the color of the pixel in the last column ('right_color').\n3. Within the central segment, count the occurrences of 'left_color' (count_left) and 'right_color' (count_right).\n4. Identify the 'fill_color', which is the color present in the central segment that is neither 'left_color' nor 'right_color'. Assume only one such color exists if the segment contains more than just 'left_color' and 'right_color'.\n5. Calculate the number of 'fill_color' pixels needed: count_fill = length of central segment - count_left - count_right.\n6. Reconstruct the central segment in the output row by concatenating:\n   - 'count_left' pixels of 'left_color'.\n   - 'count_fill' pixels of 'fill_color'.\n   - 'count_right' pixels of 'right_color'.\n7. The first and last columns of the output row remain the same as the input row.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rearranges pixels within each row based on boundary colors.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists or np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier slicing and manipulation\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_array)\n\n    # Iterate through each row\n    for r in range(height):\n        # Get the current row\n        row = input_array[r, :]\n\n        # Identify boundary colors for this row\n        left_color = row[0]\n        right_color = row[-1]\n\n        # Handle edge case: grids too narrow for a central segment\n        if width <= 2:\n            continue # No central segment to process, row remains unchanged\n\n        # Extract the central segment (columns 1 to width-2)\n        central_segment = row[1 : width - 1]\n        segment_length = len(central_segment)\n\n        # Count occurrences of boundary colors in the segment\n        counts = Counter(central_segment)\n        count_left = counts.get(left_color, 0)\n        count_right = counts.get(right_color, 0)\n\n        # Determine the fill color and its count\n        fill_color = None\n        unique_segment_colors = set(central_segment)\n        potential_fill_colors = unique_segment_colors - {left_color, right_color}\n\n        if len(potential_fill_colors) == 1:\n            fill_color = potential_fill_colors.pop()\n        elif len(potential_fill_colors) > 1:\n            # Fallback or error handling if more than one potential fill color exists\n            # Based on examples, we assume only one fill color.\n            # Let's prioritize the most frequent non-boundary color if ambiguity arises,\n            # although the rule derivation suggests simple subtraction is enough for counts.\n            # For simplicity now, we'll just pick one arbitrarily if needed, but ideally,\n            # the problem constraints ensure only one fill color exists.\n            # A robust solution might need clarification here.\n            # For now, let's stick to the assumption of one or zero fill colors.\n            # If needed, could add logic: `fill_color = max(potential_fill_colors, key=lambda c: counts[c])`\n            # But let's assume it won't happen based on examples.\n             pass # Stick with fill_color = None if ambiguous for now\n\n\n        count_fill = segment_length - count_left - count_right\n\n        # Construct the new central segment\n        new_segment = []\n        # Add left_color pixels\n        new_segment.extend([left_color] * count_left)\n        \n        # Add fill_color pixels (only if a fill_color was identified and needed)\n        if fill_color is not None and count_fill > 0:\n             new_segment.extend([fill_color] * count_fill)\n        elif count_fill > 0:\n             # This case implies the segment contained colors other than left/right,\n             # but we couldn't uniquely identify a *single* fill color.\n             # Or, maybe the fill pixels were originally left/right colors that\n             # weren't counted towards count_left/count_right initially.\n             # Re-evaluating: count_fill is simply the remaining space.\n             # The examples strongly suggest Orange (7) is the default fill.\n             # Let's refine: If a unique non-boundary color exists, use it.\n             # Otherwise, if count_fill > 0, what color to use?\n             # The problem description implies the fill color is deduced.\n             # Let's refine the fill_color finding again.\n             \n             # Re-find fill_color based on original segment composition\n             segment_colors = list(central_segment)\n             temp_fill = []\n             for color in segment_colors:\n                 if color != left_color and color != right_color:\n                     temp_fill.append(color)\n             \n             if len(set(temp_fill)) == 1 and len(temp_fill) > 0:\n                  determined_fill_color = temp_fill[0]\n                  new_segment.extend([determined_fill_color] * count_fill)\n             elif count_fill > 0:\n                  # Still ambiguous or no non-boundary colors originally.\n                  # This might happen if e.g. input segment is [4, 4, 6, 6] with left=4, right=6\n                  # Then count_left=2, count_right=2, count_fill=0.
