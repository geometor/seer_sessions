Count the number of `left_color` pixels (`count_left`) in this segment.\n    e.  Count the number of `right_color` pixels (`count_right`) in this segment.\n    f.

Construct the new central segment for the output row by placing `count_left` `left_color` pixels first, followed by `count_fill` `fill_color` pixels, followed by `count_right` `right_color` pixels.\n    i.  Place this newly constructed segment into the output row from column 1 to column `width-2`.\n6.  Return the completed output grid."
