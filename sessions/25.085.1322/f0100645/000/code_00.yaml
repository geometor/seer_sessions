task_context:
  - description: The task involves rearranging pixels within rows of a grid, constrained by fixed boundary columns.
  - grid_properties:
      - dimensions_preserved: True
      - palette_preserved: True

identified_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - rows
      - columns
  - element: boundary_columns
    properties:
      - position: leftmost (column 0) and rightmost (column width-1)
      - state: unchanged during transformation
      - role: define the colors to be sorted ('left_color' and 'right_color')
  - element: central_segment
    properties:
      - location: within each row, between column 1 and column width-2
      - content: pixels of 'left_color', 'right_color', and 'fill_color'
      - role: the area where the transformation occurs
  - element: pixel_types
    properties:
      - type: left_color
        definition: Color found in the leftmost column.
        behavior: Moves to the left within the central segment.
      - type: right_color
        definition: Color found in the rightmost column.
        behavior: Moves to the right within the central segment.
      - type: fill_color
        definition: The remaining dominant color within the central segment (initially).
        behavior: Occupies the space between 'left_color' and 'right_color' pixels after rearrangement.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: Operate independently on each row.
  - rule: Preserve the first and last columns of each row.
  - rule: For the central segment (columns 1 to width-2) of each row:
      - Count the occurrences of 'left_color' (count_left).
      - Count the occurrences of 'right_color' (count_right).
      - Determine the required count of 'fill_color' (count_fill = segment_length - count_left - count_right).
      - Reconstruct the central segment by concatenating:
          - 'count_left' pixels of 'left_color'.
          - 'count_fill' pixels of 'fill_color'.
          - 'count_right' pixels of 'right_color'.
  - rule: Replace the original central segment in the output row with the reconstructed segment.
