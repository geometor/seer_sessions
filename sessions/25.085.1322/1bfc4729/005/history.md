"""
Transforms an input grid by drawing frames and lines based on non-white pixels.

1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). These are the "trigger pixels".
3.  For each trigger pixel found, characterized by its row `R`, column `C_idx`, and color `C`:
    a.  Determine the vertical zone based on the trigger pixel's row `R`:
        i.  If `R` is less than 5 (rows 0-4), the zone covers rows 0 through 4. Set `min_row = 0`, `max_row = 4`.
        ii. If `R` is 5 or greater (rows 5-9), the zone covers rows 5 through 9. Set `min_row = 5`, `max_row = 9`.
    b.  Draw a frame using the trigger pixel's color `C` within its determined zone:
        i.  Draw a horizontal line of color `C` across the full width at `min_row`.
        ii. Draw a horizontal line of color `C` across the full width at `max_row`.
        iii. Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the leftmost column (column 0) from `min_row` to `max_row`.
        iv. Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the rightmost column (column width-1) from `min_row` to `max_row`.
    c.  Draw an additional horizontal line of color `C` across the full width at the trigger pixel's original row `R`.
4.  Return the completed output grid. If multiple trigger pixels modify the same pixel, the last modification prevails.

**General Assessment**

The provided code attempted to implement a transformation based on observations from the first example. The core idea involved identifying non-white "trigger" pixels and drawing patterns based on their color and row position within predefined vertical zones (rows 0-4 and rows 5-9).

However, testing against both examples revealed inaccuracies in the generated output compared to the expected output. The primary discrepancy lies in how the horizontal lines of the "frame" are drawn. The initial code drew solid top and bottom horizontal lines for each zone triggered, whereas the expected outputs show a more nuanced rule: only the trigger pixel's row is always filled horizontally, along with the absolute top row (row 0) for the upper zone and the absolute bottom row (row 9) for the lower zone. The vertical side lines appear correct (spanning the full height of the respective zone).

The strategy is to refine the natural language program to accurately describe this revised line-drawing logic based on the trigger pixel's row, its zone, and whether the zone is the top or bottom one. This refined program will guide the correction of the Python code.

**Facts**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  - size: All examples use 10x10 grids.
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: trigger_pixel
    definition: Any pixel in the input grid that is not white (color 0).
    properties:
      - row: The row index (0-9).
      - column: The column index (0-9).
      - color: The color value (1-9).
      - zone: Derived from the row.
          - top_zone: Rows 0-4.
          - bottom_zone: Rows 5-9.

actions:
  - Initialize output grid: Create a new 10x10 grid filled with white (0).
  - Process trigger pixels: For each trigger pixel identified in the input:
    - determine_zone: Identify if the pixel is in the top_zone (rows 0-4) or bottom_zone (rows 5-9).
    - draw_vertical_lines:
        - target: output grid
        - color: trigger_pixel's color
        - location:
            - Leftmost column (column 0) from min_row to max_row of the zone.
            - Rightmost column (column 9) from min_row to max_row of the zone.
    - draw_trigger_horizontal_line:
        - target: output grid
        - color: trigger_pixel's color
        - location: The full width of the grid at the trigger_pixel's row.
    - draw_zone_boundary_horizontal_line:
        - target: output grid
        - color: trigger_pixel's color
        - condition:
            - If trigger_pixel is in top_zone (rows 0-4): Draw line at row 0.
            - If trigger_pixel is in bottom_zone (rows 5-9): Draw line at row 9.
        - location: The full width of the grid at the specified boundary row (0 or 9).

output_grid_generation:
  - The output grid is built by applying the drawing actions for each trigger pixel.
  - Pixels are overwritten if multiple trigger pixels affect the same location; the last write determines the final color. (This seems consistent with the examples, although not strictly necessary to achieve the correct output pattern shown).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (assumed 10x10 based on examples), filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are "trigger pixels".
3.  For each trigger pixel found, characterized by its row `R`, column `C`, and color `Color`:
    a.  Determine the vertical zone based on `R`:
        i.  If `R` is between 0 and 4 (inclusive), the zone is the top zone (rows 0-4). Set `min_row = 0`, `max_row = 4`.
        ii. If `R` is between 5 and 9 (inclusive), the zone is the bottom zone (rows 5-9). Set `min_row = 5`, `max_row = 9`.
    b.  Draw vertical lines using `Color` on the output grid:
        i.  Draw a line in the leftmost column (column 0) from `min_row` to `max_row`.
        ii. Draw a line in the rightmost column (column 9) from `min_row` to `max_row`.
    c.  Draw horizontal lines using `Color` on the output grid:
        i.  Draw a line across the full width (columns 0-9) at the trigger pixel's row `R`.
        ii. If the trigger pixel is in the top zone (rows 0-4), draw an additional line across the full width at row 0.
        iii. If the trigger pixel is in the bottom zone (rows 5-9), draw an additional line across the full width at row 9.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
