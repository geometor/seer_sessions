```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location and color of non-white pixels.

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
2.  Find all non-white pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each non-white pixel with color C at row R and column C_idx:
    a.  If R is 4 or less, define a vertical range from row 0 to row R (inclusive).
    b.  If R is 5 or more, define a vertical range from row C_idx to the last row (inclusive).
    c.  Draw a rectangular frame on the output grid using color C, spanning the full width of the grid and covering the determined vertical range. The frame consists of the top row, bottom row, leftmost column, and rightmost column within these bounds.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
