## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the core concept: non-white pixels in the input act as triggers to draw colored frames in the output. However, the exact rules for defining the frame's vertical extent and structure were inaccurate, leading to mismatches in the output.

The errors primarily occurred because:
1.  The vertical range for the frame was calculated based on the trigger pixel's row (`R`) and column (`C_idx`) in ways that didn't match the observed outputs (e.g., `[0, R]` or `[C_idx, height-1]`).
2.  The code only drew the outer boundary (top, bottom, left, right) of the calculated vertical range, whereas the expected output includes an additional horizontal line corresponding to the trigger pixel's original row (`R`).

The new strategy involves:
1.  Recognizing that the grid is conceptually divided into two fixed vertical zones (e.g., rows 0-4 and rows 5-9 for a 10x10 grid).
2.  Determining which zone a trigger pixel belongs to based on its row (`R`).
3.  Drawing a standard frame (top/bottom of the zone, full-height left/right sides within the zone) using the trigger pixel's color (`C`).
4.  Drawing an additional full horizontal line at the trigger pixel's original row (`R`) using its color (`C`).

## Metrics

  - Find all trigger_pixels in the input grid.
  - For each trigger_pixel (R, C_idx, C):
      - Determine its vertical_zone based on R:
          - If R < 5, zone = zone_1 (rows 0-4).
          - If R >= 5, zone = zone_2 (rows 5-9).
      - Draw the output_frame components onto the output grid using color C:
          - Draw top_line (full width) at the zone's minimum row index.
          - Draw bottom_line (full width) at the zone's maximum row index.
          - Draw left_side (column 0) for all rows within the zone.
          - Draw right_side (column width-1) for all rows within the zone.
      - Draw the output_center_line (full width) onto the output grid at row R using color C.
  - Return the final output grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). These are the "trigger pixels".
3.  For each trigger pixel found, characterized by its row `R`, column `C_idx`, and color `C`:
    a.  Determine the vertical zone based on the trigger pixel's row `R`:
        i.  If `R` is less than 5 (i.e., rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), the zone consists of rows 0 through 4.
        ii. If `R` is 5 or greater (i.e., rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), the zone consists of rows 5 through 9.
    b.  Draw a frame using the trigger pixel's color `C` within its determined zone:
        i.  Draw a horizontal line of color `C` across the full width of the grid at the top row of the zone (row 0 for zone 1, row 5 for zone 2).
        ii. Draw a horizontal line of color `C` across the full width of the grid at the bottom row of the zone (row 4 for zone 1, row 9 for zone 2).
        iii. Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the leftmost column (column 0) for all rows within the zone.
        iv. Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the rightmost column (column width-1) for all rows within the zone.
    c.  Draw an additional horizontal line of color `C` across the full width of the grid at the trigger pixel's original row `R`.
4.  Return the completed output grid. (Note: If multiple trigger pixels cause drawing in the same location, the color from the last processed pixel for that location will prevail).
