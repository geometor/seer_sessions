task_context:
  - All example grids (input and output) have dimensions 10x10.
  - The transformation is triggered by the location and color of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - The output grid is constructed by drawing shapes based on these trigger pixels.

grid_properties:
  - height: 10
  - width: 10
  - vertical_zones:
      - zone_1: rows 0-4 (inclusive)
      - zone_2: rows 5-9 (inclusive)
  - horizontal_bounds:
      - left_col: 0
      - right_col: 9

objects:
  - type: trigger_pixel
    properties:
      - row: R (integer 0-9)
      - column: C_idx (integer 0-9)
      - color: C (integer 1-9)
    identification: Any pixel in the input grid with color != 0.
  - type: output_frame
    properties:
      - color: C (derived from trigger_pixel)
      - zone: zone_1 or zone_2 (determined by trigger_pixel.row)
      - components:
          - top_line: Horizontal line at the top row of the zone.
          - bottom_line: Horizontal line at the bottom row of the zone.
          - left_side: Vertical line at the left_col within the zone's rows.
          - right_side: Vertical line at the right_col within the zone's rows.
  - type: output_center_line
    properties:
        - color: C (derived from trigger_pixel)
        - row: R (derived from trigger_pixel.row)
        - location: Full horizontal line at row R.

actions:
  - Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
  - Find all trigger_pixels in the input grid.
  - For each trigger_pixel (R, C_idx, C):
      - Determine its vertical_zone based on R:
          - If R < 5, zone = zone_1 (rows 0-4).
          - If R >= 5, zone = zone_2 (rows 5-9).
      - Draw the output_frame components onto the output grid using color C:
          - Draw top_line (full width) at the zone's minimum row index.
          - Draw bottom_line (full width) at the zone's maximum row index.
          - Draw left_side (column 0) for all rows within the zone.
          - Draw right_side (column width-1) for all rows within the zone.
      - Draw the output_center_line (full width) onto the output grid at row R using color C.
  - Return the final output grid.
