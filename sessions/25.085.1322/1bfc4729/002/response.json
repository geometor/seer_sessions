            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the core concept: non-white pixels in the input act as triggers to draw colored frames in the output. However, the exact rules for defining the frame's vertical extent and structure were inaccurate, leading to mismatches in the output.\n\nThe errors primarily occurred because:\n1.  The vertical range for the frame was calculated based on the trigger pixel's row (`R`) and column (`C_idx`) in ways that didn't match the observed outputs (e.g., `[0, R]` or `[C_idx, height-1]`).\n2.  The code only drew the outer boundary (top, bottom, left, right) of the calculated vertical range, whereas the expected output includes an additional horizontal line corresponding to the trigger pixel's original row (`R`).\n\nThe new strategy involves:\n1.  Recognizing that the grid is conceptually divided into two fixed vertical zones (e.g., rows 0-4 and rows 5-9 for a 10x10 grid).\n2.  Determining which zone a trigger pixel belongs to based on its row (`R`).\n3.  Drawing a standard frame (top/bottom of the zone, full-height left/right sides within the zone) using the trigger pixel's color (`C`).\n4.  Drawing an additional full horizontal line at the trigger pixel's original row (`R`) using its color (`C`).\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's confirm details about the examples.\n\n"
