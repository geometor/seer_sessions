Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).\n2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). These are the \"trigger pixels\".\n3.  For each trigger pixel found, characterized by its row `R`, column `C_idx`, and color `C`:\n    a.  Determine the vertical zone based on the trigger pixel's row `R`:\n        i.  If `R` is less than 5 (rows 0-4), the zone covers rows 0 through 4. Set `min_row = 0`, `max_row = 4`.\n        ii. If `R` is 5 or greater (rows 5-9), the zone covers rows 5 through 9. Set `min_row = 5`, `max_row = 9`.\n    b.  Draw a frame using the trigger pixel's color `C` within its determined zone:\n        i.  Draw a horizontal line of color `C` across the full width at `min_row`.\n        ii. Draw a horizontal line of color `C` across the full width at `max_row`.\n        iii. Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the leftmost column (column 0) from `min_row` to `max_row`.\n        iv. Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the rightmost column (column width-1) from `min_row` to `max_row`.\n    c.  Draw an additional horizontal line of color `C` across the full width at the trigger pixel's original row `R`.\n4.  Return the completed output grid.
