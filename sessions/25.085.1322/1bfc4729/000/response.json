            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are 10x10. They consist mostly of white pixels (0), with typically two distinct non-white pixels at different locations.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are also 10x10. They contain rectangular \"frames\" (hollow rectangles) constructed from the colors found in the input grid. The interior of the frames remains white.\n3.  **Color Correspondence:** Each non-white pixel in the input seems to generate a frame of the *same color* in the output.\n4.  **Frame Structure:** The frames always span the entire width of the grid (columns 0 through 9). Their vertical position and extent vary.\n5.  **Positional Logic:** The vertical definition (top and bottom rows) of each frame appears linked to the position (row `R` and column `C_idx`) of the corresponding non-white pixel in the input grid.\n6.  **Rule Division:** There seems to be a conditional logic based on the input pixel's row index (`R`). A dividing line appears to be between row 4 and row 5.\n    *   If the input pixel's row `R` is in the top half (0-4), the resulting frame uses row `R` as its bottom edge and row 0 as its top edge.\n    *   If the input pixel's row `R` is in the bottom half (5-9), the resulting frame uses the input pixel's *column index* `C_idx` as its top edge and row 9 (the grid bottom) as its bottom edge.\n7.  **Construction:** The output grid seems to be built by starting with a white grid and then drawing the borders (top row, bottom row, first column, last column) for each calculated frame.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel of the input grid to find all non-white pixels.\n3.  For each non-white pixel found:\n    a.  Record its row index `R`, column index `C_idx`, and color `C`.\n    b.  Determine the vertical range (top row `min_row`, bottom row `max_row`) for the frame:\n        i.  If the row index `R` is 4 or less, set `min_row` to 0 and `max_row` to `R`.\n        ii. If the row index `R` is 5 or more, set `min_row` to the pixel's column index `C_idx` and `max_row` to the last row index of the grid (9 for a 10-row grid).\n    c.  Paint the border of this frame onto the output grid using color `C`:\n        i.  Change the color of all pixels in row `min_row` (from column 0 to the last column) to `C`.\n        ii. Change the color of all pixels in row `max_row` (from column 0 to the last column) to `C`.\n        iii. Change the color of all pixels in column 0 (from row `min_row` to `max_row`) to `C`.\n        iv. Change the color of all pixels in the last column (column 9 for a 10-column grid) (from row `min_row` to `max_row`) to `C`.\n4.  After processing all non-white pixels from the input, the resulting output grid is the final answer."
