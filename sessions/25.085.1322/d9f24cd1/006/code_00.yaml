task_context:
  description: Fill specific columns with red based on markers in the last row and gray modifiers anywhere above the last row.
  grid_properties:
    - height: variable (10 in examples)
    - width: variable (10 in examples)
    - colors: white (0), red (2), gray (5) are relevant.

objects:
  - name: marker
    identifier: pixel value 2 in the last row
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - location: column index in the last row (row_index = height - 1)
  - name: modifier
    identifier: pixel value 5 not in the last row
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - location: row and column index (row_index < height - 1)
  - name: background
    identifier: pixel value 0
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

actions:
  - name: identify_markers
    description: Find the column indices of all red (2) pixels in the last row.
  - name: identify_modifiers
    description: Find the column indices of all gray (5) pixels in rows above the last row. Keep track of which columns contain modifiers.
  - name: determine_target_columns
    description: Create a set of target column indices based on markers and modifiers.
    steps:
      - For each marker column index `M`:
          - Check if a modifier exists anywhere in column `M` (above the last row).
          - If yes (modifier in column `M`), add column index `M + 1` to the target set (respecting grid width).
          - If no (no modifier in column `M`), add column index `M` to the target set.
      - For each column index `G` that contains a modifier (from identify_modifiers step):
          - Check if column `G` corresponds to a marker column index `M`.
          - If column `G` does *not* correspond to a marker column index, add column index `G` to the target set.
  - name: fill_columns
    description: Modify a copy of the input grid by filling target columns.
    steps:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - For each column index `C` in the determined target set:
          - For each row index `R` from 0 to height - 1:
              - If the pixel at `(R, C)` in the *original* input grid is white (0):
                  - Change the pixel at `(R, C)` in the *copy* grid to red (2).
      - Return the modified grid.

relationships:
  - type: co-location
    description: A modifier (gray pixel) can be in the same column as a marker (red pixel in last row).
    effect: Changes the target column from the marker's column `M` to the column to its right `M + 1`.
  - type: independence
    description: A modifier (gray pixel) can exist in a column that does not contain a marker in the last row.
    effect: Causes the modifier's own column `G` to be targeted for filling.
