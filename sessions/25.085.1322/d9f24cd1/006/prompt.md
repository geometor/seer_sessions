"""
Transforms an input grid based on red markers in the last row and gray modifiers above them.
1. Identifies columns with red markers (2) in the last row.
2. For each marker column, checks if a gray pixel (5) exists anywhere in that column above the last row.
3. Determines target columns to fill with red:
    - If gray is present above the marker, both the marker column and the column to its immediate right are targeted.
    - If gray is not present above the marker, only the marker column is targeted.
4. Fills the targeted columns entirely with red (2), but only replaces pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid. Existing non-white pixels (like gray 5) are preserved. Grid boundaries are respected when targeting the column to the right.
