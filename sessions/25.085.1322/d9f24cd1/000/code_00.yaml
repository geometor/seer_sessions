task_elements:
  - grid_dimensions:
      input: [10, 10]
      output: [10, 10]
  - background_color: white (0)
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
        color: gray (5)
        attributes:
          - static: remains in the same position between input and output.
          - overrides: takes precedence over newly added red pixels.
      - type: pixel
        color: red (2)
        attributes:
          - location_input: exclusively in the last row.
          - role: acts as a trigger/marker.
  - relationships:
      - trigger_columns: The columns containing red (2) pixels in the last row of the input grid determine which columns are modified in the output.
  - actions:
      - identify_columns: Find the column indices containing red (2) pixels in the last row of the input.
      - fill_columns: For each identified column index `c`, change the color of all pixels `(r, c)` in the output grid to red (2), for all rows `r`.
      - preserve_grays: Ensure that any pixel that was gray (5) in the input grid remains gray (5) in the output grid, even if it falls within a column designated to be filled with red.
