For each marker column, checks if a gray pixel (5) exists anywhere in that column above the last row.\n3. Determines target columns to fill with red:\n    - If gray is present above the marker, both the marker column and the column to its immediate right are targeted.\n    - If gray is not present above the marker, only the marker column is targeted.\n4. Fills the targeted columns entirely with red (2), but only replaces pixels that were originally white (0) in the input grid. Existing non-white pixels (like gray 5) are preserved. Grid boundaries are respected when targeting the column to the right.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule described above.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    # This preserves existing pixels unless explicitly overwritten\n    output_array = np.copy(input_array)\n    \n    # 1.
