Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (2*H) x (2*W), initializing all pixels to 'white' (0).
3.  Copy the entire input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
4.  Copy the entire input grid again into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2*H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
5.  Examine the *input* grid row by row: For each row index `r` from 0 up to H-2 (the second-to-last row):
    a. Check if row `r` of the input grid contains at least one non-'white' pixel.
    b. Check if row `r+1` (the row immediately below `r`) of the input grid consists entirely of 'white' pixels.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment**

The initial Python code successfully implemented the 2x2 tiling aspect of the transformation and correctly identified *a* condition for inserting green rows (a non-white row followed by an all-white row). However, it failed on Example 3, indicating that the condition for inserting green rows was incomplete or incorrect. The code inserted green rows where the expected output did not have them.

By comparing the input and expected output across all three examples, particularly focusing on Example 3 where the failure occurred, we can deduce a more precise rule for the green row insertion. The key insight seems to be that a green row is inserted *only* when an all-white row acts as a single-row gap *between* two rows containing non-white pixels in the input grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  Confirm the 2x2 tiling and initialization remain correct.
2.  Refine the condition for inserting green rows based on the three-row pattern (non-white, all-white, non-white) observed in the input.
3.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this refined rule.

**Metrics**

Let's re-evaluate the conditions for inserting green rows based on the hypothesis: Insert green at `r+1` and `r+1+H` if `input[r]` is non-white, `input[r+1]` is all-white, AND `input[r+2]` is non-white (within bounds).

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 (H=3, W=3) -> Output: 6x6
    *   Check r=0 (Loop max r = H-3 = 0):
        *   `input[0]` non-white? Yes (`[0, 8, 0]`).
        *   `input[1]` all white? Yes (`[0, 0, 0]`).
        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes (`[0, 8, 0]`).
        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 1 and 1+H=4.
    *   Result: Matches expected output.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 6x6 (H=6, W=6) -> Output: 12x12
    *   Check r=0 (Loop max r = H-3 = 3):
        *   `input[0]` non-white? Yes.
        *   `input[1]` all white? Yes.
        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.
        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 1 and 1+H=7.
    *   Check r=1:
        *   `input[1]` non-white? No (all white). -> Skip.
    *   Check r=2:
        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.
        *   `input[3]` all white? No. -> Skip.
    *   Check r=3:
        *   `input[3]` non-white? Yes.
        *   `input[4]` all white? Yes.
        *   `input[5]` non-white? Yes.
        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 4 and 4+H=10.
    *   Result: Matches expected output.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7 (H=7, W=7) -> Output: 14x14
    *   Check r=0 (Loop max r = H-3 = 4):
        *   `input[0]` non-white? Yes.
        *   `input[1]` all white? Yes.
        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.
        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 1 and 1+H=8.
    *   Check r=1:
        *   `input[1]` non-white? No. -> Skip.
    *   Check r=2:
        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.
        *   `input[3]` all white? Yes.
        *   `input[4]` non-white? No (all white). -> Conditions *not* met. Do not insert green at 3, 10.
    *   Check r=3:
        *   `input[3]` non-white? No. -> Skip.
    *   Check r=4:
        *   `input[4]` non-white? No. -> Skip.
    *   Result: Matches expected output (correcting the previous code's error).

The refined hypothesis holds for all examples.

      A fill operation is required for output row `r+1` if the following three conditions are met simultaneously in the input grid:
      1. Row `r` is a content_row.
      2. Row `r+1` is a gap_row.
      3. Row `r+2` is a content_row.

      If the conditions for filling are met for input row index `r`:
      1. Create a fill_row at row `r+1` in the output grid.
      2. Create a fill_row at row `r+1+H` in the output grid.

constants:
  - name: background_color

constraints:
  - The fill operation only occurs for single-row gaps (one gap_row) located directly between two content_rows in the input grid.
  - The iteration range ensures that `r`, `r+1`, and `r+2` are valid row indices within the input grid during the check.
```


**Natural Language Program**


```
1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of size (2*H) x (2*W), initializing all cells to 'white' (0).
3.  Copy the input grid to the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows `0` to `H-1`, columns `0` to `W-1`).
4.  Copy the input grid to the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
5.  Iterate through the rows of the *input* grid using an index `r` starting from 0 up to (but not including) `H-2`. This ensures that `r`, `r+1`, and `r+2` are valid indices within the input grid height `H`.
6.  For each index `r`:
    a. Check if input row `r` contains any non-'white' pixel.
    b. Check if input row `r+1` consists entirely of 'white' pixels.
    c. Check if input row `r+2` contains any non-'white' pixel.
7.  If all three conditions (6a, 6b, 6c) are true:
    a. Fill the entire row `r+1` in the *output* grid with 'green' (3).
    b. Fill the entire row `r+1+H` in the *output* grid with 'green' (3).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
```

*Self-correction on loop range in NL program:* The loop needs to check `r`, `r+1`, and `r+2`. The highest index needed is `r+2`. To ensure `r+2` is less than `H`, the maximum value for `r` must be `H-3`. So the loop should run from `r = 0` to `r = H-3` (inclusive). Let me correct the NL program point 5.
