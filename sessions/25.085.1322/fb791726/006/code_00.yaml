task_description: Tile the input grid 2x2 and fill specific horizontal single-row gaps between content with green.
grid_properties:
  - property: output_dimensions
    description: The output grid dimensions are 2 times the height (H) and 2 times the width (W) of the input grid.
  - property: output_initialization
    color: white
    value: 0
    description: The output grid is initialized entirely with the background color 'white'.
  - property: tiling
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    quadrants:
      - name: top_left
        rows: 0 to H-1
        cols: 0 to W-1
      - name: bottom_right
        rows: H to 2H-1
        cols: W to 2W-1
    description: The input grid is copied into the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid.

object_definitions:
  - object_type: content_row
    basis: input_grid
    description: A row containing at least one non-'white' pixel.
  - object_type: gap_row
    basis: input_grid
    description: A row containing only 'white' pixels.
  - object_type: fill_row
    basis: output_grid
    color: green
    value: 3
    description: A row filled entirely with 'green' color.

actions:
  - action: identify_gaps_to_fill
    input: input_grid
    description: >
      Iterate through input row indices `r` from 0 to H-3 (where H is input height).
      A fill operation is required for output row `r+1` if the following three conditions are met simultaneously in the input grid:
      1. Row `r` is a content_row.
      2. Row `r+1` is a gap_row.
      3. Row `r+2` is a content_row.
  - action: apply_fill
    output: output_grid
    trigger: result of identify_gaps_to_fill for index `r`
    description: >
      If the conditions for filling are met for input row index `r`:
      1. Create a fill_row at row `r+1` in the output grid.
      2. Create a fill_row at row `r+1+H` in the output grid.

constants:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0
    color: white
  - name: fill_color
    value: 3
    color: green

constraints:
  - The fill operation only occurs for single-row gaps (one gap_row) located directly between two content_rows in the input grid.
  - The iteration range ensures that `r`, `r+1`, and `r+2` are valid row indices within the input grid during the check.
