            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial Python code successfully implemented the 2x2 tiling aspect of the transformation and correctly identified *a* condition for inserting green rows (a non-white row followed by an all-white row). However, it failed on Example 3, indicating that the condition for inserting green rows was incomplete or incorrect. The code inserted green rows where the expected output did not have them.\n\nBy comparing the input and expected output across all three examples, particularly focusing on Example 3 where the failure occurred, we can deduce a more precise rule for the green row insertion. The key insight seems to be that a green row is inserted *only* when an all-white row acts as a single-row gap *between* two rows containing non-white pixels in the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Confirm the 2x2 tiling and initialization remain correct.\n2.  Refine the condition for inserting green rows based on the three-row pattern (non-white, all-white, non-white) observed in the input.\n3.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect this refined rule.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the conditions for inserting green rows based on the hypothesis: Insert green at `r+1` and `r+1+H` if `input[r]` is non-white, `input[r+1]` is all-white, AND `input[r+2]` is non-white (within bounds).\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 (H=3, W=3) -> Output: 6x6\n    *   Check r=0 (Loop max r = H-3 = 0):\n        *   `input[0]` non-white? Yes (`[0, 8, 0]`).\n        *   `input[1]` all white? Yes (`[0, 0, 0]`).\n        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes (`[0, 8, 0]`).\n        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 1 and 1+H=4.\n    *   Result: Matches expected output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 6x6 (H=6, W=6) -> Output: 12x12\n    *   Check r=0 (Loop max r = H-3 = 3):\n        *   `input[0]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   `input[1]` all white? Yes.\n        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 1 and 1+H=7.\n    *   Check r=1:\n        *   `input[1]` non-white? No (all white). -> Skip.\n    *   Check r=2:\n        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   `input[3]` all white? No. -> Skip.\n    *   Check r=3:\n        *   `input[3]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   `input[4]` all white? Yes.\n        *   `input[5]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 4 and 4+H=10.\n    *   Result: Matches expected output.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 (H=7, W=7) -> Output: 14x14\n    *   Check r=0 (Loop max r = H-3 = 4):\n        *   `input[0]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   `input[1]` all white? Yes.\n        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   -> Conditions met. Insert green at rows 1 and 1+H=8.\n    *   Check r=1:\n        *   `input[1]` non-white? No. -> Skip.\n    *   Check r=2:\n        *   `input[2]` non-white? Yes.\n        *   `input[3]` all white? Yes.\n        *   `input[4]` non-white? No (all white). -> Conditions *not* met. Do not insert green at 3, 10.\n    *   Check r=3:\n        *   `input[3]` non-white? No. -> Skip.\n    *   Check r=4:\n        *   `input[4]` non-white? No. -> Skip.\n    *   Result: Matches expected output (correcting the previous code's error).\n\nThe refined hypothesis holds for all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
