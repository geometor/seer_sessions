An identical copy of these non-'white' pixels also appears shifted down by the original height and right by the original width (bottom-right quadrant).\n3.  **New Elements:** Rows filled entirely with 'green' (3) pixels appear in the output grid.\n4.  **Pattern of Green Rows:** The 'green' rows seem to be inserted based on the rows containing non-'white' pixels. Specifically, a green row appears directly below a row *if* that row contains a non-'white' pixel (from either the original or the shifted copy) *and* the row below it was originally empty (all 'white' pixels) after the two copies were placed.\n5.  **Background:** The remaining pixels in the output grid are 'white' (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Copy the content of the input grid into the top-left `H x W` area of the output grid (from row 0, column 0 to row H-1, column W-1).\n4.

If row `r` contains a non-'white' pixel, then check if the entire row `r + 1` currently consists only of 'white' (0) pixels.\n8.  If both conditions (row `r` has non-'white' pixel AND row `r + 1` is all 'white') are true, then change all pixels in row `r + 1` to 'green' (3).\n9.
