Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** The output grid's height and width are consistently double the input grid's height and width.
2.  **Content Preservation & Duplication:** The non-'white' pixels from the input grid appear in the output grid in their original relative positions (top-left quadrant). An identical copy of these non-'white' pixels also appears shifted down by the original height and right by the original width (bottom-right quadrant).
3.  **New Elements:** Rows filled entirely with 'green' (3) pixels appear in the output grid.
4.  **Pattern of Green Rows:** The 'green' rows seem to be inserted based on the rows containing non-'white' pixels. Specifically, a green row appears directly below a row *if* that row contains a non-'white' pixel (from either the original or the shifted copy) *and* the row below it was originally empty (all 'white' pixels) after the two copies were placed.
5.  **Background:** The remaining pixels in the output grid are 'white' (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
Transformation: Grid Manipulation and Pattern Insertion
Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Height: H
    - Width: W
    - Pixels: Can contain various colors (0-9), including non-'white' pixels.
Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 2 * H
    - Width: 2 * W
    - Pixels: Contains 'white' (0), 'green' (3), and the non-'white' colors from the input.
Relationships:
  - Rule_1: Output dimensions are double the input dimensions.
  - Rule_2:
    Action: Copy
    Source: Input Grid pixels
    Destination_1: Output Grid top-left quadrant (0:H, 0:W) at original relative coordinates.
    Destination_2: Output Grid bottom-right quadrant (H:2H, W:2W) at coordinates (r+H, c+W) for each input pixel at (r, c).
  - Rule_3:
    Action: Insert Green Row
    Condition_Source_Row: A row `r` (0 <= r < 2H-1) in the intermediate grid (after Rule_2 copies) contains at least one non-'white' pixel.
    Condition_Target_Row: The row `r+1` in the intermediate grid consists entirely of 'white' (0) pixels.
    Result: If both conditions are met, row `r+1` in the final output grid is filled with 'green' (3).
  - Rule_4: All pixels in the output grid not affected by Rule_2 or Rule_3 remain 'white' (0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with height `2H` and width `2W`, initially filled with 'white' (0) pixels.
3.  Copy the content of the input grid into the top-left `H x W` area of the output grid (from row 0, column 0 to row H-1, column W-1).
4.  Copy the content of the input grid again into the bottom-right `H x W` area of the output grid (from row H, column W to row 2H-1, column 2W-1).
5.  Iterate through each row `r` of the resulting grid, from row 0 up to row `2H - 2`.
6.  For each row `r`, check if it contains any pixel value other than 'white' (0).
7.  If row `r` contains a non-'white' pixel, then check if the entire row `r + 1` currently consists only of 'white' (0) pixels.
8.  If both conditions (row `r` has non-'white' pixel AND row `r + 1` is all 'white') are true, then change all pixels in row `r + 1` to 'green' (3).
9.  The final state of the grid after checking all rows is the result.
