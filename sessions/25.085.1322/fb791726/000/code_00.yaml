Transformation: Grid Manipulation and Pattern Insertion
Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Height: H
    - Width: W
    - Pixels: Can contain various colors (0-9), including non-'white' pixels.
Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 2 * H
    - Width: 2 * W
    - Pixels: Contains 'white' (0), 'green' (3), and the non-'white' colors from the input.
Relationships:
  - Rule_1: Output dimensions are double the input dimensions.
  - Rule_2:
    Action: Copy
    Source: Input Grid pixels
    Destination_1: Output Grid top-left quadrant (0:H, 0:W) at original relative coordinates.
    Destination_2: Output Grid bottom-right quadrant (H:2H, W:2W) at coordinates (r+H, c+W) for each input pixel at (r, c).
  - Rule_3:
    Action: Insert Green Row
    Condition_Source_Row: A row `r` (0 <= r < 2H-1) in the intermediate grid (after Rule_2 copies) contains at least one non-'white' pixel.
    Condition_Target_Row: The row `r+1` in the intermediate grid consists entirely of 'white' (0) pixels.
    Result: If both conditions are met, row `r+1` in the final output grid is filled with 'green' (3).
  - Rule_4: All pixels in the output grid not affected by Rule_2 or Rule_3 remain 'white' (0).
