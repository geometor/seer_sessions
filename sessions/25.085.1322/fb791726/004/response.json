            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code successfully implemented the core logic observed in the first example: doubling the grid size, copying the input to the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and adding green rows. The code passed the first two examples but failed on the third.\n\nThe failure report for Example 3 indicates that the generated output had 28 incorrect pixels, specifically by adding extra green rows compared to the expected output. However, the \"Transformed Output\" displayed for Example 3 in the prompt *matches* the \"Expected Output\". This discrepancy suggests either the failure report (pixels off count) was generated by a slightly different version of the code or rule interpretation, or the displayed \"Transformed Output\" is incorrect.\n\nAssuming the failure report is accurate and the code generated *too many* green rows, the error likely lies in the condition used to add the green rows. The original rule checked consecutive rows in the *intermediate* grid (after copying the input twice). The correct rule, as deduced by analyzing all three examples, appears to depend on consecutive rows in the *original input grid*.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Adopt the revised hypothesis: The placement of green rows depends on properties of adjacent rows in the *input* grid, not the intermediate grid.\n2.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this dependence on the input grid structure.\n3.  The coder phase will then modify the Python function to implement this corrected logic.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the provided examples and the assumed *correct* expected outputs:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Output Size: 6x6\n    *   Input Colors: white (0), azure (8)\n    *   Output Colors: white (0), azure (8), green (3)\n    *   Green rows added at indices 1 and 4. This corresponds to input row 0 having content and input row 1 being empty. (Indices 0+1=1 and 0+1+H = 1+3=4).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 6x6\n    *   Output Size: 12x12\n    *   Input Colors: white (0), yellow (4)\n    *   Output Colors: white (0), yellow (4), green (3)\n    *   Green rows added at indices 1, 4, 7, 10.\n        *   Input row 0 has content, input row 1 empty -> Green rows 1 and 1+H=7.\n        *   Input row 3 has content, input row 4 empty -> Green rows 4 and 4+H=10.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x7\n    *   Output Size: 14x14\n    *   Input Colors: white (0), orange (7)\n    *   Output Colors: white (0), orange (7), green (3)\n    *   Green rows added at indices 1, 3, 8, 10.\n        *   Input row 0 has content, input row 1 empty -> Green rows 1 and 1+H=8.\n        *   Input row 2 has content, input row 3 empty -> Green rows 3 and 3+H=10.\n\nThe pattern holds: Green rows are added in the output grid at indices `r+1` and `r+1+H` if input row `r` contains non-white pixels and input row `r+1` is entirely white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
