```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1. Doubles the dimensions (height H and width W) of the input grid to create an intermediate grid of size (2*H) x (2*W) initialized with 'white' (0).
2. Copies the input grid content into the top-left quadrant (0:H, 0:W) of the intermediate grid.
3. Copies the input grid content again into the bottom-right quadrant (H:2*H, W:2*W) of the intermediate grid.
4. Creates a final output grid, initially identical to the intermediate grid.
5. Iterates through the rows of the *intermediate* grid. If a row `r` (where r < 2*H - 1) in the intermediate grid contains any non-'white' pixel AND the row directly below it (`r+1`) in the intermediate grid is entirely 'white', then row `r+1` in the *final output grid* is filled entirely with 'green' (3).
6. Returns the final output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code successfully implemented the core logic observed in the first example: doubling the grid size, copying the input to the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and adding green rows. The code passed the first two examples but failed on the third.

The failure report for Example 3 indicates that the generated output had 28 incorrect pixels, specifically by adding extra green rows compared to the expected output. However, the "Transformed Output" displayed for Example 3 in the prompt *matches* the "Expected Output". This discrepancy suggests either the failure report (pixels off count) was generated by a slightly different version of the code or rule interpretation, or the displayed "Transformed Output" is incorrect.

Assuming the failure report is accurate and the code generated *too many* green rows, the error likely lies in the condition used to add the green rows. The original rule checked consecutive rows in the *intermediate* grid (after copying the input twice). The correct rule, as deduced by analyzing all three examples, appears to depend on consecutive rows in the *original input grid*.

**Strategy:**

1.  Adopt the revised hypothesis: The placement of green rows depends on properties of adjacent rows in the *input* grid, not the intermediate grid.
2.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this dependence on the input grid structure.
3.  The coder phase will then modify the Python function to implement this corrected logic.

**Metrics:**

Based on the provided examples and the assumed *correct* expected outputs:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 6x6
    *   Input Colors: white (0), azure (8)
    *   Output Colors: white (0), azure (8), green (3)
    *   Green rows added at indices 1 and 4. This corresponds to input row 0 having content and input row 1 being empty. (Indices 0+1=1 and 0+1+H = 1+3=4).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 6x6
    *   Output Size: 12x12
    *   Input Colors: white (0), yellow (4)
    *   Output Colors: white (0), yellow (4), green (3)
    *   Green rows added at indices 1, 4, 7, 10.
        *   Input row 0 has content, input row 1 empty -> Green rows 1 and 1+H=7.
        *   Input row 3 has content, input row 4 empty -> Green rows 4 and 4+H=10.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 7x7
    *   Output Size: 14x14
    *   Input Colors: white (0), orange (7)
    *   Output Colors: white (0), orange (7), green (3)
    *   Green rows added at indices 1, 3, 8, 10.
        *   Input row 0 has content, input row 1 empty -> Green rows 1 and 1+H=8.
        *   Input row 2 has content, input row 3 empty -> Green rows 3 and 3+H=10.

The pattern holds: Green rows are added in the output grid at indices `r+1` and `r+1+H` if input row `r` contains non-white pixels and input row `r+1` is entirely white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Create a larger grid based on repeating the input and inserting specific colored rows.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - height: H
    - width: W
    - pixels: Colors 0-9 (white=0)

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - height: 2 * H
    - width: 2 * W
  Construction:
    - Step 1: Initialize with 'white' (0).
    - Step 2: Copy Input_Grid to Output_Grid[0:H, 0:W].
    - Step 3: Copy Input_Grid to Output_Grid[H:2*H, W:2*W].
    - Step 4: Insert 'green' (3) rows based on Input_Grid structure.

Row_Insertion_Rule:
  Condition:
    - Iterate through Input_Grid rows `r` from 0 to H-2.
    - Check 1: Input_Grid row `r` contains any non-'white' pixel.
    - Check 2: Input_Grid row `r+1` consists entirely of 'white' pixels.
  Action:
    - If Condition is true:
      - Fill Output_Grid row `r+1` with 'green' (3).
      - Fill Output_Grid row `r+1+H` with 'green' (3).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (2*H) x (2*W), initializing all pixels to 'white' (0).
3.  Copy the entire input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
4.  Copy the entire input grid again into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2*H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
5.  Examine the *input* grid row by row: For each row index `r` from 0 up to H-2 (the second-to-last row):
    a. Check if row `r` of the input grid contains at least one non-'white' pixel.
    b. Check if row `r+1` (the row immediately below `r`) of the input grid consists entirely of 'white' pixels.
    c. If *both* conditions (a and b) are true, then:
        i. Fill the entire row `r+1` of the *output* grid with 'green' (3).
        ii. Fill the entire row `r+1+H` of the *output* grid with 'green' (3).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
