Task: Add green rows based on content of copied quadrants.

Initial_State:
  - Input_Grid: A 2D grid of integers (colors). Dimensions HxW.

Intermediate_State:
  - Intermediate_Grid: A 2D grid of integers (colors).
  - Properties:
    - Dimensions: (2*H) x (2*W).
    - Initialized: All 'white' (0).
    - Top-Left Quadrant (0:H, 0:W): Contains a copy of the Input_Grid.
    - Bottom-Right Quadrant (H:2*H, W:2*W): Contains a copy of the Input_Grid.
    - Other Quadrants: Remain 'white' (0).

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Iterate through rows of the Intermediate_Grid (from index 0 to 2*H - 2).
  - Condition_Check: For each row `r` (where `r < 2*H - 1`):
    - Check Row `r` in Intermediate_Grid: Does it contain any non-'white' (non-zero) pixel?
    - Check Row `r+1` in Intermediate_Grid: Is it entirely 'white' (all zero)?
  - Modification: If both conditions are true for row `r`, then in the Final_Output_Grid, set all pixels in row `r+1` to 'green' (3).
  - Base: The Final_Output_Grid starts as a copy of the Intermediate_Grid. Modifications are applied based on the conditions checked on the *unmodified* Intermediate_Grid.

Final_State:
  - Output_Grid: The transformed 2D grid.
  - Content: Derived from Intermediate_Grid, with specific rows changed entirely to 'green' based on the Transformation_Rule.
