elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The predominant color, filling empty space.
  - type: source_object
    description: Contiguous or single pixels of non-white, non-gray color, typically found near the left edge of the grid within certain rows.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (maroon, magenta, yellow, azure, red in examples). Excludes white (0) and gray (5).
      - position: Appears as the first non-white pixel when scanning a row from left to right.
  - type: target_pixel
    description: Pixels to be recolored.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - position: Can appear anywhere within a row.

actions:
  - name: identify_row_source_color
    description: For each row, find the color of the first pixel that is not white (0).
    input: row
    output: source_color (or null/white if none exists or the first is gray)
  - name: replace_gray_pixels
    description: Change the color of specific pixels in the grid.
    condition: Only applies to pixels with the target color (gray). The replacement occurs only if a valid source_color (non-white, non-gray) was identified for the row.
    input: target_pixel (gray), source_color (from the same row)
    output: pixel with source_color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The transformation is row-dependent. The color used to replace gray pixels in a specific row is determined by the first non-white, non-gray color found within that same row.
