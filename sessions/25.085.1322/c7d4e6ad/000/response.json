            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids contain a background of white (0) pixels. There are distinct colored objects (maroon, magenta, yellow in the first example; azure, red in the second) positioned primarily towards the left side of the grid. Additionally, there's a distinct object or pattern composed of gray (5) pixels located roughly in the central area, potentially slightly offset to the right.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids retain the background and the colored objects from the left side of the input grid in their exact positions. The gray (5) pixels present in the input are replaced in the output.\n3.  **Transformation Observation**: The core transformation appears to involve the gray (5) pixels. Each gray pixel in the input grid is recolored in the output grid. The new color assigned to a former gray pixel corresponds to the color of the first non-white object encountered in the *same row*, scanning from the left edge.\n4.  **Row-based Logic**: The transformation seems to operate independently on each row. If a row contains a non-white, non-gray color (e.g., maroon, magenta, yellow, azure, red) starting from the left, this color dictates the replacement color for any gray pixels found *anywhere* within that specific row.\n5.  **Conditional Replacement**: Gray pixels are only replaced if there is a non-gray, non-white \"source\" color present earlier in the same row. If a row only contains white and gray pixels, or starts with gray, the gray pixels in that row remain unchanged (though this specific edge case isn't explicitly shown in the examples, it's implied by the observed pattern). Rows containing only white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
