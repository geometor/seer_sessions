Determine the output color based on pixel counts in the input grid.

1. Count the total number of red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
2. Count the total number of yellow pixels (color 4) in the input grid.
3. Compare the count of yellow pixels to twice the count of red pixels.
4. If the yellow count is greater than or equal to twice the red count, the output color is yellow (4).
5. Otherwise, the output color is red (2).
6. Create a 2x2 output grid filled entirely with the determined output color.
