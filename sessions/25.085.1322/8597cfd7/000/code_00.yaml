elements:
  - item: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - variable height and width (within 1x1 to 30x30)
      - contains pixels of white (0), red (2), yellow (4), gray (5)
      - always includes a single solid horizontal gray line
  - item: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (0-9)
      - fixed size: 2x2
      - contains pixels of a single color: either red (2) or yellow (4)
objects:
  - object: red_pixels
    properties:
      - color_value: 2
      - location: scattered in input_grid, both above and below the gray line
  - object: yellow_pixels
    properties:
      - color_value: 4
      - location: scattered in input_grid, both above and below the gray line
  - object: gray_line
    properties:
      - color_value: 5
      - shape: horizontal line spanning the width of the input_grid
      - location: separates the grid vertically
relationships:
  - relationship: count_comparison
    description: The core logic compares the total count of yellow pixels to twice the total count of red pixels.
actions:
  - action: count_pixels
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - target_color (red=2 or yellow=4)
    outputs:
      - total count of the target color pixels
  - action: compare_counts
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - red_count
      - yellow_count
    outputs:
      - decision_color (red=2 or yellow=4)
    logic: If yellow_count >= 2 * red_count, decision_color is yellow, otherwise it is red.
  - action: generate_output
    actor: system
    inputs:
      - decision_color
    outputs:
      - output_grid (2x2 grid filled with decision_color)
