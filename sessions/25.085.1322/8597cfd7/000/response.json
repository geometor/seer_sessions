            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids vary in size but always contain a single, solid horizontal line of gray pixels (color 5) that spans the entire width. The background is white (color 0).\n2.  **Key Colors:** Red (color 2) and Yellow (color 4) pixels are present in the input grids, appearing both above and below the gray line. They often form small clusters or vertical line segments.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is consistently a 2x2 grid.\n4.  **Output Color:** The output 2x2 grid is filled entirely with a single color, either Red (2) or Yellow (4).\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The task is to determine which color (Red or Yellow) should fill the output grid based on the arrangement and quantity of Red and Yellow pixels in the input grid.\n6.  **Initial Hypothesis & Refinement:**\n    *   Comparing total counts of Red vs. Yellow directly doesn't work (Ex 1, 2 fail).\n    *   Comparing counts only above or only below the gray line doesn't work consistently.\n    *   Comparing the sizes of the largest objects of each color doesn't work (Ex 1 fails).\n    *   Comparing the number of rows containing each color below the gray line doesn't work (Ex 1 fails).\n    *   The gray line seems potentially irrelevant to the core comparison logic, possibly acting as a visual separator or distractor.\n7.  **Successful Hypothesis:** A rule comparing the total count of Yellow pixels to *twice* the total count of Red pixels successfully explains all examples: Yellow wins only if its count is at least double the Red count; otherwise, Red wins.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
