Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (13x13) and mostly composed of the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Objects:** Scattered within the input grids are four distinct small objects, each made of a single non-white color.
3.  **Object Shape/Size:** In both examples, all four objects are L-shapes consisting of 3 pixels. They each fit perfectly within a 2x2 bounding box.
4.  **Object Colors:** The colors vary between examples but include blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8).
5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are much smaller (4x4).
6.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by taking the four objects from the input grid and arranging their 2x2 patterns into a 2x2 composite grid.
7.  **Positional Mapping:** The position of an object in the input grid generally determines its position in the output grid. Objects in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right "quadrants" of the input seem to map to the corresponding 2x2 sections of the output grid.
8.  **Conditional Swap:** In the second example (train\_2), the objects that originated in the top-left and top-right quadrants of the input grid appear swapped in the output grid compared to their original quadrant positions. In the first example (train\_1), they maintain their relative quadrant positions. This suggests a condition triggers this swap.
9.  **Swap Condition Observation:** In train\_2, the azure object (originally top-right quadrant, BBox rows 1-2, cols 6-7) has a bounding box that crosses the vertical center line (column index 6 for a 13-wide grid). In train\_1, neither the blue (top-left, BBox cols 2-3) nor the azure (top-right, BBox cols 8-9) objects cross the vertical center line. This seems to be the trigger for the swap: if any object assigned to a top quadrant crosses the vertical center line, the two top objects swap their positions in the output grid.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: object_assembly
grid_properties:
  input_size: 13x13
  output_size: 4x4
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - count: 4 per input grid
  - definition: contiguous non-white pixels
  - properties:
      - color: single non-white color (1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 observed)
      - shape: L-shape (3 pixels)
      - size: fits within a 2x2 bounding box
      - position: defined by coordinates (e.g., bounding box, center of mass)
relationships:
  - each_object_maps_to_output_quadrant: The position (center of mass) of an input object relative to the input grid's center determines its target 2x2 quadrant in the 4x4 output grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
transformation:
  - identify_objects: Find the 4 non-white objects.
  - extract_patterns: Get the 2x2 pattern for each object relative to its bounding box top-left.
  - determine_quadrants: Calculate the center of the input grid and assign each object to a quadrant based on its center of mass.
  - check_swap_condition: Determine if the bounding box of either the object assigned to the Top-Left quadrant or the object assigned to the Top-Right quadrant crosses the input grid's vertical center line.
  - assemble_output:
      - Create a 4x4 white grid.
      - Place the Bottom-Left object's pattern in the bottom-left 2x2 area.
      - Place the Bottom-Right object's pattern in the bottom-right 2x2 area.
      - If the swap condition is met:
          - Place the Top-Right object's pattern in the top-left 2x2 area.
          - Place the Top-Left object's pattern in the top-right 2x2 area.
      - Else (swap condition not met):
          - Place the Top-Left object's pattern in the top-left 2x2 area.
          - Place the Top-Right object's pattern in the top-right 2x2 area.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the four distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Characterize Objects:** For each object:
    a.  Record its color.
    b.  Determine its minimal bounding box.
    c.  Extract the 2x2 pixel pattern starting from the top-left corner of the bounding box (this will be the object's pattern).
    d.  Calculate its center of mass (average row/column index).
3.  **Determine Grid Center:** Find the central row and column indices of the input grid (e.g., `center_row = floor(height / 2)`, `center_col = floor(width / 2)`).
4.  **Assign Quadrants:** Assign each object to one of four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) based on whether its center of mass row is less than `center_row` (Top) or greater/equal (Bottom), and its center of mass column is less than `center_col` (Left) or greater/equal (Right). Store the 2x2 pattern associated with each assigned quadrant.
5.  **Check Swap Condition:** Examine the two objects assigned to the Top-Left and Top-Right quadrants. Check if the minimal bounding box of *either* of these objects crosses the vertical center line (i.e., the bounding box's minimum column index is less than `center_col` and its maximum column index is greater than or equal to `center_col`). Set a flag `swap_top_quadrants` to true if this condition is met, otherwise false.
6.  **Construct Output:** Create a 4x4 grid initialized to white (0).
    a.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Bottom-Left quadrant into the output grid at position (row=2, col=0).
    b.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Bottom-Right quadrant into the output grid at position (row=2, col=2).
    c.  If `swap_top_quadrants` is true:
        i.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object originally assigned to the Top-Right quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=0).
        ii. Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object originally assigned to the Top-Left quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=2).
    d.  If `swap_top_quadrants` is false:
        i.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Top-Left quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=0).
        ii. Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Top-Right quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=2).
7.  **Return:** The final 4x4 output grid.
