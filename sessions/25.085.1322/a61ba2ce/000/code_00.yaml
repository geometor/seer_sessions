task_type: object_assembly
grid_properties:
  input_size: 13x13
  output_size: 4x4
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - count: 4 per input grid
  - definition: contiguous non-white pixels
  - properties:
      - color: single non-white color (1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 observed)
      - shape: L-shape (3 pixels)
      - size: fits within a 2x2 bounding box
      - position: defined by coordinates (e.g., bounding box, center of mass)
relationships:
  - each_object_maps_to_output_quadrant: The position (center of mass) of an input object relative to the input grid's center determines its target 2x2 quadrant in the 4x4 output grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
transformation:
  - identify_objects: Find the 4 non-white objects.
  - extract_patterns: Get the 2x2 pattern for each object relative to its bounding box top-left.
  - determine_quadrants: Calculate the center of the input grid and assign each object to a quadrant based on its center of mass.
  - check_swap_condition: Determine if the bounding box of either the object assigned to the Top-Left quadrant or the object assigned to the Top-Right quadrant crosses the input grid's vertical center line.
  - assemble_output:
      - Create a 4x4 white grid.
      - Place the Bottom-Left object's pattern in the bottom-left 2x2 area.
      - Place the Bottom-Right object's pattern in the bottom-right 2x2 area.
      - If the swap condition is met:
          - Place the Top-Right object's pattern in the top-left 2x2 area.
          - Place the Top-Left object's pattern in the top-right 2x2 area.
      - Else (swap condition not met):
          - Place the Top-Left object's pattern in the top-left 2x2 area.
          - Place the Top-Right object's pattern in the top-right 2x2 area.
