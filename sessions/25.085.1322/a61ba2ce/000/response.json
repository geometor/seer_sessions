            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (13x13) and mostly composed of the background color (white, 0).\n2.  **Objects:** Scattered within the input grids are four distinct small objects, each made of a single non-white color.\n3.  **Object Shape/Size:** In both examples, all four objects are L-shapes consisting of 3 pixels. They each fit perfectly within a 2x2 bounding box.\n4.  **Object Colors:** The colors vary between examples but include blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8).\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are much smaller (4x4).\n6.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by taking the four objects from the input grid and arranging their 2x2 patterns into a 2x2 composite grid.\n7.  **Positional Mapping:** The position of an object in the input grid generally determines its position in the output grid. Objects in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right \"quadrants\" of the input seem to map to the corresponding 2x2 sections of the output grid.\n8.  **Conditional Swap:** In the second example (train\\_2), the objects that originated in the top-left and top-right quadrants of the input grid appear swapped in the output grid compared to their original quadrant positions. In the first example (train\\_1), they maintain their relative quadrant positions. This suggests a condition triggers this swap.\n9.  **Swap Condition Observation:** In train\\_2, the azure object (originally top-right quadrant, BBox rows 1-2, cols 6-7) has a bounding box that crosses the vertical center line (column index 6 for a 13-wide grid). In train\\_1, neither the blue (top-left, BBox cols 2-3) nor the azure (top-right, BBox cols 8-9) objects cross the vertical center line. This seems to be the trigger for the swap: if any object assigned to a top quadrant crosses the vertical center line, the two top objects swap their positions in the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record its color.\n    b.  Determine its minimal bounding box.\n    c.  Extract the 2x2 pixel pattern starting from the top-left corner of the bounding box (this will be the object's pattern).\n    d.  Calculate its center of mass (average row/column index).\n3.  **Determine Grid Center:** Find the central row and column indices of the input grid (e.g., `center_row = floor(height / 2)`, `center_col = floor(width / 2)`).\n4.  **Assign Quadrants:** Assign each object to one of four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) based on whether its center of mass row is less than `center_row` (Top) or greater/equal (Bottom), and its center of mass column is less than `center_col` (Left) or greater/equal (Right). Store the 2x2 pattern associated with each assigned quadrant.\n5.  **Check Swap Condition:** Examine the two objects assigned to the Top-Left and Top-Right quadrants. Check if the minimal bounding box of *either* of these objects crosses the vertical center line (i.e., the bounding box's minimum column index is less than `center_col` and its maximum column index is greater than or equal to `center_col`). Set a flag `swap_top_quadrants` to true if this condition is met, otherwise false.\n6.  **Construct Output:** Create a 4x4 grid initialized to white (0).\n    a.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Bottom-Left quadrant into the output grid at position (row=2, col=0).\n    b.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Bottom-Right quadrant into the output grid at position (row=2, col=2).\n    c.  If `swap_top_quadrants` is true:\n        i.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object originally assigned to the Top-Right quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=0).\n        ii. Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object originally assigned to the Top-Left quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=2).\n    d.  If `swap_top_quadrants` is false:\n        i.  Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Top-Left quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=0).\n        ii. Copy the 2x2 pattern of the object assigned to the Top-Right quadrant into the output grid at position (row=0, col=2).\n7.  **Return:** The final 4x4 output grid."
