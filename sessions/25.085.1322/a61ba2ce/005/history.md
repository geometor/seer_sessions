"""
Identifies four 3-pixel L-shaped objects in the input grid.
Extracts the 2x2 pattern defined by each object's bounding box.
Assigns each pattern to a quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) in a 4x4 output grid based on the object colors sorted numerically (1st color -> TL, 2nd -> TR, 3rd -> BL, 4th -> BR).
Determines the vertical center line of the input grid (between column index floor(width/2) and floor(width/2) + 1).
Checks if the bounding box of either the object assigned to TL or the object assigned to TR crosses this vertical center line (crossing means min_col <= floor(width/2) AND max_col >= floor(width/2) + 1).
If the crossing condition is met, swaps the patterns placed in the TL and TR quadrants of the output grid. Otherwise, places them according to the sorted color order.

**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because the logic for assigning the extracted 2x2 patterns to the output 4x4 grid quadrants was incorrect. It relied on sorting the objects by color and applying a conditional swap only to the top row based on whether the bounding box crossed the input grid's vertical midline. The analysis of both examples reveals that the assignment depends on the *spatial quadrant* of each object in the input grid, combined with a conditional swap of the top-left (TL) and top-right (TR) output quadrants.

The revised strategy is:
1.  Identify the four L-shaped objects and their 2x2 bounding box patterns in the input grid.
2.  Determine the geometric center of the input grid (defined by horizontal and vertical center lines).
3.  Classify each object based on which quadrant its bounding box center falls into (InTL, InTR, InBL, InBR).
4.  Check if the bounding box of *either* the object classified as InTL *or* the object classified as InTR crosses the input grid's vertical center line.
5.  Assemble the 4x4 output grid:
    *   The pattern from the object in InBL goes to the output BL quadrant (rows 2-3, cols 0-1).
    *   The pattern from the object in InBR goes to the output BR quadrant (rows 2-3, cols 2-3).
    *   If the midline crossing condition (step 4) is true, the pattern from InTR goes to output TL, and the pattern from InTL goes to output TR.
    *   If the midline crossing condition is false, the pattern from InTL goes to output TL, and the pattern from InTR goes to output TR.

**Metrics:**

Input grids are 13x13. Output grids are 4x4.
Center lines for input grids are between row 6/7 (coord 6.0) and col 6/7 (coord 6.0).
Vertical midline crossing check: `min_col <= 6` and `max_col >= 7`.

**Example 1:**
- Objects (Color, BBox, Center (r,c), Input Quadrant):
    - Azure (8): (1, 8, 2, 9), (1.5, 8.5), InTR
    - Blue (1): (3, 2, 4, 3), (3.5, 2.5), InTL

    - Yellow (4): (9, 4, 10, 5), (9.5, 4.5), InBL
- Midline Cross Check:
    - InTL (Blue): bbox=(3, 2, 4, 3). min_c=2, max_c=3. Does not cross (2<=6, 3<7).
    - InTR (Azure): bbox=(1, 8, 2, 9). min_c=8, max_c=9. Does not cross (8>6).
- Swap Condition: False.
- Output Mapping: InTL->OutTL, InTR->OutTR, InBL->OutBL, InBR->OutBR.

    - Blue (1): (7, 7, 8, 8), (7.5, 7.5), InBR (Note: Previous analysis put this at (7,8,8,9), re-running the code gave (7,7,8,8). Let's use the code output. Center=(7.5, 7.5) -> InBR)
    - Green (3): (9, 3, 10, 4), (9.5, 3.5), InBL

    - InTR (Azure): bbox=(1, 6, 2, 7). min_c=6, max_c=7. Does cross (6<=6, 7>=7).
- Swap Condition: True.
- Output Mapping: InTR->OutTL, InTL->OutTR, InBL->OutBL, InBR->OutBR.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the four distinct, non-background colored, 3-pixel L-shaped objects within the input grid. Each object occupies a 2x2 bounding box.
2.  For each identified L-shaped object, extract the 2x2 pattern of pixels corresponding to its bounding box.
3.  Determine the horizontal and vertical center lines dividing the input grid into four quadrants (Top-Left: InTL, Top-Right: InTR, Bottom-Left: InBL, Bottom-Right: InBR). The vertical center line lies between columns `floor((Width-1)/2)` and `floor((Width-1)/2) + 1`. The horizontal center line lies between rows `floor((Height-1)/2)` and `floor((Height-1)/2) + 1`.
4.  Calculate the center coordinates `(center_row, center_col)` for each object's bounding box. Assign each object to an input quadrant (InTL, InTR, InBL, InBR) based on whether its center coordinates are above/below the horizontal center line and left/right of the vertical center line.
5.  Check a swap condition: Determine if the bounding box of the object assigned to the InTL quadrant *or* the bounding box of the object assigned to the InTR quadrant crosses the vertical center line. A bounding box crosses if its minimum column index is less than or equal to `floor((Width-1)/2)` AND its maximum column index is greater than or equal to `floor((Width-1)/2) + 1`.
6.  Construct a 4x4 output grid.
7.  Place the 2x2 pattern extracted from the object assigned to the InBL quadrant into the bottom-left quadrant (rows 2-3, cols 0-1) of the output grid.
8.  Place the 2x2 pattern extracted from the object assigned to the InBR quadrant into the bottom-right quadrant (rows 2-3, cols 2-3) of the output grid.
9.  If the swap condition (from step 5) is true:
    *   Place the pattern from the InTR object into the top-left quadrant (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) of the output grid.
    *   Place the pattern from the InTL object into the top-right quadrant (rows 0-1, cols 2-3) of the output grid.
10. If the swap condition is false:
    *   Place the pattern from the InTL object into the top-left quadrant (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) of the output grid.
    *   Place the pattern from the InTR object into the top-right quadrant (rows 0-1, cols 2-3) of the output grid.
11. The resulting 4x4 grid is the final output.
