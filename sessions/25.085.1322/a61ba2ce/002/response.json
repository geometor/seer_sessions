            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying four objects, assigning them to quadrants, extracting a 2x2 pattern for each, and assembling a 4x4 output grid. A conditional swap logic for the top two quadrants based on crossing a center line was implemented.\n\nThe code failed on both examples:\n1.  **Example 1:** Produced an empty grid. This likely stems from an error in the `get_object_pattern` function, failing to extract the 2x2 patterns correctly, leading to missing entries in the `quadrant_patterns` dictionary and the function returning an empty grid.\n2.  **Example 2:** Produced a grid with the correct patterns but placed the top-left and top-right patterns incorrectly (swapped when they shouldn't have been, based on the code's logic, or vice-versa). This points to an incorrect implementation or definition of the \"swap condition\".\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine `get_object_pattern`:** The L-shaped objects consist of 3 pixels and always fit within a 2x2 bounding box. The pattern extraction should simply copy the 2x2 region defined by the object's bounding box from the input grid.\n2.  **Refine Swap Condition:** Re-evaluate the condition for swapping the top-left (TL) and top-right (TR) patterns. Analyze both examples to determine the precise rule. The initial analysis suggested a swap if *either* top object's bounding box crossed the vertical midline. This needs careful verification against the definition of \"crossing\" and the examples. The midline for width W is between columns `floor(W/2)-1` and `floor(W/2)` if W is even, and passes through column `floor(W/2)` if W is odd. A consistent definition is crucial. Let's define crossing the vertical center line (between index `floor(width/2)` and `floor(width/2)+1`) as `min_col <= floor(width/2)` AND `max_col >= floor(width/2) + 1`.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis Results:**\n\n*   **Quadrant Assignment Issue:** In Example 1, the analysis code assigned Object 3 (Red, BBox=(5, 7, 6, 8)) to the Top-Right (TR) quadrant based on its Center of Mass (COM) (5.67, 7.67). The center row index is 6. Since 5.67 < 6, it should be Top. The center col index is 6. Since 7.67 > 6, it should be Right. So TR is correct based on COM relative to the center indices (6, 6). However, visually and in the expected output, Red appears in the Bottom-Right (BR) position. Similarly, Object 4 (Yellow, BBox=(9, 4, 10, 5), COM=(9.67, 4.33)) is assigned BL, which matches the output. Object 1 (Azure, BBox=(1, 8, 2, 9), COM=(1.33, 8.67)) is assigned TR, matching the output. Object 2 (Blue, BBox=(3, 2, 4, 3), COM=(3.33, 2.33)) is assigned TL, matching the output.\n    *   *Correction:* The analysis code incorrectly assigned Object 3 (Red) to TR. Let's re-check COM (5.67, 7.67) vs center indices (6, 6). Row 5.67 is *less* than 6, so it's Top. Column 7.67 is *greater* than 6, so it's Right. TR is correct based on COM relative to center indices. Why does the expected output place Red in BR?\n    *   Let's re-examine the definition of quadrants based on the grid's *center lines*, not just the center index. The grid center is conceptually between rows 6 & 7 and columns 6 & 7.\n        *   COM (r, c) -> Quadrant:\n            *   r < height/2, c < width/2 -> TL\n            *   r < height/2, c >= width/2 -> TR\n            *   r >= height/2, c < width/2 -> BL\n            *   r >= height/2, c >= width/2 -> BR\n        *   For 13x13, height/2 = 6.5, width/2 = 6.5.\n        *   Ex 1, Obj 1 (Azure): COM (1.33, 8.67) -> r < 6.5 (T), c >= 6.5 (R) -> TR. Correct.\n        *   Ex 1, Obj 2 (Blue): COM (3.33, 2.33) -> r < 6.5 (T), c < 6.5 (L) -> TL. Correct.\n        *   Ex 1, Obj 3 (Red): COM (5.67, 7.67) -> r < 6.5 (T), c >= 6.5 (R) -> TR. **Incorrect.** Expected BR.\n        *   Ex 1, Obj 4 (Yellow): COM (9.67, 4.33) -> r >= 6.5 (B), c < 6.5 (L) -> BL. Correct.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The assignment based on COM relative to the grid center doesn't work for all objects. There must be another assignment rule. Perhaps it's based on the bounding box position relative to the center?\n        *   Ex 1, Obj 3 (Red): BBox (5, 7, 6, 8). min_r=5 (<6.5), max_r=6 (<6.5). min_c=7 (>=6.5), max_c=8 (>=6.5). BBox is entirely in TR quadrant based on boundaries. Still doesn't match BR output.\n        *   Could the output positions be fixed TL, TR, BL, BR corresponding to objects sorted by some property? E.g., sorted by color index? Ex 1: Blue (1), Red (2), Yellow (4), Azure (8). TL=1, BR=2, BL=4, TR=8. This matches the output grid's quadrants!\n        *   Let's check Ex 2: Green (3), Red (2), Blue (1), Azure (8). Sorted: Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Azure (8). Output Grid: TR=2, TL=8, BL=3, BR=1. This mapping is: TL -> Azure(8), TR -> Red(2), BL -> Green(3), BR -> Blue(1). This matches the expected output if we assume the swap occurred.\n    *   **Revised Quadrant Logic:** The quadrant in the output grid (TL, TR, BL, BR) corresponds to the object's color sorted ascendingly (1st color -> TL, 2nd -> TR, 3rd -> BL, 4th -> BR). This is a significant change.\n\n*   **Swap Condition:** The revised crossing logic (`min_c <= center_col_idx` and `max_c >= center_col_idx + 1`) correctly predicts the swap:\n    *   Example 1: No object crosses. Calculated Swap = False. Expected Output Swap = False. Matches.\n    *   Example 2: TR object (Azure, color 8) crosses. Calculated Swap = True. Expected Output Swap = True. Matches.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The swap condition based on crossing the vertical center line (defined as between index `floor(W/2)` and `floor(W/2)+1`) seems correct, BUT it applies after assigning objects based on sorted color index.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Check if the bounding box `(min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)` of the object assigned to TL *or* the object assigned to TR crosses this vertical center line. Crossing occurs if `min_c <= floor(width/2)` AND `max_c >= floor(width/2) + 1`.\n7.  Construct the 4x4 output grid. Place the BL pattern in the 2x2 bottom-left section and the BR pattern in the 2x2 bottom-right section.\n8.  If the crossing condition (Step 6) is met, place the TR pattern in the 2x2 top-left section and the TL pattern in the 2x2 top-right section (swap).\n9.  Otherwise (if the crossing condition is not met), place the TL pattern in the 2x2 top-left section and the TR pattern in the 2x2 top-right section (no swap)."
