task_description: Assemble a 4x4 grid from four 2x2 patterns derived from L-shaped objects in the input grid, based on their spatial location and a conditional swap rule.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - contains_background: True (color 0)
    - contains_objects: True
    - object_count: 4
    - grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 13x13)

objects:
  - type: L-shape
    properties:
      - pixel_count: 3
      - shape: Contiguous L-shape (within a 2x2 bounding box)
      - color: Non-background (1-9)
      - unique_colors: Yes, each of the 4 objects has a distinct color in the examples.
    identification:
      - Find connected components of non-background pixels.
      - Filter components with exactly 3 pixels and a 2x2 bounding box.

derived_features:
  - input_grid_center:
      - horizontal_line: Between row floor((H-1)/2) and row floor((H-1)/2) + 1
      - vertical_line: Between col floor((W-1)/2) and col floor((W-1)/2) + 1
  - object_pattern: The 2x2 grid snippet defined by the object's bounding box.
  - object_input_quadrant: (InTL, InTR, InBL, InBR) based on the object's bounding box center relative to the input grid center lines.
  - swap_condition: Boolean flag, true if the bounding box of the object in InTL OR the object in InTR crosses the input grid's vertical center line. Crossing defined as (min_col <= floor((W-1)/2) AND max_col >= floor((W-1)/2) + 1).

output_grid:
  properties:
    - dimensions: 4x4
    - construction: Assembled from the 2x2 object patterns.
  quadrant_mapping:
    - Output BL (rows 2-3, cols 0-1): Pattern from object in InBL.
    - Output BR (rows 2-3, cols 2-3): Pattern from object in InBR.
    - IF swap_condition is TRUE:
        - Output TL (rows 0-1, cols 0-1): Pattern from object in InTR.
        - Output TR (rows 0-1, cols 2-3): Pattern from object in InTL.
    - ELSE (swap_condition is FALSE):
        - Output TL (rows 0-1, cols 0-1): Pattern from object in InTL.
        - Output TR (rows 0-1, cols 2-3): Pattern from object in InTR.
