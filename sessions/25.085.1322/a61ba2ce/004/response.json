            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because the logic for assigning the extracted 2x2 patterns to the output 4x4 grid quadrants was incorrect. It relied on sorting the objects by color and applying a conditional swap only to the top row based on whether the bounding box crossed the input grid's vertical midline. The analysis of both examples reveals that the assignment depends on the *spatial quadrant* of each object in the input grid, combined with a conditional swap of the top-left (TL) and top-right (TR) output quadrants.\n\nThe revised strategy is:\n1.  Identify the four L-shaped objects and their 2x2 bounding box patterns in the input grid.\n2.  Determine the geometric center of the input grid (defined by horizontal and vertical center lines).\n3.  Classify each object based on which quadrant its bounding box center falls into (InTL, InTR, InBL, InBR).\n4.  Check if the bounding box of *either* the object classified as InTL *or* the object classified as InTR crosses the input grid's vertical center line.\n5.  Assemble the 4x4 output grid:\n    *   The pattern from the object in InBL goes to the output BL quadrant (rows 2-3, cols 0-1).\n    *   The pattern from the object in InBR goes to the output BR quadrant (rows 2-3, cols 2-3).\n    *   If the midline crossing condition (step 4) is true, the pattern from InTR goes to output TL, and the pattern from InTL goes to output TR.\n    *   If the midline crossing condition is false, the pattern from InTL goes to output TL, and the pattern from InTR goes to output TR.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nInput grids are 13x13. Output grids are 4x4.\nCenter lines for input grids are between row 6/7 (coord 6.0) and col 6/7 (coord 6.0).\nVertical midline crossing check: `min_col <= 6` and `max_col >= 7`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Objects (Color, BBox, Center (r,c), Input Quadrant):\n    - Azure (8): (1, 8, 2, 9), (1.5, 8.5), InTR\n    - Blue (1): (3, 2, 4, 3), (3.5, 2.5), InTL\n    - Red (2): (5, 7, 6, 8), (5.5, 7.5), InBR\n    - Yellow (4): (9, 4, 10, 5), (9.5, 4.5), InBL\n- Midline Cross Check:\n    - InTL (Blue): bbox=(3, 2, 4, 3). min_c=2, max_c=3.

Let's use the code output. Center=(7.5, 7.5) -> InBR)\n    - Green (3): (9, 3, 10, 4), (9.5, 3.5), InBL\n- Midline Cross Check:\n    - InTL (Red): bbox=(3, 1, 4, 2). min_c=1, max_c=2.
