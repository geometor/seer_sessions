Let's call this the \"trigger pixel\".\n    *   The output grid retains the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.\n    *   The trigger pixel's color and position in the input determine the color and location of a solid rectangle drawn in the output grid.\n    *   The position of the trigger pixel relative to the center of the grid determines which corner the rectangle is anchored to and expands from/towards.\n    *   The rectangle in the output always includes the original position of the trigger pixel and is filled with the trigger pixel's color.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Documentation:**\n    "
