Other colors in that row remain unchanged.\n5.  **Identifying the Target Color:** The color to be replaced seems to be determined by analyzing the first row of the input. Specifically, it appears to be the color that occurs most frequently in the first row, *excluding* the dominant background color found in the rest of the input grid (rows 1 onwards).\n6.  **Background Color:** The input grids (rows 1 downwards) often feature a dominant color (white-0 in ex1, red-2 in ex2, yellow-4 in ex3, maroon-9 in ex4). This color is ignored when determining the target color for replacement in the first row.\n7.  **Replacement Color:** The replacement color is consistently magenta (6).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Copy the second row (row index 1) from the input grid directly to the second row (row index 1) of the output grid.\n4.  Identify the 'background color' by finding the most frequent color value present in the input grid, considering only rows from index 1 down to the last row.\n5.  Examine the first row (row index 0) of the input grid. Count the occurrences of each color present in this row.\n6.  Determine the 'target color' which is the color that appears most frequently in the first input row, *but* is not the 'background color' identified in step 4.\n7.  Generate the third row (row index 2) of the output grid by taking the first row (row index 0) of the input grid and replacing every instance of the 'target color' with the color magenta (value 6). Keep all other colors in the row unchanged."
