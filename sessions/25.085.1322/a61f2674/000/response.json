These segments vary in length and position.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation identifies specific vertical gray segments based on their length and recolors them in the output grid.\n    *   The pixels corresponding to the *longest* contiguous vertical segment of gray pixels in the input are colored blue (1) in the output.\n    *   The pixels corresponding to the *shortest* contiguous vertical segment of gray pixels in the input are colored red (2) in the output.\n    *   All other gray pixels from the input become white (0) in the output.\n    *   If there are multiple segments tied for the longest length, all are colored blue.\n    *   If there are multiple segments tied for the shortest length, all are colored red.\n5.  **Background**: White pixels in the input remain white in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n3.  Within each column, identify all contiguous vertical segments composed solely of gray (5) pixels. Record the starting row, ending row, column index, and length (number of pixels) for each segment found.\n4.  After scanning all columns, gather the list of all identified gray vertical segments and their lengths.\n5.  If no gray segments were found, the process is complete, and the initial white output grid is the result.\n6.  Determine the maximum length among all found segments.\n7.  Determine the minimum length among all found segments.\n8.  Iterate through the list of identified segments again.\n9.  For each segment whose length equals the maximum length, change the color of the corresponding pixels (identified by column index, start row, and end row) in the output grid to blue (1).\n10. For each segment whose length equals the minimum length, change the color of the corresponding pixels in the output grid to red (2). (Note: If a segment happens to be both the longest and shortest, e.g., if all segments have the same length, the blue color applied in the previous step should likely take precedence, or the specific rule for ties needs clarification. Based on the examples, they seem mutually exclusive, so apply red only if it wasn't already colored blue). *Correction based on re-thinking*: The instructions imply applying both rules independently. A pixel could potentially be targeted by both blue and red if a segment is both longest and shortest. Let's assume the last applied color wins, or specify precedence. Let's refine: Apply blue for longest, then apply red for shortest. If a pixel is part of both the longest and shortest segment (only possible if all segments are the same length), it will end up red. *Alternative refinement*: Apply blue for longest. Apply red for shortest *only if the pixel is not already blue*. Let's stick to the simpler \"Apply blue for longest, apply red for shortest\" for now, assuming red might overwrite blue in the rare tie case, as it worked conceptually for the examples where they were distinct.\n11. The final state of the output grid is the result."
