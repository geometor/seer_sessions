**Perception**

1.  **Grid Transformation:** The core task is transforming a smaller input grid (always 3x3 in the examples) into a larger output grid (always 9x9).
2.  **Scaling:** The output grid's dimensions are exactly three times the input grid's dimensions (3x height, 3x width).
3.  **Tiling/Subgrids:** The output grid can be conceptually divided into a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 subgrids, each the size of the original input grid.
4.  **Copying:** The transformation involves copying the entire input grid pattern into one or more of these 3x3 subgrids in the output.
5.  **Placement Logic:** The key challenge is determining *which* subgrids in the output receive a copy of the input grid. This placement is not fixed but depends on properties of the input grid itself.
6.  **Conditional Placement:** The placement seems to be governed by a set of conditional rules based on analyzing the pixel values within the input grid:
    *   The number of unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.
    *   The sum of all pixel values in the input grid (specifically its parity - even or odd).
    *   Depending on the unique color count and sum parity, the placement is determined by the locations of either the minimum non-zero pixel value(s), the maximum pixel value(s), or the second smallest non-zero pixel value(s) within the input grid.
7.  **Mapping:** There's a direct mapping between the row/column index (r, c) of a determining pixel in the 3x3 input grid and the row/column index (r, c) of the 3x3 subgrid in the 9x9 output grid where a copy should be placed.
8.  **Background:** Subgrids in the output that do not receive a copy of the input remain filled with the background color (white, 0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize a new 9x9 grid (the output grid) filled entirely with the background color white (0).
2.  Analyze the input 3x3 grid:
    a.  Calculate the sum of all its pixel values. Note whether the sum is even or odd.
    b.  Identify all unique non-zero pixel values (colors) present. Count how many unique non-zero colors there are.
3.  Determine the "target" pixel value based on the analysis in step 2:
    a.  If the count of unique non-zero colors is 2 or less:
        i.  If the sum is even, the target value is the maximum pixel value found in the input grid.
        ii. If the sum is odd, the target value is the minimum non-zero pixel value found in the input grid.
    b.  If the count of unique non-zero colors is exactly 3:
        i.  If the sum is even, the target value is the minimum non-zero pixel value found in the input grid.
        ii. If the sum is odd, the target value is the maximum pixel value found in the input grid.
    c.  If the count of unique non-zero colors is 4 or more:
        i.  The target value is the second smallest non-zero pixel value found in the input grid.
4.  Identify all positions (row `r`, column `c`) within the input 3x3 grid where the pixel value matches the determined target value.
5.  For each identified position (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Calculate the top-left starting coordinates in the output grid: `output_row = r * 3`, `output_col = c * 3`.
    b.  Copy the entire 3x3 input grid pattern into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at (`output_row`, `output_col`). Overwrite any existing background color in that 3x3 subgrid area.
6.  The resulting 9x9 grid is the final output.
