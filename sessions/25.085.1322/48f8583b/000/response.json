This placement is not fixed but depends on properties of the input grid itself.\n6.  **Conditional Placement:** The placement seems to be governed by a set of conditional rules based on analyzing the pixel values within the input grid:\n    *   The number of unique non-zero colors present in the input grid.\n    *   The sum of all pixel values in the input grid (specifically its parity - even or odd).\n    *   Depending on the unique color count and sum parity, the placement is determined by the locations of either the minimum non-zero pixel value(s), the maximum pixel value(s), or the second smallest non-zero pixel value(s) within the input grid.\n7.  **Mapping:** There's a direct mapping between the row/column index (r, c) of a determining pixel in the 3x3 input grid and the row/column index (r, c) of the 3x3 subgrid in the 9x9 output grid where a copy should be placed.\n8.  **Background:** Subgrids in the output that do not receive a copy of the input remain filled with the background color (white, 0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
