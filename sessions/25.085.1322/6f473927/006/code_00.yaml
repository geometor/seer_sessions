task_description: Create an output grid by combining a modified version of the input grid and the original input grid.
input_grid:
  properties:
    - grid_dimensions: variable height (H) and width (W)
    - pixel_colors: Primarily white (0) and red (2), but other colors might appear and should be preserved unless specified.
transformation:
  actions:
    - step: 1
      action: Create a copy of the input grid.
      name: modified_grid
    - step: 2
      action: Identify all pixels with the color red (2) in the `modified_grid`.
      target: red_pixels
    - step: 3
      action: Change the color of the identified `red_pixels` to azure (8) in the `modified_grid`.
    - step: 4
      action: Create the output grid by horizontally concatenating the `modified_grid` (on the left) and the original `input_grid` (on the right).
output_grid:
  properties:
    - grid_dimensions: height H, width 2*W
    - structure: Composed of two parts placed side-by-side horizontally.
      - left_part: The `modified_grid` (input with red changed to azure).
      - right_part: The original `input_grid`.
    - pixel_colors: Contains colors from the input grid, plus azure (8) replacing red (2) in the left part. Red (2) pixels remain in the right part.
