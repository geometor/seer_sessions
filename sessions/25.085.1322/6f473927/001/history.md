*   **Perception**:
    *   The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid.
    *   The output grid always has the same height as the input grid but double the width.
    *   The output grid appears to be composed of two parts placed side-by-side horizontally.
    *   The right half of the output grid is always an exact copy of the input grid.
    *   The left half of the output grid seems derived from the input grid. By comparing the input grid with the left half of the output grid, it's observed that:
        *   All red (2) pixels in the input grid correspond to azure (8) pixels in the left half of the output grid, maintaining their positions.
        *   All white (0) pixels in the input grid correspond to white (0) pixels in the left half of the output grid, maintaining their positions.
    *   The transformation rule involves creating a modified copy of the input grid where red pixels are changed to azure, and then concatenating this modified grid with the original input grid horizontally.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_description: Concatenate a modified version of the input grid with the original input grid.
    grid_properties:
      - relationship: input_output_dimensions
        input_height: H
        input_width: W
        output_height: H
        output_width: 2 * W
      - relationship: output_composition
        left_half: modified_input
        right_half: original_input
        concatenation: horizontal
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        color_map: {0: white, 2: red, 8: azure}
    transformations:
      - type: color_replacement
        input_color: red (2)
        output_color: azure (8)
        scope: applied to create the left half (modified_input)
      - type: copy
        scope: applied to create the right half (original_input)
      - type: concatenation
        direction: horizontal
        elements: [modified_input, original_input]
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid (let's call it `modified_grid`).
    2.  Iterate through each pixel in the `modified_grid`.
    3.  If a pixel's color is red (2), change its color to azure (8).
    4.  Create the output grid by placing the `modified_grid` on the left and the original input grid on the right, side-by-side (horizontal concatenation). The dimensions of the output grid will be the same height as the input grid and double its width.
