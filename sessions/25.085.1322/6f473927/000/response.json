By comparing the input grid with the left half of the output grid, it's observed that:\n        *   All red (2) pixels in the input grid correspond to azure (8) pixels in the left half of the output grid, maintaining their positions.\n        *   All white (0) pixels in the input grid correspond to white (0) pixels in the left half of the output grid, maintaining their positions.\n    *   The transformation rule involves creating a modified copy of the input grid where red pixels are changed to azure, and then concatenating this modified grid with the original input grid horizontally.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
