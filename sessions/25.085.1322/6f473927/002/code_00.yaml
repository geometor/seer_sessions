task_description: Concatenate a modified version of the input grid with the original input grid.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers (colors).
  - Output grid height is the same as input grid height.
  - Output grid width is double the input grid width.
objects:
  - Input Grid: The initial grid provided.
  - Modified Grid: A temporary grid created by copying the Input Grid and changing specific colors.
  - Output Grid: The final grid, composed of two parts.
colors:
  - Red (2): The color targeted for replacement in the modification step.
  - Azure (8): The color used to replace Red pixels.
  - Other colors (0, 1, 3-7, 9): These are preserved in their original positions during modification and concatenation.
actions:
  - Copy: Create an exact duplicate of the Input Grid to serve as the basis for the Modified Grid.
  - Replace Color: Identify all pixels with Red (2) color in the copied grid. Change the color of these specific pixels to Azure (8).
  - Concatenate Horizontally: Arrange the Modified Grid to the left and the original Input Grid to the right, joining them side-by-side to form the Output Grid.
composition:
  - The Output Grid is composed horizontally: `Output = [Modified Grid | Input Grid]`
