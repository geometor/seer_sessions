## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core elements of the transformation: duplicating the grid, changing red (2) to azure (8) in the duplicate, and concatenating the grids horizontally. However, it incorrectly placed the modified grid on the left and the original grid on the right. The provided examples consistently show the expected output having the *original* input grid on the left half and the *modified* (red to azure) grid on the right half. The strategy is to reverse the order of concatenation in the natural language program and the subsequent code.

## Metrics

Based on visual inspection and comparison of the input, expected output, and the previously generated output across all examples:

1.  **Input Grid:** Varies in size (3x3, 8x6, 3x3, 10x5). Contains primarily white (0) and red (2) pixels.
2.  **Expected Output Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: Same height as the input, double the width.
    *   Structure: Consists of two halves placed side-by-side horizontally.
    *   Left Half: Identical to the original input grid.
    *   Right Half: Identical to the original input grid, except all red (2) pixels are replaced with azure (8) pixels.
    *   Colors: Contains white (0), red (2), and azure (8).
3.  **Transformed Output Grid (Previous Code):**
    *   Dimensions: Correct (same height, double width).
    *   Structure: Consists of two halves placed side-by-side horizontally.
    *   Left Half: Corresponds to the input grid with red (2) replaced by azure (8). (Incorrect placement)
    *   Right Half: Corresponds to the original input grid. (Incorrect placement)
    *   Colors: Contains white (0), red (2), and azure (8). (Correct palette)

The previous code performed the correct modification (2 -> 8) but failed because the concatenation order was reversed (`modified | original` instead of `original | modified`).

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Concatenate the original input grid with a modified version of itself.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - output_height: Same as input_height.
  - output_width: Double the input_width.
objects:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Create a copy of the input grid.
    name: modified_grid
  - step: 2
    action: Identify all pixels in the `modified_grid` with the color red (value 2).
    target: pixels with value 2 in `modified_grid`
  - step: 3
    action: Change the color of the identified pixels to azure (value 8).
    target: pixels identified in step 2
    result: `modified_grid` now has azure (8) where red (2) was.
  - step: 4
    action: Horizontally concatenate the original `input_grid` and the `modified_grid`.
    order: `input_grid` on the left, `modified_grid` on the right.
    result: final `output_grid`.
color_mapping:
  - color_name: red
    value: 2
  - color_name: azure
    value: 8
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Create a duplicate of the input grid, called `modified_grid`.
3.  Iterate through each pixel in the `modified_grid`. If a pixel's color is red (value 2), change its color to azure (value 8).
4.  Create the output grid by horizontally concatenating the original `input_grid` on the left and the `modified_grid` (with red changed to azure) on the right.
5.  Return the final output grid.
