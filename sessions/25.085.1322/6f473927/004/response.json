            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core elements of the transformation: duplicating the grid, changing red (2) to azure (8) in the duplicate, and concatenating the grids horizontally. However, it incorrectly placed the modified grid on the left and the original grid on the right. The provided examples consistently show the expected output having the *original* input grid on the left half and the *modified* (red to azure) grid on the right half. The strategy is to reverse the order of concatenation in the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on visual inspection and comparison of the input, expected output, and the previously generated output across all examples:\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Varies in size (3x3, 8x6, 3x3, 10x5). Contains primarily white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n2.  **Expected Output Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: Same height as the input, double the width.\n    *   Structure: Consists of two halves placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    *   Left Half: Identical to the original input grid.\n    *   Right Half: Identical to the original input grid, except all red (2) pixels are replaced with azure (8) pixels.\n    *   Colors: Contains white (0), red (2), and azure (8).\n3.  **Transformed Output Grid (Previous Code):**\n    *   Dimensions: Correct (same height, double width).\n    *   Structure: Consists of two halves placed side-by-side horizontally.\n    *   Left Half: Corresponds to the input grid with red (2) replaced by azure (8). (Incorrect placement)\n    *   Right Half: Corresponds to the original input grid. (Incorrect placement)\n    *   Colors: Contains white (0), red (2), and azure (8). (Correct palette)\n\nThe previous code performed the correct modification (2 -> 8) but failed because the concatenation order was reversed (`modified | original` instead of `original | modified`).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
