task_description: Recolor vertical gray segments based on discovery order during scanning.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - grid_size: 9x9 (in examples)

objects:
  - type: vertical_segment
    input_color: 5 (gray)
    output_colors: [1, 2, 3, 4] # blue, red, green, yellow
    properties:
      - column_index: The column the segment occupies.
      - pixels: List of coordinates occupied by the segment's gray pixels.
    identification: Contiguous block of gray pixels within a single column.

transformation:
  - name: identify_segments
    description: Find all unique columns containing gray pixels.
  - name: determine_assignment_order
    description: Scan the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right to find the first occurrence (topmost pixel) of gray in each unique column. The order of finding these first occurrences determines the assignment order.
  - name: assign_colors
    description: Assign colors 1, 2, 3, 4 sequentially based on the determined order. The first column found gets color 1, the second gets color 2, etc.
  - name: recolor_grid
    description: Create the output grid by replacing all gray pixels in a given column with the color assigned to that column. White pixels remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - Each distinct input vertical gray segment (identified by its column) maps to exactly one output color.
  - The output color (1, 2, 3, or 4) is determined by the rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) in which the segment's column is first encountered during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid.
