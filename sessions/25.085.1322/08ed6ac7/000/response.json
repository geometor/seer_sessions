These segments vary in height and vertical position but are always strictly vertical (contained within a single column).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids retain the same white background. The locations previously occupied by gray pixels are now filled with other colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4). Each distinct vertical segment from the input is entirely replaced by a single new color in the output.\n3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying each distinct vertical gray segment based on its column index and assigning it a unique color from the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4.\n4.  **Color Assignment Logic**: The specific color assigned to a segment appears to depend on the order in which the segment is \"discovered\" when scanning the grid. Scanning top-to-bottom, then left-to-right within each row, the first column containing gray gets color 1, the *next* column encountered containing gray gets color 2, and so on, cycling through colors 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Increment the `color counter` by 1. (If the counter exceeds 4, it likely implies more than 4 segments, though the examples only show 4. Let's assume for now it cycles or stops based on the number of segments). Based on the examples, we use colors 1 through N, where N is the number of distinct gray columns.\n6.  Create a new output grid initially identical to the input grid.\n7.  Iterate through the input grid's pixels again (or iterate through the identified gray pixels). For each pixel at `(row, column)`:\n    a.  If the input pixel color is gray (5):\n        i.  Retrieve the assigned color for this `column` from `column_color_map`.\n        ii. Set the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the output grid to this retrieved color.\n8.  Return the modified output grid."
