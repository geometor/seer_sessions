Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

### Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids consist of a white background (color 0) and several vertical segments composed of gray pixels (color 5). These segments vary in height and vertical position but are always strictly vertical (contained within a single column).
2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids retain the same white background. The locations previously occupied by gray pixels are now filled with other colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), or yellow (4). Each distinct vertical segment from the input is entirely replaced by a single new color in the output.
3.  **Transformation**: The core transformation involves identifying each distinct vertical gray segment based on its column index and assigning it a unique color from the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4.
4.  **Color Assignment Logic**: The specific color assigned to a segment appears to depend on the order in which the segment is "discovered" when scanning the grid. Scanning top-to-bottom, then left-to-right within each row, the first column containing gray gets color 1, the *next* column encountered containing gray gets color 2, and so on, cycling through colors 1, 2, 3, 4.

### Facts


```yaml
task_description: Recolor vertical gray segments based on discovery order during scanning.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - grid_size: 9x9 (in examples)

objects:
  - type: vertical_segment
    input_color: 5 (gray)
    output_colors: [1, 2, 3, 4] # blue, red, green, yellow
    properties:
      - column_index: The column the segment occupies.
      - pixels: List of coordinates occupied by the segment's gray pixels.
    identification: Contiguous block of gray pixels within a single column.

transformation:
  - name: identify_segments
    description: Find all unique columns containing gray pixels.
  - name: determine_assignment_order
    description: Scan the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right to find the first occurrence (topmost pixel) of gray in each unique column. The order of finding these first occurrences determines the assignment order.
  - name: assign_colors
    description: Assign colors 1, 2, 3, 4 sequentially based on the determined order. The first column found gets color 1, the second gets color 2, etc.
  - name: recolor_grid
    description: Create the output grid by replacing all gray pixels in a given column with the color assigned to that column. White pixels remain unchanged.

relationships:
  - Each distinct input vertical gray segment (identified by its column) maps to exactly one output color.
  - The output color (1, 2, 3, or 4) is determined by the rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) in which the segment's column is first encountered during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty map to store the assigned color for each column index (let's call it `column_color_map`).
2.  Initialize a color counter to 1.
3.  Iterate through the input grid's rows from top (row 0) to bottom.
4.  Within each row, iterate through the columns from left (column 0) to right.
5.  For each pixel at `(row, column)`:
    a.  Check if the pixel's color is gray (5).
    b.  If it is gray, check if its `column` index is already a key in `column_color_map`.
    c.  If the `column` index is *not* in `column_color_map`:
        i.  Add an entry to `column_color_map` mapping the current `column` index to the current value of the `color counter`.
        ii. Increment the `color counter` by 1. (If the counter exceeds 4, it likely implies more than 4 segments, though the examples only show 4. Let's assume for now it cycles or stops based on the number of segments). Based on the examples, we use colors 1 through N, where N is the number of distinct gray columns.
6.  Create a new output grid initially identical to the input grid.
7.  Iterate through the input grid's pixels again (or iterate through the identified gray pixels). For each pixel at `(row, column)`:
    a.  If the input pixel color is gray (5):
        i.  Retrieve the assigned color for this `column` from `column_color_map`.
        ii. Set the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the output grid to this retrieved color.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
