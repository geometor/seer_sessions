The line always starts at the leftmost column (column 0).\n    *   The output grids retain the original red line and the grid dimensions.\n    *   Two new shapes are added to the output grid:\n        *   A green shape (color 3) appears above the red line. It resembles a right-angled triangle with its right angle at the top-left corner relative to the shape itself. Its base sits one row above the red line, and it extends upwards and rightwards. The width of the green shape increases by one pixel for each row further up from the red line.\n        *   A blue shape (color 1) appears below the red line. It resembles a right-angled triangle with its right angle at the bottom-left corner relative to the shape itself. Its top sits one row below the red line, and it extends downwards and leftwards (though it always starts at column 0). The width of the blue shape decreases by one pixel for each row further down from the red line.\n    *   The sizes and specific positions of the green and blue shapes are determined by the position and length of the original red line.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
