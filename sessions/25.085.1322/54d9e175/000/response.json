Identify all gray pixels (color 5). These form horizontal and vertical separators.\n    2.  Treat horizontal gray lines as complete dividers, creating independent horizontal regions.\n    3.  Within each horizontal region (or the entire grid if no horizontal separators exist):\n        *   Identify the vertical sections based on the vertical gray lines (and grid boundaries).\n        *   For each vertical section:\n            *   Find the single pixel that is not white (0) and not gray (5). Let its color be `C_in`.\n            *   Calculate the target fill color `C_out = C_in + 5`.\n            *   In the output grid, fill all cells within this vertical section (and the current horizontal region) that are not gray separators with the color `C_out`.\n    4.  Copy all gray pixels from the input to the output in their original positions.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Within each horizontal region, iterate through each vertical section defined by consecutive vertical boundary indices (col_start, col_end).\n    7.
