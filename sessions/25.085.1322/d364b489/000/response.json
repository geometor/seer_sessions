            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples).\n2.  **Input Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) background pixels and blue (1) pixels. The blue pixels appear as isolated single points.\n3.  **Output Colors:** The output grids contain the original blue (1) pixels at their original locations. Additionally, new colors appear around these blue pixels: red (2), orange (7), magenta (6), and azure (8). The background remains white (0).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems centered around the blue pixels found in the input. Each blue pixel acts as a \"source\" that colors its immediate orthogonal (up, down, left, right) neighbors in the output grid, provided those neighbors are within the grid boundaries.\n5.  **Color Mapping:** There's a consistent mapping based on the relative position to the blue pixel:\n    *   The pixel *above* the blue pixel becomes red (2).\n    *   The pixel *below* the blue pixel becomes azure (8).\n    *   The pixel *to the left* of the blue pixel becomes orange (7).\n    *   The pixel *to the right* of the blue pixel becomes magenta (6).\n6.  **Boundary Conditions:** If a potential neighbor position is outside the grid (e.g., trying to color the cell above a blue pixel in the top row), no coloring occurs for that specific direction.\n7.  **Overlapping:** In the given examples, the blue pixels are sufficiently far apart that the colored neighborhoods do not overlap. The rule for overlapping colored pixels is not explicitly demonstrated but is not needed for these examples. The original blue pixels are preserved in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
