The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects. These objects are rectangular blocks composed of a single non-white color (red, blue, yellow in the examples).\n3.  **Background:** The background color is white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying these colored objects, determining their properties (color, shape, position), removing them from their original positions (leaving white pixels), and rearranging them into a specific configuration in the output grid.\n5.  **Output Configuration:** In the output grid, the objects are placed horizontally adjacent to each other, starting from the left edge (column 0). They form a single composite rectangular shape.\n6.  **Object Ordering:** The horizontal order of the objects in the output assembly corresponds to their relative horizontal position in the input grid, sorted from left to right based on their leftmost column index.\n7.  **Vertical Placement:** The vertical position of the assembled object strip in the output grid depends on the vertical extent of the objects in the input grid and the overall height of the grid. Specifically, the top row of the output strip seems determined by the maximum row index occupied by any object in the input (`max_obj_row`), the common height of the objects (`obj_h`), and potentially the total grid height (`H_grid`). The rule appears to be: calculate a base `start_row = max_obj_row - obj_h + 1`; if `H_grid <= 5`, decrement `start_row` by 1.\n8.  **Preservation:** The color and shape (height and width) of each individual object are preserved during the transformation.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
