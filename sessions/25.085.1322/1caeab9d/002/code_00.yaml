task_context:
  - The input grid contains multiple distinct, contiguous, non-white objects scattered across the grid.
  - The background color is white (0).
  - All non-white objects in a given input grid share the same height.

object_properties:
  - Objects are defined by their color, shape (pixels), bounding box (min/max row/col), height, and width.
  - The key properties used in the transformation are: color, pixels relative to the object's top-left corner, height, original minimum row, original maximum row, and original minimum column.

transformation_actions:
  - Identify all non-white objects in the input grid.
  - Determine the common height (`obj_h`) of these objects.
  - Determine the maximum row index (`max_obj_row`) occupied by any pixel of any object in the input grid.
  - Calculate a target starting row (`output_start_row`) for the output grid using the formula: `base_start_row = max_obj_row - obj_h + 1`.
  - If the input grid height is 5 or less, adjust the target row: `output_start_row = base_start_row - 1`. Otherwise, `output_start_row = base_start_row`. Ensure `output_start_row` is not negative.
  - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
  - For each identified object:
    - Preserve its color and shape (relative pixel positions).
    - Place the object in the output grid such that its top-left corner is positioned at `(output_start_row, obj['min_col'])`, where `obj['min_col']` is the object's original minimum column index from the input grid.

inconsistencies_resolved:
  - The previous assumption that objects were placed adjacently starting from column 0 was incorrect.
  - The correct behavior is to preserve the original horizontal position (`min_col`) of each object while aligning their top edges vertically to the calculated `output_start_row`.

verified_logic:
  - The `find_objects` function correctly identifies objects.
  - The calculation for `output_start_row` based on `max_obj_row`, `obj_h`, and grid height is correct across all examples.
  - Objects maintain their shape and color.
