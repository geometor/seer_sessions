"""
Identifies all distinct, contiguous, non-white objects in the input grid.
Determines the common height (obj_h) of these objects and the maximum row index (max_obj_row) they occupy.
Calculates a target starting row (output_start_row) for vertical alignment: base_start_row = max_obj_row - obj_h + 1. If the grid height is 5 or less, decrement the base_start_row by 1. Ensures the start row is non-negative.
Creates an output grid of the same dimensions, filled with the background color (white, 0).
Places each identified object into the output grid, preserving its color and shape. The object's top edge is aligned with the calculated output_start_row, and its horizontal position (left edge) is preserved from its original position (min_col) in the input grid.
