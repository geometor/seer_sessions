Each non-white pixel in the input grid is transformed into a square block of the same color in the output grid. The size of this block, and consequently the overall scaling factor for the grid, is determined by the total count of non-white pixels present in the input grid. The output grid maintains the relative positions of these colored blocks corresponding to the positions of the original pixels in the input grid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "

Count the total number of non-white (value > 0) pixels in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.\n    3.  If `N` is 0, return the input grid unchanged (or an empty grid, clarification needed - based on examples, N > 0).\n    4.  Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: height `H_out = H_in * N`, width `W_out = W_in * N`.\n    5.  Create a new grid (the output grid) of size `H_out` x `W_out`, initializing all its pixels to white (0).\n    6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at row `r` (from 0 to `H_in - 1`) and column `c` (from 0 to `W_in - 1`).\n    7.  Let the color (value) of the input pixel at `(r, c)` be `V`.\n    8.  If `V` is not white (i.e., `V > 0`), then fill a square block of size `N`x`N` in the output grid with the color `V`. The top-left corner of this block should be at row `r * N` and column `c * N`. Specifically, for all `i` from 0 to `N-1` and `j` from 0 to `N-1`, set the output pixel at `(r * N + i, c * N + j)` to `V`.\n    9.  Return the generated output grid."
