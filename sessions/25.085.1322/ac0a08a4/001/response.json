Counts the total number of non-white (value > 0) pixels in the input \n       grid to determine the scaling factor `N`.\n    2. Calculates the dimensions of the output grid as `H_out = H_in * N` and \n       `W_out = W_in * N`, where `H_in` and `W_in` are the height and width \n       of the input grid.\n    3. Creates a new output grid initialized with white (0).\n    4. Iterates through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n    5. For each input pixel with color `V`, it fills an `N x N` block in the \n       output grid starting at `(r * N, c * N)` with the color `V`.
