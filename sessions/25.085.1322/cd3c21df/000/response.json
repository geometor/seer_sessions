            "text": "*   **Perception:** The input grids contain various geometric shapes composed of different colors scattered on a white background. The output grid is always a smaller grid representing one specific object extracted from the input grid. The key is to identify which object is selected and why.\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   In each example, the output grid corresponds precisely to a sub-grid of the input containing a single \"object\" (a contiguous group of non-white pixels).\n    *   The selected object consistently has the property of being a solid rectangle; its pixels perfectly fill its bounding box. Non-rectangular shapes (like L-shapes or T-shapes) are ignored.\n    *   In `train_1`, there are two rectangular objects: a 1x3 magenta line and a 2x2 orange square. The orange square is selected, which is the most \"square-like\" (aspect ratio closer to 1).\n    *   In `train_2`, there are two rectangular objects: a 4x1 yellow line and a 4x1 red line. They have the same shape and aspect ratio. The red line is selected. Comparing their top-left positions, the red line starts at a lower row index (and further right column index) than the yellow line. The selection seems to prioritize the object whose top-left corner is located furthest down, and then furthest right as a tie-breaker.\n    *   In `train_3`, there is only one object that forms a solid rectangle (a 2x3 shape made of red and blue pixels). This object is selected.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies all solid rectangular objects within the input grid. If multiple such objects exist, it selects the one that is most square-like (aspect ratio closest to 1). If there's a tie in squareness, it selects the object whose top-left corner has the highest row index, using the column index as a further tie-breaker. The output is the selected rectangular object, cropped to its bounding box.\n\n"
