1.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors (pixels 1-9) in the input grid.
2.  For each object, determine its bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices).
3.  Filter these objects, keeping only those that form solid rectangles (i.e., the number of non-background pixels within the object equals the area of its bounding box).
4.  If zero solid rectangular objects are found, the transformation rule is undefined by the examples (or possibly results in an empty grid, though not shown).
5.  If exactly one solid rectangular object is found, select it.
6.  If multiple solid rectangular objects are found:
    a.  Calculate the aspect ratio for each object as `min(height, width) / max(height, width)`.
    b.  Identify the object(s) with the maximum aspect ratio (closest to 1).
    c.  If there is a unique object with the maximum aspect ratio, select it.
    d.  If there is still a tie (multiple objects share the same maximum aspect ratio), compare their top-left corner positions (min_row, min_col). Select the object with the largest `min_row` index.
    e.  If there is still a tie (multiple objects share the same maximum aspect ratio and the same largest `min_row`), select the object among them with the largest `min_col` index.
7.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of the selected object. This subgrid is the output.
