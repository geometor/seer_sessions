task_description: Identify white pixels enclosed by yellow barriers and change their color to orange.

grid_properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9), same dimensions as input.
  - colors_present: Mainly white (0) and yellow (4), resulting in orange (7). Other colors might be present but seem irrelevant to the core logic.

objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Can form connected regions.
  - type: barrier
    color: yellow (4)
    properties: Forms structures that can enclose regions of the background (white pixels).

actions:
  - name: identify_boundary_reachable_white_pixels
    inputs: input_grid
    description: >
      Perform a search (like BFS) starting from all white pixels located on the
      outermost border of the grid. The search can only move between adjacent
      (up, down, left, right) white pixels. Mark all visited white pixels
      during this search.
  - name: identify_enclosed_white_pixels
    inputs: input_grid, marked_reachable_white_pixels
    description: >
      Iterate through the input_grid. Any pixel that is white (0) and was *not*
      marked as reachable in the previous step is considered enclosed.
  - name: change_color
    inputs: input_grid, enclosed_white_pixels
    outputs: output_grid
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input_grid. For each identified enclosed white pixel,
      change its color to orange (7) in the copied grid. Return the modified grid.
