            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted a flood-fill (BFS) approach starting from the boundaries to identify \"unenclosed\" white pixels. However, it incorrectly allowed traversal through *all* non-boundary cells, failing to recognize that the yellow (4) pixels act as barriers. The generated outputs show that no white pixels were changed because, under the previous incorrect assumption, all white pixels were considered reachable from the boundary through other white pixels, even if separated visually by yellow patterns.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the BFS implementation:\n1.  Identify all white (0) pixels on the grid's boundary.\n2.  Perform a BFS starting *only* from these boundary white pixels.\n3.  The BFS should *only* traverse through adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels. All other colors, especially yellow (4), act as barriers and cannot be traversed.\n4.  Mark all white pixels visited during this BFS as \"reachable from the boundary\".\n5.  Iterate through the input grid. Any white (0) pixel that was *not* marked as reachable is considered \"enclosed\".\n6.  Change the color of these enclosed white pixels to orange (7).\n7.  Keep all other pixels unchanged.\n\n**Gathering Metrics**\n\nLet's apply the refined logic mentally to the examples and confirm the counts.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Boundary White Pixels: All pixels in row 0, col 8, row 8, plus `(1,3)` to `(1,8)`, `(2,3)` to `(2,8)`, `(3,3)` to `(3,8)`, `(4,0)` to `(4,4)`, `(4,8)`, `(5,0)` to `(5,4)`, `(5,8)`, `(6,0)` to `(6,4)`, `(6,8)`, `(7,0)` to `(7,8)`.\n    *   BFS Traversal (White only): The BFS will reach all white pixels *except* those separated by yellow barriers.\n    *   Unreachable (Enclosed) White Pixels in Input: `(2,0)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,7)`, `(6,5)`, `(6,7)`.\n    *   Expected Output Changes: These 5 white pixels should become orange (7).\n    *   Actual Output Changes (Previous Code): 0 pixels changed.\n    *   Discrepancy: 5 pixels.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Boundary White Pixels: Similar distribution as Ex 1, but blocked differently by yellow.\n    *   BFS Traversal (White only): The BFS will reach all white pixels *except* those separated by yellow barriers.\n    *   Unreachable (Enclosed) White Pixels in Input: `(2,1)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(4,7)`, `(5,5)`, `(6,6)`.\n    *   Expected Output Changes: These 6 white pixels should become orange (7).\n    *   Actual Output Changes (Previous Code): 0 pixels changed.\n    *   Discrepancy: 6 pixels.\n\nThe refined BFS logic correctly identifies the pixels that should change in both examples.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n"
