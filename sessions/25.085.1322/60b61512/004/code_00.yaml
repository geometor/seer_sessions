task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with orange.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 9x9 in examples).
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_colors: Primarily yellow (4) forming barriers/shapes.

objects:
  - type: barrier
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Forms shapes or structures that enclose areas. These pixels are static and remain unchanged.
  - type: enclosed_area
    initial_color: white (0)
    final_color: orange (7)
    description: Regions of one or more white pixels that cannot reach the grid boundary via cardinal adjacency through other white pixels.
  - type: external_area
    color: white (0)
    description: Regions of white pixels connected to the grid boundary via cardinal adjacency through other white pixels. These pixels remain unchanged.

actions:
  - action: identify_connectivity
    target: white (0) pixels
    method: Determine which white pixels are connected cardinally to the grid boundary.
    result: Classification of white pixels into 'external' (connected to boundary) or 'internal' (not connected).
  - action: color_change
    target: 'internal' white (0) pixels
    new_color: orange (7)
    condition: Must be identified as not connected to the boundary.

invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - All non-white pixels remain unchanged (specifically yellow (4) in examples).
  - White pixels connected to the boundary remain white (0).

transformation_rule: Change the color of all white (0) pixels that are not reachable from the grid boundary (via cardinal steps on white pixels) to orange (7).
