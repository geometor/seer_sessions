Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    size: H rows x W columns (observed: 4x4)
Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    size: (2*H) rows x (2*W) columns (observed: 8x8)
Relationship: Output grid is constructed from transformed versions of the input grid.
Quadrants:
  - Top-Left:
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1
      content: Identical copy of Input_Grid
  - Top-Right:
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
      content: Result of applying Transpose and then Vertical_Flip operations to Input_Grid
  - Bottom-Left:
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols 0 to W-1
      content: Result of applying Rotate_180 operation to Input_Grid
  - Bottom-Right:
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
      content: Result of applying Rotate_90_Clockwise operation to Input_Grid
Operations:
  - Identity: No change.
  - Transpose: Swap rows and columns (element at [r, c] moves to [c, r]).
  - Vertical_Flip: Reverse the order of rows (element at [r, c] moves to [H-1-r, c]).
  - Rotate_180: Rotate the grid 180 degrees (element at [r, c] moves to [H-1-r, W-1-c]).
  - Rotate_90_Clockwise: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise (element at [r, c] moves to [c, W-1-r]).
