Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** All examples show a 4x4 input grid transforming into an 8x8 output grid. The output grid is exactly twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  **Output Structure:** The 8x8 output grid appears to be composed of four distinct 4x4 quadrants.
3.  **Quadrant Relationships:**
    *   The **top-left** quadrant of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
    *   The **top-right** quadrant seems related to the input grid through some transformation. Comparing `train_1` input and its top-right output quadrant:
        Input:
        
```
        4 9 1 8
        8 4 1 8
        4 8 8 1
        1 1 1 8
        ```

        Top-Right Output:
        
```
        8 8 1 8
        1 1 8 1
        9 4 8 1
        4 8 4 1
        ```

        This looks like the input grid first transposed (swap rows and columns) and then flipped vertically.
        Transpose(Input):
        
```
        4 8 4 1
        9 4 8 1
        1 1 8 1
        8 8 1 8
        ```

        Flip Vertically(Transpose(Input)):
        
```
        8 8 1 8
        1 1 8 1
        9 4 8 1
        4 8 4 1
        ```

        This matches.
    *   The **bottom-left** quadrant appears to be the input grid rotated 180 degrees.
        Input (`train_1`):
        
```
        4 9 1 8
        8 4 1 8
        4 8 8 1
        1 1 1 8
        ```

        Rotate 180:
        
```
        8 1 1 1
        1 8 8 4
        8 1 4 8
        8 1 9 4
        ```

        This matches the bottom-left quadrant of the output.
    *   The **bottom-right** quadrant appears to be the input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
        Input (`train_1`):
        
```
        4 9 1 8
        8 4 1 8
        4 8 8 1
        1 1 1 8
        ```

        Rotate 90 Clockwise:
        
```
        1 4 8 4
        1 8 4 9
        1 8 1 1
        8 1 8 8
        ```

        This matches the bottom-right quadrant of the output.
4.  **Consistency:** This pattern of four transformations (Identity, Transpose+FlipVertical, Rotate180, Rotate90Clockwise) holds across all provided training examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    size: H rows x W columns (observed: 4x4)
Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    size: (2*H) rows x (2*W) columns (observed: 8x8)
Relationship: Output grid is constructed from transformed versions of the input grid.
Quadrants:
  - Top-Left:
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1
      content: Identical copy of Input_Grid
  - Top-Right:
      position: rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
      content: Result of applying Transpose and then Vertical_Flip operations to Input_Grid
  - Bottom-Left:
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols 0 to W-1
      content: Result of applying Rotate_180 operation to Input_Grid
  - Bottom-Right:
      position: rows H to 2*H-1, cols W to 2*W-1
      content: Result of applying Rotate_90_Clockwise operation to Input_Grid
Operations:
  - Identity: No change.
  - Transpose: Swap rows and columns (element at [r, c] moves to [c, r]).
  - Vertical_Flip: Reverse the order of rows (element at [r, c] moves to [H-1-r, c]).
  - Rotate_180: Rotate the grid 180 degrees (element at [r, c] moves to [H-1-r, W-1-c]).
  - Rotate_90_Clockwise: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise (element at [r, c] moves to [c, W-1-r]).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid (let's call it `input`). Determine its height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid (let's call it `output`) with dimensions `2*H` by `2*W`, initially empty or filled with a default value (like black/0, though the background is white/0 in examples, it doesn't seem relevant here as the transformations cover the whole area).
3.  Perform the following transformations on the `input` grid:
    a.  `quadrant_TL`: The `input` grid itself (identity transformation).
    b.  `quadrant_TR`: Transpose the `input` grid, then flip the result vertically.
    c.  `quadrant_BL`: Rotate the `input` grid 180 degrees.
    d.  `quadrant_BR`: Rotate the `input` grid 90 degrees clockwise.
4.  Place the resulting grids into the `output` grid:
    a.  Copy `quadrant_TL` into the top-left region of `output` (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).
    b.  Copy `quadrant_TR` into the top-right region of `output` (rows 0 to `H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
    c.  Copy `quadrant_BL` into the bottom-left region of `output` (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns 0 to `W-1`).
    d.  Copy `quadrant_BR` into the bottom-right region of `output` (rows `H` to `2*H-1`, columns `W` to `2*W-1`).
5.  Return the completed `output` grid.
