Grid_Properties:
  - dimensions_input: [10, 8]
  - dimensions_output: [10, 8]
  - colors_present: [white, green, yellow, maroon] # 0, 3, 4, 9

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: one of [white, green, yellow, maroon]
      - position: [row, column]

Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    definition: Pixels sharing an edge or corner (Moore neighborhood).
  - type: Color_Persistence
    description: Pixels with color green, yellow, or maroon maintain their color and position in the output.

Actions:
  - type: Color_Change
    target: white pixels in the input grid
    condition: The white pixel must be adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one yellow pixel in the input grid.
    result: The target white pixel becomes green in the output grid.
    alternative_result: If the condition is not met, the white pixel remains white.

Transformation_Rule:
  - description: >
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white and has at least one yellow neighbor (including diagonals), change its color to green in the corresponding position in the output grid. Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color in the output grid.
