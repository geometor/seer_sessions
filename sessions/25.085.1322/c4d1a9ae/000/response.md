Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for the provided example.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10 rows x 8 columns).
2.  **Color Palette:** Both grids use the same colors: white (0), green (3), yellow (4), and maroon (9).
3.  **Conservation:** The positions of the original green (3), yellow (4), and maroon (9) pixels remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation exclusively affects pixels that are white (0) in the input grid. Some white pixels remain white, while others change to green (3).
5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the pixels that change from white (0) to green (3), they appear to be located adjacent (including diagonals) to yellow (4) pixels in the *input* grid.
6.  **Neighbor Influence:** A white pixel changes to green if *any* of its eight neighbors (Moore neighborhood) in the input grid is yellow. If a white pixel has no yellow neighbors, it remains white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - dimensions_input: [10, 8]
  - dimensions_output: [10, 8]
  - colors_present: [white, green, yellow, maroon] # 0, 3, 4, 9

Objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: one of [white, green, yellow, maroon]
      - position: [row, column]

Relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    definition: Pixels sharing an edge or corner (Moore neighborhood).
  - type: Color_Persistence
    description: Pixels with color green, yellow, or maroon maintain their color and position in the output.

Actions:
  - type: Color_Change
    target: white pixels in the input grid
    condition: The white pixel must be adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one yellow pixel in the input grid.
    result: The target white pixel becomes green in the output grid.
    alternative_result: If the condition is not met, the white pixel remains white.

Transformation_Rule:
  - description: >
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white and has at least one yellow neighbor (including diagonals), change its color to green in the corresponding position in the output grid. Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid, identified by its row and column index.
3.  For the current cell at `[row, col]`:
    a.  Check the color of the cell in the input grid.
    b.  If the input cell color is white (0):
        i.  Examine all eight neighbors (adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) of this cell in the input grid.
        ii. Check if any of these neighbors has the color yellow (4).
        iii. If at least one neighbor is yellow, set the color of the cell at `[row, col]` in the output grid to green (3).
        iv. If no neighbor is yellow, set the color of the cell at `[row, col]` in the output grid to white (0).
    c.  If the input cell color is *not* white (i.e., it is green, yellow, or maroon), copy its color directly to the cell at `[row, col]` in the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
