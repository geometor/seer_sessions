Some white pixels remain white, while others change to green (3).\n5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the pixels that change from white (0) to green (3), they appear to be located adjacent (including diagonals) to yellow (4) pixels in the *input* grid.\n6.  **Neighbor Influence:** A white pixel changes to green if *any* of its eight neighbors (Moore neighborhood) in the input grid is yellow. If a white pixel has no yellow neighbors, it remains white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
