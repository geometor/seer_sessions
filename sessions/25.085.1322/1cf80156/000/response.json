The object's shape varies across examples.\n3.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. It contains the *exact* shape and color of the object from the input grid, plus any white pixels that were immediately adjacent to the object within the minimal bounding box enclosing the object.\n4.  **Transformation:** The process appears to be one of localization and extraction. The core colored object is identified, and then the smallest rectangular region containing this object is cropped from the input grid to form the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
