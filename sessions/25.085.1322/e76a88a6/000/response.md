Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids are 10x10.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input `train_1`: white (0), gray (5), magenta (6), azure (8).
    *   Output `train_1`: white (0), magenta (6), azure (8). Gray (5) is removed.
    *   Input `train_2`: white (0), red (2), yellow (4), gray (5).
    *   Output `train_2`: white (0), red (2), yellow (4). Gray (5) is removed.
3.  **Key Objects/Regions:**
    *   **Pattern Object:** In both examples, there's a distinct shape made of colors other than white (0) and gray (5).
        *   `train_1`: A 3x4 shape using magenta (6) and azure (8) located at `[1:4, 1:5]`.
        *   `train_2`: A 3x3 shape using red (2) and yellow (4) located at `[1:4, 1:4]`.
    *   **Target Regions:** In both examples, there are blocks composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
        *   `train_1`: Two 3x4 gray blocks at `[0:3, 6:10]` and `[5:8, 4:8]`.
        *   `train_2`: Two 3x3 gray blocks at `[4:7, 6:9]` and `[7:10, 2:5]`.
    *   **Background:** The rest of the grid is primarily white (0).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The gray (5) blocks in the input are replaced in the output.
    *   The replacement content is a copy of the "Pattern Object".
    *   The original location of the "Pattern Object" in the input is replaced with white (0) pixels in the output.
    *   Crucially, the dimensions (height and width) of the Pattern Object's bounding box exactly match the dimensions of the gray target blocks in each respective example.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Replace specific marker objects (gray blocks) with copies of a template pattern object found elsewhere in the grid, and erase the original template pattern.
components:
  - id: pattern
    description: The template object to be copied. Defined as the smallest bounding box containing all non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: Any color except white (0) and gray (5).
      - location: Its original position in the input grid.
      - size: Height and width of its bounding box.
      - content: The specific arrangement of pixels within its bounding box.
  - id: marker
    description: Target objects indicating where the pattern should be copied. Defined as contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Always gray (5).
      - shape: Rectangular blocks (in examples).
      - location: Position(s) in the input grid.
      - size: Height and width of the block.
      - count: Can be multiple instances.
  - id: background
    description: The default empty space in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Typically white (0).
actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    description: Find the bounding box and content of the pattern object (all non-0, non-5 pixels).
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels and their bounding boxes.
  - action: verify_match
    description: Check if the pattern's bounding box dimensions (height, width) match the dimensions of *all* identified marker blocks.
  - action: prepare_output
    description: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
  - action: erase_original_pattern
    description: In the output grid, fill the area corresponding to the original pattern's location with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: copy_pattern_to_markers
    description: For each identified marker block location, overwrite the gray pixels in the output grid with the pixel content copied from the pattern object.
constraints:
  - The dimensions (height and width) of the pattern object must strictly match the dimensions of all marker objects.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the "pattern": Find the smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels that are neither white (0) nor gray (5). Store the pixel values within this rectangle and its location and dimensions (height, width).
2.  Identify the "targets": Find all separate, connected blocks consisting only of gray (5) pixels. For each block, determine its location and dimensions (height, width).
3.  Check for size consistency: Ensure that the height and width of the pattern rectangle exactly match the height and width of *every* gray target block found.
4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  Erase the original pattern: In the output grid, change all pixels within the original pattern's location to white (0).
6.  Replace targets with the pattern: For each gray target block's location, copy the stored pattern pixels onto the corresponding area in the output grid, overwriting the gray pixels.
