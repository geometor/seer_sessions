task_description: Replace specific marker objects (gray blocks) with copies of a template pattern object found elsewhere in the grid, and erase the original template pattern.
components:
  - id: pattern
    description: The template object to be copied. Defined as the smallest bounding box containing all non-white (0) and non-gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: Any color except white (0) and gray (5).
      - location: Its original position in the input grid.
      - size: Height and width of its bounding box.
      - content: The specific arrangement of pixels within its bounding box.
  - id: marker
    description: Target objects indicating where the pattern should be copied. Defined as contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Always gray (5).
      - shape: Rectangular blocks (in examples).
      - location: Position(s) in the input grid.
      - size: Height and width of the block.
      - count: Can be multiple instances.
  - id: background
    description: The default empty space in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Typically white (0).
actions:
  - action: identify_pattern
    description: Find the bounding box and content of the pattern object (all non-0, non-5 pixels).
  - action: identify_markers
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels and their bounding boxes.
  - action: verify_match
    description: Check if the pattern's bounding box dimensions (height, width) match the dimensions of *all* identified marker blocks.
  - action: prepare_output
    description: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
  - action: erase_original_pattern
    description: In the output grid, fill the area corresponding to the original pattern's location with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: copy_pattern_to_markers
    description: For each identified marker block location, overwrite the gray pixels in the output grid with the pixel content copied from the pattern object.
constraints:
  - The dimensions (height and width) of the pattern object must strictly match the dimensions of all marker objects.
