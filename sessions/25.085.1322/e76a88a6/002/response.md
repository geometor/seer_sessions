**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the "pattern" (non-white, non-gray pixels) and the "marker" blocks (gray rectangles). It also correctly verified that the dimensions of the pattern's bounding box matched the dimensions of the marker blocks. The core operation of copying the pattern onto the marker blocks was also performed correctly.

However, the code failed because it *erased* the original pattern from the input grid after identifying it. The provided examples show that the original pattern should *remain* in its original position in the output grid.

The strategy is to modify the transformation logic to preserve the original pattern while still copying it onto the gray marker blocks. This means removing step 5 from the previous code's logic ("Erase the original pattern").

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's confirm the shapes and colors involved.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The pattern (composed of magenta and azure pixels) has dimensions 3x4. There are two gray marker blocks, both also with dimensions 3x4.
*   **Example 2:** The pattern (composed of red and yellow pixels) has dimensions 3x3. There are two gray marker blocks, both also with dimensions 3x3. (Correction: The previous analysis mentioned three blocks, but the code correctly finds two rectangular blocks).

The metrics confirm the previous observation: the pattern's bounding box dimensions match the dimensions of the gray marker blocks in both examples. The critical difference observed by comparing input/output pairs is the preservation of the original pattern.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the "pattern object" which consists of all connected pixels that are not white (0) or gray (5). Determine its bounding box dimensions (height, width) and content.
2.  Identify all separate, solid rectangular blocks composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. These are the "marker objects". Determine the dimensions (height, width) of each marker object.
3.  Compare the dimensions of the pattern object's bounding box with the dimensions of each marker object.
4.  If the pattern's dimensions exactly match the dimensions of *all* marker objects:
    a.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    b.  For each marker object, replace the area within its bounding box in the output grid with the content of the pattern object.
    c.  The original pattern object remains in its original position in the output grid.
5.  If the dimensions do not match for any marker object, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.
