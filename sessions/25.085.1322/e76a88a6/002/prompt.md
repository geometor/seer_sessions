"""
Identifies a "pattern" object (defined by non-white, non-gray pixels) and multiple "marker" objects (contiguous blocks of gray pixels). 
It verifies that the dimensions of the pattern's bounding box exactly match the dimensions of all marker blocks.
If the dimensions match, it creates the output grid by:
1. Copying the input grid.
2. Erasing the original pattern area (filling with white).
3. Replacing each gray marker block area with a copy of the pattern object.
