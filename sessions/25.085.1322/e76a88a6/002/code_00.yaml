task_description: Copy a template pattern onto target locations marked by gray blocks of the same size, preserving the original pattern.

definitions:
  - name: background
    type: color
    value: white (0)
  - name: pattern
    type: object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels defined by all non-white and non-gray colors in the input grid. It exists as a single instance.
    properties:
      - bounding_box_dimensions: (height, width) derived from its min/max row/column.
      - content: The grid values within the bounding box.
  - name: marker
    type: object
    description: A solid rectangular block of gray (5) pixels. Multiple instances can exist.
    properties:
      - dimensions: (height, width) of the gray rectangle.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: identify
    source: input_grid
    target: pattern
    details: Find the bounding box and content of the pattern object (all non-white, non-gray pixels).
  - step: 2
    action: identify
    source: input_grid
    target: markers
    details: Find all solid rectangular blocks of gray pixels (markers).
  - step: 3
    action: verify
    condition: Check if the dimensions (height, width) of the pattern's bounding box exactly match the dimensions of *every* identified marker block.
  - step: 4
    action: copy_grid
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details: Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
  - step: 5
    action: conditional_replace (if step 3 is true)
    source: pattern.content
    target: output_grid
    details: For each identified marker block, replace the pixels within its bounding box in the output grid with the content of the pattern. The original pattern's location in the output grid remains unchanged.
  - step: 6
    action: output (if step 3 is false)
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details: If the dimensions do not match, the output grid is an identical copy of the input grid.

example_notes:
  - example: 1
    pattern_dims: (3, 4)
    marker_dims: [(3, 4), (3, 4)]
    result: Pattern copied onto both markers. Original pattern preserved.
  - example: 2
    pattern_dims: (3, 3)
    marker_dims: [(3, 3), (3, 3)]
    result: Pattern copied onto both markers. Original pattern preserved.
