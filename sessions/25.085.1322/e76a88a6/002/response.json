            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the \"pattern\" (non-white, non-gray pixels) and the \"marker\" blocks (gray rectangles). It also correctly verified that the dimensions of the pattern's bounding box matched the dimensions of the marker blocks. The core operation of copying the pattern onto the marker blocks was also performed correctly.\n\nHowever, the code failed because it *erased* the original pattern from the input grid after identifying it. The provided examples show that the original pattern should *remain* in its original position in the output grid.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation logic to preserve the original pattern while still copying it onto the gray marker blocks. This means removing step 5 from the previous code's logic (\"Erase the original pattern\").\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's confirm the shapes and colors involved.\n\n**Example 1:**\n"
