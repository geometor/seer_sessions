Identifies a horizontal pattern block defined by the columns containing any non-background pixels 
in the input grid. This pattern block spans from the minimum column index (`min_col`) to the 
maximum column index (`max_col`) containing non-background pixels, across all rows. 
The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. Then, the area from `min_col` to 
the right edge of the grid is cleared (set to background color 0). The identified pattern block 
is then repeatedly tiled horizontally into this cleared area, starting at `min_col`. If the 
pattern doesn't fit perfectly at the right edge, it is truncated. Columns to the left of `min_col` 
retain their original values from the input grid. If the input grid contains only background pixels, 
the output is identical to the input.
