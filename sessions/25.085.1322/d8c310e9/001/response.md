```python
"""
Identifies a horizontal pattern block defined by the columns containing any non-background pixels 
in the input grid. This pattern block spans from the minimum column index to the maximum column index 
containing non-background pixels, across all rows. The identified pattern block is then repeated 
horizontally, starting from its original minimum column index position, tiling across the width of the 
grid. If the pattern doesn't fit perfectly at the end, it is truncated. Areas outside the repeated 
pattern (including columns before the original minimum column index) are filled with the 
background color (0). If the input grid contains only background pixels, the output is identical 
to the input.
