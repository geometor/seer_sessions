The rest of the input grid is white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve isolating the non-white object, potentially scaling it up, and creating a new output grid that contains only this scaled object.\n4.  **Scaling:** Observing the shapes, the output object looks like a magnified version of the input object. Each pixel in the input object seems to correspond to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output object.\n5.  **Cropping/Framing:** The output grid's dimensions seem tightly bound to the scaled object. It appears the process first finds the bounding box of the non-white object in the input, then scales *everything* within that bounding box (including any white pixels inside it) by a factor of 2x2 to produce the output. The dimensions of the output grid are precisely twice the dimensions of the input bounding box.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
