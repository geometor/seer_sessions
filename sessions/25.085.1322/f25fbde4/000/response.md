Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The task takes a larger input grid (9x9 in the examples) and produces a smaller or differently proportioned output grid.
2.  **Key Element:** The core element in the input grids appears to be a single connected object composed of non-white pixels (specifically yellow/color 4 in the examples). The rest of the input grid is white (color 0).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve isolating the non-white object, potentially scaling it up, and creating a new output grid that contains only this scaled object.
4.  **Scaling:** Observing the shapes, the output object looks like a magnified version of the input object. Each pixel in the input object seems to correspond to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output object.
5.  **Cropping/Framing:** The output grid's dimensions seem tightly bound to the scaled object. It appears the process first finds the bounding box of the non-white object in the input, then scales *everything* within that bounding box (including any white pixels inside it) by a factor of 2x2 to produce the output. The dimensions of the output grid are precisely twice the dimensions of the input bounding box.

**Facts**

    properties:

  - name: calculate_bounding_box
    input: non_white_pixels
    output: bounding_box
    description: Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing non-white pixels. If no non-white pixels exist, handle appropriately (e.g., return an empty box or the whole grid - based on examples, assumes at least one non-white pixel).
  - name: extract_bounding_box_content
    input: 
      - input_grid
      - bounding_box
    output: bounding_box.content
    description: Create a subgrid containing the pixels from the input_grid within the bounding_box.
  - name: scale_grid
    input: 
      - grid_to_scale: bounding_box.content
      - scale_factor: Integer (value is 2 for this task)
    output: scaled_grid: Grid
    description: Create a new grid where each pixel (r, c) in grid_to_scale becomes a scale_factor x scale_factor block of the same color at position (r*scale_factor, c*scale_factor) in the scaled_grid. The dimensions of scaled_grid are (grid_to_scale.height * scale_factor, grid_to_scale.width * scale_factor).
  - name: assign_output
    input: scaled_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The final output grid is the scaled_grid.

relationships:
  - output_grid.height == bounding_box.height * 2
  - output_grid.width == bounding_box.width * 2
  - For each pixel `p` at relative coordinates (r, c) within the bounding_box (where 0 <= r < bounding_box.height, 0 <= c < bounding_box.width) with color `C`:
      The 2x2 block of pixels in the output_grid starting at (r*2, c*2) are all set to color `C`.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all pixels that are not white (color 0).
2.  Determine the bounding box that tightly encloses all identified non-white pixels. Record its top-left corner coordinates (min_row, min_col), height (H), and width (W).
3.  If no non-white pixels are found, the output is likely an empty grid or needs specific definition (though examples suggest there's always an object). Assuming an object exists:
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H * 2) rows by (W * 2) columns.
5.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box of the input grid, from row `min_row` to `min_row + H - 1` and column `min_col` to `min_col + W - 1`. Let the current input cell coordinates be `(in_r, in_c)`.
6.  Calculate the relative coordinates within the bounding box: `rel_r = in_r - min_row` and `rel_c = in_c - min_col`.
7.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at `(in_r, in_c)` in the input grid.
8.  In the output grid, determine the top-left corner of the corresponding 2x2 block: `out_r = rel_r * 2` and `out_c = rel_c * 2`.
9.  Fill the four cells in the output grid at `(out_r, out_c)`, `(out_r + 1, out_c)`, `(out_r, out_c + 1)`, and `(out_r + 1, out_c + 1)` with the color `C`.
10. After iterating through all cells in the input bounding box, return the completed output grid.
