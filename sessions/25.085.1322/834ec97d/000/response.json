The grid sizes and the object's color and position vary.\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as the corresponding input.\n3.  **Object Transformation:** The original non-white pixel appears in the output grid, but shifted one row down from its input position.\n4.  **Pattern Generation:** A distinct pattern appears in the output grid. This pattern consists of alternating yellow (4) and white (0) pixels filling entire rows.\n5.  **Pattern Location:** The pattern fills all rows from the top of the grid down to and including the original row where the non-white pixel was located in the input.\n6.  **Pattern Detail:** The specific alternating pattern (`4 0 4 0...` or `0 4 0 4...`) applied to the rows depends on the column index of the original non-white pixel. If the column index is even, the pattern starts with yellow (4). If the column index is odd, the pattern starts with white (0).\n7.  **Overlap:** The non-white pixel, in its new position (one row below its original), overwrites any part of the generated pattern that might occupy the same cell. Rows below the new position of the non-white pixel remain white.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white (0).\n3.  Determine the starting color for an alternating pattern: if the input column `c` is even, the pattern starts with yellow (4); if `c` is odd, the pattern starts with white (0).\n4.  Fill each row `i` of the output grid, from row 0 up to and including the input row `r`, with the alternating pattern determined in step 3 (e.g., `4 0 4 0...` or `0 4 0 4...`).\n5.  Place the original non-white pixel (identified in step 1) into the output grid at location (`r + 1`, `c`), overwriting the pixel currently at that position. This step should only be performed if `r + 1` is a valid row index within the grid boundaries."
