task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    attributes:
      - type: 2D grid
      - dimensions: variable height (H) and width (W) (observed 4x4 in examples)
  - item: output_grid
    attributes:
      - type: 2D grid
      - dimensions: H x (5 * W) (observed 4x20 in examples)
  - item: reflected_grid
    description: A derived grid created by reflecting the input_grid horizontally (left-to-right).
    attributes:
      - type: 2D grid
      - dimensions: H x W (same as input_grid)

relationships:
  - type: concatenation
    source: [input_grid, reflected_grid]
    target: output_grid
    details: The output_grid is formed by horizontally concatenating five HxW grids in the sequence: input_grid, reflected_grid, input_grid, reflected_grid, input_grid.

actions:
  - action: reflect_horizontally
    input: input_grid
    output: reflected_grid
    description: Create a new grid where each row from the input_grid is reversed.
  - action: concatenate_horizontally
    input: [grid1, grid2, grid3, grid4, grid5]
    output: output_grid
    description: Combine the five grids side-by-side to form the final output_grid.
