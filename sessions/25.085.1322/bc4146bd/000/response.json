The height remains the same, while the width is multiplied by 5.\n2.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of repeating or transformed versions of the input grid placed side-by-side.\n3.  **Pattern Identification:** Let's examine the relationship between the input and the output blocks. The output grid (4x20) can be seen as five 4x4 blocks concatenated horizontally.\n    *   The first block (columns 0-3) is identical to the input grid.\n    *   The second block (columns 4-7) appears to be a horizontal reflection (mirror image) of the input grid.\n    *   The third block (columns 8-11) is identical to the input grid again.\n    *   The fourth block (columns 12-15) is the horizontal reflection again.\n    *   The fifth block (columns 16-19) is identical to the input grid once more.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** The core operations are copying the input grid and reflecting the input grid horizontally. These two resulting grids are then concatenated in an alternating pattern, starting with the original input, repeated a total of five times: Input, Reflection, Input, Reflection, Input.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
