**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified was a Python `IndentationError` in the provided code. This is a syntax error, not necessarily a logic error, and likely occurred during code generation or formatting. The underlying logic described in the code's comments appears potentially correct but needs verification against all examples and refinement, particularly around collision handling.

The strategy is to:
1.  Mentally correct the indentation and re-simulate the logic described against all training examples.
2.  Gather metrics and specific observations about object positions and movements in each example.
3.  Refine the natural language description of the transformation rule based on a consistent pattern observed across all examples.
4.  Document the findings clearly in YAML and an updated natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations**

Based on analysis of the training examples:

*   **Task Type:** Object movement based on local context within rows.
*   **Objects:** Green pixels (movers), Azure pixels (obstacles/anchors), White pixels (background).
*   **Interaction:** Green pixels move horizontally within their row. Azure pixels act as boundaries defining the target destination for green pixels to their right.
*   **Row Independence:** The transformation is applied independently to each row.
*   **Movement Rule:**
    *   Each green pixel attempts to move leftwards.
    *   The target destination column for a green pixel is determined by the position of the nearest azure pixel *to its left* in the *original* row configuration. The target column is the one immediately to the right of that azure pixel.
    *   If no azure pixel exists to the left of a green pixel in its row, the target destination column is column 0.
*   **Processing Order:** Within a single row, green pixels are processed from right to left.
*   **Collision Handling:**
    *   If a green pixel's initial position is already its target destination, it does not move.
    *   If multiple green pixels in the same row target the same column, or target columns already occupied by *previously moved* green pixels (during the right-to-left pass), collisions occur.
    *   Collisions are resolved by placing the later-processed (more leftward originally) green pixel in the next available column to the right of its calculated target column. "Available" means not occupied by another green pixel *moved during the current row's pass*.
*   **State Update:** The original position of a moved green pixel becomes white. Azure pixels and other pixels remain unchanged.

**(No code execution needed for these observations as they derive from analyzing the grid data and simulating the proposed logic.)**

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Move green pixels leftward within each row, positioning them relative to azure pixels, and handle collisions.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - type: mover
    color: green (3)
    behavior: Moves horizontally within its row based on azure pixel locations. Processed right-to-left within rows.
  - type: obstacle / anchor
    color: azure (8)
    behavior: Static. Defines the target location for green pixels to its right.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: Fills empty space, including the original positions of moved green pixels.

actions:
  - name: process_rows_independently
    description: Apply the transformation logic to each row separately.
  - name: identify_green_pixels
    description: Find the column indices of all green pixels in the current row.
  - name: determine_target_column
    description: For a green pixel at column 'c', scan left from 'c-1' in the original row state. If an azure pixel is found at 'az_c', the target is 'az_c + 1'. If no azure is found, the target is column 0.
  - name: process_green_pixels_right_to_left
    description: Iterate through the identified green pixels within a row, starting from the rightmost one.
  - name: check_movement_needed
    description: If a green pixel's current column 'c' equals its target column 'target_c', it does not move.
  - name: resolve_collisions_and_move
    description:
      - If a green pixel needs to move (c != target_c), calculate its final destination column 'dest_c'.
      - Start with 'dest_c = target_c'.
      - Check if the position (row, dest_c) has already been occupied by another green pixel *moved earlier in the current row's pass*.
      - If occupied, increment 'dest_c' until an unoccupied column is found (within grid bounds).
      - Mark the final (row, dest_c) as occupied for the current pass.
      - Update the grid: set the original position (row, c) to white (0) and the final position (row, dest_c) to green (3).

state_management:
  - rule: Use the original input grid state to determine azure pixel locations for target calculation for all green pixels in a row.
  - rule: Track occupied destination cells *within* the processing of a single row to handle collisions correctly during the right-to-left pass.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify the column indices of all green (3) pixels.
    b.  Create an empty set `occupied_destinations_this_row` to track columns filled by moved green pixels during this row's processing.
    c.  Process the green pixels found in step 3a in order from rightmost column index to leftmost column index (`c`).
    d.  For each green pixel at original column `c`:
        i.  Determine its target column `target_c`: Scan leftwards from `c-1` down to 0 in the *original* row data. If an azure (8) pixel is found at column `az_c`, set `target_c = az_c + 1`. If no azure pixel is found, set `target_c = 0`.
        ii. If the green pixel's current column `c` is equal to `target_c`, do nothing and proceed to the next green pixel.
        iii. If `c` is not equal to `target_c`, calculate the final destination column `dest_c`:
            1.  Initialize `dest_c = target_c`.
            2.  While the coordinate (current row, `dest_c`) is present in the `occupied_destinations_this_row` set: increment `dest_c` by 1.
            3.  If `dest_c` is within the grid bounds (less than the grid width):
                A. Add the coordinate (current row, `dest_c`) to the `occupied_destinations_this_row` set.
                B. Update the output grid: set the pixel at (current row, `c`) to white (0).
                C. Update the output grid: set the pixel at (current row, `dest_c`) to green (3).
4.  Return the final output grid.
