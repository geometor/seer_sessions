task_elements:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      properties:
        - Variable dimensions (height, width) between examples.
        - Input and output grids have the same dimensions for a given example.
  - pixels:
      types:
        - background: white (0)
        - active: green (3)
        - obstacle: azure (8)
        - static: other colors (remain unchanged)
  - objects:
      - green_pixel:
          color: 3
          behavior: Moves leftward within its row.
      - azure_pixel:
          color: 8
          behavior: Acts as a stationary obstacle influencing green pixel movement.
  - relationships:
      - adjacency: A green pixel's movement stops based on horizontal adjacency to an azure pixel.
      - row_containment: Movement is constrained within the pixel's original row.
      - left_of: The relevant azure obstacle is the first one found to the left of the green pixel.
  - actions:
      - move_left: Performed by green pixels.
      - stop: Green pixel movement halts based on conditions (obstacle, edge, existing position).
      - replace: Original position of a moved green pixel is replaced with white (0).
      - resolve_collision: If multiple green pixels target overlapping destinations, subsequent pixels shift right.
  - constraints:
      - grid_boundary: Left edge (column 0) acts as a boundary if no azure obstacle exists.
      - obstacle_priority: Azure pixels take precedence over the grid edge as stopping points.
      - processing_order: Collisions are resolved based on a right-to-left processing order of green pixels within a row.
