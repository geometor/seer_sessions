            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 2D grids of pixels with the same dimensions in each example.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved in the transformation are green (3) and azure (8). White (0) acts as the background and replaces the original positions of moved green pixels. Other colors, if present, seem unaffected.\n3.  **Core Action:** The transformation involves moving green (3) pixels horizontally within their respective rows.\n4.  **Direction of Movement:** Green pixels consistently move towards the left (decreasing column index).\n5.  **Stopping Condition:** The movement of a green pixel stops based on the presence of azure (8) pixels in the same row, to its left. Specifically, a green pixel attempts to move to the column immediately to the right of the *first* azure pixel encountered when scanning leftwards from the green pixel's original position.\n6.  **Edge Condition:** If there are no azure pixels to the left of a green pixel in its row, it moves to the leftmost column (column 0).\n7.  **No Movement Condition:** If a green pixel is already located immediately to the right of the first azure pixel to its left, it does not move.\n8.  **Collision/Stacking:** When multiple green pixels in the same row target the same destination column, or adjacent columns that would result in overlap after movement, they \"stack\" or shift. The green pixel originating from the rightmost column lands in its calculated target column first. Subsequent green pixels (moving from right-to-left processing) targeting an already occupied cell will land in the next available column to the right.\n9.  **State Change:** The original position of a green pixel that moves becomes white (0). Pixels that are not green (3) or are not the original positions of moved green pixels remain unchanged.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
