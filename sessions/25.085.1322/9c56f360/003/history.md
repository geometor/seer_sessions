Processes each row of the input grid independently. 
For each row, identifies all green (3) pixels.
For each green pixel, determines its target destination column by finding the first azure (8) pixel to its left. 
The target is the column immediately to the right of this azure pixel. If no azure pixel is found to the left, the target is column 0.
Processes green pixels within a row from right to left. 
If a green pixel needs to move (its current column is not its target column), it is moved to the target column. 
If the target column is already occupied by another green pixel moved in the same row during this process, the current green pixel is placed in the next available column to the right.
The original position of a moved green pixel is set to white (0).

Train Set Error: syntax error:
unindent does not match any outer indentation level (<unknown>, line 97)
**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified was a Python `IndentationError` in the provided code. This is a syntax error, not necessarily a logic error, and likely occurred during code generation or formatting. The underlying logic described in the code's comments appears potentially correct but needs verification against all examples and refinement, particularly around collision handling.

The strategy is to:
1.  Mentally correct the indentation and re-simulate the logic described against all training examples.
2.  Gather metrics and specific observations about object positions and movements in each example.
3.  Refine the natural language description of the transformation rule based on a consistent pattern observed across all examples.
4.  Document the findings clearly in YAML and an updated natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations**

Based on analysis of the training examples:

*   **Task Type:** Object movement based on local context within rows.
*   **Objects:** Green pixels (movers), Azure pixels (obstacles/anchors), White pixels (background).
*   **Interaction:** Green pixels move horizontally within their row. Azure pixels act as boundaries defining the target destination for green pixels to their right.
*   **Row Independence:** The transformation is applied independently to each row.
*   **Movement Rule:**
    *   Each green pixel attempts to move leftwards.
    *   The target destination column for a green pixel is determined by the position of the nearest azure pixel *to its left* in the *original* row configuration. The target column is the one immediately to the right of that azure pixel.
    *   If no azure pixel exists to the left of a green pixel in its row, the target destination column is column 0.
*   **Processing Order:** Within a single row, green pixels are processed from right to left.
*   **Collision Handling:**
    *   If a green pixel's initial position is already its target destination, it does not move.
    *   If multiple green pixels in the same row target the same column, or target columns already occupied by *previously moved* green pixels (during the right-to-left pass), collisions occur.
    *   Collisions are resolved by placing the later-processed (more leftward originally) green pixel in the next available column to the right of its calculated target column. "Available" means not occupied by another green pixel *moved during the current row's pass*.
*   **State Update:** The original position of a moved green pixel becomes white. Azure pixels and other pixels remain unchanged.

**(No code execution needed for these observations as they derive from analyzing the grid data and simulating the proposed logic.)**

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify the column indices of all green (3) pixels.
    b.  Create an empty set `occupied_destinations_this_row` to track columns filled by moved green pixels during this row's processing.
    c.  Process the green pixels found in step 3a in order from rightmost column index to leftmost column index (`c`).
    d.  For each green pixel at original column `c`:
        i.  Determine its target column `target_c`: Scan leftwards from `c-1` down to 0 in the *original* row data. If an azure (8) pixel is found at column `az_c`, set `target_c = az_c + 1`. If no azure pixel is found, set `target_c = 0`.
        ii. If the green pixel's current column `c` is equal to `target_c`, do nothing and proceed to the next green pixel.
        iii. If `c` is not equal to `target_c`, calculate the final destination column `dest_c`:
            1.  Initialize `dest_c = target_c`.
            2.  While the coordinate (current row, `dest_c`) is present in the `occupied_destinations_this_row` set: increment `dest_c` by 1.
            3.  If `dest_c` is within the grid bounds (less than the grid width):
                A. Add the coordinate (current row, `dest_c`) to the `occupied_destinations_this_row` set.
                B. Update the output grid: set the pixel at (current row, `c`) to white (0).
                C. Update the output grid: set the pixel at (current row, `dest_c`) to green (3).
4.  Return the final output grid.
