Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment**

The provided code successfully transformed Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The failure occurred in the second row (index 1) of Example 3.

*   Input Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3]`
*   Expected Output Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3]`
*   Transformed Output Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0]`

The discrepancy lies at the last column (index 7). The green pixel originally at `(1, 7)` was incorrectly moved by the code, resulting in a white pixel `(0)` at `(1, 7)` in the transformed output, whereas it should have remained green `(3)`.

The core issue seems to be how collisions or overlapping targets are handled, especially when a green pixel targets the location of another green pixel that isn't supposed to move. The original logic allowed the pixel from `(1, 7)` (target column 6) to claim column 6, erasing itself from column 7. However, the pixel at `(1, 6)` also had target column 6 (meaning it should stay put). The expected output suggests that if a green pixel's target destination is already the designated final spot for *another* green pixel (specifically, one that started there and isn't moving), the first pixel cannot move and must remain in its original position.

The strategy is to refine the logic to account for this specific type of conflict: a moving pixel targeting the position of a stationary pixel.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's confirm the grid details for Example 3:

``` python
import numpy as np

# Example 3 Data
input_grid_ex3 = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3],
    [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],

    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3],
    [8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8]
]

expected_output_ex3 = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8],

    [8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0],
    [0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3],

# Transformed Output for Example 3 (from the failed run)
transformed_output_ex3 = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0], # <--- Difference here

    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3],
    [8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8]
]

input_np = np.array(input_grid_ex3)
expected_np = np.array(expected_output_ex3)
transformed_np = np.array(transformed_output_ex3)

diff = expected_np != transformed_np
diff_indices = np.where(diff)

print(f"Input shape: {input_np.shape}")
print(f"Expected shape: {expected_np.shape}")
print(f"Transformed shape: {transformed_np.shape}")

# Analyze the specific row (row index 1)
row_index = 1

expected_row = expected_np[row_index, :]
transformed_row = transformed_np[row_index, :]
print(f"\n--- Row {row_index} Analysis ---")

# Find green and azure pixels in the input row

print(f"Green pixel columns: {green_cols.tolist()}")
print(f"Azure pixel columns: {azure_cols.tolist()}")

# Calculate targets for green pixels in row 1
targets = {}
for c in green_cols:
    target_c = 0
    for az_c in range(c - 1, -1, -1):
        if input_row[az_c] == 8:
            target_c = az_c + 1
            break
    targets[c] = target_c

print(f"Targets for green pixels (col: target_col): {targets}")
```
```
Input shape: (9, 8)
Expected shape: (9, 8)
Transformed shape: (9, 8)
Mismatch indices (row, col): [(np.int64(1), np.int64(7))]
First mismatch at index: (np.int64(1), np.int64(7))
Input value at mismatch: 3
Expected value at mismatch: 3
Transformed value at mismatch: 0

--- Row 1 Analysis ---
Input row 1:       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3]
Expected output row 1: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3]
Transformed output row 1: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0]
Green pixel columns: [6, 7]
Azure pixel columns: [3, 5]
Targets for green pixels (col: target_col): {np.int64(6): 6, np.int64(7): 6}

```
The metrics confirm the mismatch occurs at `(1, 7)`. The input is green (3), expected is green (3), but transformed is white (0).
The analysis also confirms:
*   Green pixel at column 6 targets column 6 (stationary).
*   Green pixel at column 7 targets column 6 (moving).
This supports the refined hypothesis: the green pixel at column 7 should not move because its target (column 6) is the stationary position of the green pixel originally at column 6.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Processes each row of the input grid independently to move green pixels leftwards based on the position of azure pixels, resolving conflicts.
grid_properties:
  - height and width can vary.
  - pixels are integers 0-9 representing colors.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white(0), blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), orange(7), azure(8), maroon(9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: primary_actor
    identified_by: color == green(3)
    action: attempts to move left within its row.
  - type: boundary
    identified_by: color == azure(8)
    role: determines the target destination for green pixels to its right.
  - type: background
    identified_by: color == white(0)
    role: empty space, source of erased pixels.
row_processing_logic:
  - operates independently on each row.
  - output row starts as a copy of the input row.
  - green pixels are processed from right-to-left within the row.
green_pixel_movement:
  - rule: A green pixel at column 'c' finds its target column 'target_c'.
  - target_finding: Scan leftwards from 'c-1'. The target column 'target_c' is the column immediately to the right ('az_c + 1') of the first azure(8) pixel encountered at 'az_c'. If no azure pixel is found to the left, 'target_c' is 0.
  - stationary_condition: If a green pixel's original column 'c' equals its 'target_c', it is considered stationary and does not move.
  - movement_condition: If 'c' is not equal to 'target_c', the pixel attempts to move.
conflict_resolution:
  - priority: Stationary green pixels have priority for their location.
  - step_1_stationary_check: A moving green pixel checks if its 'target_c' is the location of a stationary green pixel (identified based on original positions and targets). If yes, the moving pixel *does not move* and stays at its original column 'c'.
  - step_2_dynamic_check: If the 'target_c' is *not* blocked by a stationary green pixel, the moving pixel calculates its destination 'dest_c', starting at 'target_c'.
  - step_3_collision_push: While 'dest_c' corresponds to a column already filled by *another green pixel that has successfully moved* during the processing of the current row, increment 'dest_c' by 1.
  - step_4_placement: If a valid 'dest_c' (within grid bounds and not blocked by stationary or previously moved pixels) is found:
      - The original position 'c' in the output row is set to white(0).
      - The destination 'dest_c' in the output row is set to green(3).
      - The column 'dest_c' is marked as occupied by a moved pixel for subsequent checks within the same row.
  - step_5_failure_to_move: If the initial target was blocked by a stationary pixel (step 1), or if collision pushing (step 3) results in 'dest_c' going out of bounds, the green pixel remains in its original position 'c'.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Process each row of the grid independently from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Create a reference copy of the *original* state of this row.
    b.  Identify the column indices of all green (3) pixels in the original row.
    c.  Determine the target column for each green pixel: Scan leftwards from the column to the left of the green pixel. The target column is one column to the right of the first (leftmost) azure (8) pixel found. If no azure pixel is found to the left, the target column is 0.
    d.  Identify which green pixels are "stationary": those whose target column is the same as their original column. Create a set of stationary green pixel columns.
    e.  Create an empty set, `occupied_moved_destinations`, to track columns that become occupied by *moved* green pixels during this row's processing.
    f.  Process the green pixels found in step 3b in order from the rightmost column index (`c`) to the leftmost.
    g.  For each green pixel at original column `c` with target column `target_c`:
        i.  If `c` equals `target_c` (the pixel is stationary), do nothing and proceed to the next green pixel.
        ii. If `c` does not equal `target_c` (the pixel wants to move):
            1.  Check for stationary conflict: If `target_c` is in the set of `stationary_green_columns`, this pixel cannot move. Do nothing and proceed to the next green pixel.
            2.  If `target_c` is not blocked by a stationary green pixel, calculate the final destination column `dest_c`, initially setting `dest_c = target_c`.
            3.  Check for dynamic conflict: While the column index `dest_c` is present in the `occupied_moved_destinations` set, increment `dest_c` by 1.
            4.  Check bounds and place: If the resulting `dest_c` is still within the grid's width:
                A.  Add `dest_c` to the `occupied_moved_destinations` set.
                B.  Update the output grid: Set the pixel at (current row, `c`) to white (0).
                C.  Update the output grid: Set the pixel at (current row, `dest_c`) to green (3).
            5.  If `dest_c` went out of bounds during the dynamic conflict resolution (step 3.g.ii.3), the pixel cannot be placed and effectively stays in its original position `c` (no changes needed to the output grid for this pixel as it started green).
4.  Return the final modified output grid.
