            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code successfully transformed Examples 1 and 2 but failed on Example 3. The failure occurred in the second row (index 1) of Example 3.\n\n*   Input Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3]`\n*   Expected Output Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3]`\n*   Transformed Output Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0]`\n\nThe discrepancy lies at the last column (index 7). The green pixel originally at `(1, 7)` was incorrectly moved by the code, resulting in a white pixel `(0)` at `(1, 7)` in the transformed output, whereas it should have remained green `(3)`.\n\nThe core issue seems to be how collisions or overlapping targets are handled, especially when a green pixel targets the location of another green pixel that isn't supposed to move. The original logic allowed the pixel from `(1, 7)` (target column 6) to claim column 6, erasing itself from column 7. However, the pixel at `(1, 6)` also had target column 6 (meaning it should stay put). The expected output suggests that if a green pixel's target destination is already the designated final spot for *another* green pixel (specifically, one that started there and isn't moving), the first pixel cannot move and must remain in its original position.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the logic to account for this specific type of conflict: a moving pixel targeting the position of a stationary pixel.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's confirm the grid details for Example 3:\n"
