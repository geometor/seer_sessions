task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed 8x8 for all provided examples.
  static_colors:
    - color_name: yellow
      value: 4
      behavior: Unchanged position from input to output.
    - color_name: orange
      value: 7
      behavior: Unchanged position from input to output.
  dynamic_colors:
    description: All colors present in the input grid other than yellow(4) and orange(7).
    behavior: Participate in conditional color swaps.
transformation_rules:
  - condition: The set of dynamic colors is {blue(1), red(2), green(3), magenta(6)}.
    action:
      - swap: [blue(1), green(3)]
      - swap: [red(2), magenta(6)]
  - condition: The set of dynamic colors is {blue(1), magenta(6), maroon(9)}.
    action:
      - swap: [blue(1), maroon(9)]
      - unchanged: [magenta(6)] # Explicitly note colors that are dynamic but not swapped in this case.
  - condition: The set of dynamic colors is {gray(5), magenta(6)}.
    action:
      - swap: [gray(5), magenta(6)]
pixel_level_mapping:
  process: Apply the determined swaps/unchanged rules to each pixel based on its color.
  input_color: yellow(4) -> output_color: yellow(4)
  input_color: orange(7) -> output_color: orange(7)
  input_color: dynamic_color_X -> output_color: Mapped color based on the rules determined by the set of dynamic colors present.
