            "text": "Let's look at counts and swaps:\n*   **train_1:** Colors: {1: 6, 2: 3, 3: 10, 4: 25, 6: 3, 7: 17}. Swaps: (1, 3), (2, 6). Unchanged: (4, 7). Notice that the counts for the swapped pairs are related: count(2) == count(6) == 3. But count(1)=6 and count(3)=10 are not equal.\n*   **train_2:** Colors: {1: 3, 4: 15, 6: 16, 7: 15, 9: 15}. Swap: (1, 9). Unchanged: (4, 6, 7). Here count(1)=3, count(9)=15. Not equal. Note count(4)=count(7)=count(9)=15.\n*   **train_3:** Colors: {4: 11, 5: 16, 6: 17, 7: 20}. Swap: (5, 6). Unchanged: (4, 7). count(5)=16, count(6)=17. Not equal (but close).\n\nThe count equality worked for one pair in train_1, but not otherwise. It doesn't seem reliable.\n\nWhat if we consider the *set* of colors present, excluding the background (white - 0, though none here)?\nDoes the set of colors define the swaps?\n*   Set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} -> Swaps (1, 3), (2, 6)\n*   Set2 = {1, 4, 6, 7, 9} -> Swap (1, 9)\n*   Set3 = {4, 5, 6, 7} -> Swap (5, 6)\n\nThis looks like a fixed mapping based on the *set* of colors present (excluding 4 and 7 perhaps?).\nIf the set of non-4/7 colors is {1, 2, 3, 6}, then swap (1,3) and (2,6).\nIf the set of non-4/7 colors is {1, 6, 9}, then swap (1,9) and leave 6 alone.\nIf the set of non-4/7 colors is {5, 6}, then swap (5,6).\n\nThis seems plausible. The exact transformation depends on the specific combination of colors found in the input, focusing on those other than yellow (4) and orange (7).\n\n**Final Hypothesis:**\n1.  Create a copy of the input grid for the output.\n2.  Identify the set of unique colors present in the input grid, excluding yellow (4) and orange (7). Let this set be `S`.\n3.  Determine the swap pairs based on the content of `S`:\n    *   If `S` is {1, 2, 3, 6}, the swap pairs are (1, 3) and (2, 6).\n    *   If `S` is {1, 6, 9}, the swap pair is (1, 9). Color 6 remains unchanged.\n    *   If `S` is {5, 6}, the swap pair is (5, 6).\n    *   (Need to assume this covers all cases or can be generalized).\n4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n5.  Let `color = input_grid[r, c]`.\n6.  If `color` is 4 or 7, `output_grid[r, c] = color`.\n7.  If `color` is part of a swap pair `(a, b)` defined in step 3, set `output_grid[r, c]` to the *other* color in the pair (if `color == a`, set to `b`; if `color == b`, set to `a`).\n8.  If `color` is in `S` but is not part of any swap pair (e.g., color 6 in the case where `S` is {1, 6, 9}), set `output_grid[r, c] = color`.\n9.  Return the modified output grid.\n\nThis seems like a complete description covering all examples. The core idea is a conditional color swap based on the specific set of \"active\" (non-4, non-7) colors present.\n\n**YAML Facts Structure:**\n*   Objects: Pixels, Grid\n*   Properties: Color (value 0-9), Position (row, col)\n*   Relationships: Colors 4 (yellow) and 7 (orange) are 'static'. Other colors are 'dynamic'.\n*   Actions: Identify unique dynamic colors. Determine swap pairs based on the *set* of dynamic colors. Apply swaps pixel by pixel.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2.  Find all unique colors in the input grid, excluding yellow (4) and orange (7). Call this the set of dynamic colors.\n3.  Define the color swaps based on the identified set of dynamic colors:\n    *   If the set is {blue(1), red(2), green(3), magenta(6)}, then map blue(1) to green(3), green(3) to blue(1), red(2) to magenta(6), and magenta(6) to red(2).\n    *   If the set is {blue(1), magenta(6), maroon(9)}, then map blue(1) to maroon(9), maroon(9) to blue(1). Magenta(6) maps to itself.\n    *   If the set is {gray(5), magenta(6)}, then map gray(5) to magenta(6), and magenta(6) to gray(5).\n    *   (Assume these cover the necessary cases or a general rule exists for other sets).\n4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n5.  Get the color of the current pixel.\n6.  If the color is yellow (4) or orange (7), keep the color the same in the output grid.\n7.  If the color is one of the dynamic colors, replace it in the output grid with the color it maps to according to the swaps defined in step 3.\n8.  The resulting grid is the final output.Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 8x8 grids.\n2.  **Colors Present:** The examples involve various colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), maroon (9).\n3.  **Static Colors:** Across all three examples, yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels appear to maintain their exact positions from input to output. They form a kind of structural background or frame that doesn't participate in the main transformation.\n4.  **Dynamic Colors:** The other colors present in each example (excluding yellow and orange) seem to change. Specifically, certain pairs of colors swap places.\n5.  **Example 1:** Blue (1) swaps with Green (3). Red (2) swaps with Magenta (6).\n6.  **Example 2:** Blue (1) swaps with Maroon (9). Magenta (6) remains unchanged.\n7.  **Example 3:** Gray (5) swaps with Magenta (6).\n8.  **Pattern Identification:** The core transformation is a color substitution or swap. The specific swaps depend on the *set* of \"dynamic\" colors (those other than yellow and orange) present in the input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
