task_context:
  grid_size: [8, 8]
  static_elements:
    - element_type: background
      color: 7 # Orange
      location: all cells not occupied by border or objects
    - element_type: border
      color: 8 # Azure
      location: all cells in the last row (row index 7)
  dynamic_elements:
    - element_type: object
      description: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than 7 (Orange) or 8 (Azure).
      properties:
        - color: Varies (e.g., 9, 2, 3, 1, 4)
        - shape: Varies (e.g., L-shape, bar, block, single pixel)
        - size: Measured by the number of pixels (P)
        - position: Defined by the set of coordinates (row, column) for its pixels.
      actions:
        - action_type: vertical_shift
          direction: upwards
          magnitude_determinant: size (number of pixels P)
          rule: shift_amount = P
relationships:
  - Each object's transformation is independent of other objects' initial positions but depends solely on its own size.
  - Objects maintain their internal structure (shape) and color during the shift.
  - The final position of an object is its initial position shifted upwards by P rows.
