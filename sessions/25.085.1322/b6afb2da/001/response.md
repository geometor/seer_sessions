```python
"""
Recolors pixels within each gray (5) object based on the number of gray neighbors 
in the 8-directional vicinity (Moore neighborhood).

1. Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
3. If the pixel at (r, c) is gray (5):
    a. Count the number of its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) 
       that are also gray (5). Let this count be `num_gray_neighbors`.
    b. Based on `num_gray_neighbors`, determine the new color for the pixel 
       at (r, c) in the output grid:
        i. If `num_gray_neighbors` is less than 5, set the output pixel color 
           to blue (1). (Corresponds to corners/endpoints).
       ii. If `num_gray_neighbors` is 5, 6, or 7, set the output pixel color 
           to yellow (4). (Corresponds to edges).
      iii. If `num_gray_neighbors` is 8, set the output pixel color 
           to red (2). (Corresponds to interior).
4. White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.
5. Return the modified output grid.
