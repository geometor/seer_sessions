Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.\n3. If the pixel at (r, c) is gray (5):\n    a. Count the number of its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) \n       that are also gray (5). Let this count be `num_gray_neighbors`.\n    b. Based on `num_gray_neighbors`, determine the new color for the pixel \n       at (r, c) in the output grid:\n        i. If `num_gray_neighbors` is less than 5, set the output pixel color \n           to blue (1). (Corresponds to corners/endpoints).\n       ii. If `num_gray_neighbors` is 5, 6, or 7, set the output pixel color \n           to yellow (4). (Corresponds to edges).\n      iii. If `num_gray_neighbors` is 8, set the output pixel color \n           to red (2). (Corresponds to interior).\n4. White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.\n5.
