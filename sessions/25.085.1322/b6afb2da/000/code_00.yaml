Input_Grid:
  description: A 2D grid of pixels with integer values 0-9.
  contains:
    - Background:
        color: white (0)
    - Gray_Objects:
        description: One or more distinct, contiguous areas of gray (5) pixels.
        properties:
          - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates.
          - shape: Variable (appears rectangular in examples).
          - color: gray (5)

Output_Grid:
  description: A 2D grid resulting from transforming the Input_Grid.
  size: Same dimensions as Input_Grid.
  contains:
    - Background:
        color: white (0)
        relationship: Unchanged from Input_Grid.
    - Transformed_Objects:
        description: Areas corresponding to the original Gray_Objects, now recolored.
        pixels:
          - description: Pixels derived from original Gray_Pixels.
          - properties:
              - color: blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4)
              - original_color: gray (5)
              - location: (row, col)
              - classification: corner, edge, or interior (relative to the original Gray_Object)

Transformation_Rule:
  description: Recolors pixels within each Gray_Object based on local neighborhood within that object.
  scope: Acts independently on each identified Gray_Object.
  mapping:
    - condition: Gray_Pixel has < 5 gray neighbors (within the same object, 8-connectivity).
      action: Recolor pixel to blue (1). (Corresponds to corners/endpoints).
    - condition: Gray_Pixel has 5, 6, or 7 gray neighbors (within the same object, 8-connectivity).
      action: Recolor pixel to yellow (4). (Corresponds to edges).
    - condition: Gray_Pixel has 8 gray neighbors (within the same object, 8-connectivity).
      action: Recolor pixel to red (2). (Corresponds to interior).
  unchanged: White (0) background pixels remain white (0).
