            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The examples show 10x10 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background and gray (5) forming objects in the input. The output introduces blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) replacing the gray pixels.\n3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain one or more distinct, contiguous objects made entirely of gray (5) pixels. These objects appear to be rectangular in the examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation acts upon the gray objects. The background white pixels remain unchanged. Each gray pixel within an object is recolored based on its position *relative to that specific object*.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** By comparing the input gray objects to their corresponding colored versions in the output, a consistent pattern emerges:\n    *   Pixels at the \"corners\" of the gray object become blue (1).\n    *   Pixels along the \"edges\" (but not corners) become yellow (4).\n    *   Pixels in the \"interior\" of the object become red (2).\n6.  **Neighbor Analysis:** The classification of a gray pixel (corner, edge, interior) seems dependent on its neighboring pixels *that are also part of the same gray object*. Counting the number of gray neighbors in the 8-directional vicinity (Moore neighborhood) appears to determine the output color:\n    *   A gray pixel with exactly 8 gray neighbors (meaning it's fully surrounded by other gray pixels of the same object) becomes red (2) - an interior pixel.\n    *   A gray pixel with 5, 6, or 7 gray neighbors becomes yellow (4) - an edge pixel.\n    *   A gray pixel with fewer than 5 gray neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) becomes blue (1) - a corner pixel (or potentially part of a very thin section). This rule correctly identifies the corners in the rectangular examples, which have 3 gray neighbors.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
