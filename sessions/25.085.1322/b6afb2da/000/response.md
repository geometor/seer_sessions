Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The examples show 10x10 grids.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background and gray (5) forming objects in the input. The output introduces blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) replacing the gray pixels.
3.  **Objects:** The input grids contain one or more distinct, contiguous objects made entirely of gray (5) pixels. These objects appear to be rectangular in the examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation acts upon the gray objects. The background white pixels remain unchanged. Each gray pixel within an object is recolored based on its position *relative to that specific object*.
5.  **Pattern Recognition:** By comparing the input gray objects to their corresponding colored versions in the output, a consistent pattern emerges:
    *   Pixels at the "corners" of the gray object become blue (1).
    *   Pixels along the "edges" (but not corners) become yellow (4).
    *   Pixels in the "interior" of the object become red (2).
6.  **Neighbor Analysis:** The classification of a gray pixel (corner, edge, interior) seems dependent on its neighboring pixels *that are also part of the same gray object*. Counting the number of gray neighbors in the 8-directional vicinity (Moore neighborhood) appears to determine the output color:
    *   A gray pixel with exactly 8 gray neighbors (meaning it's fully surrounded by other gray pixels of the same object) becomes red (2) - an interior pixel.
    *   A gray pixel with 5, 6, or 7 gray neighbors becomes yellow (4) - an edge pixel.
    *   A gray pixel with fewer than 5 gray neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) becomes blue (1) - a corner pixel (or potentially part of a very thin section). This rule correctly identifies the corners in the rectangular examples, which have 3 gray neighbors.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  description: A 2D grid of pixels with integer values 0-9.
  contains:
    - Background:
        color: white (0)
    - Gray_Objects:
        description: One or more distinct, contiguous areas of gray (5) pixels.
        properties:
          - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates.
          - shape: Variable (appears rectangular in examples).
          - color: gray (5)

Output_Grid:
  description: A 2D grid resulting from transforming the Input_Grid.
  size: Same dimensions as Input_Grid.
  contains:
    - Background:
        color: white (0)
        relationship: Unchanged from Input_Grid.
    - Transformed_Objects:
        description: Areas corresponding to the original Gray_Objects, now recolored.
        pixels:
          - description: Pixels derived from original Gray_Pixels.
          - properties:
              - color: blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4)
              - original_color: gray (5)
              - location: (row, col)
              - classification: corner, edge, or interior (relative to the original Gray_Object)

Transformation_Rule:
  description: Recolors pixels within each Gray_Object based on local neighborhood within that object.
  scope: Acts independently on each identified Gray_Object.
  mapping:
    - condition: Gray_Pixel has < 5 gray neighbors (within the same object, 8-connectivity).
      action: Recolor pixel to blue (1). (Corresponds to corners/endpoints).
    - condition: Gray_Pixel has 5, 6, or 7 gray neighbors (within the same object, 8-connectivity).
      action: Recolor pixel to yellow (4). (Corresponds to edges).
    - condition: Gray_Pixel has 8 gray neighbors (within the same object, 8-connectivity).
      action: Recolor pixel to red (2). (Corresponds to interior).
  unchanged: White (0) background pixels remain white (0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous groups (objects) of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each gray object found:
    a.  Create a list of the coordinates `(r, c)` for all pixels belonging to this specific object.
    b.  For each pixel `(r, c)` in this list:
        i.  Count how many of its 8 neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are also gray pixels *belonging to the same object*. Let this count be `num_gray_neighbors`.
        ii. Based on `num_gray_neighbors`, determine the new color for the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid:
            *   If `num_gray_neighbors` is less than 5, set the output pixel color to blue (1).
            *   If `num_gray_neighbors` is 5, 6, or 7, set the output pixel color to yellow (4).
            *   If `num_gray_neighbors` is 8, set the output pixel color to red (2).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
