Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0) and one or more solid rectangular objects of a single color (yellow, color 4, in the examples).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the overall dimensions and the background color of the input. The positions and the outer border color of the input rectangular objects are preserved.
3.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation occurs *inside* the rectangular objects found in the input. The interior pixels of these rectangles change color. Pixels forming the one-pixel-thick border of the rectangle retain their original color (yellow).
4.  **Interior Color Logic:** The color used to fill the interior depends on the dimensions of the interior itself.
    *   In `train_1`, a 5x5 yellow rectangle becomes yellow borders with a 3x3 red (2) interior. A 3x4 yellow rectangle becomes yellow borders with a 1x2 blue (1) interior.
    *   In `train_2`, a 4x4 yellow rectangle becomes yellow borders with a 2x2 blue (1) interior. A 4x6 yellow rectangle becomes yellow borders with a 2x4 red (2) interior.
5.  **Color Rule Deduction:** By comparing the interior dimensions and the resulting fill color:
    *   3x3 (width 3) -> Red (2)
    *   1x2 (width 2) -> Blue (1)
    *   2x2 (width 2) -> Blue (1)
    *   2x4 (width 4) -> Red (2)
    It appears the fill color is determined by the *width* of the interior region: if the interior width is greater than 2, the fill color is red (2); otherwise (if the width is 1 or 2), the fill color is blue (1).
6.  **Object Integrity:** Only solid rectangular objects are modified. The transformation effectively "hollows out" these rectangles, changing the core color based on its width. Rectangles that are too small to have an interior (width or height <= 2) would presumably remain unchanged (though not explicitly shown in these examples).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: object_transformation
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4) # In examples, potentially others
      - shape: solid_rectangle
      - location: variable
      - size: variable (width >= 1, height >= 1)
background_color: white (0)
transformation:
  - action: find_objects
    filter:
      - property: color
        value: non_background (e.g., yellow(4))
      - property: shape
        value: solid_rectangle
  - action: modify_object
    target: solid_rectangle objects found
    condition: object width > 2 AND object height > 2 # Must have an interior
    steps:
      - identify_border: pixels on the outermost layer of the rectangle
      - identify_interior: pixels inside the border
      - calculate_interior_dimensions:
          interior_width = object_width - 2
          interior_height = object_height - 2
      - determine_fill_color:
          if interior_width > 2:
            fill_color = red (2)
          else: # interior_width <= 2
            fill_color = blue (1)
      - apply_fill: change the color of interior pixels to fill_color
      - preserve_border: keep the border pixels' original color
output_grid:
  - inherits: input grid dimensions
  - inherits: input background color
  - contains: modified objects (hollowed rectangles with colored interiors)
  - contains: unmodified objects (if any did not meet modification criteria)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, connected groups of pixels that are not the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each identified group (object):
    a.  Determine the bounding box of the object.
    b.  Check if the object perfectly fills its bounding box (i.e., it is a solid rectangle).
    c.  Check if the object's width and height are both greater than 2.
    d.  If the object is a solid rectangle with width > 2 and height > 2:
        i.  Calculate the width of the interior region: `interior_width = object_width - 2`.
        ii. Determine the fill color: If `interior_width > 2`, the fill color is red (2). Otherwise, the fill color is blue (1).
        iii. Iterate through the pixels within the object's bounding box in the output grid.
        iv. If a pixel is *not* on the one-pixel-thick outer border of the bounding box (i.e., it's an interior pixel), change its color to the determined `fill_color`. Leave the border pixels unchanged.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
