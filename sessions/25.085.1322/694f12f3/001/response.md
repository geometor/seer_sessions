"""
Identifies solid rectangular objects of any non-background color in the input grid.
For each such rectangle with both width and height greater than 2, it modifies the rectangle 
in the output grid:
1. The one-pixel-thick border of the rectangle retains its original color.
2. The interior pixels of the rectangle are filled with a new color determined by the 
   width of the interior region (interior_width = rectangle_width - 2).
3. If interior_width > 2, the fill color is red (2).
4. Otherwise (if interior_width <= 2), the fill color is blue (1).
Rectangles with width or height <= 2, or objects that are not solid rectangles, remain unchanged.
The background (color 0) also remains unchanged.
