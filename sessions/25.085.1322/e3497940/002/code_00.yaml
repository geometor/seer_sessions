- task_name: crop_left_of_gray_line
- description: Extract the portion of the grid to the left of a vertical gray line.
- observations:
    - Each input grid contains exactly one vertical line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
    - This gray line spans the full height of the input grid.
    - The gray line acts as a separator.
    - The output grid consists of all columns to the *left* of the gray line column.
    - The output grid has the same height as the input grid.
    - The width of the output grid is equal to the column index of the gray line.
    - The pixel values in the output grid are identical to the corresponding pixels in the input grid's left portion.
- examples_analysis:
    - example_1:
        - input_shape: (10, 9)
        - gray_line_column_index: 4
        - expected_output_shape: (10, 4)
        - assertion: Input columns 0 through 3 match the expected output exactly. (Verified True by tool code)
    - example_2:
        - input_shape: (10, 9)
        - gray_line_column_index: 4
        - expected_output_shape: (10, 4)
        - assertion: Input columns 0 through 3 match the expected output exactly. (Verified True by tool code)
    - example_3:
        - input_shape: (10, 9)
        - gray_line_column_index: 4
        - expected_output_shape: (10, 4)
        - assertion: Input columns 0 through 3 match the expected output exactly. (Verified True by tool code)
