1. Identify the column index (C_gray) containing the vertical line of gray (5) pixels that spans the entire height of the input grid.
2. Initialize the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid to the left of this gray line (columns 0 to C_gray - 1). The output grid has the same height as the input and width C_gray.
3. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid to the *right* of the gray line (column index c_right > C_gray).
4. If a pixel at (r, c_right) is not white (color 0), calculate its horizontal reflection target column index c_target = C_gray - (c_right - C_gray).
5. Update the pixel at position (r, c_target) in the output grid with the color of the input pixel at (r, c_right).
