This line appears consistently in the 5th column (index 4) across all examples.\n2.  **Other Objects:** Various colored pixels and shapes (red, magenta, yellow, green, orange, azure) are present on both sides of the gray line. The background is white (0).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is smaller in width than the input grid but retains the same height. It contains only the pixels that were originally to the *right* of the gray line in the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The gray line itself and all pixels to its left are removed. The pixels originally to the right of the gray line form the new grid, shifted leftwards to start at column 0. Their relative vertical and horizontal positions *within that right-hand section* are preserved.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
