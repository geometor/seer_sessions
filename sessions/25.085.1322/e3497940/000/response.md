Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid features a prominent vertical line of gray (5) pixels. This line appears consistently in the 5th column (index 4) across all examples.
2.  **Other Objects:** Various colored pixels and shapes (red, magenta, yellow, green, orange, azure) are present on both sides of the gray line. The background is white (0).
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is smaller in width than the input grid but retains the same height. It contains only the pixels that were originally to the *right* of the gray line in the input grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The gray line itself and all pixels to its left are removed. The pixels originally to the right of the gray line form the new grid, shifted leftwards to start at column 0. Their relative vertical and horizontal positions *within that right-hand section* are preserved.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
facts:
  - GIVEN: An input grid (width W_in, height H_in).
  - FIND: A vertical line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
    - PROPERTY: This line spans the full height of the grid.
    - PROPERTY: Let the column index of this line be C_gray.
  - OBSERVE: In all examples, C_gray is 4 and W_in is 9.
  - ACTION: Create a new output grid.
  - ACTION_DETAIL: Populate the output grid using pixels from the input grid.
  - SELECTION_CRITERIA: Select only the columns from the input grid whose index `j` satisfies `j > C_gray`.
  - OUTPUT_GRID_DIMENSIONS:
    - Height H_out = H_in.
    - Width W_out = W_in - (C_gray + 1).
  - MAPPING:
    - Input pixel at `(row_i, col_j)` where `col_j > C_gray` maps to Output pixel at `(row_i, col_j - (C_gray + 1))`.
  - EXAMPLE_SPECIFIC (train_1, train_2, train_3):
    - Input: 9x10
    - Gray line column C_gray = 4
    - Output: 4x10 (columns 5, 6, 7, 8 from input become columns 0, 1, 2, 3 in output)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the column index (`C_gray`) containing the vertical line of gray (5) pixels that spans the entire height of the input grid.
2.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (width `W_in`, height `H_in`).
3.  Calculate the width of the output grid: `W_out = W_in - (C_gray + 1)`. The height remains the same: `H_out = H_in`.
4.  Create a new grid with dimensions `W_out` x `H_out`.
5.  For each row `r` from 0 to `H_in - 1`:
    For each column `c` from `C_gray + 1` to `W_in - 1`:
    Copy the pixel value from the input grid at `(r, c)` to the output grid at position `(r, c - (C_gray + 1))`.
6.  Return the newly created grid.
