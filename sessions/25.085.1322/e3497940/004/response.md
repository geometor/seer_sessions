Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the task's primary structural element: a vertical gray line acting as a separator. It also correctly deduced that the output grid's width is determined by the column index of this gray line. However, the code simply truncated the input grid, keeping only the portion to the left of the gray line.

The comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals that the simple truncation is insufficient. The `Expected Output` contains pixels that are *not* present in the corresponding left portion of the input grid. These differing pixels suggest a more complex interaction between the left and right sides of the input grid, mediated by the gray line.

The strategy will be:
1.  Verify the location of the gray line in each example.
2.  Confirm that the output size matches the input's left partition size.
3.  Analyze the differences between the input's left partition and the expected output.
4.  Hypothesize how the input's right partition influences the final output, focusing on the mismatched pixels.
5.  Validate the hypothesis across all examples.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's analyze each example to pinpoint the transformation rule. We'll denote the input grid as `I`, the output grid as `O`, the gray line column index as `C_gray`. The left partition `L` is `I[:, :C_gray]` and the right partition `R` is `I[:, C_gray+1:]`.

**Example 1:**
*   Input `I`: 10x9
*   Gray line `C_gray`: 4
*   Left partition `L` (10x4): `I[:, :4]`
*   Right partition `R` (10x4): `I[:, 5:]`
*   Expected Output `O` (10x4)

Let's compare `L` with `O` row by row and note differences:
*   Row 2: `L[2] = [0, 0, 0, 2]`, `O[2] = [0, 0, 6, 2]`. Difference at `O[2, 2] = 6`. Where does `6` come from? `R[2] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`. Hmm, looking elsewhere in the input, `I[2, 6] = 6`. Column 6 is 2 steps right of the gray line (4). Column 2 is 2 steps left of the gray line. `4 - (6 - 4) = 2`.
*   Row 4: `L[4] = [0, 0, 0, 2]`, `O[4] = [0, 2, 2, 2]`. Differences at `O[4, 1]=2`, `O[4, 2]=2`. `R[4] = [2, 2, 2, 0]`.
    *   `I[4, 5] = 2`. Col 5 is 1 step right. Col 3 (`4 - (5 - 4) = 3`) in `O` is `2` (matches `L`).
    *   `I[4, 6] = 2`. Col 6 is 2 steps right. Col 2 (`4 - (6 - 4) = 2`) in `O` is `2` (difference from `L`).
    *   `I[4, 7] = 2`. Col 7 is 3 steps right. Col 1 (`4 - (7 - 4) = 1`) in `O` is `2` (difference from `L`).
*   Row 7: `L[7] = [0, 2, 2, 0]`, `O[7] = [0, 2, 2, 2]`. Difference at `O[7, 3]=2`. `R[7] = [2, 0, 0, 0]`.
    *   `I[7, 5] = 2`. Col 5 is 1 step right. Col 3 (`4 - (5 - 4) = 3`) in `O` is `2` (difference from `L`).

**Hypothesis:** The output grid `O` is initialized with the left partition `L`. Then, for each non-white pixel (color != 0) at `I[r, c_right]` where `c_right > C_gray`, its color overwrites the pixel in the output grid at `O[r, C_gray - (c_right - C_gray)]`. This is a reflection across the gray line.

**Example 2:**
*   Input `I`: 10x9
*   Gray line `C_gray`: 4
*   Left partition `L`: `I[:, :4]`
*   Right partition `R`: `I[:, 5:]`
*   Expected Output `O`: 10x4

Apply hypothesis:
*   Initialize `O` with `L`.
*   `I[3, 5] = 4` -> `O[3, 4-(5-4)=3] = 4` (overwrites 4)
*   `I[3, 6] = 4` -> `O[3, 4-(6-4)=2] = 4` (overwrites 0) -> `O[3] = [0, 0, 4, 4]` (Matches Expected)
*   `I[6, 5] = 3` -> `O[6, 4-(5-4)=3] = 3` (overwrites 3)
*   `I[6, 6] = 3` -> `O[6, 4-(6-4)=2] = 3` (overwrites 0)
*   `I[6, 7] = 3` -> `O[6, 4-(7-4)=1] = 3` (overwrites 0) -> `O[6] = [0, 3, 3, 3]` (Matches Expected)
*   Hypothesis holds for Example 2.

**Example 3:**
*   Input `I`: 10x9
*   Gray line `C_gray`: 4
*   Left partition `L`: `I[:, :4]`
*   Right partition `R`: `I[:, 5:]`
*   Expected Output `O`: 10x4

Apply hypothesis:
*   Initialize `O` with `L`.
*   `I[1, 5] = 7` -> `O[1, 4-(5-4)=3] = 7` (overwrites 0) -> `O[1] = [0, 0, 0, 7]` (Matches Expected)
*   `I[5, 5] = 8` -> `O[5, 4-(5-4)=3] = 8` (overwrites 0)
*   `I[5, 6] = 8` -> `O[5, 4-(6-4)=2] = 8` (overwrites 0) -> `O[5] = [0, 0, 8, 8]` (Matches Expected)
*   `I[8, 5] = 8` -> `O[8, 4-(5-4)=3] = 8` (overwrites 0)
*   `I[8, 6] = 7` -> `O[8, 4-(6-4)=2] = 7` (overwrites 0) -> `O[8] = [0, 0, 7, 8]` (Matches Expected)
*   Hypothesis holds for Example 3.

Let's use `tool_code` to verify the calculations for one point. Example 1, `I[4, 7] = 2`. `C_gray = 4`. Expected target column = `4 - (7 - 4) = 1`.

c_gray = -1
height, width = input_grid_1.shape
for col_idx in range(width):
    if np.all(input_grid_1[:, col_idx] == gray_color):
        c_gray = col_idx
        break

print(f"{c_gray=}")

print(f"Expected Output value at O[{r}, {target_c}]: {expected_output_1[r, target_c]}")
```
```
c_gray=4
Source: I[4, 7] = 2
Target column calculation: 4 - (7 - 4) = 1
Expected Output value at O[4, 1]: 2
Source: I[2, 6] = 6
Target column calculation: 4 - (6 - 4) = 2
Expected Output value at O[2, 2]: 6

```
The calculations confirm the hypothesis: the non-white pixels from the right partition are reflected horizontally across the axis defined by the gray line and overwrite the corresponding pixels in the left partition to produce the output.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Separator:** Scan the input grid column by column to locate the vertical line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels that spans the grid's full height. Let the index of this column be `C_gray`.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same height as the input grid and a width equal to `C_gray`. Copy the content of the input grid from columns 0 up to (but not including) `C_gray` into this new output grid.
3.  **Reflect Right onto Left:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid located to the *right* of the gray line (i.e., where the column index `c_right` is greater than `C_gray`).
4.  **Apply Reflection:** If a pixel at `(r, c_right)` is not white (color 0), calculate its reflection target column index `c_target = C_gray - (c_right - C_gray)`.
5.  **Overlay Pixel:** Update the pixel at position `(r, c_target)` in the output grid with the color of the pixel found at `(r, c_right)` in the input grid. Ensure `c_target` is a valid column index (>= 0) before updating. (Note: Given `c_right > C_gray`, `c_right - C_gray >= 1`, so `c_target <= C_gray - 1`, ensuring it's always within the output grid's bounds if `C_gray > 0`. If `C_gray = 0`, the output is empty and this step is skipped).
6.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid after all reflections and overlays are applied is the final output.
