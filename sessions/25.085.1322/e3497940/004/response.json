            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the task's primary structural element: a vertical gray line acting as a separator. It also correctly deduced that the output grid's width is determined by the column index of this gray line. However, the code simply truncated the input grid, keeping only the portion to the left of the gray line.\n\nThe comparison between the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` reveals that the simple truncation is insufficient. The `Expected Output` contains pixels that are *not* present in the corresponding left portion of the input grid. These differing pixels suggest a more complex interaction between the left and right sides of the input grid, mediated by the gray line.\n\nThe strategy will be:\n1.  Verify the location of the gray line in each example.\n2.  Confirm that the output size matches the input's left partition size.\n3.  Analyze the differences between the input's left partition and the expected output.\n4.  Hypothesize how the input's right partition influences the final output, focusing on the mismatched pixels.\n5.  Validate the hypothesis across all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each example to pinpoint the transformation rule. We'll denote the input grid as `I`, the output grid as `O`, the gray line column index as `C_gray`. The left partition `L` is `I[:, :C_gray]` and the right partition `R` is `I[:, C_gray+1:]`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input `I`: 10x9\n*   Gray line `C_gray`: 4\n*   Left partition `L` (10x4): `I[:, :4]`\n*   Right partition `R` (10x4): `I[:, 5:]`\n*   Expected Output `O` (10x4)\n\nLet's compare `L` with `O` row by row and note differences:\n*   Row 2: `L[2] = [0, 0, 0, 2]`, `O[2] = [0, 0, 6, 2]`. Difference at `O[2, 2] = 6`. Where does `6` come from? `R[2] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`. Hmm, looking elsewhere in the input, `I[2, 6] = 6`. Column 6 is 2 steps right of the gray line (4). Column 2 is 2 steps left of the gray line. `4 - (6 - 4) = 2`.\n*   Row 4: `L[4] = [0, 0, 0, 2]`, `O[4] = [0, 2, 2, 2]`. Differences at `O[4, 1]=2`, `O[4, 2]=2`. `R[4] = [2, 2, 2, 0]`.\n    *   `I[4, 5] = 2`. Col 5 is 1 step right. Col 3 (`4 - (5 - 4) = 3`) in `O` is `2` (matches `L`).\n    *   `I[4, 6] = 2`. Col 6 is 2 steps right. Col 2 (`4 - (6 - 4) = 2`) in `O` is `2` (difference from `L`).\n    *   `I[4, 7] = 2`. Col 7 is 3 steps right. Col 1 (`4 - (7 - 4) = 1`) in `O` is `2` (difference from `L`).\n*   Row 7: `L[7] = [0, 2, 2, 0]`, `O[7] = [0, 2, 2, 2]`. Difference at `O[7, 3]=2`. `R[7] = [2, 0, 0, 0]`.\n    *   `I[7, 5] = 2`. Col 5 is 1 step right. Col 3 (`4 - (5 - 4) = 3`) in `O` is `2` (difference from `L`).\n\n**Hypothesis:** The output grid `O` is initialized with the left partition `L`. Then, for each non-white pixel (color != 0) at `I[r, c_right]` where `c_right > C_gray`, its color overwrites the pixel in the output grid at `O[r, C_gray - (c_right - C_gray)]`. This is a reflection across the gray line.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input `I`: 10x9\n*   Gray line `C_gray`: 4\n*   Left partition `L`: `I[:, :4]`\n*   Right partition `R`: `I[:, 5:]`\n*   Expected Output `O`: 10x4\n\nApply hypothesis:\n*   Initialize `O` with `L`.\n*   `I[3, 5] = 4` -> `O[3, 4-(5-4)=3] = 4` (overwrites 4)\n*   `I[3, 6] = 4` -> `O[3, 4-(6-4)=2] = 4` (overwrites 0) -> `O[3] = [0, 0, 4, 4]` (Matches Expected)\n*   `I[6, 5] = 3` -> `O[6, 4-(5-4)=3] = 3` (overwrites 3)\n*   `I[6, 6] = 3` -> `O[6, 4-(6-4)=2] = 3` (overwrites 0)\n*   `I[6, 7] = 3` -> `O[6, 4-(7-4)=1] = 3` (overwrites 0) -> `O[6] = [0, 3, 3, 3]` (Matches Expected)\n*   Hypothesis holds for Example 2.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   Input `I`: 10x9\n*   Gray line `C_gray`: 4\n*   Left partition `L`: `I[:, :4]`\n*   Right partition `R`: `I[:, 5:]`\n*   Expected Output `O`: 10x4\n\nApply hypothesis:\n*   Initialize `O` with `L`.\n*   `I[1, 5] = 7` -> `O[1, 4-(5-4)=3] = 7` (overwrites 0) -> `O[1] = [0, 0, 0, 7]` (Matches Expected)\n*   `I[5, 5] = 8` -> `O[5, 4-(5-4)=3] = 8` (overwrites 0)\n*   `I[5, 6] = 8` -> `O[5, 4-(6-4)=2] = 8` (overwrites 0) -> `O[5] = [0, 0, 8, 8]` (Matches Expected)\n*   `I[8, 5] = 8` -> `O[8, 4-(5-4)=3] = 8` (overwrites 0)\n*   `I[8, 6] = 7` -> `O[8, 4-(6-4)=2] = 7` (overwrites 0) -> `O[8] = [0, 0, 7, 8]` (Matches Expected)\n*   Hypothesis holds for Example 3.\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to verify the calculations for one point. Example 1, `I[4, 7] = 2`. `C_gray = 4`. Expected target column = `4 - (7 - 4) = 1`.\n"
