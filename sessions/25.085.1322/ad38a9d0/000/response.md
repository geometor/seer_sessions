Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 9x9.
2.  **Dominant Colors:** The input grids primarily consist of orange pixels (color 7), with scattered magenta pixels (color 6). The output grids also primarily consist of orange pixels (color 7) in the same positions as the input, but the magenta pixels have been replaced by various other colors.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation rule appears to operate specifically on the magenta (6) pixels. Orange (7) pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Object Identification:** The magenta pixels in the input seem to form distinct contiguous objects (using orthogonal adjacency).
5.  **Object Transformation:** Each contiguous magenta object in the input is replaced entirely by a *single* new color in the output, preserving the object's original shape and location.
6.  **Color Assignment Logic:** The specific color used to replace a magenta object appears to depend on the *shape* and *size* of that object. In some cases (like single pixels or size-2 vertical bars), the object's position might also influence the assigned color.
7.  **Shape Categories Identified:** Through analyzing the examples, specific shapes consistently map to specific output colors:
    *   L-shapes (size 3) map to yellow (4).
    *   Vertical bars (size 3) map to red (2).
    *   T-shapes (size 4) map to green (3).
    *   Z-like shapes (size 4) map to azure (8).
    *   2x3 Rectangles (size 6) map to gray (5).
    *   Horizontal bars (size 2) map to azure (8).
    *   Vertical bars (size 2) map to maroon (9) or red (2), possibly depending on location.
    *   Single pixels (dots, size 1) map to green (3), maroon (9), or red (2), possibly depending on location.

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: fixed (9x9 for examples)
  background_color: 7 (orange)
  target_color: 6 (magenta)
  transformation_scope: applies only to target_color pixels
  background_behavior: background_color pixels remain unchanged

object_definitions:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    color: 6 (magenta)
    adjacency: orthogonal
    description: Groups of connected magenta pixels form distinct objects.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      color_to_find: 6 (magenta)
    output: list_of_magenta_objects (each object is a set of coordinates)

  - rule: classify_and_recolor_objects
    input: list_of_magenta_objects
    output: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
    steps:
      - for each object in list_of_magenta_objects:
          - determine object_shape_category (e.g., dot, bar, L, T, Z, rectangle)
          - determine object_size
          - determine object_position (e.g., bounding box, centroid, relevant for ambiguous shapes)
          - determine replacement_color based on shape, size, and sometimes position:
              - Dot (Size 1): Green (3) / Maroon (9) / Red (2) (position-dependent)
              - Vertical Bar (Size 2): Maroon (9) / Red (2) (position-dependent)
              - Horizontal Bar (Size 2): Azure (8)
              - L-Shape (Size 3): Yellow (4)
              - Vertical Bar (Size 3): Red (2)
              - T-Shape (Size 4): Green (3)
              - Z-like Shape (Size 4): Azure (8)
              - 2x3 Rectangle (Size 6): Gray (5)
          - for each pixel_coordinate in the current object:
              - update output_grid[pixel_coordinate] with replacement_color

positional_dependency_hypothesis (for ambiguous shapes):
  - Dot (Size 1) or Vertical Bar (Size 2):
    - Top-Left/Mid-Left region -> Green (3) for Dot
    - Top-Mid/Mid-Right region -> Maroon (9) for Dot/VBar2
    - Bottom-Right region -> Red (2) for Dot/VBar2
    (Requires further verification with more examples or test cases)

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects formed by magenta (6) pixels in the input grid, using orthogonal adjacency.
3.  For each identified magenta object:
    a.  Determine its shape category (e.g., dot, vertical bar, horizontal bar, L-shape, T-shape, Z-shape, rectangle).
    b.  Determine its size (number of pixels).
    c.  If the shape category is ambiguous based solely on shape and size (like 'dot' or 'vertical bar size 2'), determine its approximate position or region within the grid.
    d.  Select a replacement color based on the following mapping:
        *   If shape is L (size 3), use yellow (4).
        *   If shape is Vertical Bar (size 3), use red (2).
        *   If shape is T (size 4), use green (3).
        *   If shape is Z-like (size 4), use azure (8).
        *   If shape is 2x3 Rectangle (size 6), use gray (5).
        *   If shape is Horizontal Bar (size 2), use azure (8).
        *   If shape is Vertical Bar (size 2): use maroon (9) if in the middle/upper-right region, use red (2) if in the bottom-right region.
        *   If shape is Dot (size 1): use green (3) if in the top/middle-left region, use maroon (9) if in the top/middle-right region, use red (2) if in the bottom-right region.
    e.  For every pixel coordinate belonging to the current magenta object, change the color of that coordinate in the output grid to the selected replacement color.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
