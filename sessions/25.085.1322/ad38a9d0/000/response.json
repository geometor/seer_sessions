            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 9x9.\n2.  **Dominant Colors:** The input grids primarily consist of orange pixels (color 7), with scattered magenta pixels (color 6). The output grids also primarily consist of orange pixels (color 7) in the same positions as the input, but the magenta pixels have been replaced by various other colors.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation rule appears to operate specifically on the magenta (6) pixels. Orange (7) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The magenta pixels in the input seem to form distinct contiguous objects (using orthogonal adjacency).\n5.  **Object Transformation:** Each contiguous magenta object in the input is replaced entirely by a *single* new color in the output, preserving the object's original shape and location.\n6.  **Color Assignment Logic:** The specific color used to replace a magenta object appears to depend on the *shape* and *size* of that object. In some cases (like single pixels or size-2 vertical bars), the object's position might also influence the assigned color.\n7.  **Shape Categories Identified:** Through analyzing the examples, specific shapes consistently map to specific output colors:\n    *   L-shapes (size 3) map to yellow (4).\n    *   Vertical bars (size 3) map to red (2).\n    *   T-shapes (size 4) map to green (3).\n    *   Z-like shapes (size 4) map to azure (8).\n    *   2x3 Rectangles (size 6) map to gray (5).\n    *   Horizontal bars (size 2) map to azure (8).\n    *   Vertical bars (size 2) map to maroon (9) or red (2), possibly depending on location.\n    *   Single pixels (dots, size 1) map to green (3), maroon (9), or red (2), possibly depending on location.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Select a replacement color based on the following mapping:\n        *   If shape is L (size 3), use yellow (4).\n        *   If shape is Vertical Bar (size 3), use red (2).\n        *   If shape is T (size 4), use green (3).\n        *   If shape is Z-like (size 4), use azure (8).\n        *   If shape is 2x3 Rectangle (size 6), use gray (5).\n        *   If shape is Horizontal Bar (size 2), use azure (8).\n        *   If shape is Vertical Bar (size 2): use maroon (9) if in the middle/upper-right region, use red (2) if in the bottom-right region.\n        *   If shape is Dot (size 1): use green (3) if in the top/middle-left region, use maroon (9) if in the top/middle-right region, use red (2) if in the bottom-right region.\n    e.
