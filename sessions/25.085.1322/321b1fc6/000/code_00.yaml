Observations:
  - Task: Pattern stamping based on markers.
  - Elements:
    - Background: White pixels (0).
    - Markers: Connected objects of Azure color (8).
    - Pattern Source: Connected objects of any color except White (0) and Azure (8).
    - Pattern Template: A specific grid pattern derived from the Pattern Source objects.
    - Output Grid: Initially background color, then stamped with the Pattern Template.
  - Relationships & Rules:
    - Azure objects define target locations for stamping.
    - Non-white, non-azure objects define the content of the stamp (Pattern Template).
    - Pattern Template Definition:
      - Find all distinct connected Pattern Source objects.
      - Check if all Pattern Source objects are identical (same shape and colors relative to their top-left corner).
      - IF identical: The Pattern Template is one instance of the source object (e.g., the one with the top-most, left-most coordinate).
      - ELSE (not identical): The Pattern Template is the content of the minimal bounding box containing *all* pixels of *all* Pattern Source objects in the input grid (including background pixels within that box).
    - Stamping Process:
      - Find the top-left coordinate (min_row, min_col) of each Azure marker object.
      - Create an empty output grid (all background color).
      - For each Azure marker's top-left coordinate, copy the Pattern Template onto the output grid, aligning the template's top-left corner with the marker's top-left coordinate.
    - Input objects (Markers and Pattern Sources) are not directly preserved in the output at their original locations; they are effectively replaced by the background or the stamped patterns.
