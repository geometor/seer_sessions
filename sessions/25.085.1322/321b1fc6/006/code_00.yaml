task_description: Stamp a composite pattern derived from source objects onto locations marked by azure pixels.

definitions:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - marker_color: azure (8)
  - source_colors: Any color that is not white (0) and not azure (8).
  - source_object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same source_color. Note that adjacent pixels of different source colors form separate source objects initially.
  - marker_object: A contiguous group of pixels of the marker_color (azure, 8).
  - composite_template: A rectangular pattern derived from all source_objects.
  - stamp_location: The top-left coordinate of a marker_object.

rules:
  - rule: Identify all source_objects in the input grid.
  - rule: Identify all marker_objects in the input grid.
  - rule: If no source_objects exist OR no marker_objects exist, the output grid is entirely background_color.
  - rule: Determine the combined bounding box enclosing all pixels belonging to any source_object.
  - rule: Create the composite_template by taking the grid slice defined by the combined bounding box and replacing any pixel that is not part of a source_object with the background_color (white 0). Retain the original colors and relative positions of all source_object pixels within the template.
  - rule: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background_color.
  - rule: For each marker_object, determine its top-left coordinate (stamp_location).
  - rule: Copy ('stamp') the composite_template onto the output grid, aligning the template's top-left corner with the stamp_location. Pixels from the template overwrite the background in the output grid. Ensure clipping if the template extends beyond the output grid boundaries.

example_1_analysis:
  - source_objects:
      - color: orange (7), top_left: (5, 5)
      - color: magenta (6), top_left: (6, 5)
  - combined_source_bbox: (5, 5, 6, 7) # min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c
  - composite_template:
      - [7, 7, 0]
      - [6, 6, 6]
  - marker_objects:
      - top_left: (1, 1)
      - top_left: (2, 6)
      - top_left: (7, 3)
  - action: Stamp the 2x3 composite_template at each marker's top_left coordinate.

example_2_analysis:
  - source_objects: # Note: find_components treats these as 4 separate objects
      - color: orange (7), top_left: (1, 1)
      - color: magenta (6), top_left: (1, 2)
      - color: maroon (9), top_left: (2, 1)
      - color: yellow (4), top_left: (2, 2)
  - combined_source_bbox: (1, 1, 2, 2) # min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c
  - composite_template:
      - [7, 6]
      - [9, 4]
  - marker_objects:
      - top_left: (4, 5)
      - top_left: (7, 2)
      - top_left: (8, 8)
  - action: Stamp the 2x2 composite_template at each marker's top_left coordinate.
