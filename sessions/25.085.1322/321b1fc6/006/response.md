**General Assessment**

The provided code attempted to solve the task by identifying a single "template" pattern (the top-leftmost non-background, non-marker object) and "stamping" it onto the output grid at locations indicated by azure (8) markers.

The results show this approach failed on both examples. The actual transformed output only contained parts of the expected output. Comparing the input, expected output, and actual output reveals that the core issue lies in the definition of the "template". Instead of a single object, the template seems to be a composite pattern derived from *all* non-background, non-marker objects present in the input, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement.

The strategy needs to be revised to:
1.  Identify all source objects (colors other than white 0 and azure 8).
2.  Determine the bounding box that encompasses *all* these source objects.
3.  Create the template pattern by extracting all source pixels within this combined bounding box, preserving their colors and relative positions. Pixels within the box that are not part of any source object should be treated as background (white 0) in the template.
4.  Identify all azure (8) marker objects.
5.  For each marker object, use its top-left coordinate as the anchor point to stamp the composite template onto the output grid.

**Revised Metrics and Analysis**

It seems the `find_connected_components_no_scipy` function had an issue when called with `target_colors=[8]` if only one marker object existed (the sorting key was accessing multiple elements). Let's fix the tool code and rerun. The key issue was likely the sorting key `key=lambda o: (o['top_left'][0], o['top_left'][1])` applied to potentially empty or single-element lists if no objects of a certain type were found. A safer sort or conditional sorting is needed. Also, the template extraction logic needs adjustment. It should iterate through *all* source objects and place their pixels relative to the combined bounding box's top-left corner.

task_description: Stamp a composite pattern derived from source objects onto locations marked by azure pixels.

definitions:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - marker_color: azure (8)
  - source_colors: Any color that is not white (0) and not azure (8).
  - source_object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same source_color. Note that adjacent pixels of different source colors form separate source objects initially.
  - marker_object: A contiguous group of pixels of the marker_color (azure, 8).
  - composite_template: A rectangular pattern derived from all source_objects.
  - stamp_location: The top-left coordinate of a marker_object.

rules:
  - rule: Identify all source_objects in the input grid.
  - rule: Identify all marker_objects in the input grid.
  - rule: If no source_objects exist OR no marker_objects exist, the output grid is entirely background_color.
  - rule: Determine the combined bounding box enclosing all pixels belonging to any source_object.
  - rule: Create the composite_template by taking the grid slice defined by the combined bounding box and replacing any pixel that is not part of a source_object with the background_color (white 0). Retain the original colors and relative positions of all source_object pixels within the template.
  - rule: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background_color.
  - rule: For each marker_object, determine its top-left coordinate (stamp_location).
  - rule: Copy ('stamp') the composite_template onto the output grid, aligning the template's top-left corner with the stamp_location. Pixels from the template overwrite the background in the output grid. Ensure clipping if the template extends beyond the output grid boundaries.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). These are the 'source pixels'.
3.  If no source pixels are found, return the initial empty output grid.
4.  Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses *all* identified source pixels. Find the minimum row (`min_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), maximum row (`max_r`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among all source pixels.
5.  Create the 'composite template' pattern:
    a.  Create a new grid (the template) with height `max_r - min_r + 1` and width `max_c - min_c + 1`, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
    b.  Iterate through all the original source pixels identified in step 2. For each source pixel at coordinate (`r`, `c`) with color `col`, set the pixel at `(r - min_r, c - min_c)` in the template grid to `col`.
6.  Identify all distinct connected groups of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. These are the 'markers'.
7.  If no markers are found, return the initial empty output grid.
8.  For each identified marker:
    a.  Determine the coordinate (row, column) of its top-leftmost pixel. This is the 'stamp location'.
    b.  Copy ('stamp') the 'composite template' onto the output grid, aligning the template's top-left corner with the 'stamp location'.
    c.  Pixels from the template (other than the background color 0) overwrite the corresponding pixels in the output grid. Ensure the template is clipped if it extends beyond the output grid's boundaries.
9.  Return the final modified output grid.
