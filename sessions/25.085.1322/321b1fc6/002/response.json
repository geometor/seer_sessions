            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core components of the task: identifying 'source' patterns (non-background, non-azure objects) and 'marker' objects (azure color 8), determining a template pattern based on the source(s), and then stamping this template onto the output grid at the locations indicated by the markers' top-left corners.\n\nThe primary failure was a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy'`, which prevented the code from running and validating the logic. This is an environment issue, not necessarily a logic flaw. However, without successful execution, we cannot confirm the correctness of the implementation details (like bounding box calculation, pattern extraction, and stamping).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the core logic by analyzing the examples again.\n2.  Use `tool_code` to extract specific metrics from the examples to solidify understanding.\n3.  Refine the natural language program based on this deeper analysis, ensuring it accurately captures the rules for selecting the template pattern (single source, multiple identical sources, multiple different sources) and the stamping process.\n4.  Ensure the next coding attempt avoids unnecessary dependencies if possible, or explicitly lists `scipy` if it's truly required for tasks like `label`.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's assume the task is `d43fd935` based on the described logic. We need the example data. Since it's not provided here, I will simulate the analysis based on the logic described and common patterns in ARC tasks resembling this description. I'll request the data structure for one example to perform a concrete analysis.\n\n*(Self-correction: I cannot directly access the ARC task data. I will proceed by outlining the *types* of metrics I would gather and making plausible assumptions based on the description)*\n\n**Hypothetical Metrics Request (if data were available):**\n\nFor each example (train_0, train_1, train_2, test_0):\n"

This contradicts the initial assumption of identical shapes. If true, the output grid needs resizing, or the stamping operation extends the grid. However, the previous code *enforced* the same shape (`output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)`). This discrepancy needs clarification. Let's assume for now the code's approach (same shape) is intended and the hypothetical output shape was incorrect.\n*   **Colors:** Inputs contain background (0), sources (e.g., 1, 3, 2, 4), and markers (8). Outputs contain background (0) and source colors, but typically *not* the marker color (8), which seems correct.\n*   **Sources:** Examples vary in the number and colors of source objects. The logic correctly identifies the need to differentiate between single, multiple identical, and multiple different source objects/patterns.\n*   **Markers:** Azure (8) pixels consistently act as markers.
