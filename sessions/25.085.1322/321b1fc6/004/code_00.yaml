Task: Stamp Pattern Task (Refined)

Input_Grid:
  - Contains pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - Background color is white (0).
  - Features marker objects and source objects.

Marker_Objects:
  - Definition: Contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels.
  - Property: Each marker defines a target location for the stamping action.
  - Reference_Point: The top-leftmost pixel coordinate of the marker object's bounding box.

Source_Objects:
  - Definition: Contiguous regions of any color *except* white (0) and azure (8).
  - Property: Define the potential pattern(s) to be stamped.
  - Property: Each source object has a shape (relative pattern within its bounding box) and a location (top-left coordinate).

Template_Pattern:
  - Derivation_Rule:
    - IF no source objects exist: The template is effectively empty (results in a blank output).
    - IF one or more source objects exist:
      1. Identify *all* source objects.
      2. Find the source object whose top-left coordinate has the minimum row index. If there's a tie in row index, use the minimum column index. This is the 'primary source object'.
      3. The template pattern is the relative pattern of the 'primary source object' (i.e., its shape within its own bounding box, with other pixels treated as background/white 0).
  - Note: The number or similarity of other source objects (beyond the primary one) does not influence the template choice.

Action:
  - Type: Stamping / Copying.
  - Process:
    1. Determine the single Template_Pattern based on the source objects.
    2. For each Marker_Object found in the input grid:
       - Identify its Reference_Point (top-left coordinate).
       - Copy the Template_Pattern onto the output grid.
       - The top-left corner of the Template_Pattern is placed at the Marker_Object's Reference_Point.
    3. Stamping overwrites existing pixels in the output grid.
    4. If the template extends beyond the grid boundaries when stamping, it is clipped.

Output_Grid:
  - Initial_State: Same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
  - Final_State: Contains the Template_Pattern stamped at the locations indicated by the Marker_Objects.
