However, it failed on both examples due to an incorrect color assignment at one specific intersection point: the intersection of the Azure pixel's row and the Orange pixel's column. The expected color at this point is Red (2), but the code assigned Orange (7).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the step in the natural language program and corresponding code that sets the color of the intersection points, specifically changing the color assigned to `(azure_row, orange_col)` from Orange (7) to Red (2).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Azure (8) Coordinates: (1, 3)\n    *   Orange (7) Coordinates: (7, 6)\n    *   Difference Location: (1, 6)\n    *   Expected Color at Difference: 2 (Red)\n    *   Transformed Color at Difference: 7 (Orange)\n    *   Difference Type: Intersection of Azure Row and Orange Column.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Azure (8) Coordinates: (2, 2)\n    *   Orange (7) Coordinates: (6, 6)\n    *   Difference Location: (2, 6)\n    *   Expected Color at Difference: 2 (Red)\n    *   Transformed Color at Difference: 7 (Orange)\n    *   Difference Type: Intersection of Azure Row and Orange Column.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
