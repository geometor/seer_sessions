There are exactly two non-background pixels: one azure (8) and one orange (7). Their positions vary between examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are the same size as the input grids (9x9). The original positions of the azure and orange pixels seem to be significant. The output grid features horizontal and vertical lines corresponding to the rows and columns of the input pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves drawing lines based on the locations of the input pixels.\n    *   A horizontal line of azure (8) is drawn at the row of the input azure pixel.\n    *   A vertical line of azure (8) is drawn at the column of the input azure pixel.\n    *   A horizontal line of orange (7) is drawn at the row of the input orange pixel.\n    *   A vertical line of orange (7) is drawn at the column of the input orange pixel.\n4.  **Intersections:** The key aspect is how the intersections of these lines are colored:\n    *   The intersection of the azure horizontal and vertical lines (the original position of the azure pixel) remains azure (8).\n    *   The intersection of the orange horizontal and vertical lines (the original position of the orange pixel) remains orange (7).\n    *   The intersection of the azure horizontal line and the orange vertical line is colored orange (7).\n    *   The intersection of the orange horizontal line and the azure vertical line is colored red (2).\n5.  **Background:** Pixels not part of these lines remain white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
