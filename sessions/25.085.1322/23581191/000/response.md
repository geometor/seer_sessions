Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are square (9x9) and mostly contain the background color white (0). There are exactly two non-background pixels: one azure (8) and one orange (7). Their positions vary between examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are the same size as the input grids (9x9). The original positions of the azure and orange pixels seem to be significant. The output grid features horizontal and vertical lines corresponding to the rows and columns of the input pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves drawing lines based on the locations of the input pixels.
    *   A horizontal line of azure (8) is drawn at the row of the input azure pixel.
    *   A vertical line of azure (8) is drawn at the column of the input azure pixel.
    *   A horizontal line of orange (7) is drawn at the row of the input orange pixel.
    *   A vertical line of orange (7) is drawn at the column of the input orange pixel.
4.  **Intersections:** The key aspect is how the intersections of these lines are colored:
    *   The intersection of the azure horizontal and vertical lines (the original position of the azure pixel) remains azure (8).
    *   The intersection of the orange horizontal and vertical lines (the original position of the orange pixel) remains orange (7).
    *   The intersection of the azure horizontal line and the orange vertical line is colored orange (7).
    *   The intersection of the orange horizontal line and the azure vertical line is colored red (2).
5.  **Background:** Pixels not part of these lines remain white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Draw intersecting lines based on two input points with specific intersection coloring.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Size: Typically 9x9 in examples.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Exactly two non-background pixels present.
    - Object1:
      - Color: azure (8)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Location: (row_azure, col_azure) - varies per example.
    - Object2:
      - Color: orange (7)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Location: (row_orange, col_orange) - varies per example.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Size: Same as input grid.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Derived_Features:
    - Horizontal_Line_Azure: Located at row_azure, colored azure (8).
    - Vertical_Line_Azure: Located at col_azure, colored azure (8).
    - Horizontal_Line_Orange: Located at row_orange, colored orange (7).
    - Vertical_Line_Orange: Located at col_orange, colored orange (7).
  - Intersection_Points:
    - Point1: (row_azure, col_azure) - Color: azure (8)
    - Point2: (row_orange, col_orange) - Color: orange (7)
    - Point3: (row_azure, col_orange) - Color: orange (7)
    - Point4: (row_orange, col_azure) - Color: red (2)

Relationships_Actions:
  - Identification: Locate the azure (8) and orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
  - Projection: Determine the row and column indices for each identified pixel.
  - Construction:
    - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white).
    - Draw the horizontal azure line.
    - Draw the vertical azure line.
    - Draw the horizontal orange line.
    - Draw the vertical orange line.
  - Intersection_Handling: Explicitly set the colors at the four intersection points according to the specified rules, potentially overwriting colors set during line drawing.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid to be the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates (row, column) of the single azure (8) pixel; let these be `row_azure` and `col_azure`.
3.  Scan the input grid to find the coordinates (row, column) of the single orange (7) pixel; let these be `row_orange` and `col_orange`.
4.  Fill the entire row `row_azure` of the output grid with the color azure (8).
5.  Fill the entire column `col_azure` of the output grid with the color azure (8).
6.  Fill the entire row `row_orange` of the output grid with the color orange (7).
7.  Fill the entire column `col_orange` of the output grid with the color orange (7).
8.  Set the color of the pixel at (`row_azure`, `col_azure`) in the output grid to azure (8).
9.  Set the color of the pixel at (`row_orange`, `col_orange`) in the output grid to orange (7).
10. Set the color of the pixel at (`row_azure`, `col_orange`) in the output grid to orange (7).
11. Set the color of the pixel at (`row_orange`, `col_azure`) in the output grid to red (2).
