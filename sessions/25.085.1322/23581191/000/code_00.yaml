Task: Draw intersecting lines based on two input points with specific intersection coloring.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Size: Typically 9x9 in examples.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Objects:
    - Exactly two non-background pixels present.
    - Object1:
      - Color: azure (8)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Location: (row_azure, col_azure) - varies per example.
    - Object2:
      - Color: orange (7)
      - Shape: Single pixel
      - Location: (row_orange, col_orange) - varies per example.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Size: Same as input grid.
  - Background_Color: white (0).
  - Derived_Features:
    - Horizontal_Line_Azure: Located at row_azure, colored azure (8).
    - Vertical_Line_Azure: Located at col_azure, colored azure (8).
    - Horizontal_Line_Orange: Located at row_orange, colored orange (7).
    - Vertical_Line_Orange: Located at col_orange, colored orange (7).
  - Intersection_Points:
    - Point1: (row_azure, col_azure) - Color: azure (8)
    - Point2: (row_orange, col_orange) - Color: orange (7)
    - Point3: (row_azure, col_orange) - Color: orange (7)
    - Point4: (row_orange, col_azure) - Color: red (2)

Relationships_Actions:
  - Identification: Locate the azure (8) and orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
  - Projection: Determine the row and column indices for each identified pixel.
  - Construction:
    - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white).
    - Draw the horizontal azure line.
    - Draw the vertical azure line.
    - Draw the horizontal orange line.
    - Draw the vertical orange line.
  - Intersection_Handling: Explicitly set the colors at the four intersection points according to the specified rules, potentially overwriting colors set during line drawing.
