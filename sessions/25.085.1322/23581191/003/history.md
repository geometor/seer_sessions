**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code correctly identified the core transformation: locating the single Azure (8) and Orange (7) pixels and drawing horizontal and vertical lines based on their coordinates. However, it failed on both examples due to an incorrect color assignment at one specific intersection point: the intersection of the Azure pixel's row and the Orange pixel's column. The expected color at this point is Red (2), but the code assigned Orange (7).

The strategy is to modify the step in the natural language program and corresponding code that sets the color of the intersection points, specifically changing the color assigned to `(azure_row, orange_col)` from Orange (7) to Red (2).

**Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 9)
    *   Azure (8) Coordinates: (1, 3)
    *   Orange (7) Coordinates: (7, 6)
    *   Difference Location: (1, 6)
    *   Expected Color at Difference: 2 (Red)
    *   Transformed Color at Difference: 7 (Orange)
    *   Difference Type: Intersection of Azure Row and Orange Column.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 9)
    *   Azure (8) Coordinates: (2, 2)
    *   Orange (7) Coordinates: (6, 6)
    *   Difference Location: (2, 6)
    *   Expected Color at Difference: 2 (Red)
    *   Transformed Color at Difference: 7 (Orange)
    *   Difference Type: Intersection of Azure Row and Orange Column.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Input grid contains exactly one Azure (8) pixel and one Orange (7) pixel.
  - Background is White (0).
  - Output grid dimensions match the input grid.
  - Transformation involves drawing lines based on the coordinates of the Azure and Orange pixels.

Objects:
  - Azure_Pixel: A single pixel with color 8. Properties: row_azure, col_azure.
  - Orange_Pixel: A single pixel with color 7. Properties: row_orange, col_orange.
  - Output_Grid: A grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially all White (0).

Actions:
  1. Find Coordinates: Determine (row_azure, col_azure) and (row_orange, col_orange).
  2. Draw Azure Lines:
     - Fill row `row_azure` of Output_Grid with Azure (8).
     - Fill column `col_azure` of Output_Grid with Azure (8).
  3. Draw Orange Lines:
     - Fill row `row_orange` of Output_Grid with Orange (7).
     - Fill column `col_orange` of Output_Grid with Orange (7).
  4. Set Intersection Points (Overrides):
     - Set Output_Grid[row_azure, col_azure] to Azure (8).
     - Set Output_Grid[row_orange, col_orange] to Orange (7).
     - Set Output_Grid[row_azure, col_orange] to Red (2).  # Corrected from previous attempt
     - Set Output_Grid[row_orange, col_azure] to Red (2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color, White (0).
2.  Locate the coordinates of the single Azure (8) pixel in the input grid; let these be (`row_azure`, `col_azure`).
3.  Locate the coordinates of the single Orange (7) pixel in the input grid; let these be (`row_orange`, `col_orange`).
4.  In the output grid, draw a horizontal line (fill the entire row) with Azure (8) at `row_azure`.
5.  In the output grid, draw a vertical line (fill the entire column) with Azure (8) at `col_azure`.
6.  In the output grid, draw a horizontal line (fill the entire row) with Orange (7) at `row_orange`.
7.  In the output grid, draw a vertical line (fill the entire column) with Orange (7) at `col_orange`.
8.  Ensure the colors at the four specific intersection points are set correctly (this step overrides colors set by the line drawing):
    *   Set the pixel at (`row_azure`, `col_azure`) to Azure (8).
    *   Set the pixel at (`row_orange`, `col_orange`) to Orange (7).
    *   Set the pixel at (`row_azure`, `col_orange`) to Red (2).
    *   Set the pixel at (`row_orange`, `col_azure`) to Red (2).
