*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids consistently feature a vertical red line (color 2) that divides the grid into two main sections.
    *   The section to the left of the red line and the section to the right have the same dimensions.
    *   These left and right sections primarily contain orange (color 7) and white (color 0) pixels.
    *   The output grid has the same dimensions as the left (or right) sections of the input grid.
    *   The output grid contains only blue (color 1) and white (color 0) pixels.
    *   There appears to be a pixel-wise comparison or combination between the left and right sections of the input grid to produce the output grid.
    *   Observing the pixel correspondences:
        *   If a pixel is orange (7) in the left section *or* the corresponding pixel is orange (7) in the right section, the resulting output pixel is blue (1).
        *   If both corresponding pixels in the left and right sections are white (0), the resulting output pixel is white (0).
    *   This suggests a logical OR operation where orange acts as 'True' and white acts as 'False', mapping the result to blue ('True') or white ('False').

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the single vertical column composed entirely of the red color (2) in the input grid. This column acts as a separator.
    2.  Define the "left subgrid" as the portion of the input grid to the left of the red separator column.
    3.  Define the "right subgrid" as the portion of the input grid to the right of the red separator column. (Both subgrids will have the same dimensions).
    4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the left (or right) subgrid.
    5.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) within the dimensions of the subgrids.
    6.  For the current position `(r, c)`, examine the color of the cell in the left subgrid and the color of the cell in the right subgrid.
    7.  If the cell color in the left subgrid is orange (7) OR the cell color in the right subgrid is orange (7), set the color of the cell at position `(r, c)` in the output grid to blue (1).
    8.  Otherwise (if both the cell in the left subgrid and the cell in the right subgrid are white (0)), set the color of the cell at position `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0).
    9.  Return the completed output grid.
