            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids containing a background color (white, 0) and one or more shapes defined by other colors (azure, magenta, red). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.\n2.  **Shapes/Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct visual shapes or objects. In the first example, there's one azure object. In the second, there are two separate objects: one magenta and one red.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids, the non-white shapes appear to be shifted horizontally to the right.\n4.  **Shift Amount:** The shift seems consistent across both examples and across different shapes within the second example. Specifically, the shapes move exactly one column to the right.\n5.  **Left Edge Behavior:** The pixels that were originally in the first column (column index 0) of a shape are no longer present in that column in the output; that column becomes white (background).\n6.  **Right Edge Behavior:** The examples don't explicitly show what happens if a shape reaches the right edge and is shifted further, as the rightmost columns in the inputs are white. However, a simple right shift implies that any content shifted beyond the right boundary would be lost or clipped.\n7.  **Independence:** In the second example, both the magenta and red shapes are shifted by the same amount, suggesting the transformation applies independently to all non-background elements.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
