task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - dimensions_preserved: True
objects:
  - type: shape
  - definition: contiguous non-white pixels (color > 0)
  - properties:
      - color: any non-white color (e.g., 8, 6, 2)
      - position: row and column indices
actions:
  - name: shift_right
  - target: all non-white pixels
  - details:
      - horizontal_shift: +1 column
      - vertical_shift: 0 rows
      - boundary_handling:
          - left_edge: pixels previously in column 0 are replaced by background color (0)
          - right_edge: pixels shifted beyond the rightmost column are clipped (not explicitly shown but implied)
