Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve grids containing a background color (white, 0) and one or more shapes defined by other colors (azure, magenta, red). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output.
2.  **Shapes/Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct visual shapes or objects. In the first example, there's one azure object. In the second, there are two separate objects: one magenta and one red.
3.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output grids, the non-white shapes appear to be shifted horizontally to the right.
4.  **Shift Amount:** The shift seems consistent across both examples and across different shapes within the second example. Specifically, the shapes move exactly one column to the right.
5.  **Left Edge Behavior:** The pixels that were originally in the first column (column index 0) of a shape are no longer present in that column in the output; that column becomes white (background).
6.  **Right Edge Behavior:** The examples don't explicitly show what happens if a shape reaches the right edge and is shifted further, as the rightmost columns in the inputs are white. However, a simple right shift implies that any content shifted beyond the right boundary would be lost or clipped.
7.  **Independence:** In the second example, both the magenta and red shapes are shifted by the same amount, suggesting the transformation applies independently to all non-background elements.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 # white
  - dimensions_preserved: True
objects:
  - type: shape
  - definition: contiguous non-white pixels (color > 0)
  - properties:
      - color: any non-white color (e.g., 8, 6, 2)
      - position: row and column indices
actions:
  - name: shift_right
  - target: all non-white pixels
  - details:
      - horizontal_shift: +1 column
      - vertical_shift: 0 rows
      - boundary_handling:
          - left_edge: pixels previously in column 0 are replaced by background color (0)
          - right_edge: pixels shifted beyond the rightmost column are clipped (not explicitly shown but implied)
relationships:
  - all non-white pixels undergo the same transformation regardless of their color or the shape they belong to.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row `r` and column `c`.
3.  Check the color value `v` of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
4.  If the color `v` is not the background color (i.e., `v > 0`):
    a.  Calculate the target column `c_new = c + 1`.
    b.  Check if `c_new` is less than the width of the grid.
    c.  If it is, set the pixel at `(r, c_new)` in the output grid to the color `v`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
