task_description: Transform grid by shifting non-background pixels horizontally.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same height and width as the input.
  - background_color: 0 # White pixels represent the background.
  - color_palette_preserved: True # Output uses the same colors as the input (excluding background if no non-background pixels exist).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color other than background (0).
      - location: Row and column index (r, c).
      - is_rightmost: Boolean indicating if the pixel is in the last column (c == width - 1).
actions:
  - name: shift_right
    condition: Applies to non-background pixels that are NOT in the rightmost column.
    effect: The pixel's color is moved from its original position (r, c) to the position (r, c + 1) in the output grid.
  - name: remain_stationary
    condition: Applies to non-background pixels that ARE in the rightmost column.
    effect: The pixel's color remains at its original position (r, c) in the output grid.
  - name: fill_background
    condition: Applies to all pixels in the output grid initially.
    effect: Sets the pixel color to the background color (0).
    notes: Shifted/stationary pixels overwrite this background color. Pixels originally in column 0, if shifted, leave background behind at (r, 0).
