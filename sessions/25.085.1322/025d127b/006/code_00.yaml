task_context:
  - The transformation applies to 2D grids of colored pixels (integers 0-9).
  - The grid dimensions (height, width) remain unchanged between input and output.
  - The background color is white (0).
grid_properties:
  - Objects are contiguous areas of non-background pixels.
  - Objects retain their color and internal structure.
transformation:
  - Type: Positional shift.
  - Scope: Applies to all non-background pixels independently.
  - Action: Each non-background pixel is moved one column to the right.
  - Boundary Condition: Horizontal wrap-around (toroidal). Pixels moving past the right edge (column width - 1) reappear at the left edge (column 0) in the same row.
  - Background pixels (white) remain unchanged and do not move.
