elements:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - object: horizontal_line
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - single instance per grid
      - spans horizontally across some width
      - divides grid vertically
  - object: paired_objects
    count: 2
    color: non-red (2), non-white (0) (e.g., blue(1), magenta(6), green(3))
    properties:
      - both objects have the same color
      - one object is located above the red line
      - one object is located below the red line
      - can be of various shapes and sizes
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
  - object: new_rectangle (output only)
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - added in the output grid
      - rectangular shape

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    objects: [paired_objects, horizontal_line]
    description: One paired object is above the line, the other is below.
  - type: spatial_determination
    input_objects: [paired_objects, horizontal_line]
    output_object: new_rectangle
    description: The position and extent of the new_rectangle are determined by the red line and the paired objects.
      - The rows of the new_rectangle are determined by the red line's row (start below it) and the grid's bottom boundary (end above it).
      - The columns of the new_rectangle are determined by the intersection of the columns occupied by the two paired_objects.

actions:
  - action: find
    target: horizontal_line (red)
    result: row index of the line
  - action: find
    target: paired_objects (non-red, non-white)
    result: locations (row, col indices) of pixels for each object
  - action: compute
    operation: column intersection
    inputs: [pixel columns of first paired_object, pixel columns of second paired_object]
    result: set of common column indices
  - action: compute
    operation: row range determination
    inputs: [row index of red line, grid height]
    result: range of row indices for the new rectangle (from red_line_row + 1 to grid_height - 1)
  - action: create
    target: new_rectangle (yellow)
    location: specified by common column indices and row range
    grid: output grid (initially a copy of input)
  - action: copy
    source: input grid
    destination: output grid (initial state)
