Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a single, solid horizontal line of red pixels (color 2) separating the grid roughly into upper and lower halves. Additionally, there are exactly two distinct objects composed of the same non-red, non-white color. One object appears above the red line, and the other appears below it. The color of these paired objects varies across examples (blue, magenta, green). The rest of the grid is typically white (color 0).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is largely identical to the input grid. The original red line and the two colored objects remain in their positions. The key difference is the addition of a new rectangular shape filled with yellow pixels (color 4).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves identifying the two non-red objects and the red line. The position and extent of the new yellow rectangle seem determined by the positions of the original objects and the red line.
4.  **Yellow Rectangle Placement:**
    *   **Vertical:** The yellow rectangle occupies the rows starting immediately below the red line and extending downwards, stopping just before the bottom edge of the grid.
    *   **Horizontal:** The yellow rectangle occupies the columns that are common to *both* of the original non-red objects. If a column contains pixels from the top object *and* pixels from the bottom object, that column will be part of the yellow rectangle.
5.  **Color Invariance:** The colors of the original red line and the paired objects are preserved in the output. The newly added shape is always yellow.

    count: 2
    color: non-red (2), non-white (0) (e.g., blue(1), magenta(6), green(3))
    properties:
      - both objects have the same color
      - one object is located above the red line
      - one object is located below the red line
      - can be of various shapes and sizes
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
  - object: new_rectangle (output only)
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - added in the output grid
      - rectangular shape

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    objects: [paired_objects, horizontal_line]
    description: One paired object is above the line, the other is below.
  - type: spatial_determination
    input_objects: [paired_objects, horizontal_line]
    output_object: new_rectangle
    description: The position and extent of the new_rectangle are determined by the red line and the paired objects.
      - The rows of the new_rectangle are determined by the red line's row (start below it) and the grid's bottom boundary (end above it).
      - The columns of the new_rectangle are determined by the intersection of the columns occupied by the two paired_objects.

  - action: find
    target: horizontal_line (red)
    result: row index of the line
  - action: find
    target: paired_objects (non-red, non-white)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the horizontal red line (color 2) in the input grid and determine its row index (`red_line_row`).
3.  Identify all pixels that are not red (2) and not white (0). These belong to the two paired objects.
4.  Group these pixels into two distinct objects based on connectivity or spatial separation (one above `red_line_row`, one below). Note the color of these objects.
5.  Determine the set of unique column indices occupied by the pixels of the first object (`cols1`).
6.  Determine the set of unique column indices occupied by the pixels of the second object (`cols2`).
7.  Find the intersection of these two sets: `common_cols = cols1 & cols2`.
8.  Define the row range for the new yellow rectangle: Start at `red_line_row + 1` and end at `grid_height - 1` (where `grid_height` is the total number of rows in the grid).
9.  Iterate through the rows in the determined row range and the columns in `common_cols`. For each cell (`row`, `col`) within these ranges, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (color 4).
10. Return the modified output grid.
