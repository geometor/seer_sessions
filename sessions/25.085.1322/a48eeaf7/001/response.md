"""
Identifies the largest contiguous non-background object (target) and smaller 
non-background objects (movers). The target object remains stationary. Each mover 
object moves towards the closest point on the target object, one step at a time 
(prioritizing diagonal moves), until it reaches a position adjacent (including 
diagonals) to any part of the target object. The final output grid contains the 
stationary target and the movers in their final adjacent positions.
