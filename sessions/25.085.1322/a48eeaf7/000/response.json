            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 10x10 grids containing mostly background pixels (white, 0).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The significant colors are red (2) and gray (5). The background is white (0).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   In both examples, there is a single contiguous block of red pixels (a 2x2 square).\n    *   There are several single gray pixels scattered around the grid.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The red 2x2 square remains in the exact same position in the output grid.\n    *   The gray pixels change their positions between the input and output grids.\n    *   Observing the movement of gray pixels:\n        *   In `train_1`, gray pixels at (0,8), (3,1), (6,9), (8,5) move to (1,7), (3,4), (4,7), (4,5) respectively.\n        *   In `train_2`, gray pixels at (0,3), (3,8), (7,7) move to (2,3), (3,5), (5,5) respectively.\n    *   The movement seems directed *towards* the static red square.\n    *   The final positions of the gray pixels appear to be adjacent (including diagonally adjacent) to the red square.\n5.  **Inferred Rule:** It appears the largest object (the red square) acts as a stationary target. All other distinct objects (the gray pixels) move towards the nearest part of the target object until they reach a position directly adjacent (including diagonals) to it. The movement path seems to take the shortest route, potentially favoring diagonal steps if they reduce both row and column distance simultaneously.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
