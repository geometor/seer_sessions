Task: Modify pixel colors based on grid position.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixel: Represents a color (integer 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Foreground_Color: Any non-white color (1-9).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Target_Color: Yellow (4).

Transformation_Elements:
  - Object: Individual pixels in the grid.
  - Properties:
      - color: The integer value (0-9) of the pixel.
      - row_index: The 0-based row position of the pixel.
      - column_index: The 0-based column position of the pixel.
  - Condition_Check:
      - Is the pixel color non-white (not 0)?
      - Is the pixel's column_index odd?
  - Action:
      - If both conditions are true: Change the pixel's color to yellow (4).
      - Otherwise: Keep the pixel's original color.

Relationships:
  - The output grid's pixel color at (row, col) depends on the input grid's pixel color at (row, col) and the column index `col`.
  - The transformation applies uniformly regardless of the specific non-white input color.
