Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids use white (0) as the background and one other non-white color for foreground pixels (maroon 9, red 2, green 3). The output grids use the same colors as the input, but some non-white pixels are changed to yellow (4). White pixels remain unchanged.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* non-white pixels to yellow (4). The decision to change a pixel seems based on its position within the grid.
4.  **Positional Pattern:**
    *   In example 1 (8x8), maroon (9) pixels at (1,3), (3,5), (5,1), (5,7), (7,3) change to yellow (4). All these changed pixels are in columns with odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7). Maroon pixels in even columns (0, 2, 4, 6) remain unchanged.
    *   In example 2 (3x3), the red (2) pixel at (1,1) changes to yellow (4). This pixel is in column 1 (odd). The red pixels in columns 0 and 2 (even) remain unchanged.
    *   In example 3 (6x6), green (3) pixels at (1,3), (3,5), and (4,1) change to yellow (4). All these changed pixels are in columns with odd indices (1, 3, 5). Green pixels in even columns (0, 2, 4) remain unchanged.
5.  **Rule Identification:** Across all examples, the consistent pattern is that any non-white pixel located in a column with an *odd* index is changed to yellow (4). Pixels in even columns, and all white pixels, retain their original color. The original non-white color doesn't influence *whether* a change happens, only the position does.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Modify pixel colors based on grid position.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixel: Represents a color (integer 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Foreground_Color: Any non-white color (1-9).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Target_Color: Yellow (4).

Transformation_Elements:
  - Object: Individual pixels in the grid.
  - Properties:
      - color: The integer value (0-9) of the pixel.
      - row_index: The 0-based row position of the pixel.
      - column_index: The 0-based column position of the pixel.
  - Condition_Check:
      - Is the pixel color non-white (not 0)?
      - Is the pixel's column_index odd?
  - Action:
      - If both conditions are true: Change the pixel's color to yellow (4).
      - Otherwise: Keep the pixel's original color.

Relationships:
  - The output grid's pixel color at (row, col) depends on the input grid's pixel color at (row, col) and the column index `col`.
  - The transformation applies uniformly regardless of the specific non-white input color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid, identified by its `row_index` and `column_index`.
3.  Get the `color` of the current pixel from the input grid.
4.  Check if the `color` is not white (value is not 0).
5.  If the `color` is not white, check if the `column_index` is an odd number (`column_index % 2 == 1`).
6.  If both conditions are true (the pixel is not white AND its column index is odd), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).
7.  If either condition is false (the pixel is white OR its column index is even), copy the original `color` from the input grid to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
8.  After iterating through all pixels, return the completed output grid.
