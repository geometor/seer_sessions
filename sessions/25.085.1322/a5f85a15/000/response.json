            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids use white (0) as the background and one other non-white color for foreground pixels (maroon 9, red 2, green 3). The output grids use the same colors as the input, but some non-white pixels are changed to yellow (4). White pixels remain unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of *some* non-white pixels to yellow (4). The decision to change a pixel seems based on its position within the grid.\n4.  **Positional Pattern:**\n    *   In example 1 (8x8), maroon (9) pixels at (1,3), (3,5), (5,1), (5,7), (7,3) change to yellow (4). All these changed pixels are in columns with odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7). Maroon pixels in even columns (0, 2, 4, 6) remain unchanged.\n    *   In example 2 (3x3), the red (2) pixel at (1,1) changes to yellow (4). This pixel is in column 1 (odd). The red pixels in columns 0 and 2 (even) remain unchanged.\n    *   In example 3 (6x6), green (3) pixels at (1,3), (3,5), and (4,1) change to yellow (4). All these changed pixels are in columns with odd indices (1, 3, 5). Green pixels in even columns (0, 2, 4) remain unchanged.\n5.  **Rule Identification:** Across all examples, the consistent pattern is that any non-white pixel located in a column with an *odd* index is changed to yellow (4). Pixels in even columns, and all white pixels, retain their original color. The original non-white color doesn't influence *whether* a change happens, only the position does.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Check if the `color` is not white (value is not 0).\n5.  If the `color` is not white, check if the `column_index` is an odd number (`column_index % 2 == 1`).\n6.  If both conditions are true (the pixel is not white AND its column index is odd), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).\n7.  If either condition is false (the pixel is white OR its column index is even), copy the original `color` from the input grid to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.\n8.
