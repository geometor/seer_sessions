            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Row-based Operation:** The changes appear to happen independently within specific rows. Rows that don't meet a certain condition are copied unchanged from input to output.\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation applied to a row depends on the pattern of pixels within that row, specifically seeming to depend on the value of the *second* pixel in the row.\n4.  **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Rows starting `7 3 ...` (second pixel is green) are unchanged.\n    *   Rows starting `7 8 ...` (second pixel is azure) are transformed: `7 8 3 7` becomes `7 7 8 3`. The transformation seems to be: the first pixel value replaces the second pixel, the original second pixel value moves to the third position, and the original third pixel value moves to the fourth position. The first pixel remains unchanged.\n5.  **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Rows starting `0 5 ...` (second pixel is gray) are unchanged.\n    *   Rows starting `5 0 ...` (second pixel is white) are transformed: `5 0 7 7 7 7` becomes `7 5 0 7 7 7`. The transformation seems to be: the third pixel value moves to the first position, the original first pixel value moves to the second position, and the original second pixel value moves to the third position. Pixels from the fourth position onwards remain unchanged.\n6.  **General Rule Synthesis:** There appear to be distinct rearrangement rules triggered by the value of the second pixel in each row. If the second pixel is azure (8), one rule applies. If it's white (0), another rule applies. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged. Both identified transformation rules primarily affect the first three or four pixels of the row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
