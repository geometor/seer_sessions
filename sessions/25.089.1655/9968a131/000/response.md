Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples involve transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Row-based Operation:** The changes appear to happen independently within specific rows. Rows that don't meet a certain condition are copied unchanged from input to output.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation applied to a row depends on the pattern of pixels within that row, specifically seeming to depend on the value of the *second* pixel in the row.
4.  **Example 1 Analysis:**
    *   Rows starting `7 3 ...` (second pixel is green) are unchanged.
    *   Rows starting `7 8 ...` (second pixel is azure) are transformed: `7 8 3 7` becomes `7 7 8 3`. The transformation seems to be: the first pixel value replaces the second pixel, the original second pixel value moves to the third position, and the original third pixel value moves to the fourth position. The first pixel remains unchanged.
5.  **Example 2 Analysis:**
    *   Rows starting `0 5 ...` (second pixel is gray) are unchanged.
    *   Rows starting `5 0 ...` (second pixel is white) are transformed: `5 0 7 7 7 7` becomes `7 5 0 7 7 7`. The transformation seems to be: the third pixel value moves to the first position, the original first pixel value moves to the second position, and the original second pixel value moves to the third position. Pixels from the fourth position onwards remain unchanged.
6.  **General Rule Synthesis:** There appear to be distinct rearrangement rules triggered by the value of the second pixel in each row. If the second pixel is azure (8), one rule applies. If it's white (0), another rule applies. Otherwise, the row remains unchanged. Both identified transformation rules primarily affect the first three or four pixels of the row.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  - Both input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Transformation is applied row by row.
row_processing:
  - Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  - The transformation applied depends on the value of the second pixel (index 1) in the row.
  - Rows must have at least 3 pixels for transformations to apply (based on observed rules needing up to the 3rd pixel). Shorter rows likely remain unchanged.
transformation_rules:
  - rule:
      condition: Second pixel value is 8 (azure). Minimum row length 3.
      action:
        - Keep the first pixel (index 0) the same.
        - Set the second pixel (index 1) to the value of the input first pixel (index 0).
        - Set the third pixel (index 2) to the value of the input second pixel (index 1).
        - If row length is 4 or more, set the fourth pixel (index 3) to the value of the input third pixel (index 2).
        - Keep all subsequent pixels (index 4 onwards) the same as the input.
      example: Input `[7, 8, 3, 7]` -> Output `[7, 7, 8, 3]`
  - rule:
      condition: Second pixel value is 0 (white). Minimum row length 3.
      action:
        - Set the first pixel (index 0) to the value of the input third pixel (index 2).
        - Set the second pixel (index 1) to the value of the input first pixel (index 0).
        - Set the third pixel (index 2) to the value of the input second pixel (index 1).
        - Keep all subsequent pixels (index 3 onwards) the same as the input.
      example: Input `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` -> Output `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`
  - rule:
      condition: Default (second pixel is not 8 or 0, or row length is less than 3).
      action: Copy the input row directly to the output row.
      example_1: Input `[7, 3, 8, 7]` -> Output `[7, 3, 8, 7]` (Second pixel is 3)
      example_2: Input `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` -> Output `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Second pixel is 5)

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Check if the row has at least 3 pixels.
    b.  If it has fewer than 3 pixels, copy the row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    c.  If it has 3 or more pixels, examine the value of the second pixel (at index 1).
    d.  **If the second pixel is 8 (azure):**
        i.  Create a new list or array for the transformed row.
        ii. Copy the first pixel (index 0) from the input row to the first position of the new row.
        iii. Copy the first pixel (index 0) from the input row to the second position of the new row.
        iv. Copy the second pixel (index 1) from the input row to the third position of the new row.
        v.  If the input row has 4 or more pixels, copy the third pixel (index 2) from the input row to the fourth position of the new row.
        vi. Copy any remaining pixels (from index 4 onwards, if they exist) from the input row to the corresponding positions in the new row.
        vii. Place this new row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
    e.  **Else if the second pixel is 0 (white):**
        i.  Create a new list or array for the transformed row.
        ii. Copy the third pixel (index 2) from the input row to the first position of the new row.
        iii. Copy the first pixel (index 0) from the input row to the second position of the new row.
        iv. Copy the second pixel (index 1) from the input row to the third position of the new row.
        v.  Copy any remaining pixels (from index 3 onwards, if they exist) from the input row to the corresponding positions in the new row.
        vi. Place this new row into the corresponding row of the output grid.
    f.  **Else (second pixel is neither 8 nor 0):**
        i.  Copy the input row directly to the corresponding row in the output grid.
3.  Return the completed output grid.
