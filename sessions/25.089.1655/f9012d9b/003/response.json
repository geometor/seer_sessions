Identify all unique non-white colors (pixels with value != 0) present in the input grid.\n2.  Count the occurrences (frequency) of each unique non-white color.\n3.  If there are fewer than two distinct non-white colors, return an empty list [].\n4.  Determine the color with the highest frequency (C1) and the color with the second highest frequency (C2). Record their counts: count(C1) and count(C2).\n5.  Calculate the difference between the counts: diff = count(C1) - count(C2).\n6.  Case 1: If diff is exactly 1:\n    *   The output is a 1x1 grid containing the second most frequent color (C2).\n7.  Case 2: If diff is greater than 1:\n    *   The output is a 2x2 grid.\n    *   Determine the majority color (majC) and minority color (minC) based on count parity:\n        *   If count(C1) is odd and count(C2) is even, then majC = C1 and minC = C2.\n        *   If count(C1) is even and count(C2) is odd, then majC = C2 and minC = C1.\n        *   If both counts have the same parity (both odd or both even), default to majC = C1 and minC = C2.\n    *   Determine the position for the single pixel of minC within the 2x2 grid:\n        *   If minC was originally C2 (meaning C1 had the determining odd count, or it's the default case where C1 remains majority), place minC at row 1, column 0.\n        *   If minC was originally C1 (meaning C2 had the determining odd count), place minC at row 1, column 1.\n    *   Fill the remaining three cells of the 2x2 grid with majC.\n8.
