Divide the input 9x3 grid into three 3x3 subgrids vertically: S1 (top, index 0),\n   S2 (middle, index 1), and S3 (bottom, index 2).\n2. For each subgrid, calculate its Most Frequent Color count (MFC) by finding the\n   color that appears most often and counting its occurrences. Let these counts\n   be m1, m2, and m3.\n3. Determine the subgrid to select using the following specific pattern checks,\n   applied in order:\n    a. If m2 is strictly greater than m1 AND m2 is strictly greater than m3 AND\n       m1 equals m3 (pattern [min, max, min]), select S2 (index 1).\n    b. Else if m2 equals m3 AND m2 is strictly less than m1 (pattern [max, min, min]),\n       select S3 (index 2).\n    c. Else if m1, m2, and m3 are all different values, select S1 (index 0).\n    d. Otherwise (for any other pattern, including all equal, other shared patterns, etc.),\n       select S1 (index 0).\n4.
