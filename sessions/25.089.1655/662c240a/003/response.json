Divide the input 9x3 grid into three 3x3 subgrids vertically: Subgrid 1 (top, index 0), Subgrid 2 (middle, index 1), and Subgrid 3 (bottom, index 2).\n2. For each subgrid, calculate its Most Frequent Color count (MFC) by finding the color that appears most often and counting its occurrences. Let these counts be MFC1, MFC2, and MFC3.\n3. Determine the subgrid to select using the following rules, checked in order:\n    a. First Check: If MFC1, MFC2, and MFC3 are all different values, select Subgrid 1 (index 0).\n    b. Second Check: Otherwise, if exactly one subgrid has the maximum MFC value observed among the three, select that subgrid.\n    c. Third Check: Otherwise, if exactly two subgrids share the minimum MFC value observed among the three, select the one of those two that has the higher index (index 2 over index 1, etc.).\n    d. Default: Otherwise (if none of the above conditions were met), select Subgrid 1 (index 0).\n4.
