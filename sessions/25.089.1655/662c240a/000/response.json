            "text": "    Wait, my manual calculation of MFC was wrong in some cases. Let's re-evaluate with the correct MFCs from the code.\n\n    Corrected MFCs:\n    *   Train 1: MFCs [6, 5, 5]. Output S3 (Index 2). Minimum MFC is 5. Tie between S2, S3. Select last (S3).\n    *   Train 2: MFCs [5, 6, 5]. Output S2 (Index 1). Maximum MFC is 6 (S2). Select S2.\n    *   Train 3: MFCs [6, 5, 7]. Output S1 (Index 0). Maximum MFC is 7 (S3). Select S3? No, output is S1.\n    *   Train 4: MFCs [7, 5, 5]. Output S3 (Index 2). Minimum MFC is 5. Tie between S2, S3. Select last (S3).\n\n    This still doesn't work for Train 3. The rule seems to be:\n    *   If there is a unique maximum MFC, select that subgrid (Train 2: Max=6 is unique to S2).\n    *   If there is a unique minimum MFC, select that subgrid (No examples fit this yet).\n    *   If the minimum MFC is shared (Train 1, Train 4: Min=5 shared), select the *last* subgrid with the minimum MFC.\n    *   If the maximum MFC is shared (Train 3: Max=7 is unique to S3, but it selected S1 where MFC=6??).\n\n    Let's re-check Train 3 MFC calculation.\n    S1: [[8, 8, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 8]] -> 4 appears 6 times, 8 appears 3 times. MFC=6. Correct.\n    S2: [[1, 1, 3], [1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1]] -> 1 appears 4 times, 3 appears 5 times. MFC=5. Correct.\n    S3: [[6, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 6]] -> 6 appears 2 times, 2 appears 7 times. MFC=7. Correct.\n\n    So for Train 3, MFCs are [6, 5, 7]. Output is S1 (Index 0).\n    Max MFC is 7 (S3). Min MFC is 5 (S2).\n    Why is S1 selected? Its MFC is 6.\n\n    Maybe the rule involves the MFC value *and* the subgrid index?\n    Let MFCs be `m = [m1, m2, m3]`.\n    Let indices be `idx = [0, 1, 2]`.\n    Pair them: `[(m1, 0), (m2, 1), (m3, 2)]`.\n\n    *   Train 1: MFCs=[6, 5, 5]. Pairs `[(6,0), (5,1), (5,2)]`. Output index 2. Min MFC is 5. Indices with min MFC are 1, 2. Select max index (2).\n    *   Train 2: MFCs=[5, 6, 5]. Pairs `[(5,0), (6,1), (5,2)]`. Output index 1. Max MFC is 6. Index with max MFC is 1. Select index 1.\n    *   Train 3: MFCs=[6, 5, 7]. Pairs `[(6,0), (5,1), (7,2)]`. Output index 0. Max MFC is 7 (index 2). Min MFC is 5 (index 1). Selected index is 0 (MFC 6). Why?\n    *   Train 4: MFCs=[7, 5, 5]. Pairs `[(7,0), (5,1), (5,2)]`. Output index 2. Min MFC is 5. Indices with min MFC are 1, 2. Select max index (2).\n\n    The rule seems to be:\n    1. Calculate MFC for each subgrid: `m1, m2, m3`.\n    2. Find `min_mfc = min(m1, m2, m3)` and `max_mfc = max(m1, m2, m3)`.\n    3. Check how many subgrids have `min_mfc`.\n    4. Check how many subgrids have `max_mfc`.\n    5. **IF** exactly two subgrids share the `min_mfc` (and the third has a higher MFC): Select the one of the two with the *higher index* (appears later). (Applies to Train 1, Train 4).\n    6. **ELSE IF** there is a unique `max_mfc`: Select the subgrid with the `max_mfc`. (Applies to Train 2).\n    7. **ELSE** (What covers Train 3? MFCs [6, 5, 7]. Unique min=5@S2, Unique max=7@S3. Neither min nor max is shared). In this case, select S1 (index 0). Why? Is it because it's the *first* subgrid that doesn't have the min or max MFC? Or just always select S1 in this specific configuration?\n\n    Let's refine the rule:\n    1. Calculate MFC for each subgrid: `m = [m1, m2, m3]`.\n    2. Find unique MFC values and their counts.\n    3. **Case 1: One MFC value is minimum and shared by two subgrids** (e.g., [X, min, min] or [min, Y, min] or [min, min, Z] where X, Y, Z > min). Select the subgrid with the *larger* index among the two sharing the minimum. (Covers Train 1 [6,5,5] -> S3; Train 4 [7,5,5] -> S3).\n    4. **Case 2: One MFC value is maximum and unique** (e.g., [X, max, Y] where X, Y < max). Select the subgrid with the maximum MFC. (Covers Train 2 [5,6,5] -> S2).\n    5. **Case 3: All MFC values are distinct** (e.g., [m1, m2, m3] all different). Select the *first* subgrid (index 0). (Covers Train 3 [6,5,7] -> S1).\n\n    This seems consistent across all 4 examples.\n\n    *   Train 1: [6, 5, 5]. Case 1 applies (min=5 shared by S2, S3). Select max index -> S3. Correct.\n    *   Train 2: [5, 6, 5]. Case 2 applies (max=6 unique to S2). Select S2. Correct.\n    *   Train 3: [6, 5, 7]. Case 3 applies (all distinct). Select S1. Correct.\n    *   Train 4: [7, 5, 5]. Case 1 applies (min=5 shared by S2, S3). Select max index -> S3. Correct.\n\n    This looks like a solid hypothesis for the selection logic.\n\n    **Summary of Transformation:**\n    1. Divide the 9x3 input grid into three 3x3 subgrids (S1, S2, S3).\n    2. For each subgrid, calculate the frequency of its most frequent color (MFC). Let the MFCs be `m1, m2, m3`.\n    3. Determine the selection rule based on the pattern of MFCs:\n        *   If two subgrids share the minimum MFC value, select the one with the higher index (S2 or S3).\n        *   If one subgrid has a unique maximum MFC value, select that subgrid.\n        *   If all three MFC values are distinct, select the first subgrid (S1).\n    4. The output is the selected 3x3 subgrid.Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid is consistently 9 rows by 3 columns.\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid is consistently 3 rows by 3 columns.\n3.  **Subdivision:** The input grid can be naturally divided into three contiguous 3x3 subgrids stacked vertically. Let's call them Subgrid 1 (rows 0-2), Subgrid 2 (rows 3-5), and Subgrid 3 (rows 6-8).\n4.  **Core Transformation:** The output grid is always identical to one of the three input subgrids. The task is essentially selecting the correct subgrid.\n5.  **Selection Criterion:** The key challenge is identifying the rule that determines which subgrid (1, 2, or 3) is selected. After analyzing properties like color counts, sums, unique colors, and symmetry, the most promising criterion seems related to the count of the most frequent color (MFC) within each 3x3 subgrid.\n\n**Analysis of MFCs and Selection:**\n\nLet's calculate the MFC for each subgrid in the training examples:\n\n*   **Train 1:** Input MFCs = [6, 5, 5]. Output = Subgrid 3 (Index 2).\n*   **Train 2:** Input MFCs = [5, 6, 5]. Output = Subgrid 2 (Index 1).\n*   **Train 3:** Input MFCs = [6, 5, 7]. Output = Subgrid 1 (Index 0).\n*   **Train 4:** Input MFCs = [7, 5, 5]. Output = Subgrid 3 (Index 2).\n\nBased on this, the selection rule appears to depend on the distribution of these MFC values:\n\n*   **Rule for Shared Minimum:** If the minimum MFC value occurs in exactly two subgrids (e.g., [X, min, min] or [min, Y, min] or [min, min, Z]), select the subgrid with the *higher index* (further down) among the two minimums. (This applies to Train 1 and Train 4).\n*   **Rule for Unique Maximum:** If there is a single subgrid with the maximum MFC value (and the other two are lower), select that subgrid. (This applies to Train 2).\n*   **Rule for Distinct Values:** If all three MFC values are different, select the *first* subgrid (Index 0). (This applies to Train 3).\n\nThis set of rules consistently explains the selection in all training examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
