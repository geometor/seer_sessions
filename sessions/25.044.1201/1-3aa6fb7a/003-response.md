Okay, let's analyze the transformation in the second example. The core concept from the first example seems to apply, but we need to verify and refine it.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all occurrences of the number 8 within the input grid.

2.  **Neighbor Analysis:** For each identified '8', examine its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right). Diagonal neighbors are *not* considered.

3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a '8' has exactly one neighbor that is also an '8', change the value of the original '8' to '1'.
    *   If a '8' has zero, two, three, or four neighbors that are '8', its value remains unchanged.

**Key Observations and Refinements:**

*   **Specificity of Neighbors:** The rule strictly applies to immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors.
*   **Single Neighbor Condition:** The transformation to '1' occurs *only* when there's exactly one '8' neighbor.
*    The program identifies the transformation and provides a correct explanation.
