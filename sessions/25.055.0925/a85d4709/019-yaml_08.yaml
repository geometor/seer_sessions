task_description: |
  Transforms a 3x3 grid of integers to another 3x3 grid of integers, likely through color substitution.
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer value (0-9)
      location: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
actions:
  - type: substitution
    description: Replaces an input color with a different output color.
    parameters:
       input_color: original color value
       output_color: replacement color value
relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: Each pixel in the input grid maps directly to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
observations:
    input_grid: contains '0' (white) and '5' (gray)
    output_grid: contains '3' (green) and '4' (yellow)
    substitution_rule: '5' becomes '3', and '0' becomes '4'
