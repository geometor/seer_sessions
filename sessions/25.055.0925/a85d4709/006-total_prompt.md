Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple color substitution rule. It correctly identified two transformations: gray (5) to green (3) and white (0) to red (2). The initial hypothesis was that other colors remain unchanged. The testing results provide more comprehensive view. It seems that all the train examples holds and therefore no changes are necessary

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirmation:** Since all the examples are correct, no changes are needed

**Metrics and Observations:**

To confirm, let's still define the metrics that we'd normally perform.
The core metric here is a simple comparison: for each (input, output) pair,
compare the `transform(input)` with the expected `output`.

**YAML Facts:**
```yaml
task: color_substitution_simple
observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: gray (5)
          - color: white (0)
          - color: blue (1)
      output:
        objects:
          - color: green (3)
          - color: red (2)
          - color: blue(1)
      transformations:
        - type: color_change
          from: gray (5)
          to: green (3)
        - type: color_change
          from: white (0)
          to: red (2)
        - type: no_change
          color: blue(1)

  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: gray (5)
          - color: white (0)
          - color: blue (1)
      output:
        objects:
          - color: green (3)
          - color: red (2)
          - color: blue(1)
      transformations:
        - type: color_change
          from: gray (5)
          to: green (3)
        - type: color_change
          from: white (0)
          to: red (2)
        - type: no_change
          color: blue(1)

  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: gray (5)
          - color: white (0)
      output:
        objects:
          - color: green (3)
          - color: red (2)
      transformations:
        - type: color_change
          from: gray (5)
          to: green (3)
        - type: color_change
          from: white (0)
          to: red (2)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Any gray (5) pixel becomes green (3).
2.  Any white (0) pixel becomes red (2).
3.  All other pixels retain their original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
