Previous Code:

    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule:
    - Gray (5) pixels become Red (2).
    - White (0) pixels become Yellow (4) if in the center, otherwise Red (2).

    Args:
        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The transformed grid.

    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Replace gray (5) with red (2)
    output_grid[output_grid == 5] = 2

    # Check for center pixel and replace white (0) with yellow (4)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples. The initial code was designed based on the first training example, and now we need to refine it based on how it performed on the other examples.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handles the first training example but fails on subsequent examples. The core issue seems to be an over-simplification of the transformation rule. The initial rule assumed all non-center white pixels should become red.  The other training examples, however, show that only *some* white pixels change to red, while others remain white. The logic concerning the center pixel and the gray pixels is correct, but identifying which surrounding whites become red and which should stay white is not and requires refinement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine *each* input-output pair, paying close attention to the spatial relationships between the white, gray, and the central white/yellow pixel. We're looking for a consistent rule that dictates which white pixels get converted.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, update the natural language description of the transformation, taking the new observations into account.
3.  **Hypothesis and Test:** Develop a clear hypothesis (the refined rule) and make sure that it's captured in the program description.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To thoroughly analyze the examples, let's look at the size of each grid. And also look for any objects in the grid.

import numpy as np

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
