Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a limited set of observations from the first training example. It correctly identified some key transformations (corner gray to green, center gray to yellow, white to red), but it's clearly incomplete and makes incorrect assumptions about the conditions for these transformations. The primary issue is that the code doesn't generalize well to other examples because it's overly specific to the structure of the *first* example. It assumes, for instance, that a gray pixel will *only* be in a corner or the center. It also doesn't handle other colors present in the input grids. The transformation rules need to be more general and consider *all* pixels, not just specific colors in specific locations. We also need to ensure that untransformed pixels are copied, not zeroed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden Scope:** The transformation logic must consider all pixels in the input, not just those matching specific criteria (gray, white). We must explicitly copy unchanged pixels.

2.  **Re-evaluate Conditions:** The conditions for color changes (gray to green/yellow) are too restrictive (corners, center). We need to analyze *all* examples to identify the *true* conditions, which likely relate to relative position/adjacency rather than absolute position.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll use a process of observation, hypothesis formation, code generation, testing, and analysis to iteratively refine the rules.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the transformations better, let's examine each example, focusing on how pixels change and their relationships. I'll note discrepancies and potential patterns. I cannot use code_execution.

**Example 0 (Correct):**

*   Input: 3x3, corners and center are gray (5), rest are white(0).
*   Output: Corners are green (3), center is yellow (4), rest are red(2)
*   *Result: Correct*

**Example 1 (Incorrect):**

*   Input: 5x5, single gray(5) in top-left. Rest 0.
*   Output: Top-left is green(3). Rest 2.
*   *Result: Incorrect.* The rest are zeroed in current output.

**Example 2 (Incorrect):**

*   Input: 7x7. Two gray(5) pixels - one at a corner, on not. Rest 0.
*   Output: Both gray pixels turn green(3). Rest 2.
*    *Result: Incorrect.* One gray is not at a corner and turns to 3. The rest is zeroed.

**Example 3 (Incorrect):**

*   Input: 5 x 5 all 0 except (1,1) which is 5.
*   Output: (1,1) is 3, rest 2.
*   *Result: Incorrect.* The rest are zeroed in current output.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: 0
    status: correct
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels in corners become green (3).
      - Gray (5) pixel in the center becomes yellow (4).
      - White (0) pixels become red (2).
  - id: 1
    status: incorrect
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixel in top-left becomes green (3) - matches example 0 corner rule.
      - White(0) becomes 2. But other 0 pixels are missing - should be 2.
  - id: 2
    status: incorrect
    observations: |
      - Both gray pixels become 3.
      - White(0) becomes 2. But other 0 pixels are missing.
  - id: 3
    status: incorrect
    observations:
      - Gray(5) at (1,1) becomes 3.
      - White(0) becomes 2. But other 0 pixels are missing.

general_observations:
  - The initial assumption that only corner grays become green is incorrect.
  - The initial assumption that only center grays become yellow is incorrect (no yellows observed outside example 0).
  - The current program only replaces specific colors in the output, leaving the rest as zeros.
  - White pixels are intended to become red.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Input:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Gray Transformation:** Any gray (5) pixel becomes green (3).
3. **White transformation:** Any white(0) pixel becomes red(2)
4.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels retain their original color from the input grid. This ensures no data loss.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
