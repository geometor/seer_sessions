The input grid contains the digits 0 and 5, while the output grid contains the digits 3 and 4. There's a clear spatial correspondence between the input and output grids. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex geometric manipulations like rotations or reflections. Instead, it seems to be a color substitution based on the original color and maybe its location.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
