examples:
  - id: 0
    status: correct
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels in corners become green (3).
      - Gray (5) pixel in the center becomes yellow (4).
      - White (0) pixels become red (2).
  - id: 1
    status: incorrect
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixel in top-left becomes green (3) - matches example 0 corner rule.
      - White(0) becomes 2. But other 0 pixels are missing - should be 2.
  - id: 2
    status: incorrect
    observations: |
      - Both gray pixels become 3.
      - White(0) becomes 2. But other 0 pixels are missing.
  - id: 3
    status: incorrect
    observations:
      - Gray(5) at (1,1) becomes 3.
      - White(0) becomes 2. But other 0 pixels are missing.

general_observations:
  - The initial assumption that only corner grays become green is incorrect.
  - The initial assumption that only center grays become yellow is incorrect (no yellows observed outside example 0).
  - The current program only replaces specific colors in the output, leaving the rest as zeros.
  - White pixels are intended to become red.
