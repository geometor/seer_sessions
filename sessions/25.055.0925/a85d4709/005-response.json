            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple color substitution rule. It correctly identified two transformations: gray (5) to green (3) and white (0) to red (2). The initial hypothesis was that other colors remain unchanged. The testing results provide more comprehensive view. It seems that all the train examples holds and therefore no changes are necessary\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirmation:** Since all the examples are correct, no changes are needed\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo confirm, let's still define the metrics that we'd normally perform.\nThe core metric here is a simple comparison: for each (input, output) pair,\ncompare the `transform(input)` with the expected `output`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n```yaml\ntask: color_substitution_simple\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: gray (5)\n          - color: white (0)\n          - color: blue (1)\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: green (3)\n          - color: red (2)\n          - color: blue(1)\n      transformations:\n        - type: color_change\n          from: gray (5)\n          to: green (3)\n        - type: color_change\n          from: white (0)\n          to: red (2)\n        - type: no_change\n          color: blue(1)\n\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: gray (5)\n          - color: white (0)\n          - color: blue (1)\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: green (3)\n          - color: red (2)\n          - color: blue(1)\n      transformations:\n        - type: color_change\n          from: gray (5)\n          to: green (3)\n        - type: color_change\n          from: white (0)\n          to: red (2)\n        - type: no_change\n          color: blue(1)\n\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: gray (5)\n          - color: white (0)\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: green (3)\n          - color: red (2)\n      transformations:\n        - type: color_change\n          from: gray (5)\n          to: green (3)\n        - type: color_change\n          from: white (0)\n          to: red (2)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  Any gray (5) pixel becomes green (3).\n2.  Any white (0) pixel becomes red (2).\n3.  All other pixels retain their original color.\n"
