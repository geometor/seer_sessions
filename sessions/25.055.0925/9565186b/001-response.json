The input grid contains pixels of red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). The output grid retains the red pixels (2) and replaces both the blue and azure pixels with grey (5) pixels. The overall shape and size (3x3) are preserved. The transformation seems to be a color replacement rule, specifically changing blue and azure to grey, conditioned by some criteria that aren't obvious from this single example.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
