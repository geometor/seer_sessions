Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identifies magenta (6) pixels in the input grid. Maintains the magenta pixels in the first column and moves all other magenta pixels to the first column, filling the rest with white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape
    
    # find all magenta pixels
    magenta_pixels = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if output_grid[r, c] == 6:
                magenta_pixels.append((r,c))

    # Fill output grid with white.  This will overwrite magenta
    #   pixels that will later be moved.
    output_grid[:] = 0

    # move first column and other magenta to the left
    magenta_col = 0
    for r,c in magenta_pixels:

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
