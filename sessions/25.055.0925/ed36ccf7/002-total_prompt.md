## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB5095CEA40>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB5095CF040>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   The grids contain two colors: maroon (9) and white (0).
*   The overall shape/structure of the grid is maintained during the transformation.
*   The transformation involves a change in the position of colors, suggesting movement or rearrangement of colored regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: maroon
        value: 9
      - color: white
        value: 0
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The maroon and white pixels form distinct regions within the grid."
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: "Pixels are rearranged."
    details: "Maroon and White regions swap some pixels."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the grid into two regions: a region made of maroon (9) pixels and a region of white (0) pixels.
2.  **Swap:** In first row and first column swap the white and maroon. Specifically:
    *   The first white cell in the top row, changes to maroon.
    *   The first cell, which starts as maroon changes to white.
3. **Output:** Maintain 3x3 output grid.

In more general term the program could be stated: swap the first column and first row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
