## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6
0 0 0
6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509888A60>

**output:**
```
6 0 0
6 0 6
6 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB5095CF7F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: magenta (6) and white (0). The output grid also contains magenta (6) and white (0) pixels, but their arrangement has changed. The task appears to involve manipulating pixel locations based on color and position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        type: categorical
        values: [0, 6]  # 0: white, 6: magenta

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          type: categorical
          values: [0, 6]
      - position:
          type: coordinate
          values: (row, col) #row and column indices

actions:
  - name: move_pixel
    description: Changes the position of a pixel within the grid.
    parameters:
      - from: original position (row, col)
      - to: new position (row, col)

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid structure, with adjacency being relevant.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Magenta Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are magenta (color value 6).

2.  **Maintain Left Column:** The magenta pixels in first column of input are kept.

3.  **Move to First Column:**  All remaining magenta colored pixels are moved to the first column. Other position are set to white/0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
