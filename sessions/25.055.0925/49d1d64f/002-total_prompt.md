## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 2
3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7EB50988AC80>

**output:**
```
0 1 2 0
1 1 2 2
3 3 8 8
0 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7EB50988AC50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to contain single-digit numbers, each representing a distinct color. The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with each original pixel replicated in a 2x2 block. The output also includes '0' (white) pixels surrounding the expanded input pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is a 2x2 matrix of colored pixels.
  - observation: Output grid is a 4x4 matrix of colored pixels.
  - object: InputPixel
    properties:
      color:  variable (1, 2, 3, 8 in the example)
      position: (row, column) in the input grid
  - object: OutputPixel
    properties:
      color: variable (matches corresponding InputPixel or 0)
      position: (row, column) in the output grid
  - action: Replication
    description: Each InputPixel is replicated into a 2x2 block in the output.
  - action: Padding
    description: The replicated blocks are surrounded by '0' (white) pixels.
  - relationship: InputPixel(r, c) maps to OutputPixel(2r-1, 2c-1), OutputPixel(2r-1, 2c), OutputPixel(2r, 2c-1), OutputPixel(2r, 2c).
  - constants:
      padding_color: 0
      replication_factor: 2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions, plus one additional row and column for padding.
2.  **Padding:** Fill the outermost rows and columns of the output grid with '0' (white).
3.  **Replication:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Copy the color of the input pixel.
    *   Create a 2x2 block in the output grid, starting at the position corresponding to twice the row and column indices of the input pixel, minus 1 to account for 0 indexing and padding.
    * Fill all four pixels of the 2x2 block with the copied color.

In simpler terms the input grid is replicated/expanded by a factor of 2. Then a 1 pixel border of color `0` is placed around it.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
