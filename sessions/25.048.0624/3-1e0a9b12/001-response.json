These are the \"objects\" we'll be working with. In this specific instance we have one object of color 1 at \\[3, 0], two objects of color 4 at \\[0, 1] and \\[2, 1], one object of color 6 at position \\[2, 2] and one object of color 9 at \\[0, 3].\n\n2.  **Move Down:** All non-background colored objects are moved down to the bottom-most free row of the grid, to row 3 in this instance.\n\n3.  **Preserve Column Position:** While moving objects down, their original column index remains fixed.\n\n4.  **Sort by column within the last row:** The objects keep their original column order.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n1. Find all non-zero colored cells in the input grid.\n2. Move the objects to the last row of the grid.\n3. Keep the column index constant during the operation.\n\n"
