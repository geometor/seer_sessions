Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes, one on the left is 2 cells high and 2 cells wide (top-left), and the other is 2 cells wide and 2 cells high(bottom right). The upper L-shape has the elbow at (2,1) and other at (3,5)"

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes. The upper L-shape has the elbow at (2,1) and other at (3,5)"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single separated cells."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Points:** Observe two points.
    *   The first point is one cell to the right of the top-left L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *   The second point is one cell to the left of the bottom-right L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.

3.  **Perform the Change:** Insert the identified colors in the correct place. All of the other cells from the input remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: "Locate the two separated L-shaped azure objects, identify the specific cells to the right and left of the L shaped objects, and change those to blue, maintaining every other cell."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
