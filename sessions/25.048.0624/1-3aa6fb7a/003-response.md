Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5,4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate L-shapes, one on the top-right is 2 cells wide and 2 cells high, other at middle left, and another one at bottom-right."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5,4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate L-shapes. The upper L-shape has the elbow at (0,5), the middle L-shape has the elbow at (3,2), and the bottom L-shape has the elbow at (6,4)."
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single separated cells."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Points:**
    *   The first point is one cell to the left of the top-right L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *   The second point is one cell to the right of the middle-left L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *  The third point is one cell to the left of the bottom L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.

3.  **Perform the Change:** Insert the identified colors in the correct place. All of the other cells from the input remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: "Locate the three separated L-shaped azure objects, identify the specific cells to the right or left of the L shaped objects, and change those to blue, maintaining every other cell."

The code written previously can perform this transformation, since it captures the general rule and can handle an arbitrary number of L shapes.
