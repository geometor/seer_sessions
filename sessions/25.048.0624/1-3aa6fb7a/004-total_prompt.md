Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes, one on the left is 2 cells high and 2 cells wide (top-left), and the other is 2 cells wide and 2 cells high(bottom right). The upper L-shape has the elbow at (2,1) and other at (3,5)"

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shapes. The upper L-shape has the elbow at (2,1) and other at (3,5)"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single separated cells."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Points:** Observe two points.
    *   The first point is one cell to the right of the top-left L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *   The second point is one cell to the left of the bottom-right L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.

3.  **Perform the Change:** Insert the identified colors in the correct place. All of the other cells from the input remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: "Locate the two separated L-shaped azure objects, identify the specific cells to the right and left of the L shaped objects, and change those to blue, maintaining every other cell."

      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three single separated cells."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Points:**
    *   The first point is one cell to the left of the top-right L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *   The second point is one cell to the right of the middle-left L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.
    *  The third point is one cell to the left of the bottom L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.

3.  **Perform the Change:** Insert the identified colors in the correct place. All of the other cells from the input remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule is: "Locate the three separated L-shaped azure objects, identify the specific cells to the right or left of the L shaped objects, and change those to blue, maintaining every other cell."

The code written previously can perform this transformation, since it captures the general rule and can handle an arbitrary number of L shapes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
