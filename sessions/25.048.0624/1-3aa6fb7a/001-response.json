The upper L-shape has the elbow at (2,1) and other at (3,5)\"\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n      shape: \"Two separate L-shapes. The upper L-shape has the elbow at (2,1) and other at (3,5)\"\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]\n      shape: \"Two single separated cells.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure).\n\n2.  **Locate Insertion Points:** Observe two points.\n    *   The first point is one cell to the right of the top-left L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.\n    *   The second point is one cell to the left of the bottom-right L. This position becomes color 1 (blue) in the output.\n\n3.  **Perform the Change:** Insert the identified colors in the correct place. All of the other cells from the input remain unchanged.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is: \"Locate the two separated L-shaped azure objects, identify the specific cells to the right and left of the L shaped objects, and change those to blue, maintaining every other cell.\"\n"
