The rest is background (color 0).\n\n2.  **Red object action:** The red pixel triggers the creation of four yellow pixels (color 4). These yellow pixels appear in a square pattern *around* where the red pixel *would have been*, if it had been moved one row up:\n    - Two yellow pixels above where the red pixel is located.\n    - Two yellow pixels below.\n    - The yellow pixels are positioned one column to the left and one column to the right.\n\n3. **Blue object Action:** Similarly, the blue pixel remains in place, but four orange pixels (color 7) appear around the blue pixel and with the same logic.\n\n    -   One orange pixel to the top.\n    -   One orange pixel to the bottom.\n    -   One orange pixel on the left.\n    -    One orange pixel on the right.\n\n4.  **Preservation of Initial Objects:** The original red and blue pixels maintain its color and position.\n\nIn short, we have two agents (red and blue). The red agent creates a cross (top, bottom, left, right) of color 4 centered one row above its position. The blue agent creates a cross (top, bottom, left, right) of color 7 centered in its position.\n\n"
