            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.\n\n**YAML Description of Input Grid**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 1 (blue)\n    positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 5], [1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2,5]]\n    shape: scattered\n  - color: 0 (white)\n    positions: [[0, 2], [0, 6], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 6]]\n    shape: scattered\n  - color: 5 (gray)\n    positions: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]\n    shape: vertical line\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the central pixel:** Find the center pixel of the input grid. In this case, the input grid is 3x7, so the center is at (1, 3). The color of the center pixel is 5.\n\n2. **Check surrounding blue pixels:**\n    - Count the number of the blue pixels around the gray vertical line object (color 5).\n    - Blue pixels at \\[0,1], \\[2,1], \\[1,4] which makes the count = 3.\n\n3.  **Create output grid**: Output grid will be always 3x3 filled with color 0.\n\n4. **Form output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\nCount how many blue pixels surround the grey line in each row. If the count of surrounding blue pixels is equal to 2 for any row, then the central pixel of that row in output grid will be 2.\n\n**Explanation of the Logic**\n\nThe transformation rule now appears to involve a more detailed examination of the surroundings of the central gray line:\n\nThe output is always a 3x3 grid. We determine which central pixels of rows should change color to 2.\nIf in the input grid, a row of the object with color 5 which is in the central column, has two neighbor blue pixels, the color of the central pixel of that row in the output grid will be 2.\n\n*text:*\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe updated transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Identify the vertical line object (color 5) and its central column.\n2. For each row, count the blue pixels (color 1) adjacent to the gray line.\n3. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0.\n4. For each row, if the count of adjacent blue pixels is exactly 2, set the central pixel of that row in the output grid to color 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_adjacent_blue_pixels(grid, center_col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of blue pixels (color 1) adjacent to the central column for each row.\n    Returns a list of counts for each row.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    counts = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        count = 0\n        if center_col > 0 and grid[r, center_col - 1] == 1:\n            count += 1\n        if center_col < cols - 1 and grid[r, center_col + 1] == 1:\n            count += 1\n        counts.append(count)\n    return counts\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the updated rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid as 3x3 with all zeros\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find the central column (assuming the gray line is always in the center)\n    _, cols = input_grid.shape\n    center_col = cols // 2\n\n    # Count adjacent blue pixels for each row\n    blue_counts_per_row = count_adjacent_blue_pixels(input_grid, center_col)\n\n    # Update the output grid based on the counts\n    for i, count in enumerate(blue_counts_per_row):\n        if count == 2:\n            output_grid[i, 1] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
