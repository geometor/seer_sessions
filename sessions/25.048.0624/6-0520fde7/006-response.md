"""
The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1. Identify the vertical line object (color 5) and its central column.
2. For each row, check if there's exactly one blue pixel (color 1) to the left or right of the gray line.
3. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0.
4. For each row:
   - If there's one blue pixel to the left, set the left pixel of that row in the output grid to 2.
   - If there's one blue pixel to the right, set the right pixel of that row in the output grid to 2.
