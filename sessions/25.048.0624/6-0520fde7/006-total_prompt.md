Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 1 (blue)
    positions: [[0, 0], [0, 5], [1, 1], [1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 0]]
    shape: scattered
  - color: 0 (white)
    positions: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 6], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6]]
    shape: scattered
  - color: 5 (gray)
    positions: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
    shape: vertical line
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the central pixel:** Find the center pixel of the input grid. In this case, the input grid is 3x7, so the center is at (1, 3). The color of the center pixel is 5.

2. **Check surrounding blue pixels:**
    - Count the number of the blue pixels around the gray vertical line object (color 5).
    - Blue pixels at \[1,1] and \[1,4] which makes the count = 2.

3.  **Create output grid**: Output grid will be always 3x3 filled with color 0.

4. **Form output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. If the count of surrounding blue pixels is equal to 2, change color of the central pixel into 2.

**Explanation of the Logic**

The core of the transformation rule seems to be like this:

The output is always a 3x3 grid. If in the input grid, the object with color 5 which is in the central column has two neighbor blue pixels, the color of the central pixel of the output grid will be 2.



*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1. Identify the central pixel of the input grid and the vertical line object (color 5).
2. Check and Count the number of blue pixels (color 1) that surround the vertical line.
3. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0.
4. If the count of surrounding blue pixels equals 2, set the central pixel of the output grid to color 2; otherwise, the output grid remains all zeros.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 1 (blue)
    positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 5], [1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2,5]]
    shape: scattered
  - color: 0 (white)
    positions: [[0, 2], [0, 6], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 6]]
    shape: scattered
  - color: 5 (gray)
    positions: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
    shape: vertical line
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the central pixel:** Find the center pixel of the input grid. In this case, the input grid is 3x7, so the center is at (1, 3). The color of the center pixel is 5.

2. **Check surrounding blue pixels:**
    - Count the number of the blue pixels around the gray vertical line object (color 5).
    - Blue pixels at \[0,1], \[2,1], \[1,4] which makes the count = 3.

3.  **Create output grid**: Output grid will be always 3x3 filled with color 0.

4. **Form output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
Count how many blue pixels surround the grey line in each row. If the count of surrounding blue pixels is equal to 2 for any row, then the central pixel of that row in output grid will be 2.

**Explanation of the Logic**

The transformation rule now appears to involve a more detailed examination of the surroundings of the central gray line:

The output is always a 3x3 grid. We determine which central pixels of rows should change color to 2.
If in the input grid, a row of the object with color 5 which is in the central column, has two neighbor blue pixels, the color of the central pixel of that row in the output grid will be 2.

The updated transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1. Identify the vertical line object (color 5) and its central column.
2. For each row, count the blue pixels (color 1) adjacent to the gray line.
3. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0.
4. For each row, if the count of adjacent blue pixels is exactly 2, set the central pixel of that row in the output grid to color 2.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the third example.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

objects:
  - color: 1 (blue)
    positions: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 4], [2,6]]

    positions: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the central pixel:** Find the center pixel of the input grid. In this case, the input grid is 3x7, so the center is at (1, 3). The color of the center pixel is 5.

2. **Check surrounding blue pixels:**
    - Count the number of the blue pixels to the left and to the right of the gray vertical line object (color 5) in each row.

3.  **Create output grid**: Output grid will be always 3x3 filled with color 0.

4. **Form output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
Count how many blue pixels surround the grey line in each row. If the count of surrounding blue pixels is equal to 1 for any row, then the left pixel if there is a blue pixel to the left, and the right pixel, if there is a blue pixel to the right of that row in output grid will be 2.

**Explanation of the Logic**

The output is always a 3x3 grid. We determine which left and right pixels of rows should change color to 2.
If in the input grid, a row of the object with color 5 which is in the central column, has one neighbor blue pixel to the left, then the color of the left pixel of that row in the output grid will be 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
