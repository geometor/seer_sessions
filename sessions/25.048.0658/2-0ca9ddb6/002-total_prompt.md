Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: 1x1, arranged around red object
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1, arranged around blue object
     - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the single red (color 2) pixel and the single blue (color 1) pixel in the input grid.

2.  **Red Surroundings:** For the red pixel, change the color of the pixels immediately above, below, to the left and right to the color yellow (value 4).

3.  **Blue Surroundings:** For the blue pixel, change the color of the pixels immediately above, below, to the left and right to the color orange(value 7).

4. **Preservation:** The positions of the original red and blue pixel are preserved.

5. **Background:** All other pixels remain unchanged (color 0).

In essence, the transformation rule involves identifying specific colored pixels (red and blue) and changing the color of their immediate neighbors to a new color, based on which pixel is the "center". The central pixels themselves remain in their input position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
