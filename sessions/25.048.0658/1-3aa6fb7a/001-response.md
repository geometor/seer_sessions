Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and two single 1x1 squares.
        position: 
          - One 2x1 shape at (1,1), (2,1)
          - One 1x1 shape at (2,2)
          - One 2x1 shape at (3,4), (4,4)
          - One 1x1 shape at (3,5)
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7

  output_grid:
      - color: 8
        shape: same as input.
        position: same as input.
      - color: 1
        shape: 1x1.
        position: replaces single square objects of color 8.
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, locate all the objects that are azure (color 8).
2.  **Categorize:** Identify if an object of colour 8 consists of 2 vertically stacked squares, or a single 1x1 square.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** All single azure (color 8) square objects are replaced by blue (color 1).
4. **Preservation:** All other azure objects, and empty cells maintain their original color.

In essence, single-celled azure objects are replaced with blue, while others, bigger objects, are preserved, as well as the white background.
