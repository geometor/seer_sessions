Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: >
          Various shapes including single cells, 2x1 vertical,
          and 2x2 blocks.
        position: Distributed across the grid.
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7

  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Same as input, excluding single cells.
        position: Same as input for non-single cells.
      - color: 1
        shape: 1x1
        position: Replaces single-cell azure objects from input.
    background_color: 0
    size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is identical to the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  **Categorize Objects:** Determine the size of each azure object.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** Replace single-cell (1x1) azure objects with blue (color 1).
4.  **Preservation:** Keep all other azure objects (those larger than 1x1) and all background (color 0) cells unchanged.

The core concept is the identification and replacement of *single-cell* azure objects with blue ones, leaving larger azure objects and the rest of the grid untouched. The `transform` function provided previously perfectly implements this rule, and therefore correctly transforms the given input grid to the expected output grid.
