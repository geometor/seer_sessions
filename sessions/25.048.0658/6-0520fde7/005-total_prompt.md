Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 5
      positions: [(0,0), (0,5), (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0)]
    gray_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      count: 13
      positions:  [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_objects:
      count: 1
      positions: [(1,1)]
    white_objects:
      count: 8
      positions: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation follows these steps:

1.  **Identify the Centroid:** Determine the centroid of the input grid. In this case centroid calculation are performed on the coordinates of cells that contain color different than `0`.
((0+0+0+1+1+1+1+2+0+1+2+0+0+0+1+1+2+2) / 18, (0+5+3+1+4+5+6+0+3+0+3+1+2+4+5+6+1+2) / 18) = (0.94, 2.94) ~ (1,3).

2.  **Extract Central Pixel:** Use the calculated centroid to identify the central pixel in the input grid. The integer part of centroid coordinates points to the central pixel: (1, 3).

3. **Construct the Output Grid Shell**: Create an empty 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).

4.  **Map Central Pixel:**
    *   If the central pixel from input is not white(0) paint into the center cell (1, 1) of the output grid a predefined color. In this case we map non-zero to red(2).
    *   If the central pixel is zero leave the cell (1,1) of output grid with the background color (white).


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation identifies the centroid of the non-white pixels in the input grid.
It extracts the color of the pixel at the centroid's coordinates.
A 3x3 output grid is created, filled with white (0).
If the central pixel from the input is not white (0), the center cell (1, 1) of the output grid is colored red (2).
Otherwise, the center cell remains white (0).

Okay, let's analyze the second transformation example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 7
      positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,5), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,5)]
    gray_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      count: 11
      positions:  [(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6)]

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,1), (1,2), (2,1)]
    white_objects:
      count: 6
      positions: [(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2)]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is more complex than the first example and appears to involve a pattern or shape detection and mapping, rather than just a simple centroid.

Let's break down a possible rule, focusing on relative positioning and pattern recognition:

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0).

2. **Extract 3x3 Subgrids**: From each non-white pixel, check if 3x3 subgrid can be formed where non-white pixel is the top-left element of that subgrid.

3.  **Pattern Check:** For each 3x3 subgrid found, determine if there are exactly three non-zero pixels within the 3x3 sub-grid.

4. **Map to Output:**
    *   If there are exactly three non-zero cells, map those into the output grid so their relative coordinates in the output grid are the same as the relative coordinate in the subgrid.

*text:*
```python
"""
This transformation identifies patterns of non-white pixels in the input grid.
It locates all 3x3 subgrids and identifies those that contain exactly three non-zero cells.
If 3x3 subgrid contains exactly 3 non-zero cells, those are mapped to output grid with color red(2).
