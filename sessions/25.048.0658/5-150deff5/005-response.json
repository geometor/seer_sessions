            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this third transformation example.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  dimensions: 8x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 5\n      shape: Irregular, resembling a stylized \"E\" or a mirrored \"3\".\n      position: Starts at (1,1)\n      notes: Spans multiple rows and columns.\n  background:\n    color: 0\n\noutput_grid:\n  dimensions: 8x9\n  objects:\n    - color: 8\n      shape: Appears as blocks on the right side.\n      position: Occupies the areas to the right of the \"E\".\n    - color: 2\n      shape: Appears as vertical lines.\n      position: Appears in the \"stem\" and prongs of the \"E\".\n  background:\n    color: 0\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** The input grid has a single object of color 5 (gray) against a background of color 0 (white).  The object's shape can be described as resembling a stylized \"E\".\n\n2.  **Decompose and Recolor Based on Contiguity:** Similar to the previous example, the transformation recolors parts of the object based on their contiguity characteristics.\n    *   **Single Vertical Contiguous Parts (Color 2):**  Parts of the \"E\" that form a single vertical line are recolored to 2 (red). This includes not just the vertical spine, but each vertical bar of each \"prong\". We are detecting local contiguity.\n    *   **Other Parts (Color 8):** The remaining sections of the \"E\", which have greater horizontal contiguity (more than one adjacent pixel in a row), are recolored to 8 (azure).\n\n3. **No other changes.** The parts of the input that are not color 5, are left the same.\n\nThe rule combines the ideas from the first two tasks. The transformation rule, similar to the previous case, involves decomposing an object into components based on the local vertical contiguity and recoloring those based on if the color is only contiguous vertically or also horizontally.\n\n**Python Code**\n\nThe Python code from the second transformation should correctly handle this case as well. I'll reproduce it here for completeness, but no changes are needed:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous regions of the same color in a grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, obj):\n        if (r < 0 or r >= grid.shape[0] or c < 0 or c >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != color):\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, obj)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], obj)\n                objects.append(obj)\n    return objects\n\ndef split_object_by_contiguity(obj, grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits the object into parts based on contiguity.\n    \"\"\"\n    single_contiguous_parts = []\n    other_parts = []\n\n    for r, c in obj:\n        neighbors = 0\n        # Check adjacent cells (not diagonally)\n        if (r + 1, c) in obj: neighbors += 1\n        if (r - 1, c) in obj: neighbors += 1\n        if (r, c + 1) in obj: neighbors += 1\n        if (r, c - 1) in obj: neighbors += 1\n\n        # If a position as only a single vertical connection with\n        # neighbors, it goes into single_contiguous_vertical\n        is_single_vertical = False\n        if neighbors <= 2:\n            if ((r+1,c) in obj and (r-1,c) in obj) and not ((r,c+1) in obj or (r,c-1) in obj):\n                is_single_vertical = True\n            elif neighbors == 1 and ( (r+1, c) in obj or (r-1,c) in obj):\n                is_single_vertical = True\n\n\n        if is_single_vertical:\n            single_contiguous_parts.append((r, c))\n        else:\n            other_parts.append((r, c))\n    return single_contiguous_parts, other_parts\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = get_objects(input_grid)\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        if input_grid[obj[0]] == 5:  # Assuming color 5 is the object to modify\n            single_parts, other_parts = split_object_by_contiguity(obj, input_grid)\n\n            for r, c in single_parts:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 2  # Recolor single contiguous parts to 2\n\n            for r, c in other_parts:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 8 # Recolor other parts to 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
