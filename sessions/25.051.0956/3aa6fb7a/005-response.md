Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (0,4) # Top-left corner of the object
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (2,2) # Top-left corner of the object
    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (5,4)
    - object_4:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (6,3)

  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (0,4)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (2,2)
    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (5,4)
    - object_4:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (6,3)
    - object_5:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1,5)
    - object_6:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (2,3)
    - object_7:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (5,3)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, there are four L-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Preserve Objects:** These objects maintain their shape, color, and location in the output grid.

3.  **Add Blue Pixel:**  A blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the corner of each L-shaped object, similar to the first example.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

The transformation preserves all four azure L-shaped objects, keeping their original positions and shapes.  A single blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right side of the corner pixel of each L-shaped object. The logic is consistent with the previous example, but applied to four objects instead of two.
