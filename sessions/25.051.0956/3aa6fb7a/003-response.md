Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the transformation rule description.

**Analysis of the Failed Examples and Revised Understanding**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly identified the corner of the "L" shape and misplaced the blue pixel. The core issue is determining the correct orientation of the "L" and placing the blue pixel accordingly. It's not always *immediately* to the right of the corner pixel; it depends on the 'open' side of the L.

Here's a revised breakdown of the transformation:

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all azure (color 8) "L"-shaped objects. An "L" shape is defined as a 2x2 block with one cell removed.

2.  **Corner Identification:** For each azure "L" shape, determine the "corner" pixel. The corner is the pixel within the 2x2 bounding box that is occupied by the shape.

3. **Blue Pixel Placement**:
    The key is to find where the L-shape extends from this corner.
    * Find the two azure pixels adjacent to the corner.
    * Place a blue pixel (color 1) adjacent to the corner, *but not* adjacent to any of the other azure pixels.

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Locate Azure L-Shapes:** Find all azure (color 8) objects that form an "L" shape (a 2x2 square with one cell missing).

2.  **Identify the Corner:** For each L-shape, determine the corner pixel. This is the pixel within the L-shape that is part of a potential 2x2 square.

3. **Determine open direction:** Check the neighbor of the corner to determine which direction to add the blue pixel.

4.  **Add Blue Pixel:** Place a single blue pixel (color 1) adjacent to the identified corner of the L-shape, on the side *opposite* to the rest of the "L". In other words, the added blue pixel extends the 'line' which makes the corner.

**Why the Previous Approach Failed**

The previous implementation made a simplifying, but flawed assumption regarding the placement relative to the corner. It looks like the blue pixel is not directly on the right of the azure shape. Instead, it is positioned such that it extends a line from the corner.

Next step would be to try it with python code.
