The \"arms\" of the plus extend one cell away from the red cell.\n    *   For each identified blue cell (color 1), generate a \"plus\" shape centered around, but *not* touching, the original cell using orange (color 7). The \"arms\" of the plus extend one cell away from the blue cell.\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** Any cell that is not part of the generated \"plus\" shapes retains its original color (including azure (8) in this case and 0, the background).\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies blue and red cells, then constructs \"plus-shaped\" patterns of specific colors around them. Azure cells are considered as the background and are not modified.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify Target Color Cells:** Locate cells with colors blue (1) and red (2).\n\n2.  **Create Plus Shapes:**\n    *   For each identified red cell (color 2), generate a \"plus\" shape centered around, but *not* touching, the original cell using yellow (color 4).
