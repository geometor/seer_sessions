Okay, I've analyzed the results of the previous code execution on the training examples and identified the issue. The plus shapes are being drawn *centered on* the target cells (red and blue), overwriting them. Instead, the plus shapes should be drawn *around* the target cells, leaving the target cells themselves unchanged.

Here's the revised natural language program:

1.  **Identify Target Cells:** Locate all cells with the colors red (2) and blue (1).

2.  **Create Surrounding Plus Shapes:**
    *   For each red cell (color 2), create a "plus" shape using yellow (color 4) in the four cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the red cell.  Do *not* change the color of the red cell itself.
    *   For each blue cell (color 1), create a "plus" shape using orange (color 7) in the four cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the blue cell. Do *not* change the color of the blue cell itself.

3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid (those that are not red or blue, and are not part of a plus shape drawn around a red or blue cell) retain their original color.

The key change is to emphasize that the plus shapes are created *around* the target cells, not *on* them. The previous program's description and code incorrectly centered the plus shape on the target cell.
