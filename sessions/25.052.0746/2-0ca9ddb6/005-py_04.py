1.  **Identify Target Color Cells:** Locate cells with colors blue (1) and red (2).

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:**
    *   For each identified red cell (color 2), generate a "plus" shape centered around, but *not* touching, the original cell using yellow (color 4).  The "arms" of the plus extend one cell away from the red cell.
    *   For each identified blue cell (color 1), generate a "plus" shape centered around, but *not* touching, the original cell using orange (color 7). The "arms" of the plus extend one cell away from the blue cell.

3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** Any cell that is not part of the generated "plus" shapes retains its original color (including azure (8) in this case and 0, the background).
