Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1 (blue)
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      position: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)
      shape: single cells forming a plus shape around the red cell, but not directly touching
    - color: 7 (orange)
      position: (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)
      shape: single cells forming a plus shape, around the blue cell, but not directly touching
    - color: 0 (white)
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Singular Color Cells:** Locate all the cells with colors, each being the unique member of that color in the input grid. The example colors provided are Red (2) at (3,2) and Blue(1) at (6,6).

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:** For each identified single-color cell:
    *   Generate a "plus" shape centered around, but not touching the original cell with a new color. The shapes and colors around the red and blue cells are the same, and are at a one cell distance.
    *   For the red cell (color 2), place yellow (color 4) cells in a plus shape around the center. The arms of each "plus" extend one cell away from the original cell.
    *    For the blue cell (color 1), place orange(color 7) cells in a plus shape around the center. The arms of each "plus" extend one cell away from the original cell.

3. **Background:** All other cells remain unchanged (color 0).

In summary, the transformation identifies single-color cells, then constructs "plus-shaped" patterns of a specific different color around them, using those original color cells as the center of each plus (but not included in the plus).
