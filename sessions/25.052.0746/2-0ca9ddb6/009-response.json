The \"arms\" of the plus extend one cell away from the red cell.\n    *   For each identified blue cell (color 1), generate a \"plus\" shape centered *around*, but *not* touching, the original cell using orange (color 7). The \"arms\" of the plus extend one cell away from the blue cell.\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** Any cell that is not part of the identified target cells or the generated \"plus\" shapes retains its original color. This includes the magenta cell (6) and the white background (0).\n\nThe main difference between this and previous examples is that this example consolidates and generalizes the rule: it creates a plus with colors 4 (yellow) and 7 (orange) around the red (2) and blue (1) cells respectively, and *preserves* other single colored cells in the grid.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify Target Color Cells:** Locate cells with colors red (2) and blue (1).\n\n2.  **Create Plus Shapes:**\n    *   For each identified red cell (color 2), generate a \"plus\" shape centered *around*, but *not* touching, the original cell using yellow (color 4).
