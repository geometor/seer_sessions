These \"L\" shapes are composed of three adjacent cells of color 8 (azure) forming a 2x2 block with one cell missing. There are four possible orientations for the \"L\" shape (normal, mirrored, and rotated).\n\n2.  **Check Orientation and Position:** For each identified \"L\" shape:\n\n    *   If it's a \"right-facing\" L (the single cell is on the right), and the cell to the *right* of the corner of the \"L\" is within the grid bounds, change the color of that adjacent cell to 1 (blue). The 'corner' is the single 8 in that configuration.\n    *    If it is a \"left-facing\" L (the single cell is on the left), and the cell immediately to the *left* of the corner of the \"L\" is within bounds, change that adjacent cell's color to 1 (blue). The 'corner' is the single 8.\n\n3. **No other changes:** All other cells in the grid retain their original colors.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on identifying 'L' shaped objects of color 8 and changing adjacent cells to color 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check for right-facing L\n            if (r > 0 and c < cols - 1 and\n                output_grid[r, c] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r - 1, c] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r - 1, c + 1] == 8):\n                output_grid[r, c + 1] = 1\n\n            # Check for left-facing L\n            if (r < rows - 1 and c > 0 and\n                output_grid[r, c] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r, c - 1] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r + 1, c - 1] == 8):\n                output_grid[r, c - 1] = 1\n\n            # Check for bottom-left-facing L\n            if (r > 0 and c > 0 and\n                output_grid[r, c] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r, c - 1] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r - 1, c - 1] == 8):\n                    output_grid[r, c-1] = 1\n\n            # Check for top-right-facing L\n            if (r < rows -1 and c < cols - 1 and\n                output_grid[r,c] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r, c+1] == 8 and\n                output_grid[r+1,c+1] == 8):\n                    output_grid[r,c+1] = 1\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
