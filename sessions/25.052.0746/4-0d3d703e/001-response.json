The spatial arrangement (left, middle, right columns) remains the same, and it suggests a consistent color mapping.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct vertical lines, each occupying a single column and consisting of a uniform color. These are our primary objects.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** The core transformation is a color substitution. The specific mapping appears to be:\n    *   Input color 3 (left column) becomes output color 4.\n    *   Input color 1 (middle column) becomes output color 5.\n    *   Input color 2 (right column) becomes output color 6.\n\n3.  **Spatial Preservation:** The positions and shapes of the objects (vertical lines) are preserved. Each object in the input has a direct, spatially corresponding counterpart in the output. No objects are added or removed, and they maintain their shape and size, only their color changes.\n\n4. **Complete Description**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines of colors 3, 1, and 2. The output grid has the same structure but substitutes each input color with a distinct color.\n\nThis transformation rule focuses on a consistent color mapping while preserving the spatial structure of the input grid.\n"
