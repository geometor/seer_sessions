input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 1
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 2
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 5
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 6
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
transformation_rule:
  description: Each vertical line of a specific color in the input grid is transformed into a vertical line of a different, corresponding color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement (left, middle, right columns) remains the same, and it suggests a consistent color mapping.
