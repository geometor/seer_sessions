The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. Identify all "L" shaped objects (2x2 blocks with one cell missing) of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.  There are two orientations of the "L" shape: a regular "L" and a mirrored "L".
2. For each regular "L" shaped object, if the '8' colored cell is the right-most within the "L", change the color of the cell immediately to its right to 1 (blue), provided this cell exists and is within the grid boundaries.
3. For each mirrored "L" shaped object, if the '8' colored cell is the left-most within the "L", change the color of the cell immediately to its left to 1 (blue), provided that cell exists and is within the grid boundaries.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
