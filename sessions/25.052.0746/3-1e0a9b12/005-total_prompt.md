Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block Observation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - color: 0 (white)
        count: 11
        shape: background
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        count: 2
        shape: isolated cells
        positions: [0,1], [2,1]
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [0,3]
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [2,2]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [3,0]

  output_grid:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - color: 0 (white)
        count: 12
        shape: background

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of isolated cells of colors 1 (blue), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), and 9 (maroon) against a background of color 0 (white).

2.  **Predicate:** The non-white cells maintain their colors.

3. **Action:** Move the colored cells to the bottom row, maintaining the x value, stacking the cells in order from bottom to top, keeping the original colors.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation moves all non-zero colored cells to the last row available, keeping their original colors. The colored objects do not change color, they are just translated.

```python

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block Observation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 6x6
    objects:
      - color: 0 (white)
        count: 28
        shape: background
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        count: 3
        shape: vertical line
        positions: [[3,0], [4,0], [5,0]]

        shape: vertical line
        positions: [[4,2], [5,2]]

        positions: [[1,3], [4,3]]
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1

      - color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [[5,5]]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of a vertical line of yellow (4), two vertical lines of orange (7) and azure (8), and an isolated cell maroon(9).

2.  **Predicate:** The non-white cells maintain their original colors.

3.  **Action**:
    *   Translate vertically the azure object, to occupy the lowest available position.

    *    Other colored cells remain in their places.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation moves all non-zero colored cells to the last row available, keeping their original colors and x-coordinates.
The previous python program is enough to produce the right output.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [[5,5]]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of several colored objects against a white (0) background:
    *   A vertical line of three yellow (4) cells.
    *   A vertical line of two orange (7) cells.
    *   Two azure (8) cells, one at row 1 and another at row 4 (same column).
    *   A single maroon (9) cell.

2.  **Predicate:** All colored cells (non-white) maintain their original colors throughout the transformation.

3.  **Action:**
    *   The azure (8) cells at \[1, 3] and \[4, 3] are consolidated into a single vertical line at the bottom of the grid, occupying positions \[4, 3] and \[5, 3]. The two 8s stack.
    *   The maroon (9) cell moves to the lowest available row in its column.
    *   All other colored cells remain in their original positions.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
Non-zero colored objects are moved down to the lowest available position in their respective columns, maintaining their color and x-coordinate. The previous program can produce this output. If there is a stack of objects of the same color they are grouped.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
