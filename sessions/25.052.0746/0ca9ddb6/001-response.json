The example colors provided are Red (2) at (3,2) and Blue(1) at (6,6).\n\n2.  **Create Plus Shapes:** For each identified single-color cell:\n    *   Generate a \"plus\" shape centered around, but not touching the original cell with a new color. The shapes and colors around the red and blue cells are the same, and are at a one cell distance.\n    *   For the red cell (color 2), place yellow (color 4) cells in a plus shape around the center. The arms of each \"plus\" extend one cell away from the original cell.\n    *    For the blue cell (color 1), place orange(color 7) cells in a plus shape around the center. The arms of each \"plus\" extend one cell away from the original cell.\n\n3. **Background:** All other cells remain unchanged (color 0).\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies single-color cells, then constructs \"plus-shaped\" patterns of a specific different color around them, using those original color cells as the center of each plus (but not included in the plus).\n"
