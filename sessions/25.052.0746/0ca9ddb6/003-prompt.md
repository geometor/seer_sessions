"""
1.  **Identify Singular Color Cells:** Locate all the cells with colors, each being the unique member of that color in the input grid. The example colors provided are Red (2) at (3,2) and Blue(1) at (6,6).

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:** For each identified single-color cell:
    *   Generate a "plus" shape centered around, but not touching the original cell with a new color. The shapes and colors around the red and blue cells are the same, and are at a one cell distance.
    *   For the red cell (color 2), place yellow (color 4) cells in a plus shape around the center. The arms of each "plus" extend one cell away from the original cell.
    *    For the blue cell (color 1), place orange(color 7) cells in a plus shape around the center. The arms of each "plus" extend one cell away from the original cell.

3. **Background:** All other cells remain unchanged (color 0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
