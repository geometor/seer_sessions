This plus shape is centered *adjacent to* the red cell, meaning the yellow cells *do not* replace the original red cell. The plus shape's arms extend one cell in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the central red cell's position.\n    *   For each blue cell (1): Create a \"plus\" shape made of orange cells (7).  This plus shape is also centered *adjacent to* the blue cell. The orange cells do not replace the original blue cell. The arms extend one cell in each cardinal direction.\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid (those not colored blue or red, and not part of a generated plus shape) remain unchanged.
