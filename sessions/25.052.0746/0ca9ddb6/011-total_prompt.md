"""
1.  **Identify Target Color Cells:** Locate cells with colors red (2) and blue (1).

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:**
    *   For each identified red cell (color 2), generate a "plus" shape centered *around*, but *not* touching, the original cell using yellow (color 4). The "arms" of the plus extend one cell away from the red cell.
    *   For each identified blue cell (color 1), generate a "plus" shape centered *around*, but *not* touching, the original cell using orange (color 7). The "arms" of the plus extend one cell away from the blue cell.

3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** Any cell that is not part of the identified target cells or the generated "plus" shapes retains its original color. This includes the magenta cell (6) and the white background (0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
