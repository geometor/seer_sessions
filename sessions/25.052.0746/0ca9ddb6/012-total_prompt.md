1.  **Identify Target Color Cells:** Locate cells with colors red (2) and blue (1).

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:**
    *   For each identified red cell (color 2), generate a "plus" shape centered *around*, but *not* touching, the original cell using yellow (color 4). The "arms" of the plus extend one cell away from the red cell.
    *   For each identified blue cell (color 1), generate a "plus" shape centered *around*, but *not* touching, the original cell using orange (color 7). The "arms" of the plus extend one cell away from the blue cell.

3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** Any cell that is not part of the identified target cells or the generated "plus" shapes retains its original color. This includes the magenta cell (6) and the white background (0).

Status: False
Okay, I've analyzed the results of the previous code execution on the training examples and identified the issue. The plus shapes are being drawn *centered on* the target cells (red and blue), overwriting them. Instead, the plus shapes should be drawn *around* the target cells, leaving the target cells themselves unchanged.

Here's the revised natural language program:

1.  **Identify Target Cells:** Locate all cells with the colors red (2) and blue (1).

2.  **Create Surrounding Plus Shapes:**
    *   For each red cell (color 2), create a "plus" shape using yellow (color 4) in the four cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the red cell.  Do *not* change the color of the red cell itself.
    *   For each blue cell (color 1), create a "plus" shape using orange (color 7) in the four cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the blue cell. Do *not* change the color of the blue cell itself.

3.  **Preserve Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid (those that are not red or blue, and are not part of a plus shape drawn around a red or blue cell) retain their original color.

The key change is to emphasize that the plus shapes are created *around* the target cells, not *on* them. The previous program's description and code incorrectly centered the plus shape on the target cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
