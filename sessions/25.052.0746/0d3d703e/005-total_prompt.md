Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 1
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 2
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
    - color: 5
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
    - color: 6
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
transformation_rule:
  description: Each vertical line of a specific color in the input grid is transformed into a vertical line of a different, corresponding color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement (left, middle, right columns) remains the same, and it suggests a consistent color mapping.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct vertical lines, each occupying a single column and consisting of a uniform color. These are our primary objects.

2.  **Color Mapping:** The core transformation is a color substitution. The specific mapping appears to be:
    *   Input color 3 (left column) becomes output color 4.
    *   Input color 1 (middle column) becomes output color 5.
    *   Input color 2 (right column) becomes output color 6.

3.  **Spatial Preservation:** The positions and shapes of the objects (vertical lines) are preserved. Each object in the input has a direct, spatially corresponding counterpart in the output. No objects are added or removed, and they maintain their shape and size, only their color changes.

4. **Complete Description**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines of colors 3, 1, and 2. The output grid has the same structure but substitutes each input color with a distinct color.

This transformation rule focuses on a consistent color mapping while preserving the spatial structure of the input grid.

```python
"""
The input grid consists of three vertical lines of colors 3, 1, and 2. 
The output grid has the same structure but substitutes each input color 
with a distinct color according to the following mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by applying a color mapping while preserving 
    the spatial structure.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Define the color mapping
    color_map = {
        3: 4,
        1: 5,
        2: 6
    }

    # Iterate through the input grid and apply the color mapping
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[i, j] in color_map:
                output_grid[i, j] = color_map[input_grid[i, j]]

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
