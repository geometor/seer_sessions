"""
The input grid consists of three vertical lines of colors 3, 1, and 2. 
The output grid has the same structure but substitutes each input color 
with a distinct color according to the following mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.

    the spatial structure.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
