task_description: Fill a pattern along the midline inside hollow rectangles based on background color parity.

definitions:
  background_color: The color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  background_parity: The parity (0 for even, 1 for odd) of the numerical value of the background_color.
  hollow_rectangle: An object composed of a single non-background color forming a rectangular border exactly one pixel thick. The area strictly inside this border must contain only the background_color in the input grid.
  internal_area: The region of pixels strictly inside the border of a hollow_rectangle.
  internal_midline_row: The row index corresponding to the horizontal center of the internal_area. Calculated as `min_row + 1 + (internal_height // 2)`, where `min_row` is the top row of the rectangle border and `internal_height` is the height of the internal_area.
  internal_columns: The column indices corresponding to the internal_area. These range from `min_col + 1` to `max_col - 1`, inclusive, where `min_col` and `max_col` define the rectangle's border columns.

steps:
  - step: 1. Identify Context
    action: Determine the background_color and background_parity from the input grid.
  - step: 2. Initialize Output
    action: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background_color.
  - step: 3. Find Objects
    action: Identify all hollow_rectangles in the input grid. For each, note its color, border coordinates, and bounding box.
  - step: 4. Process Each Rectangle
    actions:
      - action: 4a. Draw Border
        on_object: hollow_rectangle
        effect: Copy the pixels forming the rectangle's border from the input grid to the output grid, using the rectangle's color.
      - action: 4b. Apply Midline Pattern
        on_object: hollow_rectangle
        condition: The rectangle must have an internal_area (height > 2 and width > 2).
        effect:
          - Calculate the internal_midline_row.
          - Iterate through all internal_columns (`col`).
          - If the parity of `col` matches the background_parity, set the pixel at `(internal_midline_row, col)` in the output grid to the rectangle's color.
  - step: 5. Finalize
    action: Return the completed output grid.
