            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming input grids containing various colored shapes and pixels into output grids. Each input grid features a dominant background color, several hollow rectangles constructed from a single color different from the background, and some scattered pixels (\"noise\") of various colors.\n\nThe transformation rule appears to operate primarily on the hollow rectangles. The core logic involves:\n1.  Identifying the background color.\n2.  Identifying the hollow rectangular structures. Each rectangle is defined by a single-pixel thick border of a specific color, enclosing an area filled solely with the background color.\n3.  Identifying and discarding any other non-background pixels (noise) that are not part of these hollow rectangles.\n4.  Modifying the interior of each identified hollow rectangle. Specifically, pixels along the horizontal midline of the rectangle's *internal* area are selectively colored with the rectangle's border color.\n5.  The selection criteria for coloring pixels on the midline depend on the parity (odd or even) of the background color's numerical value. If the background color value is odd, pixels at *odd* absolute column indices on the midline are colored. If the background color value is even, pixels at *even* absolute column indices on the midline are colored.\n6.  The final output grid consists of the original background color, the intact hollow rectangle borders, and the newly colored pixels within the rectangles' midlines.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
