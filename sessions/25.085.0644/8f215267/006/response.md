## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully identified the background color and the hollow rectangles (1-pixel border, width > 2, height > 2, background interior). It also correctly filtered out other shapes. However, the logic for filling pixels on the horizontal midline of the rectangle's interior was incorrect. The initial assumption that pixels are filled *only* based on the column index parity matching the background color parity does not hold true across all examples.

The comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals that the *selection* of which columns (with the correct parity) to fill depends on more factors. The strategy is to:

1.  **Re-analyze the pattern:** Examine the relationship between the background color parity, the rectangle color parity, and potentially the specific rectangle color itself, to determine the exact rule for selecting which columns on the midline get filled.
2.  **Gather detailed metrics:** Programmatically extract information about the background, rectangles, internal columns, target parity columns, and the actual filled columns in the expected output for each example to confirm the observed patterns.
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to incorporate the newly discovered rules for midline filling.
4.  **Update the code:** Modify the implementation to reflect the refined pattern logic.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's extract the relevant details for each hollow rectangle in the training examples.
