"""
The transformation identifies isolated pixels of specific 'trigger' colors (red, green, gray) in the input grid. 
It then modifies a copy of the input grid by first removing any existing pixels that have 'output' colors (blue, yellow, magenta). 
Finally, it draws a 4x4 hollow square onto the modified grid, centered at the location of each identified isolated trigger pixel. 
The color of the square's perimeter is determined by a mapping from the trigger color (red->yellow, green->blue, gray->magenta), and the interior of the square is set to the background color (white).

1. Define trigger, output, and background colors:
   - Trigger colors: Red (2), Green (3), Gray (5)
   - Output colors: Blue (1), Yellow (4), Magenta (6)
   - Background color: White (0)
   - Color mapping: Red -> Yellow, Green -> Blue, Gray -> Magenta

2. Initialize output grid: Create a copy of the input grid.

3. Clear existing output colors: Iterate through the output grid. Set any pixel matching an output color (1, 4, 6) to the background color (0).

4. Identify isolated trigger pixels: Iterate through the *original* input grid. For each pixel:
   - Check if its color is one of the trigger colors (2, 3, 5).
   - Check if all its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) are the background color (0). Pixels on edges/corners are considered isolated if all their existing neighbors are background.
   - Store the location (row, col) and original color of each isolated trigger pixel found.

5. Draw hollow squares: For each isolated trigger pixel identified in step 4:
   - Get the center coordinates (r, c) and the trigger color.
   - Determine the corresponding output color using the mapping (2->4, 3->1, 5->6).
   - Calculate the top-left corner coordinates for a 4x4 square centered at (r, c). This would be (r-1, c-1).
   - Iterate through the 4x4 area defined by the top-left corner.
   - For each cell within this 4x4 area:
     - Check if the cell coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
     - If the cell is on the perimeter of the 4x4 square (first/last row or first/last column relative to the 4x4 box), set its color in the output grid to the determined output color.
     - If the cell is in the inner 2x2 area of the 4x4 square, set its color in the output grid to the background color (0).

6. Return the final modified output grid.
