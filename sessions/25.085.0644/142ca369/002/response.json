            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core mechanism: drawing diagonal lines (down and to the right) from non-white pixels. However, the implementation failed because it did not account for two crucial aspects observed in the expected outputs:\n\n1.  **Grid Wrapping:** The diagonal lines wrap around the grid boundaries. When a line reaches the right edge, it continues from the left edge in the next row. When it reaches the bottom edge, it continues from the top edge in the next column.\n2.  **Stopping Condition:** The previous code stopped drawing a line if the next diagonal cell was already colored *or* if it hit a boundary. The correct behavior seems to be that the line continues wrapping until it hits a cell that is already colored (either from the original input or from a previously drawn line).\n\nThe strategy is to modify the line-drawing logic to incorporate coordinate wrapping using the modulo operator and adjust the stopping condition.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the grid dimensions and pixel counts for each example.\n\n"
