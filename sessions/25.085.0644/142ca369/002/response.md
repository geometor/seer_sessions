## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core mechanism: drawing diagonal lines (down and to the right) from non-white pixels. However, the implementation failed because it did not account for two crucial aspects observed in the expected outputs:

1.  **Grid Wrapping:** The diagonal lines wrap around the grid boundaries. When a line reaches the right edge, it continues from the left edge in the next row. When it reaches the bottom edge, it continues from the top edge in the next column.
2.  **Stopping Condition:** The previous code stopped drawing a line if the next diagonal cell was already colored *or* if it hit a boundary. The correct behavior seems to be that the line continues wrapping until it hits a cell that is already colored (either from the original input or from a previously drawn line).

The strategy is to modify the line-drawing logic to incorporate coordinate wrapping using the modulo operator and adjust the stopping condition.

## Metrics Analysis

Let's analyze the grid dimensions and pixel counts for each example.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(train_example):
    input_grid = np.array(train_example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(train_example['output'])

    input_h, input_w = input_grid.shape
    output_h, output_w = output_grid.shape

    input_non_white = np.count_nonzero(input_grid)
    output_non_white = np.count_nonzero(output_grid)

    input_colors = sorted(list(np.unique(input_grid)))
    output_colors = sorted(list(np.unique(output_grid)))


    return {
        "input_shape": (input_h, input_w),
        "output_shape": (output_h, output_w),
        "input_non_white_pixels": input_non_white,
        "output_non_white_pixels": output_non_white,
        "input_colors": input_colors,
        "output_colors": output_colors,
    }

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Grid Shape:** Input and output grids always have the same dimensions in all examples.
*   **Pixel Counts:** The number of non-white pixels increases significantly from input to output, confirming that pixels are being added.
*   **Color Palette:** The set of colors present in the output is identical to the set of colors in the input. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed (though individual pixels might be overwritten).

These metrics support the hypothesis that the transformation involves adding pixels based on existing ones, using the same colors, and respecting the grid boundaries (via wrapping).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  size_relation: input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  value_type: integer pixel values (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: white (0) is the background.
transformation_components:
  - object_identification:
      description: Individual non-white pixels in the input grid act as sources.
      properties:
        - color: The color C of the source pixel.
        - position: The (row, col) coordinates of the source pixel.
  - action:
      description: Draw a diagonal line (down and to the right) originating from each source pixel.
      details:
        - starting_point: The line path starts one cell diagonally down-right from the source pixel, at (row + 1, col + 1).
        - path_progression: The line continues step-by-step, moving one cell down and one cell right (r+1, c+1) at each step.
        - coloring: Each cell along the path is colored with the color C of the source pixel.
        - grid_wrapping:
            - Horizontal: If the column index c reaches the grid width W, the next column index becomes 0 (c mod W).
            - Vertical: If the row index r reaches the grid height H, the next row index becomes 0 (r mod H).
        - stopping_condition: The drawing process for a specific source pixel's line stops if the *next* cell to be colored (r_next, c_next) in the path is already non-white (i.e., not 0) in the evolving output grid. The path stops *before* overwriting the existing non-white pixel.
  - process_order:
      description: The order in which source pixels are processed might matter if lines intersect. While not explicitly tested by the failed code, iterating through the input grid (e.g., row by row, column by column) is a standard approach. The output grid is progressively updated.
  - initial_state:
      description: The transformation starts with an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Get the height (H) and width (W) of the grid.
3.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the *input* grid.
4.  If the cell `(row, col)` contains a non-white color `C`:
    a.  Initialize the current path position `(r, c)` to `(row + 1, col + 1)`.
    b.  Start a loop to trace the diagonal path:
        i.  Calculate the *wrapped* coordinates for the current path position: `r_wrapped = r % H`, `c_wrapped = c % W`.
        ii. Check the color of the cell `(r_wrapped, c_wrapped)` in the *current state* of the output grid.
        iii. If the cell `(r_wrapped, c_wrapped)` is white (0):
            1.  Color this cell `(r_wrapped, c_wrapped)` in the output grid with color `C`.
            2.  Advance the path position: `r = r + 1`, `c = c + 1`.
            3.  Continue the loop (go back to step 4.b.i).
        iv. If the cell `(r_wrapped, c_wrapped)` is *not* white (i.e., it's already colored):
            1.  Stop tracing the path for the current source pixel `(row, col)`. Break the loop.
5.  After iterating through all cells of the input grid, return the final output grid.
