Identify all other colors present as \"active colors\".\n3. Determine the \"target color\" (T) as the active color with the highest numerical value.\n4. Identify the two \"source colors\" from the remaining active colors: Source A (lower value) and Source B (higher value).\n5. Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.\n6. For each pixel in the input grid that has the target color T:\n    a. Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance from this pixel to any pixel with color Source A (`dist_A`).\n    b. Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance from this pixel to any pixel with color Source B (`dist_B`).\n    c. If `dist_B` is less than or equal to `dist_A`, change the pixel's color in the output grid to Source B.\n    d. Otherwise (if `dist_A` is strictly less than `dist_B`), change the pixel's color in the output grid to Source A.\n7.
