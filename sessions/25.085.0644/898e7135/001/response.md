"""
Identifies all contiguous objects (non-white pixels) in the input grid.
Determines the "ignored" colors by finding the colors of all single-pixel objects.
Filters out objects whose color is one of the ignored colors.
Determines the background color for the output grid by finding the color of the largest remaining object.
Calculates the minimal bounding box containing all remaining objects.
Creates an output grid with the dimensions of the bounding box, filled with the background color.
Copies the pixels of the remaining objects into the output grid, preserving their relative positions within the bounding box.
