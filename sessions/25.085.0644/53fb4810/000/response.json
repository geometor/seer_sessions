            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions and the background color is consistently Azure (8).\n2.  **Key Colors:** The transformation seems primarily concerned with specific pixels of Red (2), Yellow (4), and Blue (1), distinct from the Azure background. Other colors like Green (3) might be involved depending on the configuration.\n3.  **Identifying Markers:** In both examples, the input grid contains exactly one isolated Red (2) pixel and one isolated Yellow (4) pixel. These seem to act as markers or triggers for the transformation.\n4.  **Blue Objects:** Blue (1) pixels form distinct shapes (objects). Notably, there is always at least one Blue (1) object located vertically below the Red/Yellow markers.\n5.  **Columnar Transformation:** The primary transformation involves modifying entire vertical sections (columns) of the grid, extending from the top edge down to just above the lowest Blue (1) object.\n6.  **Conditional Logic:** The way the columns are modified depends on the relative positions of the initial Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels:\n    *   **Train 1:** The Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels are in the *same column* (column 10). The output fills this column above the lowest Blue (1) object with an *alternating pattern* of Red (2) and Yellow (4), starting with Red (2). Additionally, a Green (3) pixel in this column, part of a horizontal pattern, is changed to Yellow (4).\n    *   **Train 2:** The Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels are in *different columns* (columns 9 and 8, respectively). The output fills the column containing the original Yellow (4) pixel with solid Yellow (4), and the column containing the original Red (2) pixel with solid Red (2), both extending down to just above the lowest Blue (1) object.\n7.  **Target Boundary:** The vertical extent of the modification seems bounded by the topmost row of the lowest Blue (1) object that intersects the affected column(s).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
