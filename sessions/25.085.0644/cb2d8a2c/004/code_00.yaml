task_description: Perform a flood fill starting from a green pixel, changing reachable azure pixels to green, respecting blue/red pixels as barriers.

grid_properties:
  size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  pixels: Represent colors (integers 0-9).

objects:
  - object: start_point
    color_name: green
    color_value: 3
    quantity: Exactly one per input grid.
    role: Origin for the flood fill.
  - object: fill_target
    color_name: azure
    color_value: 8
    quantity: Variable.
    role: Pixels to be potentially changed to green by the flood fill.
  - object: barrier
    color_name_input: blue
    color_value_input: 1
    color_name_output: red
    color_value_output: 2
    role: Impassable walls for the flood fill. Existing red pixels also act as barriers.
  - object: background/other
    color_name: any color other than green, azure, blue, red
    role: Static; not directly involved in the transformation, stops flood fill propagation.

actions:
  - action: solidify_barriers
    input: grid with blue (1) and potentially red (2) pixels.
    output: grid where all original blue (1) pixels are changed to red (2).
    purpose: Create the final set of barriers for the flood fill.
  - action: flood_fill
    start_condition: Begins at the single green (3) pixel.
    propagation_rule: Can move horizontally or vertically (4-connectivity) to adjacent cells.
    propagation_constraint_1: Cannot move outside grid boundaries.
    propagation_constraint_2: Cannot move into a barrier cell (red, 2).
    propagation_constraint_3: Can only move into cells that are currently azure (8) or green (3).
    effect: When the fill moves into an azure (8) cell, that cell's color is changed to green (3).
    termination: Stops when no more valid moves can be made.

output_grid:
  content: The result of applying barrier solidification and the constrained flood fill.
  properties: Azure pixels reachable from the start point via other azure or green cells (without crossing barriers) become green. All other pixels (barriers, unreachable azure, other colors) retain their state after barrier solidification.
