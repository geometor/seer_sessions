"""
Performs a transformation on an input grid based on the following steps:
1. Barrier Solidification: Identifies all blue pixels (color 1) and changes them to red pixels (color 2) in a copy of the input grid. Existing red pixels (color 2) also act as barriers.
2. Flood Fill Initiation: Locates the single green pixel (color 3) in the original input grid, which serves as the starting point for a flood fill operation.
3. Flood Fill Execution: Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the green pixel. The fill expands through adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells that meet these criteria:
    a. Within grid boundaries.
    b. Not a red barrier (color 2).
    c. Are either azure (color 8) or green (color 3).
4. Coloring: As the flood fill progresses, any azure pixels (color 8) encountered are changed to green (color 3). The fill continues propagating through these newly greened pixels and any pre-existing green pixels (like the start point) that meet the propagation criteria.
5. Output: Returns the modified grid after the flood fill is complete. Azure pixels reachable from the start point via a path of only azure or green cells (without crossing red barriers) become green. All other pixels retain their colors after the initial blue-to-red barrier solidification.
