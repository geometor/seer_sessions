Determines the rightmost column index (`max_col_maroon`) occupied by any maroon (9) pixel in the input grid. If no maroon pixels exist, this boundary is the right edge of the grid.\n2.  For each red (2) pixel in the input grid, if its immediate left neighbor is orange (7), the corresponding left neighbor in the output grid is changed to red (2).\n3.  For each row in the output grid, gray (5) pixels are iteratively extended to the right into adjacent orange (7) pixels, but only up to the `max_col_maroon` column index.\n4.  Any green (3) pixel in the output grid located in a column strictly to the right of `max_col_maroon` is changed to orange (7).\n5.  Other colors (blue-1, azure-8, maroon-9, orange-7 unless modified) remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_max_maroon_col(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the maximum column index containing a maroon (9) pixel.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    max_col = -1\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == 9:\n                max_col = max(max_col, c)\n    # If no maroon found, the boundary is the right edge\n    if max_col == -1:\n        max_col = width - 1\n    return max_col\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies color-specific transformation rules to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # 1.
