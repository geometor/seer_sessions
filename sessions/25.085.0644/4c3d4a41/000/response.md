Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (8x20). They are visually divided into two main sections: a left section (columns 0-8) and a right section (columns 9-19).
2.  **Left Section (Stencil Area):** In the input, this section contains a shape made of gray pixels (5) on a white background (0). In the output, this entire section (columns 0-8) is cleared to white (0).
3.  **Right Section (Target Area):** This section contains a large rectangular frame made of gray pixels (5). Inside the frame, there are various colored pixels and white pixels. This frame structure appears identical in both input and output grids.
4.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs within the right section (Target Area). Some pixels inside the frame change their color from their original input color to gray (5) in the output. The pixels that change correspond positionally to the gray pixels found in the left section (Stencil Area) of the input grid. Specifically, a pixel at `(row, col)` in the right section changes to gray if the pixel at `(row, col - 9)` in the input grid was gray. Pixels in the right section whose corresponding left-side pixel was *not* gray retain their original color. The gray frame pixels themselves remain gray.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions:
    height: 8
    width: 20
  vertical_split_column: 9 # Column index separating left and right sections

sections:
  - name: stencil_area
    columns: [0, 8]
    input_description: Contains a stencil object made of gray (5) pixels on a white (0) background.
    output_description: All pixels are set to white (0).
  - name: target_area
    columns: [9, 19]
    input_description: Contains a static gray (5) frame and variable content pixels (various colors).
    output_description: Frame remains. Content pixels are modified based on the stencil area.

objects:
  - name: stencil_shape
    location: stencil_area (input)
    pixels: Contiguous gray (5) pixels. Shape varies between examples.
    role: Determines which pixels in the target_area are modified.
  - name: frame
    location: target_area (input and output)
    pixels: Contiguous gray (5) pixels forming a border and internal structure.
    role: Static background structure, remains unchanged.
  - name: content_pixels
    location: target_area (input and output)
    pixels: Non-gray pixels within the bounds of the frame.
    role: Subject to modification based on the stencil_shape.

transformation_rule:
  - action: copy_input_to_output
    description: Start with the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - action: clear_stencil_area
    target: output_grid columns [0, 8]
    effect: Set all pixels in these columns to white (0).
  - action: apply_stencil
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    condition: For each pixel at (row, col) where col >= 9
    logic: If the corresponding stencil pixel input_grid[row, col - 9] is gray (5), set output_grid[row, col] to gray (5). Otherwise, output_grid[row, col] keeps its copied value.

relationships:
  - type: positional_mapping
    from: stencil_area pixel at (r, c_stencil)
    to: target_area pixel at (r, c_target)
    condition: c_target = c_stencil + 9
    relevance: Links stencil pixels to the target pixels they potentially modify.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid (`output_grid`) with the same dimensions as the `input_grid`.
2.  Copy all pixel values from the `input_grid` to the `output_grid`.
3.  Define the split column index as `split_col = 9`.
4.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to the height of the grid minus 1.
5.  Iterate through each column `c` from 0 to `split_col - 1`.
6.  Set the pixel value at `output_grid[r][c]` to white (0).
7.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to the height of the grid minus 1.
8.  Iterate through each column `c` from `split_col` to the width of the grid minus 1.
9.  Get the color of the corresponding pixel in the stencil area of the *input* grid: `stencil_color = input_grid[r][c - split_col]`.
10. If `stencil_color` is gray (5), then set the pixel value at `output_grid[r][c]` to gray (5).
11. (Implicitly) If `stencil_color` is not gray (5), the pixel `output_grid[r][c]` retains the value it was assigned in step 2.
12. Return the `output_grid`.
