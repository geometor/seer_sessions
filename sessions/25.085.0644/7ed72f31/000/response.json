            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Colors**: The grids use several colors. Red (2) seems to play a special role. Blue (1) is the background in the first example, and Azure (8) is the background in the second. Other colors (Green=3, Yellow=4, Gray=5, Azure=8, Blue=1) form distinct shapes.\n2.  **Detect Shapes**: In both examples, there are contiguous blocks of pixels forming shapes distinct from the background color.\n3.  **Role of Red Pixels**: Red pixels (2) appear adjacent to some shapes. Crucially, when red pixels form a straight line segment (horizontal or vertical, length >= 2), they seem to act as a mirror. Single red pixels or red pixels not adjacent to a shape seem inactive.\n4.  **Transformation**: The core transformation appears to be reflection. Shapes adjacent to a red line segment are reflected across the axis defined by that line.\n5.  **Output Composition**: The output grid seems to contain the original input grid's elements (including the shapes and the red mirror lines) *plus* the newly generated reflected shapes. The reflection only seems to draw over the background color pixels; it doesn't erase existing non-background pixels.\n6.  **Example 1 Discrepancy**: The textual representation of the output grid for `train_1` seems inconsistent with the reflection"
