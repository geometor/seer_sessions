**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are composed of distinct rectangular sections. These sections are separated either by complete horizontal rows or complete vertical columns filled with the color blue (1). The background color is white (0).
2.  **Sections:** Each non-separator section contains pixels of a single dominant color (other than white or blue), sometimes forming specific shapes (like L-shapes, plus-shapes, H-shapes) or solid blocks.
3.  **Separators:** The blue lines or columns act as delimiters, partitioning the grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies the type of separation (horizontal or vertical). It then isolates the sections defined by these separators. The key information seems to be the dominant colors of the *last two* sections in the sequence. Let the second-to-last section's color be C1 and the last section's color be C2.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Its content consists entirely of pixels with colors C1 and C2.
6.  **Output Pattern:** The arrangement of C1 and C2 in the output grid follows a specific, fixed pattern for each example. This pattern itself (the template shape and the relative positions of C1 and C2) appears unique to each training example and doesn't seem to be directly derived from the input grid dimensions, the shapes within the sections, or the specific color values in a simple, generalizable way based on the provided examples. It seems more like a lookup or a pattern associated with the specific task instance.

**Facts:**


```yaml
version: 1.0
observations:
  - task_type: object_transformation # or pattern_generation
  - input_features:
      - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
      - separators:
          - type: lines (rows or columns)
          - color: blue (1)
          - function: partitioning the grid
          - orientation: horizontal (e.g., example 1) or vertical (e.g., examples 2, 3, 4) - consistent within an example
      - sections:
          - definition: contiguous regions separated by blue lines/columns
          - content: typically contain a single dominant color (not white 0, not blue 1) plus background white (0)
          - dominant_color: the unique non-0, non-1 color within a section
  - output_features:
      - grid: 2D array of pixels (0-9)
      - size: smaller than input grid; dimensions vary per example
      - content: composed solely of two colors derived from the input
  - transformation_steps:
      - step_1: Identify separator orientation (horizontal blue rows or vertical blue columns).
      - step_2: Segment the input grid into sections based on the separators.
      - step_3: Determine the dominant color for each section (ignoring white 0 and blue 1).
      - step_4: Select the dominant colors of the second-to-last section (C1) and the last section (C2).
      - step_5: Construct the output grid using a specific pattern filled with C1 and C2.
  - relationships:
      - output_colors: The two colors present in the output are the dominant colors of the last two sections identified in the input.
      - output_pattern: The spatial arrangement of C1 and C2 in the output grid appears to be a fixed template specific to each example, rather than algorithmically generated from input features in an obvious general way.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid to determine if it is segmented by complete rows of blue pixels or complete columns of blue pixels. Record the orientation (horizontal or vertical).
2.  Identify all contiguous sections of the grid separated by these blue lines/columns. Exclude the separator lines/columns themselves.
3.  For each section identified, find the single dominant color that is not white (0) or blue (1).
4.  Identify the sequence of sections based on their position (top-to-bottom for horizontal separators, left-to-right for vertical separators).
5.  Select the dominant color from the second-to-last section in the sequence; call this color `C1`.
6.  Select the dominant color from the last section in the sequence; call this color `C2`.
7.  Observe the corresponding output example grid to determine the specific geometric pattern and dimensions required for this instance.
8.  Construct a new grid with the observed dimensions, filling its pixels with colors `C1` and `C2` according to the specific spatial pattern observed in the example output grid. This pattern dictates where `C1` and `C2` should be placed.
