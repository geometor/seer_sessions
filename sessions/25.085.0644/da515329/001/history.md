Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are sparsely populated, primarily consisting of a white (0) background with a small number of azure (8) pixels. These azure pixels often form simple shapes or clusters.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They also have a white (0) background but contain significantly more azure (8) pixels than the inputs.
3.  **Transformation:** The azure pixels in the output appear to be generated based on the positions of the azure pixels in the input. Specifically, lines or rays of azure pixels seem to emanate horizontally and vertically from each input azure pixel. These rays extend outwards until they either reach the boundary of the grid or encounter the row or column of another *original* azure pixel from the input. The original input azure pixels are also present in the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
    - background_color: The background color is consistently white (0) in both input and output.
    - primary_color: The active color is azure (8).
  objects:
    - object_type: pixel_cluster
      color: azure (8)
      location: Sparse locations in the input grid.
      role: Act as sources or seeds for generating output patterns.
    - object_type: pixel_lines
      color: azure (8)
      location: Horizontal and vertical lines in the output grid.
      role: Represent the transformed output pattern.
  relationships:
    - type: generation
      description: Output azure pixels are generated based on input azure pixel locations.
    - type: extension
      direction: Cardinal (up, down, left, right)
      origin: Each azure pixel in the input grid.
      termination:
        - Grid boundary.
        - Alignment (same row or column) with another azure pixel from the input grid.
  actions:
    - action: identify_sources
      input: Input grid
      output: Set of coordinates of all azure (8) pixels.
    - action: project_rays
      input: Source coordinates, grid dimensions, set of all source coordinates.
      output: Sets of coordinates covered by rays in each cardinal direction.
      details: For each source, trace rays up, down, left, and right. Stop a ray if it hits the grid boundary or reaches a coordinate occupied by *another* source pixel.
    - action: populate_output
      input: Grid dimensions, source coordinates, projected ray coordinates.
      output: Output grid.
      details: Create a white grid of the correct dimensions. Fill in azure (8) at all source coordinates and all coordinates covered by the projected rays.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the white (0) color.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Store these as a set of "source coordinates".
3.  For each source coordinate `(r, c)` identified in step 2:
    a.  Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).
    b.  **Trace Up:** Starting from the pixel directly above the source `(r-1, c)`, move upwards row by row towards row 0. For each pixel `(i, c)` encountered:
        i.   Check if the coordinate `(i, c)` exists within the set of source coordinates identified in step 2.
        ii.  If it does, stop tracing upwards from this source.
        iii. If it does not, set the pixel `(i, c)` in the output grid to azure (8). Continue tracing upwards.
    c.  **Trace Down:** Starting from the pixel directly below the source `(r+1, c)`, move downwards row by row towards the last row. For each pixel `(i, c)` encountered:
        i.   Check if `(i, c)` is a source coordinate.
        ii.  If it is, stop tracing downwards.
        iii. If not, set `(i, c)` in the output grid to azure (8). Continue tracing downwards.
    d.  **Trace Left:** Starting from the pixel directly to the left of the source `(r, c-1)`, move leftwards column by column towards column 0. For each pixel `(r, j)` encountered:
        i.   Check if `(r, j)` is a source coordinate.
        ii.  If it is, stop tracing leftwards.
        iii. If not, set `(r, j)` in the output grid to azure (8). Continue tracing leftwards.
    e.  **Trace Right:** Starting from the pixel directly to the right of the source `(r, c+1)`, move rightwards column by column towards the last column. For each pixel `(r, j)` encountered:
        i.   Check if `(r, j)` is a source coordinate.
        ii.  If it is, stop tracing rightwards.
        iii. If not, set `(r, j)` in the output grid to azure (8). Continue tracing rightwards.
4.  After processing all source coordinates, return the completed output grid.
