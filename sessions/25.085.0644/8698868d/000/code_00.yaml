Input Grid:
  - Contains multiple distinct regions/objects.
  - Features a dominant 'placeholder' color (P) that often acts as background or separator. (Azure 8 in Ex1, Red 2 in Ex2).

Objects:
  - Frame Objects:
    - Properties:
      - Have a border of a non-placeholder color (C_frame).
      - Contain an internal pattern composed of the placeholder color (P).
      - Have a specific location/bounding box in the input grid.
    - Examples:
      - Ex1: Blue(1) frame, Yellow(4) frame.
      - Ex2: Yellow(4), Green(3), Azure(8), Blue(1) frames.
  - Content Objects:
    - Properties:
      - Composed of a single, non-placeholder color (C_content).
      - Located within regions predominantly filled with the placeholder color (P).
      - Have a specific location/bounding box in the input grid.
    - Examples:
      - Ex1: Red(2) shape, Green(3) shape.
      - Ex2: Maroon(9), Orange(7), Blue(1), Gray(5) shapes.

Relationships:
  - Pairing: Each Frame object is paired with exactly one Content object.
  - Pairing Rule: Based on relative spatial locations of the Frame object and the region containing the Content object.
    - Ex1 Rule: Match horizontal position (Left Frame <-> Left Content, Right Frame <-> Right Content).
    - Ex2 Rule: Seems to be a fixed mapping based on quadrant/region (e.g., Content in Top-Right region modifies Top-Left Frame).
  - Spatial Arrangement: Frame objects have relative positions (e.g., Top-Left, Top-Right) in the input.

Actions:
  - Identify Placeholder Color (P): Find the color used for internal frame patterns and content backgrounds.
  - Identify Frame Objects: Locate regions with non-P borders and P internal patterns.
  - Identify Content Objects: Locate non-P shapes within P-dominated areas.
  - Pair Frames and Contents: Apply the spatial pairing rule.
  - Modify Frame Objects:
    - For each (Frame, Content) pair:
      - Keep the Frame's border color (C_frame).
      - Replace the pixels of the internal pattern that have color P with the Content's color (C_content).
  - Construct Output Grid: Arrange the modified Frame objects according to their original relative positions, excluding other elements from the input.
