This border consists of pixels that were yellow in the input and were adjacent (including diagonally) to the blue shape.\n    *   The area enclosed by the red border undergoes a color transformation based on its original content (blue or yellow pixels).\n    *   If the enclosed area contained *only* blue pixels in the input, those pixels remain blue (1) in the output.\n    *   If the enclosed area contained *both* blue and yellow pixels in the input:\n        *   The original blue pixels are changed to azure (8).\n        *   The original yellow pixels within the enclosure are filled with either azure (8) or magenta (6).

Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n    3.  For each identified blue object:\n        a.  Find all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) to any blue (1) pixel belonging to the current blue object. Store the coordinates of these adjacent yellow pixels; these will form the red border.\n        b.  Temporarily mark the original blue pixels and the identified border pixels associated with this object.\n        c.  Determine the set of pixels enclosed by the border pixels. Check if this enclosed region contains *any* yellow (4) pixels from the input grid that are *not* part of the border itself.\n        d.  **Coloring Rule Application:**\n            i.  If the enclosed region (excluding the border itself) contains *only* pixels that were originally blue (1):\n                - Change the color of the border pixels (identified in step 3a) to red (2) in the output grid.\n                - The original blue (1) pixels within the enclosure remain blue (1) in the output grid.\n            ii. If the enclosed region (excluding the border itself) contains *both* pixels that were originally blue (1) and pixels that were originally yellow (4):\n                - Change the color of the border pixels (identified in step 3a) to red (2) in the output grid.\n                - Change the color of all original blue (1) pixels within the enclosure to azure (8) in the output grid.\n                - For each original yellow (4) pixel within the enclosure (and not part of the border):\n                    - Check if it is adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) to *any* red (2) border pixel (created in this step).\n                    - If it is adjacent to a red (2) border pixel, change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.\n                    - If it is *not* adjacent to any red (2) border pixel, change its color to magenta (6) in the output grid.\n    4.  Ensure any pixels not modified by the above process retain their original color from the input grid (this mainly applies to the yellow background pixels far from any blue shapes)."
