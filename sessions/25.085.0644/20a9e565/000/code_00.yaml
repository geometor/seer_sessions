task_type: conditional_transformation
input_features:
  - grid_size: [30, 30]
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - objects:
      - type: indicator
        color: 5 (gray)
        shape_types:
          - L-shape: 3 pixels, e.g., [[5, 5], [5, 0]] or rotations/reflections
          - Z-shape: 3 pixels, e.g., [[0, 5], [5, 5]] or rotations/reflections
        role: Determine the transformation rule case. May also determine output dimensions (e.g., height in Z-shape case).
      - type: pattern_source
        colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9] (non-gray, non-white)
        shapes:
          - C-pattern: 3x3, e.g., [[C, C, C], [C, 0, C], [C, C, C]]
          - Block-pattern: 2x3, e.g., [[C], [C, C, C]]
        arrangement: Often stacked vertically or grouped.
        role: Provide the color and/or base pattern for the output grid, selected based on criteria determined by the indicator shapes.
output_features:
  - grid_size: variable
  - content: Derived from selected input pattern_source objects/colors.
  - structure: Depends on the transformation rule case triggered by gray indicators.
    - Case L: Fixed 3x6 pattern with border of selected color C, hollow center.
    - Case Z: Vertical repetition of the 3x3 C-pattern of selected color C, height determined by gray position.
    - Case L+Z: Direct extraction of a 2-column slice from the input grid's central pattern.
relationships:
  - Gray shape type(s) determine the transformation case (L-only, Z-only, Both).
  - In L-only case, the gray shape implicitly selects the color C based on the `C/CCC` pattern, and the output is a fixed 3x6 shape using C.
  - In Z-only case, the gray shape implicitly selects the color C based on the `CCC/C0C/CCC` pattern (tallest stack), and the maximum row index of gray pixels determines the output height.
  - In Both case, the location of non-gray patterns determines the columns to extract, and the vertical extent of the pattern in those columns determines the rows to extract.
