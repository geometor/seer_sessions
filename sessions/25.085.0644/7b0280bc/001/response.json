If a pixel is not background-colored and was not reached by the flood fill (i.e., it's 'inside' an enclosure formed by non-background colors), its color is potentially changed based on specific rules that depend on both the grid's background color and the pixel's original color:\n\nRule Set:\n- If background is azure (8):\n  - white (0) becomes gray (5)\n  - red (2) becomes green (3)\n- If background is maroon (9):\n  - yellow (4) becomes gray (5)\n  - orange (7) becomes green (3)\n- If background is orange (7):\n  - blue (1) becomes green (3)\n  - magenta (6) becomes gray (5)\n\nPixels that are 'inside' but do not match any applicable rule for the specific background color retain their original color.
