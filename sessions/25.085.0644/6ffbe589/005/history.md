**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   In all three examples, the component with the largest bounding box area is indeed the one that corresponds spatially to the expected output.
    *   Example 1: Component 1, BBox Area = 169, BBox = (0, 12, 6, 18). Output size is 13x13.
    *   Example 2: Component 1, BBox Area = 100, BBox = (2, 11, 6, 15). Output size is 10x10.
    *   Example 3: Component 1, BBox Area = 100, BBox = (9, 18, 1, 10). Output size is 10x10.
*   The previous code correctly identified this component and its bounding box.
*   The previous code correctly cropped the input grid to this bounding box.
*   The discrepancy lies *between* the directly cropped content and the expected output.

**New Hypothesis:** The transformation involves identifying the connected component with the largest bounding box area, determining its bounding box, and then performing some *other* operation based on the input grid content *within that bounding box* to produce the final output. The output is the same size as the bounding box.

Let's look at the relationship between the input *within the bounding box* (which the previous code produced as `Transformed Output`) and the `Expected Output`.

**Example 1: Input Crop vs Expected Output**
Input Crop:

```
0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0

0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Expected Output:

```
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 8 0 3 3
0 3 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 3 3
3 3 8 8 6 6 6 6 0 8 8 3 0
3 3 8 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 8 3 0
0 3 8 8 0 6 6 6 6 8 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 3 0
0 3 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 8 3 0

0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0
```

Differences are subtle. Let's pinpoint a few:
- Crop[0, 2] = 3, Exp[0, 2] = 0
- Crop[0, 4] = 3, Exp[0, 4] = 0
- Crop[0, 8] = 0, Exp[0, 8] = 0
- Crop[0, 10] = 0, Exp[0, 10] = 3
- Crop[2, 0] = 3, Exp[2, 0] = 0
- Crop[2, 1] = 3, Exp[2, 1] = 3
- Crop[2, 2] = 8, Exp[2, 2] = 0
- Crop[2, 12] = 0, Exp[2, 12] = 3
- Crop[5, 0] = 0, Exp[5, 0] = 3
- Crop[5, 1] = 3, Exp[5, 1] = 3
- Crop[5, 12] = 3, Exp[5, 12] = 0
- Crop[12, 6] = 3, Exp[12, 6] = 0
- Crop[12, 8] = 0, Exp[12, 8] = 3

This looks like some kind of pixel shifting or rearrangement, but it's not uniform. Could it be related to the *original* grid's structure beyond the bounding box?

Let's look at the original input grid again, focusing on the area *around* the bounding box (0, 12, 6, 18).
The bounding box starts at row 0, col 6. The columns to the left (0-5) are all 0 except for the azure pixels at (16,1), (17,1) and green/magenta at (18,5).
The bounding box ends at row 12, col 18. The rows below (13+) are all 0 until row 16. The columns to the right (19) are all 0.

What if the task involves finding the "frame" or "border" of the largest component?
In Example 1, the component is defined by green, azure, and magenta pixels.
Let's map the component pixels onto the bounding box grid.

Map Component Pixels to BBox Grid (Example 1):
The component *is* the non-white pixels within the bounding box.
The `Transformed Output` *is* the content within the bounding box.
The `Expected Output` is *different* from the content within the bounding box.

Is it possible the definition of the "object" is not just the single connected component? What if we consider all non-white pixels within the bounding box of the largest component? That's what the crop already does.

Let's reconsider connectivity. What if we used 4-way connectivity?

Okay, 4-way connectivity changes the components significantly, especially in examples 2 and 3.
- Example 1: Largest BBox area component remains the same (169).
- Example 2: Largest BBox area component becomes much smaller (36 vs 100).
- Example 3: Largest BBox area component becomes much smaller (24 vs 100).

Since the output sizes correspond to the BBox areas found using 8-way connectivity (169->13x13, 100->10x10, 100->10x10), it strongly suggests 8-way connectivity *is* correct for identifying the target object/region.

The core problem remains: how does the content *within* the bounding box of the largest (8-way) component transform into the output?

Let's look at Example 3: Input Crop vs Expected Output
Input Crop (BBox=(9, 18, 1, 10)):

```
4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0
0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0
0 4 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 4
4 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 4 0
0 4 1 0 2 2 1 0 0 4
4 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 4 0
0 4 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 4
4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0
0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
```

Expected Output:

```
0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0
0 4 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 4  <- Differs
4 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 4 0  <- Differs
0 4 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 4  <- Differs
4 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 4 0  <- Differs
0 4 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 4  <- Differs
4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0  <- Differs
0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0
```

Comparing the first two rows: The expected output seems to be the input crop's first two rows swapped.
Comparing the last two rows: The expected output seems to be the input crop's last two rows swapped.

Let's check rows 3-8 (0-indexed, so indices 2-7):
Crop[2]: `4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0` -> Exp[2]: `0 4 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 4`
Crop[3]: `0 4 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 4` -> Exp[3]: `4 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 4 0`
Crop[4]: `4 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 4 0` -> Exp[4]: `0 4 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 4`
Crop[5]: `0 4 1 0 2 2 1 0 0 4` -> Exp[5]: `4 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 4 0`
Crop[6]: `4 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 4 0` -> Exp[6]: `0 4 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 4`
Crop[7]: `0 4 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 4` -> Exp[7]: `4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0`

This doesn't look like a simple row swap. It looks more complex, maybe related to the pattern itself. The pattern involves alternating yellow (4) pixels.

Let's focus on the pixels that *change*.
Exp[2,0]=0, Crop[2,0]=4 | Exp[2,1]=4, Crop[2,1]=0 | Exp[2,3]=1, Crop[2,3]=0 | Exp[2,4]=1, Crop[2,4]=0 | Exp[2,6]=0, Crop[2,6]=0 | Exp[2,7]=0, Crop[2,7]=0 | Exp[2,8]=0, Crop[2,8]=4
Exp[3,0]=4, Crop[3,0]=0 | Exp[3,1]=0, Crop[3,1]=4 | Exp[3,5]=1, Crop[3,5]=0 | Exp[3,6]=0, Crop[3,6]=1 | Exp[3,7]=0, Crop[3,7]=1 | Exp[3,8]=4, Crop[3,8]=0

Hypothesis: Maybe the transformation involves identifying pixels belonging to the largest component *within* the bounding box, and keeping only those, setting others to white (0)?

Let's test this on Example 1.
Find the largest component (8-way) in the whole grid. Component 1, Pixels: 100, BBox: (0, 12, 6, 18).
Create the output grid of size 13x13, initially all white.
For each pixel `(r, c)` in the Component 1's pixel list:
  Calculate its position within the bounding box: `out_r = r - min_r`, `out_c = c - min_c`.
  Set `output_grid[out_r, out_c] = input_grid[r, c]`.

Let's see what this produces for Example 1. The component pixels are exactly the non-white pixels within the bounding box. So this operation *just reproduces the Input Crop*. This hypothesis is incorrect.

**Revisit Example 1 Difference:**
Input Crop (IC) vs Expected Output (EO)
IC[0,:] = `0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
EO[0,:] = `0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0`
Looks like the green pixels shifted? (0,2)->(0,3), (0,4)->(0,10)? No, that doesn't fit.

Consider the bounding box coordinates: (min_r=0, max_r=12, min_c=6, max_c=18).
Size: 13x13.

Let's look at the absolute coordinates in the *input* grid that correspond to the *expected output* pixels.
Expected Output has size 13x13. Let its top-left be at (R_out, C_out) in the input grid.
The content suggests R_out=0, C_out=6.
So, `Expected Output[r, c]` should correspond to `Input[r + 0, c + 6]`.

Let's compare `Expected Output[r, c]` vs `Input[r, c+6]` for r=0..12, c=0..12.
This is exactly the comparison we did between `Expected Output` and `Input Crop`!

Okay, maybe the bounding box is identified, but the content is derived differently.
Could it be identifying specific *sub-objects* within the bounding box?

In Example 1, the large component has Green (3), Azure (8), Magenta (6).
Maybe only pixels of certain colors, or pixels connected in a certain way *within* the BBox are kept?

Could it be related to the *other* components?
Ex 1: Other components at (16,1),(17,1) and (18,5),(18,9),(18,10). These are far away.
Ex 2: Other components are single pixels or small groups, mostly gray (5).
Ex 3: Other components are a blue line (1,1,1) at (2, 8-10) and a yellow pixel (4) at (3, 14).

What if the task is to find the object with the largest bounding box, extract it, and then remove "noise" or specific parts?
In Ex 1, the difference between Input Crop and Expected Output seems complex.
In Ex 3, the difference is also complex but involves the central blue/red part changing.

Let's rethink the "largest bounding box area" criterion. Is it possible it's ambiguous? No, the code seems to pick the visually dominant object consistently.

Could the bounding box be calculated differently? E.g., tightest box vs. box expanded to nearest grid lines? Doesn't seem likely.

Is there a pattern related to symmetry or grids?
Ex 1: Has some internal symmetry.
Ex 2: Has some internal symmetry.
Ex 3: Is clearly based on a grid/pattern.

What if the rule involves finding the bounding box, then *reconstructing* the output based on some rule applied *within* that box?

Consider Example 3 again. The core pattern seems to be alternating Yellow pixels (4) on a 2x2 checkerboard pattern. Inside this, there's a shape made of Blue (1) and Red (2).
Input Crop (IC):

```
4 0 4 ...
0 4 0 ...
4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0  <- Row 2
0 4 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 4  <- Row 3
4 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 4 0  <- Row 4
0 4 1 0 2 2 1 0 0 4  <- Row 5
4 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 4 0  <- Row 6
0 4 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 4  <- Row 7
```

Expected Output (EO):

```
0 4 0 ...  <- Swapped?
4 0 4 ...  <- Swapped?
0 4 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 4  <- Row 2
4 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 4 0  <- Row 3
0 4 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 4  <- Row 4
4 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 4 0  <- Row 5
0 4 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 4  <- Row 6
4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0  <- Row 7
```

The yellow checkerboard pattern seems shifted or modified.
IC[2,0]=4, IC[2,2]=0 vs EO[2,0]=0, EO[2,2]=0
IC[3,1]=4, IC[3,3]=1 vs EO[3,1]=0, EO[3,3]=1
The yellow pixels on the *border* of the internal Blue/Red shape seem to be affected.

Let's define the "internal shape" as the Blue/Red pixels.
In IC: Blue/Red pixels span rows 2-7 and cols 3-8.
In EO: Blue/Red pixels span rows 2-7 and cols 3-8.

Maybe the transformation is:
1. Find the component C with the largest bounding box area (using 8-way).
2. Determine its bounding box B = (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c).
3. Create an output grid O of the same size as B.
4. For each pixel (r, c) within the bounding box B (i.e., r in [min_r, max_r], c in [min_c, max_c]):
   a. Let `in_val = Input[r, c]`.
   b. Let `out_r = r - min_r`, `out_c = c - min_c`.
   c. Determine the value `out_val` based on `in_val` and its neighbors *within the bounding box*.
   d. Set `O[out_r, out_c] = out_val`.

What is the rule for step 4c? This looks like a pixel-wise transformation or filter applied *after* cropping.

Consider the white pixels (0) *within* the bounding box. Do they ever become non-white in the output?
Ex 1: IC[0,0]=0 -> EO[0,0]=0. IC[0,3]=0 -> EO[0,3]=3. Yes. IC[0,12]=0 -> EO[0,12]=0. IC[2,4]=0 -> EO[2,4]=0. IC[2,8]=0 -> EO[2,8]=0.
Ex 3: IC[2,1]=0 -> EO[2,1]=4. Yes. IC[2,3]=0 -> EO[2,3]=1. Yes.

Consider non-white pixels *within* the bounding box. Do they ever become white in the output?
Ex 1: IC[0,2]=3 -> EO[0,2]=0. Yes. IC[2,0]=3 -> EO[2,0]=0. Yes. IC[2,2]=8 -> EO[2,2]=0. Yes.
Ex 3: IC[2,0]=4 -> EO[2,0]=0. Yes. IC[2,8]=4 -> EO[2,8]=0. Yes.

This isn't just keeping/removing pixels. It's changing pixel values, sometimes between white and non-white, sometimes between colors? (Need to check if colors change).

Ex 1: IC[0,3]=0 -> EO[0,3]=3 (Green). Input[0, 9]=0. Input[0,3]=0. Where does the Green come from? Neighbor Input[1,9]=3.
Ex 3: IC[2,1]=0 -> EO[2,1]=4 (Yellow). Input[11, 2]=0. Input[11, 1]=4. Neighbor Input[11,1]=4.

This looks like some kind of cellular automaton rule or neighbor-based update applied to the cropped grid.

Let's try a simpler idea: Maybe the bounding box is correct, but the *content* placed inside it is taken from a *different* component? No, the content clearly matches the largest component, just slightly modified.

What if the bounding box itself is slightly modified?
- Maybe expanded by 1 pixel? (Doesn't fit sizes)
- Maybe shrunk by 1 pixel? (Doesn't fit sizes)
- Maybe aligned to some grid? (Doesn't seem obvious)

Could the task be related to "repairing" or "completing" a pattern within the bounding box?
In Example 3, the yellow checkerboard pattern seems broken around the blue/red shape in the input crop. In the expected output, the checkerboard seems more regular *except* where the blue/red shape is.

Let's re-examine the natural language description. "Crops the input grid to the bounding box." This is insufficient.

Revised idea:
1. Find all 8-way connected components of non-white pixels.
2. Identify the component C with the largest bounding box area.
3. Determine the bounding box B = (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) of C.
4. Create an output grid O by copying the portion of the input grid defined by B. `O = Input[min_r : max_r+1, min_c : max_c+1]`.
5. **Modify the output grid O based on some local rule.**

What is the local rule? Let's look at Example 1 again.
IC: `... 3 0 3 ...` -> EO: `... 0 3 0 ...` at row 0
IC: `3 3 8 ...` -> EO: `0 3 0 ...` at row 2
IC: `... 3 3` -> EO: `... 3 0` at row 5
IC: `... 3 0` -> EO: `... 3 0` at row 6

It's hard to discern a simple local rule like "if a pixel has > N neighbors of color X, change it".

Could the transformation involve *layers* or different colors behaving differently?
Maybe Green pixels follow one rule, Azure another?

Let's reconsider the initial prompt instruction to the coder: "Identifies the connected component ... with the largest bounding box area and crops ... to that bounding box." This matches the previous code but not the expected output.

Possibility: The original interpretation was correct for *that specific example* used to generate the code, but the *general rule* is different.

What if the rule is about finding the largest *rectangle* of a certain color, or the largest *object* based on pixel count, not BBox area?
Let's look at pixel counts from the tool output:
Ex 1: Comp 1 (100 px), Comp 2 (2 px), Comp 3 (2 px), Comp 4 (1 px). Largest pixel count matches largest BBox area.
Ex 2: Comp 1 (46 px), Others (<=1 px). Largest pixel count matches largest BBox area.
Ex 3: Comp 1 (48 px), Comp 2 (3 px), Comp 3 (1 px). Largest pixel count matches largest BBox area.
So, selecting based on pixel count vs BBox area doesn't change the target component.

**Final Hypothesis Attempt:**
The process involves identifying the main object (component with largest BBox area using 8-way connectivity), defining its bounding box, and then **filling this bounding box based on the properties of the original component's pixels relative to the bounding box.**

Let O be the output grid (size = BBox size).
For each cell `(r_out, c_out)` in O:
  The corresponding position in the input grid is `(r_in, c_in) = (r_out + min_r, c_out + min_c)`.
  What should `O[r_out, c_out]` be?
  Is it simply `Input[r_in, c_in]` IF `(r_in, c_in)` was part of the original component C?
  Let's try this: `O[r_out, c_out] = Input[r_in, c_in] if (r_in, c_in) in C['pixels'] else 0`

Let's trace this for Example 1, cell (0, 0) of the output.
Corresponds to input cell (0, 6). `Input[0, 6] = 0`. Is (0, 6) in Component 1? No. So Output[0, 0] = 0. Correct.
Output cell (0, 2). Corresponds to input cell (0, 8). `Input[0, 8] = 3`. Is (0, 8) in Component 1? Yes. So Output[0, 2] = 3. Expected is 0. Incorrect.

Output cell (0, 3). Corresponds to input cell (0, 9). `Input[0, 9] = 0`. Is (0, 9) in Component 1? No. So Output[0, 3] = 0. Expected is 3. Incorrect.

This hypothesis (simply masking the crop with the component pixels) is also wrong. It just reproduces the non-white pixels from the crop.

**Back to Basics:** The code generates `Transformed Output`. The task requires `Expected Output`. The difference is the core transformation rule we missed.

Could the bounding box be defined differently? E.g., smallest box containing *all* non-white pixels?
Ex 1: Min non-white row=0, Max=18. Min col=1, Max=18. Box=(0,18,1,18). Size 19x18. Doesn't match output 13x13.
Ex 2: Min non-white row=2, Max=16. Min col=1, Max=15. Box=(2,16,1,15). Size 15x15. Doesn't match output 10x10.
Ex 3: Min non-white row=2, Max=18. Min col=1, Max=14. Box=(2,18,1,14). Size 17x14. Doesn't match output 10x10.
This isn't it.

The process *must* involve selecting the largest component (by BBox area, 8-way) and using its BBox dimensions for the output. The content generation is the mystery.

Let's assume the `Expected Output` IS the correct interpretation. How could it be generated?
It takes the BBox area, extracts the content, then applies a transformation.

What if the transformation involves finding *all* components within the bounding box and doing something with them?
Using 4-way connectivity *within the cropped grid*?
Let's try cropping Ex 1 input to the BBox (0,12, 6,18), then find 4-way components in that 13x13 grid.

Input Crop (Ex 1):

```
0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
3 3 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 8 0 3 0
0 3 8 0 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 3 0
0 3 8 8 6 6 6 6 0 8 8 3 3
0 3 8 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 8 3 0
0 3 8 8 0 6 6 6 6 8 8 3 3
0 3 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 3 0
3 3 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 8 0 3 0
0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Expected Output (Ex 1):

```
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 8 0 3 3
0 3 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 3 3
3 3 8 8 6 6 6 6 0 8 8 3 0
3 3 8 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 8 3 0
0 3 8 8 0 6 6 6 6 8 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 3 0
0 3 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 8 3 0
0 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 3 0
0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0
```

This is feeling like a "pattern completion" or "noise removal" task applied locally *after* the crop. The specific rules are elusive just by looking.

Given the discrepancy between the simple crop and the expected output, I need to describe this gap. The original natural language program was too simple.

**Strategy:** Acknowledge the previous code correctly performs the cropping based on the largest component's BBox (8-way). State that an additional transformation step is needed on the *cropped* grid to match the expected output. Describe the *nature* of this transformation (pixel values change, including 0 to non-0 and vice-versa) but admit the exact rule is not yet clear from visual inspection alone. Focus the facts on the confirmed parts (component selection, BBox) and the observed changes in the second step.


## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code successfully identified the connected component (using 8-way connectivity) with the largest bounding box area in each example. It also correctly extracted the portion of the input grid corresponding to this bounding box (the 'Input Crop' or 'Transformed Output').

However, this extracted grid does not match the `Expected Output` for any of the examples. This indicates that the transformation is more complex than simply cropping to the bounding box. An additional step is required that modifies the pixels *within* the identified bounding box.

**Observations:**
- The `Expected Output` has the same dimensions as the bounding box of the largest component.
- Comparing the `Input Crop` (the direct extraction) with the `Expected Output` reveals pixel differences:
    - Some white pixels (0) in the crop become non-white in the output.
    - Some non-white pixels in the crop become white (0) in the output.
    - Some non-white pixels appear to change position or color, although simple shifts or color swaps don't fully explain the changes.
- The changes don't seem to be a uniform filter (like adding a border or simple erosion/dilation). They appear context-dependent, possibly related to local neighbor configurations or specific patterns within the cropped area.

**Strategy:**
1. Keep the initial steps: Find the 8-way connected component with the largest bounding box area and determine its bounding box dimensions.
2. Focus on analyzing the transformation *within* the bounding box. Treat the `Input Crop` as an intermediate state.
3. Hypothesize rules for transforming the `Input Crop` into the `Expected Output`. This might involve:
    - Local neighbor rules (like cellular automata).
    - Pattern completion or correction based on structures identified within the crop.
    - Rules specific to certain colors.
4. Refine the natural language program to reflect this two-stage process: identify and crop, then transform the cropped content.

## Metrics

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` for components identified with both 8-way and 4-way connectivity.

**8-Way Connectivity Results:**
- **Example 1:** Largest component: Pixels=100, BBox=(0, 12, 6, 18), Area=169 (13x13). Output Size: 13x13. Match.
- **Example 2:** Largest component: Pixels=46, BBox=(2, 11, 6, 15), Area=100 (10x10). Output Size: 10x10. Match.
- **Example 3:** Largest component: Pixels=48, BBox=(9, 18, 1, 10), Area=100 (10x10). Output Size: 10x10. Match.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The target object for cropping is consistently the 8-way connected component with the largest bounding box area. The dimensions of this bounding box match the dimensions of the expected output grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid, considering pixels connected 8-directionally (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) as belonging to the same component.
2.  For each component, calculate its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels) and the area of this bounding box (height * width).
3.  Select the single component that has the largest bounding box area. This is the "target component".
4.  Determine the coordinates of the bounding box of the target component: `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`.
5.  Create a new intermediate grid (the "cropped grid") by extracting the portion of the input grid corresponding to the bounding box: `Input[min_row : max_row + 1, min_col : max_col + 1]`.
6.  Create the final output grid with the same dimensions as the cropped grid.
7.  Determine the value of each pixel in the final output grid by applying a transformation rule to the corresponding pixel and its neighbors within the *cropped grid*. (The exact transformation rule needs further definition but involves changing pixel values based on local patterns or context).
