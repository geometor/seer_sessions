            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids**: The task takes a larger input grid (20x20 in the examples) and produces a smaller output grid. The output grid's dimensions vary between examples (13x13, 10x10).\n2.  **Content**: Both input and output grids contain pixels of various colors on a white (0) background.\n3.  **Structure in Input**: The input grids typically feature one large, central structure composed of connected non-white pixels. This structure often has a distinct border color (green in train_1, gray in train_2, yellow in train_3) enclosing other colors. Additionally, there are often smaller, isolated non-white pixels or small groups of pixels scattered elsewhere in the input grid, separate from the main structure.\n4.  **Transformation**: The output grid appears to be a direct copy of the content within the main central structure found in the input grid. The isolated pixels or groups outside this main structure are excluded. The transformation is essentially a cropping operation focused on the most significant object.\n5.  **Object Identification**: The key seems to be identifying the \"main object\". Based on the examples, this main object is the largest connected component (group) of non-white pixels. Connectivity includes diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).\n6.  **Cropping Mechanism**: The boundaries of the output grid correspond precisely to the minimal bounding box enclosing the largest connected component of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Select the group that contains the largest number of pixels. This is the \"main object\".\n4.  Determine the top-most row index, bottom-most row index, left-most column index, and right-most column index occupied by any pixel belonging to this main object. These four indices define the minimal bounding box of the main object.\n5.  Create a new grid whose dimensions match the height (bottom_row - top_row + 1) and width (right_col - left_col + 1) of the calculated bounding box.\n6.  Copy the pixels from the input grid within the bounding box (from `top_row` to `bottom_row` and `left_col` to `right_col`) into the new grid, preserving their relative positions.\n7.  The resulting new grid is the final output."
