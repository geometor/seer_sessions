task_type: object_extraction_cropping
input_properties:
  - size: Typically larger (e.g., 20x20)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - elements:
      - Multiple connected components of non-white pixels.
      - One component is significantly larger than others.
output_properties:
  - size: Variable, smaller than input. Determined by the bounding box of the main object.
  - content: A subgrid copied directly from the input.
pertinent_objects:
  - main_object:
      definition: The largest connected component of non-white pixels in the input grid (using 8-way connectivity).
      role: Defines the content and boundaries of the output grid.
  - other_objects:
      definition: Smaller connected components or isolated non-white pixels.
      role: Ignored during the transformation.
transformation:
  - step_1: Identify all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - step_2: Determine the component with the largest number of pixels (the main_object).
  - step_3: Calculate the minimal bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) that encloses all pixels of the main_object.
  - step_4: Extract the subgrid from the input defined by this bounding box.
  - step_5: The extracted subgrid is the output grid.
