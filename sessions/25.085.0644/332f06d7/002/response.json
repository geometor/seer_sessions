The initial natural language program, likely based primarily on the first example, made incorrect assumptions about:\n1.  **Agent Transformation:** The code assumed the red object *always* transforms into the background color (green, 3). The expected outputs show it sometimes transforms into white (0) and sometimes remains unchanged (red, 2).\n2.  **Target Selection:** The code assumed the target is always the *first* white object reachable via a blue path starting from the red object. Example 2 shows a case where an *unreachable* white object is targeted.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate each example, focusing on the conditions under which the agent transforms and how the specific white object target is selected, especially when multiple white objects exist with varying path connectivity.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the connectivity and object counts for each example. We need functions to find objects and perform BFS.\n\n"
