task_context:
  description: "Extract a subgrid from the input grid based on vertical separator lines."
  input_type: 2D grid of integers (colors)
  output_type: 2D grid of integers (colors)

grid_properties:
  height: variable (1-30)
  width: variable (1-30)
  pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors

objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties: [height, width, pixels]
  - name: separator
    type: vertical line (column)
    properties:
      - spans full grid height
      - consists of a single, uniform color
      - visually distinct from surrounding patterns (often non-background)
      - multiple separators of the same color can exist
  - name: subgrid
    type: 2D array (portion of the input grid)
    properties:
      - shares height with the input grid
      - width determined by separator position and color

actions:
  - name: find_separators
    input: grid
    output: list of separator column indices, separator color
    description: >
      Identify all columns that span the full height of the grid and consist of a single, uniform color.
      Determine the color of these separator columns (assuming only one relevant separator color per grid based on examples).
  - name: select_relevant_separator
    input: list of separator indices, separator color
    output: single relevant separator index
    description: >
      If the separator color is red (2), select the index of the rightmost separator.
      If the separator color is not red, select the index of the leftmost separator.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: grid, relevant separator index, separator color
    output: subgrid
    description: >
      If the separator color is red (2), extract the portion of the grid strictly to the right of the relevant separator index.
      If the separator color is not red, extract the portion of the grid strictly to the left of the relevant separator index.
  - name: handle_no_separators
    input: grid
    output: empty grid
    description: >
      If no valid separators are found, return an empty grid (0 width) with the same height as the input grid.
  - name: handle_edge_separators
    input: grid, relevant separator index, separator color
    output: empty grid
    description: >
      If the extraction based on the separator index results in a subgrid with zero width (e.g., separator is at the left edge for non-red, or right edge for red), return an empty grid (0 width) with the same height as the input grid.

output_format:
  type: 2D list of integers
  empty_grid_representation: list of empty lists, one for each row (e.g., `[[], [], []]` for height 3).
