observations:
  - task_type: grid_transformation
  - grid_properties:
      - background_color_is_most_frequent: True # Based on previous code's assumption
      - grid_size_varies: True # Common in ARC
  - object_properties:
      - definition: contiguous_pixels_of_same_non_background_color
      - adjacency: 4-way (orthogonal) # Based on previous code
  - initial_hypotheses_from_code_v1:
      - rule_A:
          condition: object is 1x5 pixels AND located on the bottom row
          action: change_object_pixels_to_background_color
      - rule_B:
          condition: object is 3x3 plus shape (5 pixels) AND color is Maroon (9), Magenta (6), or Green (3)
          action: change_object_pixels_to_Gray (5)
  - execution_result:
      - status: Timeout
      - example_failed: train[0]
      - implication: The object finding or rule application logic is too slow for at least one training case. The complexity might be higher than initially assumed, or the implementation is inefficient.
  - potential_issues:
      - object_identification_performance: BFS might be slow on large/dense grids or grids with numerous small objects.
      - rule_complexity: Complex shape/position checks for many objects could be time-consuming.
      - rule_correctness: The initial rules derived from one example might be wrong or incomplete.
  - strategy_adjustment:
      - Re-analyze all examples for simpler patterns.
      - Consider pixel-local rules instead of object-based rules if object identification proves too costly or complex.
      - Profile or simplify the object identification step if it's confirmed as the bottleneck.
