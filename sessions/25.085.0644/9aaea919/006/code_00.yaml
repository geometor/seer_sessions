task_description: Apply transformations based on specific object shapes, colors, and locations.
observations:
  - input_output_relationship: Output grid is derived by modifying specific objects within the input grid. Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - background_color_definition: The background color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid. It is typically white (0) but calculated dynamically.
  - object_definitions: Objects are contiguous areas of non-background colors (using 4-way adjacency).
hypothesized_rules:
  - rule_name: Bottom Line Removal
    applies_to: Objects matching specific criteria.
    criteria:
      - shape: Horizontal line (1 pixel high, 5 pixels wide).
      - size: 5 pixels total.
      - location: Must reside entirely within the bottom-most row of the grid.
    action: Change all pixels of the object to the background color.
  - rule_name: Plus Sign Color Change
    applies_to: Objects matching specific criteria.
    criteria:
      - shape: Plus sign (+) within a 3x3 bounding box.
      - size: 5 pixels total.
      - color: Must be Maroon (9), Magenta (6), or Green (3).
    action: Change all 5 pixels of the object to Gray (5).
  - default_behavior: Objects not matching any specific rule remain unchanged.
performance_issue:
  - analysis: The current implementation using BFS for full object segmentation timed out on at least one training example.
  - likely_cause: High number of pixels to traverse, large number of objects, or complex object shapes leading to excessive computation time for `find_objects_bfs`.
proposed_solution_strategy:
  - refactor_object_finding: Avoid full BFS object segmentation upfront.
  - implement_targeted_search: Directly search the grid for the specific patterns (bottom row lines, plus signs) required by the hypothesized rules.
  - modify_output_directly: Apply changes to a copy of the input grid as patterns are found.
