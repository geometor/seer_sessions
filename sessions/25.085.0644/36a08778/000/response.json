            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of varying dimensions.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are orange (7), magenta (6), and red (2). Orange appears to be the default background color.\n3.  **Input Patterns:**\n    *   Magenta pixels (6) often appear as isolated points or vertical lines in the input.\n    *   Red pixels (2) form various shapes, usually lines or small rectangles.\n4.  **Output Patterns:**\n    *   The positions of red pixels (2) remain unchanged from input to output.\n    *   The original positions of magenta pixels (6) remain magenta.\n    *   Many orange pixels (7) in the input are changed to magenta (6) in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Nature:** The change involves magenta \"spreading\" or \"filling\" adjacent orange areas. This spread seems to originate from the initial magenta pixels.\n6.  **Barriers:** The spread of magenta appears to be blocked by red pixels (2) and the grid boundaries. Magenta does not overwrite red pixels or spread beyond the grid edges. It also doesn't spread into areas already occupied by magenta.\n7.  **Propagation Mechanism:** The spread happens cardinally (up, down, left, right). An orange pixel changes to magenta if it is adjacent to an existing magenta pixel (either an original one or one that has already been changed in the process). This suggests a flood-fill or propagation mechanism.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
