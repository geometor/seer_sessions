Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent) and foreground color (other significant color) in the input grid.
2. Find all contiguous objects composed of the foreground color pixels (using 8-way connectivity).
3. Identify the largest object (the one containing the most pixels). If there's a tie, any of the largest can be chosen.
4. Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing only the pixels of the selected largest object.
5. Create an output grid whose dimensions are 2 larger (in height and width) than the bounding box of the largest object.
6. Initialize the output grid with the background color.
7. Draw a 1-pixel thick border around the output grid using the foreground color.
8. Copy only the pixels belonging to the largest object into the center of the output grid (inside the border), placed relative to the object's bounding box. The color copied is the foreground color. Pixels within the central area that do not correspond to a pixel from the largest object remain the background color.
