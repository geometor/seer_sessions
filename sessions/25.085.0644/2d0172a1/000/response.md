**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves identifying and extracting a specific region from a larger input grid based on the distribution of pixels of a certain color. The input grid primarily consists of two colors: a dominant background color and a secondary foreground color. The foreground color pixels are scattered across the input grid. The output grid is a smaller grid that represents a consolidated view of the foreground pixels from the input. Specifically, it seems to capture the pattern formed by the foreground pixels within their minimal bounding box in the input, and then frames this pattern with a border of the same foreground color, placing the result on the background color.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    - Colors: Contains primarily two colors.
    - BackgroundColor: The color occupying the majority of the grid cells.
    - ForegroundColor: The color of the scattered pixels/shapes.
    - ForegroundPixels: A set of coordinates where the ForegroundColor is present.

DerivedElements:
  - BoundingBox:
      Type: Rectangle
      Definition: The smallest rectangular area in the InputGrid that encloses all ForegroundPixels.
      Properties:
        - min_row
        - max_row
        - min_col
        - max_col
  - ExtractedSubgrid:
      Type: 2D Array (Grid)
      Definition: The portion of the InputGrid corresponding to the BoundingBox.
      Properties:
        - Contains both BackgroundColor and ForegroundColor pixels as they appear within the BoundingBox in the InputGrid.
        - Height: BoundingBox.max_row - BoundingBox.min_row + 1
        - Width: BoundingBox.max_col - BoundingBox.min_col + 1

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D Array (Grid)
    - Dimensions:
        - Height: ExtractedSubgrid.Height + 2
        - Width: ExtractedSubgrid.Width + 2
    - BackgroundColor: Same as InputGrid.BackgroundColor.
    - ForegroundColor: Same as InputGrid.ForegroundColor.
    - Structure:
        - A border (1 pixel thick) made of the ForegroundColor surrounds the entire grid.
        - The inner area (corresponding to the ExtractedSubgrid dimensions) contains the pattern from the ExtractedSubgrid. Pixels in this inner area are copied directly from the ExtractedSubgrid (maintaining their original colors - Foreground or Background).

Relationships:
  - The OutputGrid's dimensions are determined by the BoundingBox of the ForegroundPixels in the InputGrid.
  - The colors used in the OutputGrid are the same two colors found in the InputGrid.
  - The pattern inside the OutputGrid's border is a direct copy of the pixels within the BoundingBox from the InputGrid.

Actions:
  1. Identify BackgroundColor and ForegroundColor in the InputGrid.
  2. Locate all ForegroundPixels in the InputGrid.
  3. Calculate the BoundingBox enclosing all ForegroundPixels.
  4. Extract the ExtractedSubgrid from the InputGrid using the BoundingBox coordinates.
  5. Create the OutputGrid with dimensions based on the ExtractedSubgrid plus a border.
  6. Fill the OutputGrid initially with the BackgroundColor.
  7. Draw a border using the ForegroundColor around the OutputGrid.
  8. Copy the pixels from the ExtractedSubgrid into the corresponding inner area of the OutputGrid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the background color by identifying the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Identify the foreground color as the other color present in the input grid.
3.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels matching the foreground color.
4.  Calculate the minimum bounding box that contains all foreground pixels found in step 3. Determine the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column of these pixels.
5.  Determine the height and width of this bounding box.
6.  Create a new output grid with a height equal to the bounding box height plus 2, and a width equal to the bounding box width plus 2.
7.  Fill the entire output grid with the background color identified in step 1.
8.  Draw a 1-pixel thick border around the perimeter of the output grid using the foreground color identified in step 2.
9.  Iterate through the pixels within the calculated bounding box in the *input* grid (from minimum row/column to maximum row/column).
10. For each pixel from the input grid's bounding box, copy its color to the corresponding position in the *output* grid, offset by (1, 1) to account for the border (i.e., input pixel at (r, c) within the bounding box goes to output grid at (r - min_row + 1, c - min_col + 1)).
