Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Initialize:** Start with the input grid. Create a working copy.
2.  **Yellow Connection:**
    *   Identify all Yellow (4) pixels in the current working grid.
    *   For each row, find pairs of Yellow pixels.
    *   If the horizontal path strictly between a pair of Yellow pixels on the same row consists only of White (0) pixels, fill that path with Yellow (4) in the working grid.
    *   Repeat this connection process on the updated working grid until no more connections can be made in a full pass. Store this grid state.
3.  **Source Identification and Mapping:**
    *   Refer back to the *original* input grid. Identify all non-White (0) and non-Yellow (4) pixels. These are the "expansion sources".
    *   Determine if any of these identified expansion sources are Magenta (6) (`has_magenta_source`).
    *   Determine if the *original* input grid contains *any* Orange (7) pixels (not necessarily sources) (`has_orange_anywhere`).
    *   Create a mapping for how source colors will expand:
        *   If a source is Azure (8) AND `has_magenta_source` is true, it expands as Blue (1).
        *   If a source is Magenta (6) AND `has_orange_anywhere` is true, it expands as Orange (7).
        *   All other sources expand using their own original color.
4.  **Simultaneous Expansion (BFS):**
    *   Start a simultaneous Breadth-First Search (BFS) from all identified expansion sources on the grid resulting from the Yellow Connection phase (Step 2).
    *   The BFS expands one step (Manhattan distance) at a time into adjacent cells.
    *   **Expansion Condition:** A source can only expand into a cell if that cell was White (0) in the *original* input grid AND is currently White (0) in the working grid (i.e., hasn't been filled by Yellow connections or previous expansion steps). This check implicitly handles obstacles defined by originally non-white cells and connected yellow cells.
    *   **Obstacles:** Expansion is blocked by grid boundaries and any cell that is not eligible based on the Expansion Condition.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** If multiple *different* sources attempt to expand into the same valid White cell in the *same step* of the BFS, that cell remains White (0) and becomes an obstacle, preventing any source from expanding into or through it in subsequent steps.
    *   **Coloring:** When a source successfully expands into a cell, the cell is filled with the color determined by the color mapping defined in Step 3, based on the *original* color of the source that reached it.
5.  **Output:** The final grid is the state of the working grid after the expansion process is complete. It contains the original non-White pixels, the added Yellow connections, and the colored expansions, with contested areas remaining White.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to implement a multi-stage transformation: yellow horizontal connection followed by simultaneous source expansion (BFS). However, the code fails on all three training examples, producing outputs with significantly more filled pixels than expected.

The core issue appears to be in the **BFS expansion phase (Step 4)**. The current implementation allows sources to expand into any cell that was *originally* white, even if that cell became non-white (e.g., yellow) during the connection phase or if it should logically be blocked by adjacent non-white cells from the initial state. The expected outputs show much more constrained expansion, suggesting that *all* non-white cells present after the yellow connection phase should act as barriers to the BFS expansion.

The color transformation rules (Azure->Blue if Magenta source exists, Magenta->Orange if any Orange exists) appear consistent across the examples. The yellow connection rule also seems correctly applied in Example 1, though it wasn't applicable or didn't change the grid in Examples 2 and 3 based on the specific inputs.

The strategy is to correct the BFS expansion logic to properly respect barriers defined by *all* non-white cells in the grid state *after* the yellow connection phase.

## Metrics

Let's gather metrics for each example.
