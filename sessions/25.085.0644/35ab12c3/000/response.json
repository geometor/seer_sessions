            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** Contain sparse distributions of non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9) on a white (0) background.\n2.  **Output Grids:** Show the original non-white pixels, plus additional filled areas connected to or between some of the original pixels. The background remains white.\n3.  **Color Roles:** Different colors seem to behave differently.\n    *   Some colors act as \"sources\" that expand outwards.\n    *   Some colors act as static \"obstacles\" that block expansion.\n    *   Some colors might change their expansion behavior based on the presence of other colors in the input.\n    *   Yellow (4) seems unique, often filling horizontal segments between pairs.\n4.  **Expansion Pattern:** The filled areas suggest an expansion process based on Manhattan distance (cardinal neighbors). Expansion seems to occur simultaneously from all sources. Where expansions from different sources would meet at the same time, the cell remains empty (white). Expansion stops upon hitting any non-white cell (original or newly filled) or the grid boundary.\n5.  **Expansion Color Logic:** The color used for filling isn't always the same as the source color.\n    *   In train\\_1, Magenta (6) expands as Orange (7), and Azure (8) expands as Blue (1). Yellow (4) connects horizontally with Yellow (4).\n    *   In train\\_2, Azure (8) expands as Blue (1), but Magenta (6) expands as Magenta (6). Blue (1) expands as Blue (1), Yellow (4) expands as Yellow (4).\n    *   In train\\_3, all source colors (Azure 8, Blue 1, Orange 7, Yellow 4, Red 2) expand using their *own* color. Yellow (4) also performs its horizontal connection.\n6.  **Context Dependency:** The specific expansion colors seem dependent on the overall context of the input grid:\n    *   Azure (8) expands as Blue (1) *only if* a Magenta (6) source pixel is present in the input grid (seen in train\\_1 and train\\_2, but not train\\_3). Otherwise, Azure (8) expands as Azure (8).\n    *   Magenta (6) expands as Orange (7) *only if* an Orange (7) pixel (source or obstacle) is present anywhere in the input grid (seen in train\\_1, but not train\\_2). Otherwise, Magenta (6) expands as Magenta (6).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
