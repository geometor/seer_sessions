This container object is unique because it encloses other pixels of different non-white colors within its boundary. Other objects in the input grid seem to be irrelevant to the transformation.\n    *   In `train_1`, the container is the red (2) object enclosing blue (1), gray (5), azure (8), and maroon (9) pixels.\n    *   In `train_2`, the container is the magenta (6) object enclosing red (2), yellow (4), azure (8), and green (3) pixels.\n3.  **Content Pixels:** The pixels enclosed within the container object, which are neither the container's color nor the white background, seem crucial. Let's call these \"content pixels\".\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves extracting these content pixels, determining their spatial arrangement relative to each other, and then scaling up this arrangement to produce the output grid.\n5.  **Scaling:** The content pixels form a small grid (2x2 in both examples). This small grid is scaled up to create the larger output grid. The scaling factor appears to be determined by the dimensions of the *container object's* bounding box. Specifically, the scale factor seems to be `min(container_height, container_width) - 1`.\n    *   `train_1`: Red container bounding box is 5x5. `min(5, 5) - 1 = 4`. Content grid is 2x2. Output grid is (2*4)x(2*4) = 8x8.\n    *   `train_2`: Magenta container bounding box is 8x6. `min(8, 6) - 1 = 5`. Content grid is 2x2. Output grid is (2*5)x(2*5) = 10x10.\n6.  **Output Generation:** Each content pixel from the input is expanded into a solid block of `scale_factor x scale_factor` pixels in the output grid, maintaining the relative positions of the original content pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

For each object, determine its color and find its bounding box. Identify the unique object (the \"Container\") whose bounding box contains pixels of colors other than white and the object's own color.\n2.  **Extract Content:** Collect all such contained pixels within the Container's bounding box; these are the \"Content Pixels\".\n3.  **Determine Content Grid:** Find the minimal bounding box enclosing only the Content Pixels.

Let the dimensions of this content grid be `H_content` x `W_content`.\n4.  **Calculate Scale Factor:** Get the height (`H_C`) and width (`W_C`) of the bounding box of the Container object identified in step 1.
