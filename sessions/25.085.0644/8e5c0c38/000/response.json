The background color is the most frequent color in the grid (`azure` in the first example, `white` in the second). The transformation involves modifying these colored objects by removing specific pixels. The pixels removed appear to be those within an object that do not have any immediate (cardinal, i.e., up, down, left, right) neighbors of the same color. Pixels that only have diagonal neighbors of the same color, or no same-color neighbors at all, are changed to the background color. The overall shapes are preserved but appear slightly \"eroded\" or \"cleaned up\" by removing these less connected pixels.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
