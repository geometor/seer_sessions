            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task using a prioritized set of rules based on the unique non-white colors present in the input grid. However, the execution results show that the code fails on all training examples, indicating significant flaws in the implemented logic or the understanding of the transformation rules.\n\nKey issues observed:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Rule Logic:** The transformations applied within each rule (color swaps, flips, conditional conversions) do not consistently match the expected outputs across different examples.\n2.  **Contradictory Rules:** The logic derived for the color set {1, 2, 8} from Example 4 seems to contradict the required transformation for the same color set in Example 1. This suggests the trigger condition is more complex than just the presence of these colors.\n3.  **Spatial Transformation Errors:** Rule 1 (involving Magenta/Orange/Red/Yellow) requires a horizontal flip combined with color swaps. The implementation seems to handle this incorrectly, particularly in how the flipped elements replace original elements. Rule 2 (involving Blue/Yellow/Azure) likely involves a complex spatial rearrangement in Example 3 that is not captured by the current pixel-wise color conversion.\n4.  **Handling of Extra Colors:** How colors not explicitly mentioned in a rule's core trigger (e.g., Azure in Rule 1, Red/Orange in Rule 2, Azure in Rule 3/4) are handled needs careful verification. The default assumption of mapping them to white might be incorrect or need refinement based on context.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-analyze Each Example:** Carefully compare input and output grids for each example, focusing on:\n    *   Exact color mappings (input color at (r, c) -> output color at (r', c')).\n    *   Spatial transformations (translation, rotation, flipping, scaling, rearrangement).\n    *   Conditional logic (depending on position, neighbours, presence/count/shape of other colors).\n2.  **Identify Consistent Patterns:** Look for rules that hold true across multiple examples or identify the differentiating factors that cause rules to change (e.g., grid dimensions, relative color counts, object shapes).\n3.  **Address Contradictions:** The {1, 2, 8} case (Ex 1 vs Ex 4) requires finding the hidden condition that distinguishes them. Potential factors include relative counts of colors or the size/shape of contiguous color objects.\n4.  **Refine Rule Priority and Logic:** Update the natural language program based on the revised understanding, ensuring the rules are distinct, correctly prioritized, and accurately described. Pay special attention to the interaction between color changes and spatial changes.\n5.  **Focus on Object Properties:** Incorporate the concept of \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of color) where relevant, especially for the conditional logic in the {1, 2, 8} case.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's gather the unique non-white colors for each example's input and expected output.\n"
