The transformation rule depends on the specific set of non-white colors present in the input grid. The rules are checked in a specific priority order:

1.  **Magenta/Orange Swap & Flip:** If both Magenta (6) and Orange (7) are present:
    *   Swap all Magenta pixels to Orange and all Orange pixels to Magenta.
    *   Horizontally flip the positions of all Red (2) and Yellow (4) pixels relative to the grid's width.
    *   All other non-white pixels (e.g., Azure 8) become white (0).
2.  **Yellow/Blue Conversion:** If both Blue (1) and Yellow (4) are present (and rule 1 didn't apply):
    *   Convert all Yellow (4) pixels to Red (2).
    *   Convert all Blue (1) pixels to Orange (7).
    *   Convert Azure (8) pixels based on row: If the row index is less than or equal to the median row index (floor((height - 1) / 2)), convert to Red (2); otherwise, convert to Orange (7).
    *   All other non-white pixels (e.g., original Red 2, Orange 7) become white (0).
3.  **Red/Yellow Swap:** If both Red (2) and Yellow (4) are present (and rules 1, 2 didn't apply):
    *   Swap all Red pixels to Yellow and all Yellow pixels to Red.
    *   All other non-white pixels become white (0).
4.  **Blue/Red Swap:** If both Blue (1) and Red (2) are present (and rules 1, 2, 3 didn't apply):
    *   Swap all Blue pixels to Red and all Red pixels to Blue.
    *   All other non-white pixels (e.g., Azure 8) become white (0).
5.  **Default:** If none of the above color combinations trigger a rule, the output grid is entirely white (0).

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** Input {1, 2, 8} -> Output {2}. Code triggered Rule 4 ({1, 2}), Output {1, 2}. Mismatch in output colors and pixel values. Expected output suggests only Red remains, potentially based on Azure locations.
*   **Example 2:** Input {2, 4, 6, 7, 8} -> Output {2, 4, 6, 7}. Code triggered Rule 1 ({6, 7}), Output {2, 4, 6, 7}. Output colors match, but pixel values are wrong. The rule needs refinement, especially the Red/Yellow flip and Azure handling.
*   **Example 3:** Input {1, 2, 4, 7, 8} -> Output {2, 7}. Code triggered Rule 2 ({1, 4}), Output {2, 7}. Output colors match, but pixel values are wrong. The Blue->Orange, Yellow->Red, and Azure handling need significant changes.
*   **Example 4:** Input {1, 2, 8} -> Output {1, 2}. Code triggered Rule 4 ({1, 2}), Output {1, 2}. Output colors match, but pixel values are wrong. Confirms Rule 4 (Blue/Red swap) needs to handle Azure correctly (Azure -> Blue).

**Revised Hypotheses:**

*   **Rule 1 (Magenta/Orange Present - {6, 7}):** Example 2.
    *   Magenta (6) swaps with Orange (7).
    *   Red (2) / Yellow (4) *pairs* seem to be flipped horizontally. Look at rows 3, 5, 7, 10. Input (r3: 2 @ c1, 4 @ c13) -> Output (r3: 4 @ c1, 2 @ c13). Input (r10: 4@c2, 2@c3, 4@c5, 2@c6) -> Output (r10: 2@c8, 4@c9, 2@c11, 4@c12) which is a horizontal flip of the block (4,2,0,4,2) -> (2,4,0,2,4) from c2-c6 to c8-c12. Let's re-examine the code's flip: it flips *individual* pixels, not pairs or blocks. **Correction:** Find Red/Yellow pixels. For each such pixel at (r, c), place its swapped color (Red->Yellow, Yellow->Red) at (r, width - 1 - c). This seems closer to the expected output for rows 3, 5, 7, but not row 10. Wait, the *original* code's flip logic `flipped_grid[r, width - 1 - c] = pixel` *is* correct for flipping positions. The issue might be the swap part. Expected output swaps Red/Yellow *colors* AND flips *positions*. So Red at (r, c) becomes Yellow at (r, width-1-c), and Yellow at (r, c) becomes Red at (r, width-1-c).
    *   Azure (8) becomes white (0). This seems consistent with Example 2's expected output vs input.
    *   **Revised Rule 1:** If Magenta(6) and Orange(7) are present: Swap Magenta(6) <-> Orange(7). For Red(2) and Yellow(4), swap their colors *and* flip their horizontal positions: Red(2) at (r, c) moves to (r, width-1-c) and becomes Yellow(4); Yellow(4) at (r, c) moves to (r, width-1-c) and becomes Red(2). All other non-white pixels (Azure 8) become white(0).
*   **Rule 2 (Blue/Yellow Present - {1, 4}):** Example 3.
    *   Blue(1) -> Orange(7).
    *   Yellow(4) -> Red(2).
    *   Azure(8) -> Red(2) if row <= median_row, else Orange(7). This seems to be the logic applied by the code. Let's re-check Example 3. Input height=20, median_row=(20-1)//2 = 9. Top half (0-9), bottom half (10-19).
        *   Input Azures: (4,9), (5,8), (5,10), (6,7), (6,11), (7,6), (7,12), (8,7), (8,11), (9,8), (9,10), (10,9), (15,12), (15,16), (16,13), (16,15), (17,14), (18,13), (18,15), (19,12), (19,16).
        *   Code Output Azures: Red(2) at (4,9), (5,8), (5,10), (6,7), (6,11), (7,6), (7,12), (8,7), (8,11), (9,8), (9,10). Orange(7) at (10,9), (15,12), (15,16), (16,13), (16,15), (17,14), (18,13), (18,15), (19,12), (19,16).
        *   Expected Output Azures: The output grid contains *patterns* of Red and Orange, not single pixels corresponding to input Azure locations. Example: Input Azure at (4,9) (top half) corresponds to a 2x1 block of Red at (4,4), (5,4)? No, that doesn't make sense.
        *   Let's look at the overall structure. Top half of output (rows 0-9) contains only Red(2). Bottom half (rows 10-19) contains only Orange(7). This matches the median split idea.
        *   Where do the Red/Orange pixels appear? They seem related to the original positions of Blue(1), Yellow(4), *and* Azure(8).
        *   Examine Row 4 Input: Yellow(4) at c1, Azure(8) at c9, Yellow(4) at c13, Yellow(4) at c17.
        *   Examine Row 4 Output: Red(2) at c1, c4, c13, c17.
        *   Examine Row 15 Input: Blue(1) at c0, Blue(1) at c4, Azure(8) at c12, Azure(8) at c16.
        *   Examine Row 15 Output: Orange(7) at c2, c6, c11, c15.
        *   This isn't a simple pixel mapping. It looks like *objects* or *areas* are involved.
        *   Consider the bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input.
        *   Maybe it maps input pixels to output *regions*?
        *   Let's try a simpler hypothesis based on the median split: Any non-white pixel (Blue, Yellow, Azure, *also Red, Orange*) in the top half (row <= median) becomes Red(2) in the output. Any non-white pixel in the bottom half (row > median) becomes Orange(7) in the output. Let's test this on Example 3.
            *   Input (r=4, c=1): Yellow(4). r=4 <= median=9. Output should be Red(2) at (4,1). Expected Output has Red(2) at (4,1). Correct.
            *   Input (r=4, c=9): Azure(8). r=4 <= median=9. Output should be Red(2) at (4,9). Expected Output has White(0) at (4,9). Incorrect.
            *   Input (r=11, c=9): Red(2). r=11 > median=9. Output should be Orange(7) at (11,9). Expected Output has White(0) at (11,9). Incorrect.
            *   Input (r=15, c=0): Blue(1). r=15 > median=9. Output should be Orange(7) at (15,0). Expected Output has White(0) at (15,0). Incorrect.
        *   This hypothesis is also wrong. The transformation is more complex.
        *   Let's reconsider the original code's logic for Rule 2: Yellow->Red, Blue->Orange, Azure->Red/Orange by median row, OTHER colors -> White. This seems to match the output colors {2, 7} but fails placement.
        *   Looking closely at Example 3 output: The Red pixels form a pattern in the top half, and Orange pixels form a pattern in the bottom half. The patterns look like 2x2 blocks with one corner missing, or maybe connected components. They don't seem to directly map 1-to-1 from input pixels.
        *   Could it be related to connectivity? Find all connected components of {Blue, Yellow, Azure} pixels. For components entirely in the top half, replace with Red patterns? For components entirely in the bottom half, replace with Orange patterns? What about components spanning the median?
        *   Let's stick closer to the code's logic but try to fix the placement. Maybe the output position is relative to something?
        *   What if we take the code's output (which has the right colors but wrong places) and rearrange the pixels?
        *   Let's revisit the initial idea: Yellow->Red, Blue->Orange. How does Azure fit? The code does Azure->Red (top) / Orange (bottom). What if *all* input pixels {1, 4, 8} contribute to the output based on their row?
            *   If input pixel at (r, c) is Blue(1), Yellow(4), or Azure(8):
                *   If r <= median_row, output pixel at (r, c) becomes Red(2).
                *   If r > median_row, output pixel at (r, c) becomes Orange(7).
            *   All other input pixels (including original Red, Orange) become White(0).
        *   Let's test this revised logic on Example 3:
            *   Input (4,1)=Yellow(4). r=4<=9. Output(4,1)=Red(2). Matches expected.
            *   Input (4,9)=Azure(8). r=4<=9. Output(4,9)=Red(2). Expected is White(0). Fails.
            *   Input (15,0)=Blue(1). r=15>9. Output(15,0)=Orange(7). Expected is White(0). Fails.
            *   Input (11,9)=Red(2). Not 1, 4, or 8. Output(11,9)=White(0). Matches expected.
            *   Input (14,14)=Orange(7). Not 1, 4, or 8. Output(14,14)=White(0). Matches expected.
        *   This revised logic is still wrong. The spatial mapping is the key missing piece for Rule 2. The expected output pattern seems artificial, like it's drawing shapes based on the *presence* of certain input colors in certain regions, rather than direct pixel mapping.
        *   Given the significant mismatch, maybe Rule 2 as defined (Yellow->Red, Blue->Orange, Azure split) is fundamentally wrong. What if the rule triggered by {1, 4} is something else entirely? Example 3 has inputs {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}. Maybe the rule trigger is {1, 4, 8}? Or maybe {1, 4} triggers one thing, but the presence of {2, 7} modifies it? This seems too complex. Let's assume the trigger is {1, 4} for now.
        *   Let's look at the *shape* of the output in Ex 3. The red shapes in the top half and orange shapes in the bottom half look like mirrored 'L' shapes or 2x2 blocks with a corner missing. They appear at column indices related to the input Blue, Yellow, Azure columns.
        *   Maybe: Find all input pixels (r, c) where color is Blue(1), Yellow(4), or Azure(8). If r <= median, draw a Red 'shape' centered at/near (r, c)? If r > median, draw an Orange 'shape'? This is getting highly speculative.
        *   **Let's stick to the color mapping from the code but acknowledge the position is wrong.** Rule 2 (Trigger {1,4}): Yellow(4)->Red(2). Blue(1)->Orange(7). Azure(8)->Red(2) if row <= median, else Orange(7). Other colors (Red 2, Orange 7) -> White(0). The placement needs fixing.
*   **Rule 4 (Blue/Red Present - {1, 2}):** Examples 1 and 4.
    *   Input colors {1, 2, 8}.
    *   Expected Output (Ex 1): Contains only Red(2).
    *   Expected Output (Ex 4): Contains Red(1) and Blue(2).
    *   These are contradictory if the rule is solely based on {1, 2}. The presence of Azure(8) must be the deciding factor.
    *   **Hypothesis A:** If {1, 2} present AND {8} *is* present: Rule is specific. (Ex 1 & 4)
    *   **Hypothesis B:** If {1, 2} present AND {8} is *not* present: Rule is different. (No examples yet)
    *   Let's analyze Ex 4 first as it seems simpler. Input {1, 2, 8}. Output {1, 2}. Action: Blue(1) <-> Red(2) swap. Azure(8) -> Blue(1). This explains the output perfectly.
    *   Now let's re-analyze Ex 1. Input {1, 2, 8}. Output {2}. Action: Blue(1) -> Red(2). Red(2) -> Red(2)? Azure(8) -> Red(2)? This doesn't seem right.
    *   Look at Ex 1 input/output again.
        Input: B R A A A / .....B / ...B. / ...B. / .....B
        Output: ..... / .....R / ...RR / ...RR / .....R
        The output Red pixels seem spatially related to the input Blue and Azure pixels, but not the Red ones.
        Maybe: If {1, 2, 8} are present: Find all Blue(1) and Azure(8) pixels. In the output grid, place Red(2) at these locations. All other pixels (including original Red(2)) become White(0).
        Let's test this on Ex 1:
        Input Blue/Azure locations: (0,0), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4).
        Placing Red(2) at these locations:
        R 0 R R R
        0 0 0 0 R
        0 0 0 R 0
        0 0 0 R 0
        0 0 0 0 R
        This is *not* the expected output.
    *   What if the two examples trigger *different* rules despite having the same color set {1, 2, 8}? This happens if the priority order is wrong or if another color combination takes precedence.
    *   Let's re-evaluate the rule priorities and triggers:
        *   Rule 1: Trigger {6, 7}. Example 2.
        *   Rule 2: Trigger {1, 4}. Example 3.
        *   Rule 3: Trigger {2, 4}. (Untested).
        *   Rule 4: Trigger {1, 2}. Examples 1, 4.
    *   This priority seems okay based on the examples. So, the rule triggered for both Ex 1 and Ex 4 *should* be the same. Why are the outcomes different?
    *   Could there be a property other than color sets distinguishing Ex 1 and Ex 4? Grid size? Number of pixels? No obvious difference.
    *   Let's revisit the Rule 4 for {1, 2, 8} derived from Ex 4: Swap Blue(1)<->Red(2), Azure(8)->Blue(1). Let's apply *this* rule to Ex 1.
        Input Ex 1:
        1 2 8 8 8
        0 0 0 0 1
        0 0 0 1 0
        0 0 0 1 0
        0 0 0 0 1
        Apply Swap B<->R, A->B:
        2 1 1 1 1  (1->2, 2->1, 8->1)
        0 0 0 0 2  (1->2)
        0 0 0 2 0  (1->2)
        0 0 0 2 0  (1->2)
        0 0 0 0 2  (1->2)
        This is also not the expected output for Ex 1.

    *   **Conclusion:** The initial assumption that the *set* of colors uniquely determines the rule might be incorrect, OR the rules themselves are more complex/context-dependent, OR the priority is wrong.
    *   Let's reconsider Rule 4 ({1, 2} trigger).
        *   Maybe the rule *is* just Blue<->Red swap, and Azure->White *unless* some other condition holds? What condition could hold in Ex 4 but not Ex 1? In Ex 4, Azure pixels are neighbours to Blue pixels. In Ex 1, some Azure pixels are neighbours to Red pixels. Maybe adjacency matters?
        *   Let's try Rule 4 = Simple Blue<->Red swap, Azure->White. This was the code's logic. It failed both Ex 1 and Ex 4.
        *   Let's try Rule 4 = Swap Blue<->Red, Azure->Blue. This worked for Ex 4 output. Let's re-check Ex 1 with this: Output would be (as calculated above):
          2 1 1 1 1
          0 0 0 0 2
          0 0 0 2 0
          0 0 0 2 0
          0 0 0 0 2
          Still not Ex 1 expected:
          0 0 0 0 0
          0 0 0 0 2
          0 0 0 2 2
          0 0 0 2 2
          0 0 0 0 2
        *   There's a fundamental misunderstanding of what happens in Example 1. The output seems to be created by drawing a shape based on input features. Look at the input Blue+Azure pixels: they form a rough 'L' shape / diagonal structure. The output Red pixels form a different shape in the bottom right.

**Revising Strategy Again:**

The rules based purely on color combinations are insufficient or incorrectly defined. The spatial arrangement and object properties seem crucial, especially for Examples 1 and 3.

Let's focus on the most likely correct parts and note the uncertainties:

*   **Rule Priority:** The order {6,7} -> {1,4} -> {2,4} -> {1,2} seems plausible but needs confirmation.
*   **Rule 1 ({6, 7}):** Magenta<->Orange swap seems right. Red/Yellow positional swap+color swap needs verification, but is the best hypothesis so far. Azure->White seems right.
*   **Rule 2 ({1, 4}):** Yellow->Red, Blue->Orange, Azure->Red/Orange based on median row seems partially correct for *color selection*, but the *positioning* is wrong. The output seems pattern-based. Original Red/Orange -> White seems right.
*   **Rule 4 ({1, 2}):** This is the most problematic. The same input colors {1, 2, 8} yield different results in Ex 1 and Ex 4.
    *   Maybe the trigger isn't just {1, 2}? Maybe it's {1, 2, 8}? But that doesn't resolve the conflict.
    *   Could Ex 1 actually be triggering a *different* rule based on some property we missed? It has Azure pixels adjacent to Red. Ex 4 has Azure pixels adjacent to Blue. Is {1, 2} + (A adj R) different from {1, 2} + (A adj B)?
    *   Let's assume Ex 4 is the 'base' rule for {1, 2, 8}: Swap Blue<->Red, Azure->Blue.
    *   What makes Ex 1 different? In Ex 1, the top row is 1 2 8 8 8. Blue is left of Red, Red is left of Azures. In Ex 4, the critical row is 0 2 1 8 0 2 0 0. Red is left of Blue, Blue is left of Azure. Does the relative order matter?
    *   Let's assume the rule for Ex 4 (Swap B<->R, A->B) applies when {1, 2, 8} are present. We need a new explanation for Ex 1.

**New Plan:**

1.  Define rules based on the priority order.
2.  Rule 1 ({6, 7}): Implement as revised (M<->O swap, R/Y color swap + position flip, A->W).
3.  Rule 2 ({1, 4}): Implement color change (Y->R, B->O, A->R/O by median, Others->W) but note the position is likely wrong and needs a complex spatial algorithm (defer this complexity for now).
4.  Rule 3 ({2, 4}): Keep original hypothesis (R<->Y swap, Others->W).
5.  Rule 4 ({1, 2}): Check for Azure(8).
    *   If {1, 2, 8} present: Apply rule from Ex 4: Swap Blue(1)<->Red(2), Azure(8)->Blue(1).
    *   If {1, 2} present but NO {8}: Apply simple Swap Blue(1)<->Red(2), Others->White(0). (Hypothetical).
6.  Default: All White.

This still doesn't explain Example 1. It will be predicted incorrectly by the revised Rule 4. Example 1 remains an anomaly under this framework. Maybe Example 1 triggers a special case if Azure is adjacent to Red when Blue is also present?

Let's refine the YAML and NL program with this updated, albeit incomplete, understanding.**General Assessment**

The initial code, based on limited observations, failed on all training examples. This indicates that the transformation rules are more complex than simple color swaps or flips based solely on the presence of certain color pairs. The failures highlight several issues:

1.  **Incorrect Actions:** The specific actions (color changes, positional changes) within the hypothesized rules were often wrong. For example, the Red/Yellow flip in Rule 1 and the Azure handling in Rule 2 and Rule 4 were incorrect.
2.  **Context Dependence (Spatial/Object):** Examples 1 and 3, in particular, suggest that the transformation isn't just pixel-wise. The output patterns seem related to the spatial arrangement, adjacency, or perhaps connected components of input pixels, which the current logic ignores. Rule 2 (triggered by Blue/Yellow) seems to produce patterned outputs based on row position.
3.  **Rule Specificity/Triggers:** Examples 1 and 4 both contain Blue(1), Red(2), and Azure(8), yet have different output structures. This implies either the rule trigger is more specific than just the set {1, 2, 8}, the priority of rules is different, or there's another factor (like pixel adjacency or relative positions) influencing the rule application.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Re-evaluate each rule based on all examples:** Analyze the input/output pairs where each specific color combination occurs.
2.  **Refine Actions:** Correct the color mappings and positional transformations based on the evidence. Pay attention to how *all* colors present in the input are handled by each rule.
3.  **Incorporate Context:** Where simple pixel mapping fails (e.g., Ex 1, Ex 3), consider spatial properties like row/column indices, adjacency, and the median row. Acknowledge where the exact spatial logic is still undetermined.
4.  **Address Contradictions:** Investigate why Examples 1 and 4 behave differently despite having the same color set {1, 2, 8}. Propose a refined trigger or conditional logic for Rule 4.
5.  **Iterate:** Update the natural language program and prepare for further refinement in the coding phase. Accept that some rules (especially spatial ones) might require more complex algorithms.

**Metrics**
