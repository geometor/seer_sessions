Other similar horizontal gaps of background color between foreground pixels are *not* filled.\n    *   In train_2, a horizontal gap of white pixels `(0, 0, 0)` at row 9, columns 20-22, between two green pixels (at column 19 and 23), is filled with green (3).\n    *   The distinguishing feature of the gaps that get filled seems to be the presence of at least one foreground-colored pixel immediately above or below the gap itself. In train_1, pixel (8, 17) is magenta (6), located below the gap. In train_2, pixel (10, 21) is green (3), located below the gap. The unfilled gaps lack such adjacent foreground pixels above or below them.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    3.  Iterate through each row `R` of the input grid.\n    4.  Within each row `R`, iterate through potential starting columns `C1`.\n    5.  Let the color at `(R, C1)` be `P1_color`. If `P1_color` is the background color `B`, continue to the next column.\n    6.  If `P1_color` is not `B` (let this foreground color be `C`), then search rightwards from `C1 + 1` in the same row `R` for the first column `C2` where the pixel `(R, C2)` also has the color `C`.\n    7.  If such a `C2` is found:\n        a.  Check if all pixels in row `R` between columns `C1 + 1` and `C2 - 1` (the potential gap) have the background color `B`.\n        b.  If they are all background color `B`, then check the pixels directly adjacent (above and below) to this gap. Specifically, examine all pixels `(R-1, col)` and `(R+1, col)` for `col` ranging from `C1 + 1` to `C2 - 1`. Be mindful of grid boundaries (rows 0 and max_row).\n        c.  If *any* of the pixels checked in step 7b have the foreground color `C`, then fill the gap in the output grid: change the color of all pixels `(R, col)` for `col` ranging from `C1 + 1` to `C2 - 1` to the foreground color `C`.\n    8.  After checking all rows and potential gaps, return the modified output grid."
