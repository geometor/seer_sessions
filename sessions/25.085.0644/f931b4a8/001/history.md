Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All input grids appear to be square and have dimensions that are powers of 2 (8x8 or 16x16). They can be naturally divided into four equal quadrants.
2.  **Quadrant Focus:** The transformation consistently depends on the content of the bottom-left (BL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants of the input grid. The top two quadrants (TL, TR) seem irrelevant to the output generation.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The specific transformation rule applied depends on the content of the BR quadrant. I can identify three distinct cases based on the examples:
    *   **Case 1: BR is solid white (0).** The output is simply the BL quadrant. (Example: train_4)
    *   **Case 2: BR is a solid color, but not white.** The output is constructed using the solid color of BR and the solid color of BL. (Example: train_5)
    *   **Case 3: BR contains a pattern involving white (0) and other colors.** The output is derived from the BR pattern, but with the white pixels replaced by a color derived from the BL quadrant. The final output size and structure (tiling vs. padding) depend on the initial quadrant size. (Examples: train_1, train_2, train_3)
4.  **Color Replacement:** In Case 3, the white (0) pixels in the BR pattern are replaced. The replacement color is determined by the BL quadrant â€“ specifically, it appears to be the most frequent non-white color present in the BL quadrant. If the BL quadrant is a single solid color, that color is used.
5.  **Output Construction:**
    *   **Extraction:** In Case 1, the BL quadrant is directly extracted.
    *   **Row Construction:** In Case 2, the output is a small grid (3 rows high) built from rows of the solid colors found in BL and BR.
    *   **Pattern Manipulation & Resizing:** In Case 3, the modified BR pattern (after color replacement) is either tiled or padded to create the final output:
        *   If the quadrants are 4x4, the 4x4 modified pattern is tiled 4x4 times to produce a 16x16 output.
        *   If the quadrants are 8x8, the 8x8 modified pattern is padded with 2 rows/columns of the replacement color on the bottom and right to produce a 10x10 output.

## Facts


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - always square (8x8 or 16x16 in examples)
    - divisible into 4 equal Quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR)
  Relationships:
    - Output depends only on BL and BR Quadrants.

Quadrants:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: h x w (where h=H/2, w=W/2 of InputGrid)
    - Content: Can be solid color, contain patterns, contain white (0).
  Instances:
    - TL: Top-Left
    - TR: Top-Right
    - BL: Bottom-Left
    - BR: Bottom-Right

Transformation_Rules:
  - Condition: BR Quadrant is solid white (0).
    Action: Extract BL Quadrant.
    Output: BL Quadrant grid.
  - Condition: BR Quadrant is solid non-white (Color_BR) AND BL Quadrant is solid non-white (Color_BL).
    Action: Construct grid with 3 rows.
    Output: 3 x w grid: [Row(Color_BR), Row(Color_BL), Row(Color_BR)].
  - Condition: BR Quadrant contains white (0) and other colors.
    Action:
      1. Determine Replacement_Color: Most frequent non-white color in BL Quadrant.
      2. Create Pattern_Grid: Copy BR Quadrant, replace all white (0) with Replacement_Color.
      3. Resize based on quadrant dimensions (h x w):
         - If h=4, w=4: Tile Pattern_Grid 4x4 times. Output size: 16x16.
         - If h=8, w=8: Pad Pattern_Grid to (h+2)x(w+2) with Replacement_Color (add 2 rows at bottom, 2 cols at right). Output size: 10x10.
    Output: Resized grid.

Colors:
  - white (0): Special role as a replaceable background/placeholder in BR quadrant patterns.
  - other colors (1-9): Used for patterns, solid fills, and as replacement colors.

Actions:
  - Divide: Input into quadrants.
  - Analyze: Content of BL and BR quadrants (solid, contains white, colors present).
  - Identify Color: Determine solid color or most frequent non-white color.
  - Replace: Substitute white pixels in a pattern.
  - Extract: Copy a quadrant directly.
  - Construct: Build a grid row by row using specific colors.
  - Tile: Repeat a pattern grid multiple times to form a larger grid.
  - Pad: Add rows/columns of a specific color around a pattern grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the input grid into four equal quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR). Let the dimensions of each quadrant be `h` rows and `w` columns.
2.  Examine the Bottom-Right (BR) quadrant:
    a.  **If** the BR quadrant consists entirely of white (0) pixels:
        The output grid is an exact copy of the Bottom-Left (BL) quadrant.
    b.  **Else if** the BR quadrant consists entirely of a single non-white color (`Color_BR`) **and** the BL quadrant also consists entirely of a single non-white color (`Color_BL`):
        Create a new grid with 3 rows and `w` columns.
        Fill the first row with `Color_BR`.
        Fill the second row with `Color_BL`.
        Fill the third row with `Color_BR`.
        This 3x`w` grid is the output.
    c.  **Else** (the BR quadrant contains a pattern mixing white (0) and other colors):
        i.  Determine the `Replacement_Color` by finding the most frequent non-white color in the BL quadrant.
        ii. Create a temporary `Pattern_Grid` of size `h` x `w` by copying the BR quadrant and replacing every white (0) pixel with the `Replacement_Color`.
        iii. Check the quadrant height `h`:
            1.  **If** `h` is 4 (meaning quadrants are 4x4):
                Create the output grid by tiling the `Pattern_Grid` 4 times horizontally and 4 times vertically, resulting in a 16x16 grid.
            2.  **If** `h` is 8 (meaning quadrants are 8x8):
                Create an output grid of size (`h`+2) x (`w`+2) (i.e., 10x10) filled initially with the `Replacement_Color`.
                Place the `h` x `w` `Pattern_Grid` into the top-left corner of this output grid, overwriting the initial `Replacement_Color` pixels in that `h` x `w` area.
                This 10x10 grid is the output.
