InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - always square (8x8 or 16x16 in examples)
    - divisible into 4 equal Quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR)
  Relationships:
    - Output depends only on BL and BR Quadrants.

Quadrants:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: h x w (where h=H/2, w=W/2 of InputGrid)
    - Content: Can be solid color, contain patterns, contain white (0).
  Instances:
    - TL: Top-Left
    - TR: Top-Right
    - BL: Bottom-Left
    - BR: Bottom-Right

Transformation_Rules:
  - Condition: BR Quadrant is solid white (0).
    Action: Extract BL Quadrant.
    Output: BL Quadrant grid.
  - Condition: BR Quadrant is solid non-white (Color_BR) AND BL Quadrant is solid non-white (Color_BL).
    Action: Construct grid with 3 rows.
    Output: 3 x w grid: [Row(Color_BR), Row(Color_BL), Row(Color_BR)].
  - Condition: BR Quadrant contains white (0) and other colors.
    Action:
      1. Determine Replacement_Color: Most frequent non-white color in BL Quadrant.
      2. Create Pattern_Grid: Copy BR Quadrant, replace all white (0) with Replacement_Color.
      3. Resize based on quadrant dimensions (h x w):
         - If h=4, w=4: Tile Pattern_Grid 4x4 times. Output size: 16x16.
         - If h=8, w=8: Pad Pattern_Grid to (h+2)x(w+2) with Replacement_Color (add 2 rows at bottom, 2 cols at right). Output size: 10x10.
    Output: Resized grid.

Colors:
  - white (0): Special role as a replaceable background/placeholder in BR quadrant patterns.
  - other colors (1-9): Used for patterns, solid fills, and as replacement colors.

Actions:
  - Divide: Input into quadrants.
  - Analyze: Content of BL and BR quadrants (solid, contains white, colors present).
  - Identify Color: Determine solid color or most frequent non-white color.
  - Replace: Substitute white pixels in a pattern.
  - Extract: Copy a quadrant directly.
  - Construct: Build a grid row by row using specific colors.
  - Tile: Repeat a pattern grid multiple times to form a larger grid.
  - Pad: Add rows/columns of a specific color around a pattern grid.
