  - description: "Task involves identifying two primary structures in the input grid against a background color."
    properties:
      background_color: "The most frequent color in the input grid."
      structures: "Two distinct groups of non-background pixels."

  - description: "One structure serves as a pattern tile."
    properties:
      definition: "A rectangular region extracted from the input grid, potentially containing multiple colors including the background color."
      identification: "Identified as the structure whose bounding box contains the minimum number of background pixels compared to the other structure."
      bounding_box: "The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to this structure."
      tile_data: "The actual pixel values from the input grid within the pattern structure's bounding box."
      tile_height_ph: "The height of the pattern tile bounding box."
      tile_width_pw: "The width of the pattern tile bounding box."

  - description: "The second structure serves as a control object."
    properties:
      definition: "The non-background structure that is not the pattern tile."
      identification: "Identified as the structure whose bounding box contains more background pixels."
      bounding_box: "The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to this structure."
      control_height_ch: "The height of the control object's bounding box."
      control_width_cw: "The width of the control object's bounding box."

  - description: "Identifying the two structures involves grouping non-background colors."
    properties:
      step_1: "Find all unique non-background colors present in the grid."
      step_2: "Determine the two distinct sets of colors that constitute the two structures (often one set has a single color, the other has multiple, but not necessarily)."
      step_3: "For each color set, find all pixels matching those colors."
      step_4: "Calculate the bounding box enclosing all pixels for each color set."
      step_5: "Count the background pixels within each bounding box to distinguish pattern from control."

  - description: "The transformation rule is tiling."
    properties:
      output_grid_height: "control_height_ch * tile_height_ph"
      output_grid_width: "control_width_cw * tile_width_pw"
      process: "The pattern tile data is repeated (tiled) `ch` times vertically and `cw` times horizontally to construct the output grid."
