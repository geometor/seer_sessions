            "text": "**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves identifying distinct objects within a grid and translating them horizontally based on a specific property: the color of their outer frame. The input grid contains several objects, each typically appearing as a 5x5 square structure. These squares consist of a single-pixel thick frame of one color surrounding a 3x3 filled center of another color. The rest of the grid is filled with a background color, which can vary between examples (white, yellow, blue). The transformation rule consistently depends on the frame color: objects with an Azure (8) frame are shifted left, and objects with a Red (2) frame are shifted right. The internal color of the object and the background color do not affect the translation rule itself, although they are preserved in the moved object. The output grid reflects these translated objects against the original background color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, completely filled with this background color.\n2.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to locate all distinct 5x5 square objects composed of a 1-pixel thick frame and a 3x3 filled center. For each object found, record its top-left corner coordinates, its frame color, and its center color.\n3.  **Translate Objects:** For each identified object:\n    a. Check the color of its frame.\n    b. If the frame color is Azure (8), calculate the new top-left column coordinate by subtracting 1 from the original column coordinate. The row coordinate remains unchanged.\n    c. If the frame color is Red (2), calculate the new top-left column coordinate by adding 5 to the original column coordinate. The row coordinate remains unchanged.\n4.  **Draw Output:** For each object, using its calculated new top-left coordinates, draw the object (both its frame and center pixels with their original colors) onto the output grid. Ensure that drawing operations stay within the bounds of the grid; any part of an object that would be translated outside the grid dimensions is omitted.\n5.  **Finalize:** Return the completed output grid."
