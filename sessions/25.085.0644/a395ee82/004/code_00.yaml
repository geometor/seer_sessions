TaskContext:
  InputGrid: A 2D grid of pixels with integer color values (0-9).
  OutputGrid: A 2D grid derived from the InputGrid.
  Background: The most frequent color in the InputGrid is considered background and generally ignored in object processing.

Objects:
  - Type: BasePattern
    Identification: The largest connected component of non-background pixels in the InputGrid.
    Properties:
      - Color: The single color of the object.
      - Size: The number of pixels in the object.
      - Shape: The relative coordinates of the pixels within its bounding box.
      - BoundingBox: The minimal rectangle enclosing the object.
      - BoundingBoxCenter: The geometric center pixel(s) of the BoundingBox, calculated as `(height // 2, width // 2)` relative to the BoundingBox top-left corner.
  - Type: MarkerSource
    Identification: All connected components of non-background pixels having the minimum size found among all non-background objects.
    Properties:
      - Color: The color(s) of these smallest objects. Let this set be MarkerColors.
      - Size: The minimum size found.
  - Type: MarkerLocation
    Identification: All pixels in the InputGrid whose color is one of the MarkerColors.
    Properties:
      - Coordinate: The (row, column) position of each such pixel.

Actions:
  - Action: InitializeOutput
    Source: InputGrid
    Target: OutputGrid
    Rule: Create OutputGrid as an identical copy of InputGrid initially.
  - Action: StampPattern
    Source: BasePattern, MarkerLocations
    Target: OutputGrid
    Rule: For each MarkerLocation (marker_row, marker_col):
      1. Determine the target top-left position for the stamp: `target_row = marker_row - BasePattern.BoundingBoxCenter.row`, `target_col = marker_col - BasePattern.BoundingBoxCenter.col`.
      2. Iterate through each relative coordinate (rel_row, rel_col) in the BasePattern's Shape.
      3. Calculate the destination coordinate in the OutputGrid: `dest_row = target_row + rel_row`, `dest_col = target_col + rel_col`.
      4. If the destination coordinate is within the OutputGrid bounds, set the pixel at `(dest_row, dest_col)` to the BasePattern's Color, overwriting the existing content.

FinalOutput: The modified OutputGrid after all StampPattern actions are completed.
