This shape appears to be the 'pattern' that gets replicated. Notably, this pattern object seems to be the largest connected component (excluding the background).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** There are other, smaller objects (often single pixels) of a different color (Azure 8 in train_1, Red 2 in train_2, Magenta 6 in train_3). These act as 'markers'. These marker pixels seem to correspond to the color of the smallest non-background object(s).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves copying the 'pattern' object. Copies of the pattern object are placed onto the output grid, centered at the locations where the 'marker' pixels existed in the input grid.\n5.  **Persistence/Removal:** The original 'pattern' object also persists in its original location in the output. The 'marker' pixels themselves are removed (or overwritten) in the output. Any other pixels that are not part of the background or the identified pattern object are also removed and replaced with the background color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
