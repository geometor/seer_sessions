"""
Identify the background color (most frequent) in the input grid.
Find all contiguous objects of non-background colors.
Identify the largest of these objects (the 'frame').
Determine the frame's color and its bounding box.
Create an output grid with the dimensions of the frame's bounding box.
Iterate through the input grid within the frame's bounding box.
For each pixel:
- If it's the original background color, place the frame's color in the corresponding output grid position.
- Otherwise, copy the pixel's original color to the corresponding output grid position.
Return the generated output grid.
