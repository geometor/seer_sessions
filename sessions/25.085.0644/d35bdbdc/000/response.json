            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently 10x10 grids.\n2.  **Key Objects:** The most prominent features are 3x3 square patterns. These squares consist of a central pixel and 8 surrounding pixels (the \"frame\"). In the identified objects, the 8 frame pixels all share the same color (`FrameColor`), which is different from the central pixel's color (`CenterColor`).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between input and output grids exclusively involve these 3x3 \"frame objects\". Other pixels and structures (like the gray shapes in the examples) remain untouched.\n4.  **Types of Changes:** Three distinct outcomes occur for these frame objects:\n    *   **Removal:** The entire 3x3 object (frame and center) is replaced with white pixels (color 0).\n    *   **Center Modification:** Only the central pixel's color is changed to a new color (`NewCenterColor`). The frame pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   **No Change:** The 3x3 object remains identical in the output.\n5.  **Rule Dependency:** The specific action (Remove, Change Center, No Change) depends entirely on the specific combination of the `FrameColor` and the `CenterColor`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
