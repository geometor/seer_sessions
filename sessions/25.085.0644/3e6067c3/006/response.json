This syntax error must be corrected first. The likely fix is to unindent line 75 by one level.\n*   **Logic Robustness:** Beyond the syntax error, the core logic relies on several assumptions derived potentially from only one example:\n    *   **Legend:** Assumes a specific `8, C1, 8, C2,...` pattern exists, is unique, and is found by scanning from the bottom up. What if the pattern differs, is elsewhere, or missing?\n    *   **Boxes:** Assumes boxes are strictly defined by a single-pixel blue border with a solid, non-blue, non-azure interior. Variations in border thickness, interior patterns, or allowed colors could cause issues.\n    *   **Gaps:** Assumes gaps are exactly one pixel wide and always azure.\n    *   **Priority:** Assumes priority is determined solely by the order in the legend row, with a specific tie-breaking rule (first box color wins if priorities are equal or undefined).\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  Correct the identified `IndentationError`.\n    2.  Execute the corrected code against *all* training examples.\n    3.  Analyze the outputs for *each* example:\n        *   If the output is correct, confirm the logic holds for that case.\n        *   If the output is incorrect, pinpoint the discrepancies. Did it fail to find the legend? Boxes? Gaps? Did it apply the wrong fill color?\n    4.  Use the results of this analysis to gather detailed metrics and facts about *all* examples.\n    5.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on the comprehensive understanding gained from all examples, modifying the rules to be general enough to cover all cases.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering (Anticipated)**\n\nSince the code failed with a syntax error, no execution metrics are available yet. We need to fix the code and run it. Once runnable, we would execute code similar to this for each example `i`:\n\n"
