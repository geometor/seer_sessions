Other colors are not present in the inputs.\n2.  **Output Grid Colors:** The output grids retain the blue (1) and white (0) pixels from the input but also introduce orange pixels (7).\n3.  **Spatial Relationship:** The orange pixels (7) in the output consistently appear adjacent (including diagonally) to the white pixels (0) that were present in the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** It appears that blue pixels (1) in the input are transformed into orange pixels (7) in the output *if and only if* they are adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one white pixel (0) in the input.\n5.  **White Pixel Invariance:** White pixels (0) in the input remain white pixels (0) in the output.\n6.  **Blue Pixel Conditional Invariance:** Blue pixels (1) in the input that are *not* adjacent (including diagonals) to any white pixel (0) remain blue pixels (1) in the output.\n7.  **Neighborhood:** The transformation rule seems to operate based on the immediate 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood) of each pixel.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
