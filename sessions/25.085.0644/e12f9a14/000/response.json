            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grids:** The task operates on 2D grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Background:** The predominant color is azure (8), which acts as the background.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous pixels of colors other than azure (8).\n4.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   Green (3) often forms enclosing shapes or boundaries.\n    *   Other colors (maroon(9), blue(1), yellow(4), magenta(6), red(2), orange(7)) appear, frequently *inside* the green shapes.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves projecting colors outwards from certain source pixels.\n6.  **Source Pixels:** The pixels whose colors are projected seem to be those that are *not* azure (8) and *not* green (3).\n7.  **Projection Mechanism:** For each source pixel, its color is extended in straight lines (up, down, left, right) across the grid.\n8.  **Projection Boundary:** The projection continues until it reaches the edges of the grid.\n9.  **Overwriting:** The projected color overwrites *any* pixel it encounters along its path, including the background (azure 8) and the green (3) pixels. The original source pixels and green pixels also remain unless overwritten by a projection from a *different* source pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

A source pixel is defined as any pixel whose color is neither the background color (azure 8) nor the container color (green 3). Record the row, column, and color of each source pixel.\n3.  For each identified source pixel (let its color be `C` and its position be `(R, Col)`):\n    a.  **Project Up:** Iterate from row `R-1` down to row `0`. Set the color of the pixel at `(current_row, Col)` in the output grid to `C`.\n    b.  **Project Down:** Iterate from row `R+1` up to the last row of the grid. Set the color of the pixel at `(current_row, Col)` in the output grid to `C`.\n    c.  **Project Left:** Iterate from column `Col-1` down to column `0`. Set the color of the pixel at `(R, current_col)` in the output grid to `C`.\n    d.  **Project Right:** Iterate from column `Col+1` up to the last column of the grid. Set the color of the pixel at `(R, current_col)` in the output grid to `C`.\n4.  After processing all source pixels from the input grid, return the modified output grid."
