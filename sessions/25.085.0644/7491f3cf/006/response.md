## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by dividing the input grid into four zones. It aims to generate Zone 4 by primarily copying the pattern from Zone 2 and then conditionally applying modifications based on the content of Zone 3. The results show that this code failed on all training examples.

The primary reasons for failure appear to be:
1.  **Incorrect Modifier Condition**: The logic to detect the "modifier" pattern in Zone 3 (a horizontal green line) was too strict. It required *all* non-background, non-border pixels in Zone 3 to form this line, whereas the examples show the line modifier should be applied even if other pattern pixels exist in Zone 3.
2.  **Missing Non-Modifier Logic**: When Zone 3 did *not* contain the green line modifier (as in Example 3), the code failed to apply the alternative transformation, which seems to involve copying the pattern pixels from Zone 3 into Zone 4.

The strategy for resolving these errors involves:
1.  Revising the condition for identifying the Zone 3 modifier to correctly detect the presence of *any* continuous horizontal green line spanning the zone's width, regardless of other pixels.
2.  Adding logic to handle the case where the Zone 3 modifier is *not* present. In this case, the pattern pixels from Zone 3 should be copied (overlaid) onto Zone 4 after the Zone 2 pattern has been copied.

## Metrics Gathering

The following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids of the training examples based on the proposed revised logic.
