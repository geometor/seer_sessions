            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by dividing the input grid into four zones. It aims to generate Zone 4 by primarily copying the pattern from Zone 2 and then conditionally applying modifications based on the content of Zone 3. The results show that this code failed on all training examples.\n\nThe primary reasons for failure appear to be:\n1.  **Incorrect Modifier Condition**: The logic to detect the \"modifier\" pattern in Zone 3 (a horizontal green line) was too strict. It required *all* non-background, non-border pixels in Zone 3 to form this line, whereas the examples show the line modifier should be applied even if other pattern pixels exist in Zone 3.\n2.  **Missing Non-Modifier Logic**: When Zone 3 did *not* contain the green line modifier (as in Example 3), the code failed to apply the alternative transformation, which seems to involve copying the pattern pixels from Zone 3 into Zone 4.\n\nThe strategy for resolving these errors involves:\n1.  Revising the condition for identifying the Zone 3 modifier to correctly detect the presence of *any* continuous horizontal green line spanning the zone's width, regardless of other pixels.\n2.  Adding logic to handle the case where the Zone 3 modifier is *not* present. In this case, the pattern pixels from Zone 3 should be copied (overlaid) onto Zone 4 after the Zone 2 pattern has been copied.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input grids of the training examples based on the proposed revised logic.\n\n"
