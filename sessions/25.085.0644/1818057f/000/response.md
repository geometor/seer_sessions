Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use red (2) and yellow (4) pixels in the input. The output introduces azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a background (mostly red) with scattered yellow pixels, sometimes forming specific patterns.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, with the key difference being that certain yellow (4) pixels are changed to azure (8).
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The change seems localized to specific configurations of yellow pixels. Red pixels and yellow pixels not part of these configurations remain unchanged.
5.  **Key Pattern:** Observing the locations where yellow changes to azure across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: a 3x3 area where the center pixel and its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all yellow (4). It looks like a plus sign (+) made of 5 yellow pixels.
6.  **Action:** When this yellow plus pattern is detected in the input, all five yellow pixels that constitute the plus shape are changed to azure (8) in the output grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - consists of pixels with colors (red: 2, yellow: 4, azure: 8)
      - dimensions vary across examples
  - object: pattern
    definition: A 3x3 area centered on a pixel (r, c).
    properties:
      - target_color: yellow (4)
      - shape: plus sign (+)
      - components:
          - center pixel (r, c)
          - north neighbor (r-1, c)
          - south neighbor (r+1, c)
          - west neighbor (r, c-1)
          - east neighbor (r, c+1)
      - condition: All five component pixels must be yellow (4).
actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    input: input grid
    target: the yellow plus pattern (+)
    description: Scan the grid to find all occurrences where a pixel and its four cardinal neighbors are all yellow (4).
  - name: change_color
    input: pixels identified by 'identify_pattern'
    from_color: yellow (4)
    to_color: azure (8)
    output: modified grid
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid.
  - A pixel's color changes from yellow (4) to azure (8) *if and only if* it is part of the identified yellow plus pattern (+).
  - All other pixels (red pixels, and yellow pixels not part of the pattern) retain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index (r, c), excluding the border pixels (as they cannot be the center of a 3x3 pattern). Specifically, iterate for rows from 1 to height-2 and columns from 1 to width-2.
3.  For each pixel at (r, c), check if it forms the center of a yellow plus pattern (+):
    *   Verify that the pixel at (r, c) is yellow (4).
    *   Verify that the pixel above it at (r-1, c) is yellow (4).
    *   Verify that the pixel below it at (r+1, c) is yellow (4).
    *   Verify that the pixel to its left at (r, c-1) is yellow (4).
    *   Verify that the pixel to its right at (r, c+1) is yellow (4).
4.  If all five conditions in step 3 are met, then update the colors in the output grid for all five corresponding pixel locations ( (r, c), (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) ) to azure (8).
5.  After checking all possible center pixels, return the final output grid.
