"""
Identifies 3x3 patterns where the center pixel and its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all yellow (4), forming a plus shape (+).
Changes the color of all five pixels in each identified plus pattern from yellow (4) to azure (8) in the output grid.
All other pixels retain their original colors.
