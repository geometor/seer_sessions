Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue).

2.  **Locate Specific Occurrences:** Find the '8' (blue) objects that are located diagonally adjacent (specifically, up-and-left or down-and-left) relative to another '8' object.

3. **Apply a color change:** Change the value of these specific adjacent '8' objects with value '1'.

4.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other '8' objects, and cells with '0', remain unchanged.

In essence, the rule identifies '8' colored pixels that reside diagonally, and to the left and are next to the other '8's, and it transforms the most adjacent diagonal '8' cell into '1'.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
