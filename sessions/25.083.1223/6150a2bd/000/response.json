The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color substitutions, but rather a re-arrangement of the input grid's elements. The positions of the numbers are changing, suggesting a spatial transformation. It's notable that the values are simply relocated, no new values are computed. It also appears that rows and columns and order of them may be swapped.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This means swapping rows and columns (element at `[i][j]` goes to `[j][i]`).\n2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of rows in the transposed matrix. That it, the top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.\n\nEssentially, the transformation is a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), and the sequence of rows is inverted.\n"
