Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids seem to have a single non-zero color, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grids consist only of the non-zero color from the input, but the dimensions and number of pixels change. The core task appears to be identifying the non-zero color and creating a new grid containing only that color, with a size determined by the number of times that color appears in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are rectangular and contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - object_identification: |
      Each non-zero pixel represents an instance of a color.  Zero represents the background.
  - property_identification: |
      Color: The non-zero digit.
      Count: Number of times the non-zero digit appears in the input grid.
  - action_identification: |
      Extraction: Identify the non-zero color.
      Counting: Count the occurrences of the non-zero color.
      Construction:  Create a new grid filled with the extracted color.
  - relationship_identification: |
      The output grid's total number of pixels equals the count of the non-zero color in the input grid. The output is a 1D row of the input non-zero colored pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the single non-zero color (digit) present in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of times this non-zero color appears in the input grid.
3.  **Create** a new 1D grid (a single row). The length of this 1D grid equals the count of the identified non zero color.
4.  **Fill** all cells of the new grid with the identified non-zero color.
