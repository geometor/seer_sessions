facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are rectangular and contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - object_identification: |
      Each non-zero pixel represents an instance of a color.  Zero represents the background.
  - property_identification: |
      Color: The non-zero digit.
      Count: Number of times the non-zero digit appears in the input grid.
  - action_identification: |
      Extraction: Identify the non-zero color.
      Counting: Count the occurrences of the non-zero color.
      Construction:  Create a new grid filled with the extracted color.
  - relationship_identification: |
      The output grid's total number of pixels equals the count of the non-zero color in the input grid. The output is a 1D row of the input non-zero colored pixels.
