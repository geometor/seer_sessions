The input grids seem to have a single non-zero color, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grids consist only of the non-zero color from the input, but the dimensions and number of pixels change. The core task appears to be identifying the non-zero color and creating a new grid containing only that color, with a size determined by the number of times that color appears in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
