Both grids have the same dimensions (6x9). The grids contain single-digit integer values, representing colors.  The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).  The azure and yellow regions appear to be the key objects undergoing transformation. The transformation seems to involve a change related to the azure pixels only. The yellow shapes don't change.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Its position and shape are preserved.\n3.  **Azure Transformation - Horizontal Shift:** The set of contiguous azure pixels located in the top 3 rows of the grid shifts horizontally. Specifically, all azure pixels from the top 3 rows are moved to the left, until the left-most azure pixel becomes in the first column where there was any azure pixel before.\n\nIn summary. Copy the yellow pixels from input to output.\nCopy the azure pixels, making sure that all azure colored pixels in the top three rows are moved to the left, such that leftmost azure pixel occupies the first column that contained azure previously.\n"
