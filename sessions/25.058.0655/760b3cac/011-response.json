            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, focusing on the expansion of the azure object. However, the provided examples show the initial implementation has flaws. It looks like the expansion needs to occur in all directions (right, down, up, and left. The expansion also doesn't seem to stop when multiple azure areas combine. The expansion should also happen simultaneously from all azure pixels and should stop at either yellow or the boundary.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to how the azure expands and what limits its expansion.\n2.  **Refine Expansion Logic:** Update the code to allow for bidirectional expansion (up, down, left, right).\n3. **Simultaneous Expansion:** Implement simultaneous expansion in a step by step method from all azure pixels.\n4.  **Stopping Condition:** Expand only to adjacent white cells and stop at the edge of the grid and yellow cells.\n5. **Update natural language program:** Describe the transformation with full details on constraints and behaviours.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nTo gather metrics, I'll use `code_execution` to generate reports of relevant features. I am interested in: the initial position of azure and yellow objects, the size of the initial object, the size of the expanded object, and the edge constraints. Because of the text format of the response, I will not use any graphing tools in the `code_execution`, focusing on tabular data reports.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_object(grid, color):\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    return coords\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    azure_coords_in = find_object(input_grid, 8)\n    yellow_coords_in = find_object(input_grid, 4)\n    azure_coords_out = find_object(output_grid, 8)\n\n    print(\"Input Grid:\")\n    print(input_grid)\n    print(\"Output Grid:\")\n    print(output_grid)\n\n    print(\"\\nAzure Object Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"  Initial Coordinates: {azure_coords_in}\")\n    print(f\"  Initial Size: {len(azure_coords_in)} pixels\")\n    print(f\"  Output Coordinates: {azure_coords_out}\")\n    print(f\"  Output Size: {len(azure_coords_out)} pixels\")\n\n    print(\"\\nYellow Object Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"  Coordinates: {yellow_coords_in}\")\n    print(f\"  Size: {len(yellow_coords_in)} pixels\")\n\n    print(\"\\nGrid Boundaries:\")\n    print(f\"  Height: {input_grid.shape[0]}, Width: {input_grid.shape[1]}\")\n\n# example_data is not available here, so it cannot execute\n#for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(example_data):\n#    print(f\"\\n--- Example {i+1} ---\")\n#    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)\n\n#Mock the data to validate that the analysis script works\nmock_input = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0],[0,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4],[0,0,0,0,0]])\nmock_output = np.array([[0,8,8,0,0],[8,8,8,0,4],[0,8,8,0,4],[0,0,0,0,0]])\n\nanalyze_example(mock_input, mock_output)\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: azure_object\n    color: 8\n    behavior: expands\n    constraints: [yellow_object, grid_boundary]\n  - name: yellow_object\n    color: 4\n    behavior: stationary\n    constraints: []\n\nactions:\n  - name: expansion\n    description: The azure object expands into adjacent white cells.\n    directions: [up, down, left, right]\n    stopping_conditions:\n      - type: color\n        value: 4  # Yellow\n      - type: boundary\n        value: grid_edge\n    propagation: simultaneous\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe azure (8) object expands simultaneously in all directions (up, down, left, and right) into adjacent empty (white, 0) cells. The expansion stops when the expanding azure object encounters either a yellow (4) object or the edge of the grid. Yellow objects do not move. The expansion propagates such that all azure pixels expand to adjacent white cells at each step.\n"
