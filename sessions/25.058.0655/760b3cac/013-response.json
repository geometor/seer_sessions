Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. The transformation seems to involve manipulating these blocks, specifically the azure (8) colored blocks, while the yellow (4) colored block stays unchanged. There's a shift or duplication of the azure blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
