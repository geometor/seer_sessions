            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple observation: extending an azure shape to the right. While this worked for the first example, subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule. The core issue is that the extension isn't simply \"one pixel to the right\" but rather a conditional extension that depends on the presence of yellow pixels and the boundaries of the grid. The yellow shape doesn't remain entirely constant as there is some interaction in play.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, I'll examine the input, expected output, and actual output of the `transform` function. I will use code execution to verify assumptions about the input and outputs.\n2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** I'll pinpoint exactly where the actual output differs from the expected output. This will highlight the flaws in the current logic.\n3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the discrepancies, I'll adjust the natural language program to incorporate the observed behavior, focusing on the interaction between the azure and yellow objects.\n4.  **YAML Documentation:** I'll create a YAML block summarizing key observations, object properties, and actions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo effectively analyze each training example, I'll use a consistent approach that includes a summary, code to determine key attributes, and an observation of how the current program produces errors.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Summary:** The initial observation and code were developed from this example, so the transform performs as expected. Azure extends to the right.\n*   Metrics:\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    input_grid = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]])\n    expected_output = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]])\n    actual_output = transform(input_grid)\n\n    # check to see if they are equal\n    print(np.array_equal(expected_output,actual_output))\n    # show where they are not equal\n    print(np.where(expected_output != actual_output))\n    # find azure\n    print(f\"Azure: {np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)}\")\n    # find yellow\n    print(f\"Yellow: {np.argwhere(input_grid == 4)}\")\n\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    True\n    (array([], dtype=int64), array([], dtype=int64))\n    Azure: [[8 0]\n    [8 1]\n    [8 2]\n    [8 3]\n    [8 4]\n    [8 5]\n    [8 6]\n    [8 7]\n    [8 8]\n    [8 9]\n    [9 0]\n    [9 1]\n    [9 2]\n    [9 3]\n    [9 4]\n    [9 5]\n    [9 6]\n    [9 7]\n    [9 8]\n    [9 9]]\n    Yellow: [[4 4]\n    [4 5]\n    [4 6]\n    [5 4]\n    [5 5]\n    [5 6]\n    [6 4]\n    [6 5]\n    [6 6]]\n    ```\n*   Observation: The code works as expected for this case.\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Summary:** Azure extends to the right until blocked by the yellow object. Yellow shape remains in place.\n*   Metrics:\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    input_grid = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]])\n    expected_output = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0],[0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0],[0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0]])\n    actual_output = transform(input_grid)\n\n    print(np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output))\n    print(np.where(expected_output != actual_output))\n    print(f\"Azure: {np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)}\")\n    print(f\"Yellow: {np.argwhere(input_grid == 4)}\")\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    False\n    (array([7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]), array([2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3]))\n    Azure: [[7 0]\n    [7 1]\n    [7 2]\n    [7 3]\n    [7 4]\n    [7 5]\n    [8 0]\n    [8 1]\n    [8 2]\n    [8 3]\n    [8 4]\n    [8 5]\n    [9 0]\n    [9 1]\n    [9 2]\n    [9 3]\n    [9 4]\n    [9 5]]\n    Yellow: [[2 3]\n    [2 4]\n    [2 5]\n    [3 3]\n    [3 4]\n    [3 5]\n    [4 3]\n    [4 4]\n    [4 5]]\n\n    ```\n*   Observation: The azure extends all the way to the edge. The yellow object prevents further extension, but the program does not recognize this and extends azure anyway, overwriting the empty space.\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*   **Summary:** The azure shape expands to the right and down, filling the available space adjacent to its initial position, stopping when it encounters the yellow shape or the grid boundaries.\n*   Metrics:\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    input_grid = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]])\n    expected_output = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]])\n    actual_output = transform(input_grid)\n\n    print(np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output))\n    print(np.where(expected_output != actual_output))\n    print(f\"Azure: {np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)}\")\n    print(f\"Yellow: {np.argwhere(input_grid == 4)}\")\n\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    False\n    (array([7, 8, 9]), array([1, 1, 1]))\n    Azure: [[7 0]\n    [7 1]\n    [7 2]\n    [8 0]\n    [8 1]\n    [8 2]\n    [9 0]\n    [9 1]\n    [9 2]]\n    Yellow: [[3 3]\n    [3 4]\n    [3 5]\n    [4 3]\n    [4 4]\n    [4 5]\n    [5 3]\n    [5 4]\n    [5 5]]\n    ```\n*   Observation: The azure should only extend one space to the right on each row. Currently it only changes the first column next to the original object.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: azure (8)\n    shape: variable, initially rectangular\n    behavior: expands right and down, filling adjacent white (0) cells\n    constraints:\n      - blocked by yellow (4) objects\n      - blocked by grid boundaries\n  - color: yellow (4)\n    shape: variable, rectangular\n    behavior: remains stationary, acts as a barrier\n    constraints: []\n\nactions:\n  - type: expansion\n    actor: azure object\n    direction: right and down\n    condition: adjacent cell is white (0) AND not blocked\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the azure (8) and yellow (4) colored objects within the input grid.\n2.  **Expansion:** The azure object expands.\n3. **Expansion direction:** The azure object expands into adjacent empty (white, 0) cells to the right and down.\n4.  **Constraints:** The expansion stops when the azure object encounters either a yellow (4) object or the edge of the grid.\n5. **Yellow Object:** Yellow objects do not move.\n\nThis natural language program captures the interaction between the azure and yellow objects and incorporates the constraints observed in the training examples. The key improvement is recognizing the \"blocking\" behavior of the yellow object and the grid boundaries, and specifying right AND down expansion.\n"
