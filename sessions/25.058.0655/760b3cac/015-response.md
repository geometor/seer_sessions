Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program and strategy.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made specific assumptions about the transformation: it assumed there would always be one azure block and one yellow block, and that the azure block would always be duplicated and shifted left by one and two positions. The results across all training examples show this is not universally true.  The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example and didn't generalize. We need a more flexible approach that accounts for variations in object presence, shape, and transformation rules across different examples.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function seems generally sound, correctly identifying contiguous blocks of the same color. We'll keep this, but need to avoid hardcoding assumptions about specific colors (like 8 and 4).
2.  **Transformation Logic:** Instead of assuming a fixed shift, we need to analyze the relationship between the input and output positions of *each* object *within each example*. This involves comparing the coordinates of objects in the input and output grids.
3.  **Generalized Rules:** We'll aim to derive rules that describe the transformation in terms of relative changes (e.g., "move each pixel of the object one step to the left and one down") or pattern replication, rather than absolute positions.
4. **Handle edge cases:** We need to check the grid boundaries during the transforms to confirm our output grid respects the bounds.

**Metrics and Observations (Example-Specific):**

To get precise information, I'll build strings to print, which will use the provided example information.

```tool_code
def grid_to_string(grid):
    return '\\n'.join(''.join(str(cell) for cell in row) for row in grid)

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    return grid_to_string(grid1) + '\\n\\n' + grid_to_string(grid2)
