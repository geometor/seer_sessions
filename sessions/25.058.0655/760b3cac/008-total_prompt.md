## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7C75138261D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0 8
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).  The input grid appears to have two distinct objects or shapes, one formed by azure pixels and the other by yellow pixels. The output grid has a modified azure shape and maintains an unmodified yellow. The azure shape undergoes a transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_shape
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: top_center
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - irregular shape
    actions:
      - extends_right
  - id: yellow_shape
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: bottom_center
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - T-shape
    actions:
      - none # Remains unchanged
relationships:
  - azure_shape is_above yellow_shape
  - azure_shape and yellow_shape are_vertically_aligned

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous azure (8) shape and the contiguous yellow (4) shape within the input grid.

2.  **Azure Shape Transformation:** Extend the azure shape to the right. For every azure pixel at grid location \[row, column], check to see if the input grid location \[row, column+1] equals zero.
    *   If true, extend the azure shape by changing the pixel color from 0 to 8 for every instance on the azure shape.

3.  **Yellow Shape Preservation:** The yellow shape remains unchanged.

4. **Output construction:** Output the updated shape locations.

In essence, the transformation rule is to extend the azure shape to the right by one pixel where possible, while keeping the yellow shape constant.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
