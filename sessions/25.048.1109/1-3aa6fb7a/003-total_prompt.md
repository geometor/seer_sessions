Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two L-shaped objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: "Two L-shaped objects"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: "Two single-cell objects"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can observe two L-shaped objects composed of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Detect Changed Pixels**
    - Find pixels on the right side of the top-left azure L. Change the color of the pixel to blue (color 1).
    - Find pixels on the left side of the down-right azure L. Change the color of the pixel to blue (color 1).

3.  **Construct Output:** The output grid retains all azure colored pixels, except the specified two pixels which become blue.

**Elaborated Description of the Rule**

The transformation rule preserves most of the azure pixels, and adding two blue pixels, each one at specific relative positions related with the two initial L-shaped objects.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule preserves most of the azure pixels, and adds two blue pixels, each one at specific relative positions related with the two initial L-shaped objects.
Specifically, one blue pixel is placed to the immediate right of the top-left L-shaped object, and another blue pixel is placed to the immediate left of the bottom-right L-shaped object.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
