Each number in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding number in the output grid. The spatial structure (3x3 grid) remains constant. The transformation is a simple arithmetic operation applied element-wise. The strategy is to observe this numerical relationship and express it in a natural language program and later confirm as a python function.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n"
