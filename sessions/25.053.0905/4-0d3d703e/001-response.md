Here's a breakdown of the provided input-output example, along with a strategy, observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves a simple transformation of a 3x3 grid. Each number in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding number in the output grid. The spatial structure (3x3 grid) remains constant. The transformation is a simple arithmetic operation applied element-wise. The strategy is to observe this numerical relationship and express it in a natural language program and later confirm as a python function.

**Metrics and Observations:**




*code_execution:*

```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [3, 1, 2],
    [3, 1, 2],
    [3, 1, 2]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [4, 5, 6],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [4, 5, 6]
])

# Check if the shapes are the same
shapes_equal = input_grid.shape == output_grid.shape
print(f"{shapes_equal=}")

# Calculate the difference between corresponding elements
difference = output_grid - input_grid
print(f"{difference=}")

# Check if the differences are all the same
all_differences_equal = np.all(difference == difference[0,0])
print(f"{all_differences_equal=}")



```


*code_execution_result:*

outcome: 1

```
shapes_equal=True
difference=array([[1, 4, 4],
       [1, 4, 4],
       [1, 4, 4]])
all_differences_equal=np.False_

```

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3).
  - observation: Each element in the output grid is derived from the corresponding element in the input grid.
  - observation: The relationship seems to be a simple addition.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]
  - action: element_wise_addition
    description: Add a constant value to each element of the input grid.
    parameters:
        constant: value is dependent of original value of cell
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of numbers.
2.  **Transformation:** For each number in the input grid, add a value that is specific to the original value of that number . Specifically, add 1 to all cells of value 3; add 4 to all cells with the original value 1; add 4 to all cells with the original value 2.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of numbers, where each number is the result of the addition performed in step 2.
