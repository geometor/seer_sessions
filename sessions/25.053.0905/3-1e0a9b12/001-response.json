It appears there's some rearrangement and/or combination of the input elements to form the output. There are no obvious, simple arithmetic operations that connect them directly. The number of non-zero elements changes, and their positions also change. It does not appear to be a rotation or reflection. It is more likely some kind of sorting or conditional placement based on original position.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Treat each contiguous block of non-zero pixels of the same color as an \"object\".\n2.  **Property Analysis:** For each object, note its color (value), position (row, column), size, and shape.\n3.  **Transformation Tracking:** Carefully compare the properties of objects in the input and output. Look for patterns in how these properties change or remain the same. Specifically, I'll be looking at relative positions and order.\n4.  **Rule Hypothesis:** Based on observed changes, formulate a hypothesis about the transformation rule.\n5.  **Rule Refinement:** (In later steps) Use additional examples to refine and validate the rule.\n\n**Metrics and Initial Observations (using manual inspection for now, will use code later):**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Four non-zero values: 4 (yellow), 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), 1 (blue)\n    * values appear on the top, and bottom rows and middle rows\n    * all columns contain at least one non-zero value\n\n*   **Output:**\n    *   Four non-zero values: 4 (yellow), 1 (blue), 4 (yellow), 6(magenta), 9(maroon)\n    *   Non-zero values are grouped at the bottom two rows.\n    *   The sequence `1 4 6 9` appears in the bottom row\n    *   Zero values fill other places.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Place the sorted values in the bottom row of the output grid, starting from the leftmost column.\n4.  Maintain the original row order relationship of duplicate values in the input to the output. For instance, a value in a higher row in the input should be positioned above other instances of that same number in the output.\n5. Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with zeros.\n"
