            "text": "Okay, here's my assessment of the third provided input-output example:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example further reinforces the \"column-wise stacking\" transformation observed in the previous examples. It's a 5x5 grid with a mix of zeros and non-zero values. The output shows a clear downward stacking of the non-zero values *within their respective columns*. The relative vertical order within each column is preserved. Values in columns that were all zeros in the input stay as zeros, showing that the operation occurs on a per-column basis.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy remains consistent:\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Treat each non-zero pixel as an individual object. Since there are no contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels of the same color, this simplification is valid.\n2.  **Property Analysis:** Track the value (color) and position (row, column) of each object. The key property here is the column index, as the transformation seems to be column-specific.\n3.  **Transformation Tracking:** Observe how the row index of each object changes (or doesn't) within its column. Confirm that the relative vertical order within each column is maintained.\n4.  **Rule Hypothesis:** Refine the hypothesis (if needed, but it's likely already accurate) to ensure it clearly describes the column-wise stacking behavior.\n5.  **Rule Refinement:** (In later steps, if needed)\n\n**Metrics and Initial Observations:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Six non-zero values: 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 6\n    *   Values distributed across various rows and columns.\n    *   Columns 0, 1, and 3 have non-zero values; columns 2 and 4 are all zeros.\n\n*   **Output:**\n    *   Six non-zero values: 3, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2\n    *   Non-zero values are stacked downwards within their original columns.\n    *   Columns 2 and 4 remain all zeros.\n    *   The vertical order within each column is preserved (e.g., in column 1, the two 3s remain stacked in the same order).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
