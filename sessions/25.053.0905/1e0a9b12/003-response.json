            "text": "Okay, here's my assessment of the second provided input-output example and my plan to figure out the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example is more complex than the first. It involves a 6x6 grid, and there are more non-zero values. The output grid has most, but not all, of the non-zero values from the input grid present, and there's a definite vertical stacking effect, similar to the first. The key difference seems to be that not *all* non-zero values are moved to the bottom-most row; some values stay in their original rows, or are placed in rows above. There are duplicates in the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Same as before - each contiguous block of non-zero pixels of the same color is an \"object.\"\n2.  **Property Analysis:** Again, track color (value), position (row, column), size, and shape of each object. Pay close attention to duplicate values and their relative vertical positions.\n3.  **Transformation Tracking:** Compare the properties of objects between input and output. Focus on:\n    *   Which objects are moved?\n    *   Which objects remain in place (or relatively in place)?\n    *   How are duplicates handled? Is there a consistent rule for which duplicate gets placed where?\n    * Is there a vertical sorting component?\n    * Are columns preserved?\n4.  **Rule Hypothesis:** Formulate a more refined hypothesis that accounts for the observed changes, especially the selective placement and handling of duplicates.\n5.  **Rule Refinement:** Continue to analyze to find the detailed rules\n\n**Metrics and Initial Observations (using manual inspection for now, will use code later):**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Nine non-zero values: 9, 8, 4, 4, 7, 8, 4, 7, 0\n    *   Values appear across multiple rows and columns.\n    *   Duplicates of 4, 7 and 8.\n    *   A column has three 4s.\n\n*   **Output:**\n    *   Nine non-zero values: 4, 4, 7, 8, 4, 7, 8, 9\n    *   Values are stacked vertically.\n    *   Duplicates maintain a similar vertical order.\n    * The value '9' only appears at the bottom-right\n    * Columns with multiple values in the input are largely preserved in the output, stacking them in place.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
