            "text": "Okay, here's the analysis of the third example pair:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example further solidifies the established pattern. We observe a red (2) pixel and a blue (1) pixel in the input grid.  The output grid shows the red pixel remaining with the addition of yellow (4) pixels in a \"plus\" shape around it, and the blue pixel remaining with the addition of orange (7) pixels in a \"plus\" shape around *it*.  There's also a magenta (6) pixel which, like the azure (8) pixel in the previous example, remains unchanged. This confirms that the transformation rule applies *specifically* to red and blue pixels, leaving other colors untouched. The strategy remains consistent: identify red and blue pixels and apply the \"plus-shaped\" addition of yellow and orange pixels, respectively.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   One red pixel (value 2).\n    *   One blue pixel (value 1).\n    *   One magenta pixel (value 6)\n    *   The rest are white (value 0).\n*   **Output:**\n    *   The red pixel remains.\n    *   Yellow pixels form a cross centered on the red pixel\n    *   The blue pixel remains.\n    *  Orange pixels form a cross centered on the blue pixel.\n    *   The magenta pixel is unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
