            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for this second example pair:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example reinforces the pattern observed in the first pair, but with more instances of the colored pixels. We see the same red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input, and the corresponding yellow (4) and orange (7) \"cross\" patterns around them in the output. Additionally, there's a new azure (8) pixel in the input that doesn't seem to be affected or generate any new colors in the output. This suggests that the transformation rule is specific to red and blue pixels. The strategy remains the same: identify red/blue pixels, and apply the \"cross\" addition rule for yellow and orange.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Two red pixels (value 2).\n    *   Two blue pixels (value 1).\n    *   One azure pixel (value 8)\n    *   The rest are white (value 0).\n*   **Output:**\n    *   The red pixels remain.\n    *   Yellow pixels appear around the area of red pixels, in cross shapes\n    *    The blue pixels remain\n    *   Orange pixels appear around and within the blue pixels, in a cross shape\n    *    Azure pixel remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
