Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for this second example pair:

**General Assessment:**

This example reinforces the pattern observed in the first pair, but with more instances of the colored pixels. We see the same red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input, and the corresponding yellow (4) and orange (7) "cross" patterns around them in the output. Additionally, there's a new azure (8) pixel in the input that doesn't seem to be affected or generate any new colors in the output. This suggests that the transformation rule is specific to red and blue pixels. The strategy remains the same: identify red/blue pixels, and apply the "cross" addition rule for yellow and orange.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Two red pixels (value 2).
    *   Two blue pixels (value 1).
    *   One azure pixel (value 8)
    *   The rest are white (value 0).
*   **Output:**
    *   The red pixels remain.
    *   Yellow pixels appear around the area of red pixels, in cross shapes
    *    The blue pixels remain
    *   Orange pixels appear around and within the blue pixels, in a cross shape
    *    Azure pixel remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**



```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
  - color: azure
    value: 8
    position: [(0, 3)]
output_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
    - color: azure
      value: 8
      position: [(0,3)]
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
  - color: orange
    value: 7
    positions: [(2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]

transformations:
    - type: "add yellow"
      around: red
      shape: plus shape, radius one
    - type: "add orange"
      around: blue
      shape: plus shape, radius one
    - type: "ignore azure" #explicitly note untouched
      color: azure
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve:** Keep all original red, blue, and azure pixels in their original locations.
2.  **Add Yellow:** For each red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.
3.  **Add Orange:** For each blue pixel, add an orange pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.

The program is identical to the previous example, with the addition of explicitly ignoring (preserving) the azure pixel. This confirms the core rule.



```python
"""
1. Preserve: Keep all original red, blue and azure pixels in their original locations.
2. Add Yellow: For each red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.
3. Add Orange: For each blue pixel, add an orange pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.
