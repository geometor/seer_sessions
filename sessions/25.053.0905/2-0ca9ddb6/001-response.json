            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for this task:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a few isolated pixels of different colors (red and blue in this example), while the output grid introduces new colors (yellow, orange) and expands some of the existing colors into patterns. The background remains white (0). My strategy will be to:\n\n1.  Identify the colored pixels in the input grid.\n2.  Analyze their positions and colors.\n3.  Look for relationships between input pixel positions/colors and the new/modified pixels in the output grid.\n4.  Formulate a rule that explains the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code later to confirm):**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   One red pixel (value 2).\n    *   One blue pixel (value 1).\n    *   The rest are white (value 0).\n*   **Output:**\n    *   The red pixel remains.\n    *   Yellow pixels appear around the area of red pixel\n    *    The blue pixel remains\n    *   Orange pixels appear around and within the blue pixel\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
