Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for this task:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a few isolated pixels of different colors (red and blue in this example), while the output grid introduces new colors (yellow, orange) and expands some of the existing colors into patterns. The background remains white (0). My strategy will be to:

1.  Identify the colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  Analyze their positions and colors.
3.  Look for relationships between input pixel positions/colors and the new/modified pixels in the output grid.
4.  Formulate a rule that explains the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations (using code later to confirm):**

*   **Input:**
    *   One red pixel (value 2).
    *   One blue pixel (value 1).
    *   The rest are white (value 0).
*   **Output:**
    *   The red pixel remains.
    *   Yellow pixels appear around the area of red pixel
    *    The blue pixel remains
    *   Orange pixels appear around and within the blue pixel

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    position: (3, 2)  # (row, column) - 0-indexed
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    position: (6, 6)
output_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    position: (3, 2)
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    position: (6, 6)
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
  - color: orange
    value: 7
    positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]

transformations:
    - type: "add yellow"
      around: red
      shape: plus shape, radius one
    - type: "add orange"
      around: blue
      shape: plus shape, radius one

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve:** Keep all original red and blue pixels in their original locations.
2.  **Add Yellow:** For the red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.
3.  **Add Orange:** For the blue pixel, add a orange pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.

Essentially, a cross of yellow pixels is added and centered around the original red pixel and an orange cross is added at the original blue pixel.

```python
"""
1. Preserve: Keep all original red and blue pixels in their original locations.
2. Add Yellow: For the red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.
3. Add Orange: For the blue pixel, add a orange pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for this second example pair:

**General Assessment:**

This example reinforces the pattern observed in the first pair, but with more instances of the colored pixels. We see the same red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input, and the corresponding yellow (4) and orange (7) "cross" patterns around them in the output. Additionally, there's a new azure (8) pixel in the input that doesn't seem to be affected or generate any new colors in the output. This suggests that the transformation rule is specific to red and blue pixels. The strategy remains the same: identify red/blue pixels, and apply the "cross" addition rule for yellow and orange.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Two red pixels (value 2).
    *   Two blue pixels (value 1).
    *   One azure pixel (value 8)
    *   The rest are white (value 0).
*   **Output:**
    *   The red pixels remain.
    *   Yellow pixels appear around the area of red pixels, in cross shapes
    *    The blue pixels remain
    *   Orange pixels appear around and within the blue pixels, in a cross shape
    *    Azure pixel remains unchanged.

3.  **Add Orange:** For each blue pixel, add an orange pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.

The program is identical to the previous example, with the addition of explicitly ignoring (preserving) the azure pixel. This confirms the core rule.

Okay, here's the analysis of the third example pair:

**General Assessment:**

This example further solidifies the established pattern. We observe a red (2) pixel and a blue (1) pixel in the input grid.  The output grid shows the red pixel remaining with the addition of yellow (4) pixels in a "plus" shape around it, and the blue pixel remaining with the addition of orange (7) pixels in a "plus" shape around *it*.  There's also a magenta (6) pixel which, like the azure (8) pixel in the previous example, remains unchanged. This confirms that the transformation rule applies *specifically* to red and blue pixels, leaving other colors untouched. The strategy remains consistent: identify red and blue pixels and apply the "plus-shaped" addition of yellow and orange pixels, respectively.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input:**
    *   One red pixel (value 2).
    *   One blue pixel (value 1).
    *   One magenta pixel (value 6)
    *   The rest are white (value 0).
*   **Output:**
    *   The red pixel remains.
    *   Yellow pixels form a cross centered on the red pixel
    *   The blue pixel remains.
    *  Orange pixels form a cross centered on the blue pixel.
    *   The magenta pixel is unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

3.  **Add Orange:** For each blue pixel, add an orange pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.

The program remains consistent, solidifying the identified transformation rule. The "ignore" rule is generalized to magenta, but it's likely that *any* color other than red or blue is simply preserved.


```python
"""

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
