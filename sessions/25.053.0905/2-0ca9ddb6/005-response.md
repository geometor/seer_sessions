Okay, here's the analysis of the third example pair:

**General Assessment:**

This example further solidifies the established pattern. We observe a red (2) pixel and a blue (1) pixel in the input grid.  The output grid shows the red pixel remaining with the addition of yellow (4) pixels in a "plus" shape around it, and the blue pixel remaining with the addition of orange (7) pixels in a "plus" shape around *it*.  There's also a magenta (6) pixel which, like the azure (8) pixel in the previous example, remains unchanged. This confirms that the transformation rule applies *specifically* to red and blue pixels, leaving other colors untouched. The strategy remains consistent: identify red and blue pixels and apply the "plus-shaped" addition of yellow and orange pixels, respectively.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input:**
    *   One red pixel (value 2).
    *   One blue pixel (value 1).
    *   One magenta pixel (value 6)
    *   The rest are white (value 0).
*   **Output:**
    *   The red pixel remains.
    *   Yellow pixels form a cross centered on the red pixel
    *   The blue pixel remains.
    *  Orange pixels form a cross centered on the blue pixel.
    *   The magenta pixel is unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**



```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    position: (2, 2)
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    position: (7, 3)
  - color: magenta
    value: 6
    position: (5,6)
output_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    position: (2, 2)
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    position: (7, 3)
   - color: magenta
     value: 6
     position: (5,6)
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    positions:  [(1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3)]
  - color: orange
    value: 7
    positions: [(6,3), (7,2), (7,4), (8,3)]

transformations:
    - type: "add yellow"
      around: red
      shape: plus shape, radius one
    - type: "add orange"
      around: blue
      shape: plus shape, radius one
    - type: "ignore magenta"
      color: magenta
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve:** Keep all original red, blue, and magenta pixels in their original locations.
2.  **Add Yellow:** For each red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.
3.  **Add Orange:** For each blue pixel, add an orange pixel one step above, one step below, one to the left, and one to the right.

The program remains consistent, solidifying the identified transformation rule. The "ignore" rule is generalized to magenta, but it's likely that *any* color other than red or blue is simply preserved.



```python
"""
