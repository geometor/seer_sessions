Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for this task:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a few isolated pixels of different colors (red and blue in this example), while the output grid introduces new colors (yellow, orange) and expands some of the existing colors into patterns. The background remains white (0). My strategy will be to:

1.  Identify the colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  Analyze their positions and colors.
3.  Look for relationships between input pixel positions/colors and the new/modified pixels in the output grid.
4.  Formulate a rule that explains the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations (using code later to confirm):**

*   **Input:**
    *   One red pixel (value 2).
    *   One blue pixel (value 1).
    *   The rest are white (value 0).
*   **Output:**
    *   The red pixel remains.
    *   Yellow pixels appear around the area of red pixel
    *    The blue pixel remains
    *   Orange pixels appear around and within the blue pixel

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    position: (3, 2)  # (row, column) - 0-indexed
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    position: (6, 6)
output_objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    position: (3, 2)
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    position: (6, 6)
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
  - color: orange
    value: 7
    positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]

transformations:
    - type: "add yellow"
      around: red
      shape: plus shape, radius one
    - type: "add orange"
      around: blue
      shape: plus shape, radius one

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve:** Keep all original red and blue pixels in their original locations.
2.  **Add Yellow:** For the red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.
3.  **Add Orange:** For the blue pixel, add a orange pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.

Essentially, a cross of yellow pixels is added and centered around the original red pixel and an orange cross is added at the original blue pixel.

```python
"""
1. Preserve: Keep all original red and blue pixels in their original locations.
2. Add Yellow: For the red pixel, add a yellow pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.
3. Add Orange: For the blue pixel, add a orange pixel one step above, one step below and on each side.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

above is an example pair for a task

this is your opportunity to perceive the underlying logic that transforms the
input into the output

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.


your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a conversation
