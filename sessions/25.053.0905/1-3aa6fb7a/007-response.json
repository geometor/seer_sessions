            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this second example pair, building upon the insights from the first.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example appears to follow the same core rule as the first example: adding blue (1) pixels to the right of azure (8) pixels under specific conditions. However, the arrangement of azure pixels is different, providing more context to refine our understanding of the \"border\" condition. We need to ensure our logic correctly handles cases where azure pixels are adjacent and form different shapes. The strategy remains the same: identify azure pixels, check the right-neighbor condition, and the border condition, and then place blue pixels accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Colors: Black (0), Azure (8)\n    *   Azure pixel coordinates: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)\n*   **Output Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Colors: Black (0), Azure (8), Blue (1)\n    *   Azure pixel coordinates: *Same as input*\n    *   Blue pixel coordinates: (1,4), (2,3), (5,3)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The critical aspect is the precise definition of the \"border\" which the python code should do an effective job.\n"
