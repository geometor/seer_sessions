            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the interaction between azure and black pixels, it didn't accurately capture the spatial relationship and the \"insertion\" aspect. The code inserts blue pixels *adjacent* to black pixels that are to the right of azure, but it isn't inserting them in the correct configuration. It also has issues at boundaries.\n\nThe primary issue is that the code adds a blue pixel next to any black pixel that's next to azure, instead of *only* at the boundary of the azure object, and to the right. Also, it seems that a blue should be inserted even if a black is not.\n\nStrategy:\n1. **Refine Object Identification:** The `get_objects` function seems sound, so we will retain that.\n2. **Improve Boundary Detection:** The current 'is_border' check inside the loop is not efficient. Instead, after getting azure objects, find the rightmost pixels of *each* azure object.\n3. **Precise Insertion Logic:** Change insertion logic to add blue to the right of the rightmost azure in each object.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations and code execution results:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Two azure objects, two black objects.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels inserted to the right of the rightmost azure pixels of each object.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Blue pixels are incorrectly placed, too far to the right.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 5 (Indicates incorrect placement)\n    *    `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *  `correct_pixel_counts`:False\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Three azure objects.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels inserted to the right of the rightmost azure pixels.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Blue pixels are misplaced and occur next to the black as well as at boundary.\n*    **Metrics:**\n    *    `pixels_off`: 8\n     *    `size_correct`: True\n    *  `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *  `correct_pixel_counts`: False\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: 002\n  - objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        description: Contiguous regions of azure pixels. Multiple objects can exist.\n        properties:\n          - rightmost_pixel: The pixel within an azure object with the largest column index.\n      - color: blue (1)\n        description: inserted pixels.\n        properties:\n          - insertion_rule: Inserted to the immediate right of the rightmost pixel of each azure object.\n      - color: black (0)\n        description: Appears to be filler.  It's presences does not affect the transformation.\n        properties:\n          - role: No direct role in the transformation rule discovered so far.\n\n  - actions:\n      - name: insert_blue\n        description: Insert a blue pixel.\n        parameters:\n          - location: Immediately to the right of the rightmost pixel of each azure object.\n        constraints:\n          - Only insert if the position is within grid bounds.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Find Rightmost Pixels:** For each azure object, determine the pixel(s) with the largest column index (the rightmost pixel of that object).\n3.  **Insert Blue Pixels:** For each rightmost azure pixel, insert a blue (color 1) pixel immediately to its right in the output grid.  Do not insert if this would place a pixel outside of the grid boundaries.\n4.  **Copy Other Pixels** Copy all pixels from input to output, except where blue pixels are inserted.\n\nThis refined natural language program addresses the observed errors by focusing on the rightmost edge of the azure objects, not simply any azure pixel adjacent to black, and clarifies the insertion mechanism.\n"
