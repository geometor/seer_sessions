The primary change appears to be the introduction of the color blue (represented by '1') in specific locations relative to existing azure (represented by '8') pixels. The strategy will be to identify the spatial relationship between the azure pixels in the input and the placement of the new blue pixels in the output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, no code execution needed for this simple case):**\n\n*   **Input Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Colors present: Black (0), Azure (8)\n    *   Azure pixel coordinates: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n*   **Output Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Colors present: Black (0), Azure (8), Blue (1)\n    *   Azure pixel coordinates: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) - *Same as input*\n    *   Blue pixel coordinates: (1,2), (4,4)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
