Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for the provided input-output example:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves a grid transformation where the input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The primary change appears to be the introduction of the color blue (represented by '1') in specific locations relative to existing azure (represented by '8') pixels. The strategy will be to identify the spatial relationship between the azure pixels in the input and the placement of the new blue pixels in the output.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, no code execution needed for this simple case):**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: 7x7
    *   Colors present: Black (0), Azure (8)
    *   Azure pixel coordinates: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: 7x7
    *   Colors present: Black (0), Azure (8), Blue (1)
    *   Azure pixel coordinates: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) - *Same as input*
    *   Blue pixel coordinates: (1,2), (4,4)

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8  # Azure
    shape: irregular
    coordinates: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5]] # using row, col indexing

output_objects:
    - color: 8
      coordinates: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1
      coordinates: [[1,2], [4,4]]

transformations:
    - action: add
      color: 1  #Blue
      relative_position: "one pixel to the right, if its a border pixel and direction is free"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Borders:** Examine the input grid and locate all azure (8) pixels.
2. **Check Border Condition** For an azure pixel, if there is a black pixel to the immediate right, it's marked to add a pixel.
3. **Add a blue pixel**: If an azure pixel is marked and it's at the border of the azure colored object, insert a blue (1) pixel.

In simple words: Scan the input. If an azure pixel has a black pixel to its immediate right, and the azure pixel is at the right border of an azure area, insert a blue pixel to the right of the azure pixel in the output grid.
