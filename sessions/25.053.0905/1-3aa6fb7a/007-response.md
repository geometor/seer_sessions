Okay, let's analyze this second example pair, building upon the insights from the first.

**General Assessment:**

This example appears to follow the same core rule as the first example: adding blue (1) pixels to the right of azure (8) pixels under specific conditions. However, the arrangement of azure pixels is different, providing more context to refine our understanding of the "border" condition. We need to ensure our logic correctly handles cases where azure pixels are adjacent and form different shapes. The strategy remains the same: identify azure pixels, check the right-neighbor condition, and the border condition, and then place blue pixels accordingly.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: 7x7
    *   Colors: Black (0), Azure (8)
    *   Azure pixel coordinates: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: 7x7
    *   Colors: Black (0), Azure (8), Blue (1)
    *   Azure pixel coordinates: *Same as input*
    *   Blue pixel coordinates: (1,4), (2,3), (5,3)

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8  # Azure
    shape: irregular
    coordinates: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3], [5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]

output_objects:
    - color: 8
      coordinates: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3], [5,4], [6,3], [6,4]]
    - color: 1
      coordinates: [[1,4], [2,3], [5,3]]

transformations:
    - action: add
      color: 1  # Blue
      relative_position: "one pixel to the right, if its a border pixel and the direction is free"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check Right Neighbor:** For each azure pixel, check if the pixel immediately to its right is black (0).
3.  **Border Condition Check:** If the right neighbor is black (0), determine if current azure is at the border of other azure pixels (there's no other azure color at the right).
4.  **Place Blue Pixel:** If *both* conditions (right neighbor is black AND it is a border pixel) are true, place a blue (1) pixel in the corresponding position in the output grid.

The natural language program is essentially the same as the previous. The critical aspect is the precise definition of the "border" which the python code should do an effective job.
