I need to analyze the given input and output grids, determine the transformation rule, and then express that rule in both natural language and Python code. Here's my initial analysis and plan:\n\n**Initial Analysis:**\n\n*   The input and output grids are 7x7 matrices.\n*   The input grid contains `0`s and `8`s.\n*   The output grid contains `0`s, `1`s and `8`s.\n*   It seems that some `0`s in the input grid are replaced by `1`s in the output grid. The `8`'s remain unchanged.\n*   I need to figure out the logic that determines which `0`s are changed to `1`s. It appears to be based on proximity to `8`.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\nZeros adjacent to eights are transformed to one.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Natural Language Description:** Write a clear and concise description of the transformation rule in natural language. This will serve as the docstring for the Python module.\n2.  **Python Code:**\n    *   Create a `transform` function that takes the input grid as a list of lists.\n    *   Initialize an output grid identical to the input grid.\n    *   Iterate through the input grid.\n    *   For each cell, check if it's a `0`.\n    *   If it is a `0`, check its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).\n    *   If any neighbor is an `8`, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to `1`.\n    *   Return the modified output grid.\n3.  **Testing:**\n    *   Create an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.\n    *   Define the given input grid.\n    *   Define the given expected output grid.\n    *   Call the `transform` function with the input grid.\n    *   Assert that the returned output matches the expected output.\n\nNow, I'll generate the code.\n\n"
