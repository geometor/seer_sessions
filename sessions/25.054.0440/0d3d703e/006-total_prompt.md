Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was on the right track with incrementing and applying modulo 10. However, the value replacement mapping is incorrect and needs adjustment. The errors in Examples 3 and 4 clearly indicate that replacement is not consistent with all examples. We need to re-examine all examples to determine the correct, consistent mapping.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input/output pairs to derive the correct mapping.
2.  **Correct Mapping:** define the correct mapping.
3. **Metrics**: calculate how many pixels would have been correct with the increment step, but no mapping.
4.  **YAML and Program:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program.

**Metrics:**

For the "increment and modulo" hypothesis, the output pixel values would be:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `3 1 2`
    *   Expected Output: `4 5 6`
    *    Incremented: `4 2 3`
    *    Pixels correct after increment: 1 / 3 = 33.3%

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `2 3 8`
    *   Expected Output: `6 4 9`
    *    Incremented: `3 4 9`
        *    Pixels correct after increment: 2 / 3 = 66.6%

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `5 8 6`
    *   Expected Output: `1 9 2`
        *    Incremented: `6 9 7`
        *    Pixels correct after increment: 1 / 3 = 33.3%

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `9 4 2`
    *   Expected Output: `8 3 6`
        *    Incremented: `0 5 3`
        *    Pixels correct after increment: 0 / 3 = 0%

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: input grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      elements: integers from 0 to 9

  - description: output grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      elements: integers from 0 to 9

actions:
  - name: increment_modulo
    input: input grid
    output: intermediate grid
    description: Each element in the input grid is incremented by 1, then modulo 10 is applied.
  - name: value_replacement
    input: intermediate grid
    output: output grid
    description: specific mapping derived from examples
    mapping:
        0: 4
        1: 5
        2: 6
        3: 4
        4: 3
        5: 1
        6: 2
        7: 0
        8: 9
        9: 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Increment and Modulo:** Take the input grid and increment each number by 1. Then, apply the modulo 10 operation to the result (e.g., 9 + 1 = 10, 10 % 10 = 0).
2.  **Value Replacement:** Replace each number in the grid obtained after step 1 with a corresponding value based on this mapping:
    *   0 -> 4
    *   1 -> 5
    *   2 -> 6
    *   3 -> 4
    *   4 -> 3
    *   5 -> 1
    *   6 -> 2
    *   7 -> 0
    *   8 -> 9
    *   9 -> 8

This process transforms the input grid into the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
