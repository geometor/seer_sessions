            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was on the right track with incrementing and applying modulo 10. However, the value replacement mapping is incorrect and needs adjustment. The errors in Examples 3 and 4 clearly indicate that replacement is not consistent with all examples. We need to re-examine all examples to determine the correct, consistent mapping.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input/output pairs to derive the correct mapping.\n2.  **Correct Mapping:** define the correct mapping.\n3. **Metrics**: calculate how many pixels would have been correct with the increment step, but no mapping.\n4.  **YAML and Program:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nFor the \"increment and modulo\" hypothesis, the output pixel values would be:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `3 1 2`\n    *   Expected Output: `4 5 6`\n    *    Incremented: `4 2 3`\n    *    Pixels correct after increment: 1 / 3 = 33.3%\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `2 3 8`\n    *   Expected Output: `6 4 9`\n    *    Incremented: `3 4 9`\n        *    Pixels correct after increment: 2 / 3 = 66.6%\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `5 8 6`\n    *   Expected Output: `1 9 2`\n        *    Incremented: `6 9 7`\n        *    Pixels correct after increment: 1 / 3 = 33.3%\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `9 4 2`\n    *   Expected Output: `8 3 6`\n        *    Incremented: `0 5 3`\n        *    Pixels correct after increment: 0 / 3 = 0%\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: input grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      elements: integers from 0 to 9\n\n  - description: output grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      elements: integers from 0 to 9\n\nactions:\n  - name: increment_modulo\n    input: input grid\n    output: intermediate grid\n    description: Each element in the input grid is incremented by 1, then modulo 10 is applied.\n  - name: value_replacement\n    input: intermediate grid\n    output: output grid\n    description: specific mapping derived from examples\n    mapping:\n        0: 4\n        1: 5\n        2: 6\n        3: 4\n        4: 3\n        5: 1\n        6: 2\n        7: 0\n        8: 9\n        9: 8\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Increment and Modulo:** Take the input grid and increment each number by 1. Then, apply the modulo 10 operation to the result (e.g., 9 + 1 = 10, 10 % 10 = 0).\n2.  **Value Replacement:** Replace each number in the grid obtained after step 1 with a corresponding value based on this mapping:\n    *   0 -> 4\n    *   1 -> 5\n    *   2 -> 6\n    *   3 -> 4\n    *   4 -> 3\n    *   5 -> 1\n    *   6 -> 2\n    *   7 -> 0\n    *   8 -> 9\n    *   9 -> 8\n\nThis process transforms the input grid into the output grid.\n"
