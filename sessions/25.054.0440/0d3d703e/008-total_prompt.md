## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x791C5D05B910>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x791C5D05B7F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The integers in the input grid seem to correspond to specific colors, and these same integers, albeit possibly modified, also appear in the output grid, again corresponding to colors. The transformation appears to be consistent across all rows, suggesting a row-wise or element-wise operation rather than a complex spatial manipulation. The core operation seems to be adding a constant value to each number of input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    element_type: color_mapped_integers
  - observation: input_grid_values
    values: [2, 3, 8]
  - observation: output_grid_values
    values: [6, 4, 9]
  - relationship: elementwise_transformation
    description: Each element in the input grid is transformed to a corresponding element in the output grid.
  - operation: addition
    input_values: [2, 3, 8]
    operands: [4, 1, 1]
    output_values: [6, 4, 9]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Add 4 to the first element (value 2 in this case). Add 1 to the second element (value 3). Add 1 to the third element (value 8).
3. **Output:** Construct new grid using the same dimensions and structure, each element now represents the transformed values.

In simpler term. For a 3 x 3 input grid. Add 4 to all instances of the number in the first column, and 1 to all instance of numbers in the second and third columns. Output this modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
