"""
Transforms an input grid by finding two unique pixels of the same color (endpoints), 
identifying the background color (most frequent) and obstacle colors (all others),
and then drawing the shortest path between the endpoints using the endpoint color. 
The path can only traverse cells originally containing the background color and moves 
only horizontally or vertically.

Workflow:
1. Identify Key Components:
    - Find the most frequent color and assume it's the background.
    - Find a color that appears exactly twice, excluding the background color. These are the endpoints.
    - Identify all other colors as obstacles.
    - Handle cases where unique endpoints or background cannot be clearly identified.
2. Find Shortest Path:
    - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from one endpoint.
    - Explore adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells.
    - Valid moves are onto cells that match the background color.
    - The target is the other endpoint.
    - Keep track of the path taken.
3. Draw Path:
    - Create a copy of the input grid.
    - If a path is found, iterate through the coordinates in the path (excluding the start and end points).
    - Set the color of these path cells in the copied grid to the endpoint color.
4. Return Result:
    - Return the modified grid. If identification fails or no path is found, return the original grid copy.
