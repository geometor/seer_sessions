# Assumptions based on the previous code attempt - Requires Validation
# --- Input Grid Objects & Properties ---
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Height: Integer (1-30)
    - Width: Integer (1-30)
    - Pixels: Matrix of Integers (0-9) representing colors.
  Objects:
    - BackgroundPixel:
        Properties:
          - Color: Integer (Identified as the most frequent color in the grid)
          - Role: Serves as the medium for pathfinding.
    - EndpointPixel:
        Properties:
          - Color: Integer (Identified as the unique color appearing exactly twice, excluding background)
          - Count: Exactly 2 instances in the grid.
          - Role: Define the start and end points for a path.
        Instances: Exactly two pixels share the same EndpointPixel color.
    - ObstaclePixel:
        Properties:
          - Color: Integer (Any color that is not BackgroundPixel or EndpointPixel)
          - Role: Impassable barriers for pathfinding (implicitly, as path must be on background).
        Instances: Variable number.

# --- Transformation Actions ---
Actions:
  1. IdentifyComponents:
     - Determine BackgroundPixel color (most frequent).
     - Find the unique color appearing exactly twice (EndpointPixel color).
     - Locate the two coordinates of the EndpointPixels.
     - Identify all other colors as ObstaclePixels.
     - Fails if: No unique background, zero or multiple endpoint colors found.
  2. FindShortestPath:
     - Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS).
     - Start: Coordinates of one EndpointPixel.
     - End: Coordinates of the other EndpointPixel.
     - Constraints:
       - Movement: Horizontal and Vertical only.
       - Valid Cells: Must traverse only cells originally containing the BackgroundPixel color. The destination EndpointPixel cell is also valid.
     - Fails if: No path exists between endpoints under the constraints.
  3. GenerateOutputGrid:
     - Initialize: Create a copy of the InputGrid.
     - If Path Found:
       - Modify the copy: Change the color of the pixels along the found path (excluding the start and end EndpointPixels) to the EndpointPixel color.
     - If Identification Failed or No Path Found:
       - Return the unmodified copy of the InputGrid.

# --- Output Grid ---
OutputGrid:
  - Structure: Same dimensions as InputGrid.
  - Content: InputGrid modified by drawing the path (if found) using the EndpointPixel color, or InputGrid unchanged.
