            "text": "**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concept of using 3x3 \"stamp\" patterns found in the input grid. However, the logic for determining *where* and *how* to apply these patterns was flawed, leading to significant deviations in the transformed outputs compared to the expected outputs across all training examples.\n\n*   **Key Observations from Failures:**\n    *   The transformed outputs show modifications spreading from the stamps, but the shape and extent of these modified areas are incorrect.\n    *   The expected outputs suggest that the stamp pattern should fill contiguous regions adjacent to the stamp. These regions seem to be defined by pixels matching either the background color or the stamp's center color.\n    *   The method of applying the pattern (tiling via modulo arithmetic relative to the stamp's origin) appears to be the correct mechanism for determining the color of a filled pixel.\n    *   The discrepancy lies primarily in defining the exact set of pixels (`target_pixels`) that should be modified by each stamp. The previous logic simply took immediate neighbors; the correct logic likely involves a flood-fill or region-growing approach starting from those neighbors.\n    *   The \"first modification wins\" rule seems appropriate, as the expected outputs don't show blending or complex interactions where filled regions overlap.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  Retain the stamp identification logic (3x3, uniform non-background border).\n    2.  Retain the pattern application logic (modulo arithmetic based on the stamp's grid and the target pixel's coordinates relative to the stamp's origin).\n    3.  **Revise the target pixel identification:** For each stamp, identify initial adjacent pixels that match either the background color or the stamp's center color. Perform a flood fill (or similar region-growing algorithm like Breadth-First Search) starting from these initial pixels. The fill should only propagate to contiguous pixels that also match either the background color or the stamp's center color *in the original input grid*.\n    4.  Maintain the `modified_pixels` set to ensure that once a pixel is filled by one stamp's pattern, it is not overwritten by another.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
