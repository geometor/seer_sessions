elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors. Contains a background color and various foreground objects/patterns.
    properties:
      - background_color: azure (8) is the most common background.
      - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - object: pattern
    description: A small, usually 3x3, arrangement of pixels acting as a template.
    properties:
      - size: Typically 3x3.
      - structure: Often consists of a border (frame) and a center pixel.
      - frame_color: The color of the border pixels.
      - center_color: The color of the center pixel (can be same as frame_color).
      - location: Found within the input grid.
  - object: target_area
    description: A contiguous, usually rectangular, area filled with a single color.
    properties:
      - color: Matches the 'frame_color' of a corresponding 'pattern' object.
      - shape: Generally rectangular.
      - location: Found within the input grid, separate from its corresponding pattern.
  - object: unchanged_elements
    description: Pixels or areas in the input grid that are not part of a pattern or a target area being filled.
    properties:
      - color: Any color, including the background.
      - structure: Can be single pixels, lines, or shapes.

actions:
  - action: identify_patterns
    description: Locate all 3x3 patterns in the input grid and record their frame_color and center_color.
  - action: identify_target_areas
    description: Locate contiguous areas filled with a single color that matches the frame_color of an identified pattern. Determine the bounding box of these areas.
  - action: tile_fill
    description: Fill a target_area by repeating its corresponding 3x3 pattern horizontally.
    details:
      - The filling starts from the top-left corner of the target_area.
      - The 3x3 pattern is repeatedly placed side-by-side horizontally across each row within the target_area.
      - The original pixels within the target_area are overwritten by the pattern pixels.
      - Tiling stops at the boundaries of the target_area.

relationships:
  - relationship: correspondence
    description: A target_area corresponds to a specific 3x3 pattern if the target_area's solid color matches the pattern's frame_color.
  - relationship: transformation_scope
    description: Only the identified target_areas are modified in the output. All other pixels retain their input values.
