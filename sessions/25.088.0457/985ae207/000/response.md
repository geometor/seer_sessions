**Perception**

The input grids contain a background color (azure - 8) and several distinct shapes or patterns made of other colors. The core elements appear to be:

1.  **3x3 Patterns:** Small, usually 3x3 pixel squares, acting as templates or "stamps". These patterns typically have a single-pixel border of one color (`frame_color`) and a center pixel of another color (`center_color`). Sometimes the frame and center colors are the same.
2.  **Target Areas:** Larger, often rectangular, contiguous areas filled solid with a single color. This color matches the `frame_color` of one of the 3x3 patterns found elsewhere in the grid.
3.  **Other Shapes/Noise:** Some shapes or color blocks exist that are neither 3x3 patterns nor target areas associated with a pattern.

The transformation involves identifying the 3x3 patterns and their corresponding target areas (matched by the `frame_color`). The target areas are then "filled" or "tiled" by repeating the associated 3x3 pattern horizontally across the extent of the target area. Pixels outside these target areas, including the background and other shapes/noise, remain unchanged. The original 3x3 pattern often remains in its original location but also serves as the template for filling the target area.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors. Contains a background color and various foreground objects/patterns.
    properties:
      - background_color: azure (8) is the most common background.
      - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
  - object: pattern
    description: A small, usually 3x3, arrangement of pixels acting as a template.
    properties:
      - size: Typically 3x3.
      - structure: Often consists of a border (frame) and a center pixel.
      - frame_color: The color of the border pixels.
      - center_color: The color of the center pixel (can be same as frame_color).
      - location: Found within the input grid.
  - object: target_area
    description: A contiguous, usually rectangular, area filled with a single color.
    properties:
      - color: Matches the 'frame_color' of a corresponding 'pattern' object.
      - shape: Generally rectangular.
      - location: Found within the input grid, separate from its corresponding pattern.
  - object: unchanged_elements
    description: Pixels or areas in the input grid that are not part of a pattern or a target area being filled.
    properties:
      - color: Any color, including the background.
      - structure: Can be single pixels, lines, or shapes.

actions:
  - action: identify_patterns
    description: Locate all 3x3 patterns in the input grid and record their frame_color and center_color.
  - action: identify_target_areas
    description: Locate contiguous areas filled with a single color that matches the frame_color of an identified pattern. Determine the bounding box of these areas.
  - action: tile_fill
    description: Fill a target_area by repeating its corresponding 3x3 pattern horizontally.
    details:
      - The filling starts from the top-left corner of the target_area.
      - The 3x3 pattern is repeatedly placed side-by-side horizontally across each row within the target_area.
      - The original pixels within the target_area are overwritten by the pattern pixels.
      - Tiling stops at the boundaries of the target_area.

relationships:
  - relationship: correspondence
    description: A target_area corresponds to a specific 3x3 pattern if the target_area's solid color matches the pattern's frame_color.
  - relationship: transformation_scope
    description: Only the identified target_areas are modified in the output. All other pixels retain their input values.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct 3x3 pixel patterns. For each pattern found:
    *   Determine its `frame_color` (the color of the pixels forming the border of the 3x3 square).
    *   Determine its `center_color` (the color of the central pixel).
    *   Store the complete 3x3 pattern structure associated with its `frame_color`. If multiple patterns share the same `frame_color`, the task examples suggest using the one explicitly present as a 3x3 block (prioritize complete 3x3 patterns if ambiguity arises, though examples don't show ambiguity).
3.  Scan the input grid again to identify all contiguous (connected horizontally and vertically) areas composed entirely of a single color `C`.
4.  For each identified contiguous area of color `C`:
    *   Check if color `C` matches the `frame_color` of any 3x3 pattern identified in step 2.
    *   If a match is found, designate this contiguous area as a `target_area` and retrieve the corresponding 3x3 pattern structure.
    *   Determine the bounding box (minimum and maximum row and column indices) of the `target_area`.
    *   Iterate through each row `r` within the `target_area`'s bounding box (from min row to max row).
    *   For each row `r`, iterate through the columns `c` within the `target_area`'s bounding box (from min column to max column).
    *   If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid belongs to the current `target_area` (i.e., its color is `C` and it's part of this contiguous block):
        *   Calculate the corresponding row index `pr = (r - min_row) % 3` and column index `pc = (c - min_col) % 3` within the 3x3 pattern.
        *   Get the color `pattern_pixel_color` from the stored 3x3 pattern structure at `(pr, pc)`.
        *   Update the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid with `pattern_pixel_color`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
