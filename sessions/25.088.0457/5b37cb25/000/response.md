Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples feature a large grid with a distinct 1-pixel thick border surrounding an inner area. The border colors are different in each example.
2.  **Inner Area Contents:** The inner area contains a primary background color (blue=1 in train_1, yellow=4 in train_2) and several "obstacle" shapes made of a different color (magenta=6 in train_1, red=2 in train_2).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the colors of pixels *within* the inner area. The border itself remains unchanged. The changes seem related to the border colors "propagating" inwards.
4.  **Propagation Behavior:**
    *   In train_1, the border colors (top=green, right=red, bottom=yellow, left=azure) spread inwards from their respective sides.
    *   This propagation colors the background pixels (blue) it encounters.
    *   When the propagation encounters an obstacle pixel (magenta), it colors *that* obstacle pixel with the border color and stops propagating further *past* that obstacle pixel along that path.
    *   Where propagation waves from different borders meet, they form boundaries. Pixels seem to take the color of the first wave that reaches them.
    *   Pixels that are "behind" an obstacle relative to a border (i.e., the obstacle lies between the pixel and the border) are not affected by that border's propagation wave.
5.  **Consistency:** This propagation behavior appears consistent in train_2, using its specific border colors (top=blue, right=azure, bottom=magenta, left=green), background (yellow), and obstacles (red). Notably, the azure propagation from the right border doesn't seem to color many (or any) pixels, likely because waves from other directions or obstacles block it first.

**YAML Facts:**

    properties:
      - thickness: 1 pixel
      - composition: four segments (top, right, bottom, left) with distinct colors
      - role: source_of_propagation
      - static: remains unchanged in output
  - object: inner_area
    type: region
    properties:
      - location: enclosed by the border
      - composition: contains background pixels and obstacle objects
      - role: target_of_transformation
  - object: background_pixel
    type: pixel_type
    properties:
      - color: varies per example (blue=1 in train_1, yellow=4 in train_2)
      - location: fills most of the inner_area
      - role: medium_for_propagation
  - object: obstacle_shape
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: varies per example (magenta=6 in train_1, red=2 in train_2)
      - shape: multiple contiguous regions of obstacle color
      - location: scattered within the inner_area
      - role: barrier_to_propagation

actions:
  - action: propagation
    source: border segments
    target: inner_area pixels (background and obstacle)
    rule: Color spreads inwards from each border segment.
    effect: Changes the color of affected pixels to the color of the originating border segment.
  - action: stopping
    trigger: Propagation wave encounters an obstacle_shape pixel.
    effect: The wave colors the encountered obstacle pixel but does not continue past it along that path.
  - action: collision_resolution
    trigger: Propagation waves from different borders attempt to color the same pixel.
    effect: The pixel takes the color of the first wave to reach it (implicit in simultaneous, step-by-step propagation).

relationships:
  - relation: adjacency
    between: border segments and inner_area pixels
    relevance: Defines the starting points for propagation.
  - relation: containment
    between: inner_area and (background_pixels, obstacle_shapes)
    relevance: Defines the area where transformation occurs.
  - relation: blocking
    between: obstacle_shapes and propagation waves
    relevance: Obstacles halt the spread of color.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the rectangular region inside the 1-pixel border (the "inner area").
3.  Identify the four border colors immediately adjacent to the inner area: `top_color`, `right_color`, `bottom_color`, `left_color`.
4.  Identify the "obstacle" color present within the inner area (magenta=6 in train_1, red=2 in train_2).
5.  Create a data structure (e.g., a grid of the same inner dimensions) to keep track of which border's propagation wave has claimed each pixel, initially marking all as unclaimed.
6.  Initialize four separate queues (or lists) of coordinates, one for each border direction (Top, Right, Bottom, Left). Add the coordinates of the inner area pixels directly adjacent to their respective border segments to the corresponding queue. Mark these initial pixels as claimed by their respective borders in the tracking structure.
7.  Perform a simultaneous breadth-first search (BFS) expanding layer by layer from all four borders:
    a.  While any of the four queues are not empty:
        i.  Create four empty lists for the *next* layer of coordinates for each direction.
        ii. Process the **Top** queue: For each coordinate `(r, c)` currently in the queue, consider the pixel below it `(r+1, c)`. If `(r+1, c)` is within the inner area, is currently unclaimed, then claim `(r+1, c)` for Top in the tracking structure. If the input color at `(r+1, c)` is *not* the obstacle color, add `(r+1, c)` to the next layer list for Top.
        iii. Process the **Right** queue: For each coordinate `(r, c)`, consider the pixel left of it `(r, c-1)`. If `(r, c-1)` is within the inner area, is currently unclaimed, then claim `(r, c-1)` for Right. If the input color at `(r, c-1)` is *not* the obstacle color, add `(r, c-1)` to the next layer list for Right.
        iv. Process the **Bottom** queue: For each coordinate `(r, c)`, consider the pixel above it `(r-1, c)`. If `(r-1, c)` is within the inner area, is currently unclaimed, then claim `(r-1, c)` for Bottom. If the input color at `(r-1, c)` is *not* the obstacle color, add `(r-1, c)` to the next layer list for Bottom.
        v. Process the **Left** queue: For each coordinate `(r, c)`, consider the pixel right of it `(r, c+1)`. If `(r, c+1)` is within the inner area, is currently unclaimed, then claim `(r, c+1)` for Left. If the input color at `(r, c+1)` is *not* the obstacle color, add `(r, c+1)` to the next layer list for Left.
        vi. Replace the current queues with the next layer lists generated in the previous steps.
8.  After the BFS completes (all queues are empty), iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` within the inner area:
    a.  Check the tracking structure to see which border claimed the pixel `(r, c)`.
    b.  If it was claimed by Top, change the `output[r][c]` to `top_color`.
    c.  If it was claimed by Right, change the `output[r][c]` to `right_color`.
    d.  If it was claimed by Bottom, change the `output[r][c]` to `bottom_color`.
    e.  If it was claimed by Left, change the `output[r][c]` to `left_color`.
    f.  If the pixel remained unclaimed (meaning it was an obstacle pixel that blocked all propagation, or behind such an obstacle), leave its color unchanged from the original input.
9.  Return the modified output grid.
