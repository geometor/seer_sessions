task_description: "Propagate border colors inward, stopping at obstacle shapes."
elements:
  - object: border
    type: frame
    properties:
      - thickness: 1 pixel
      - composition: four segments (top, right, bottom, left) with distinct colors
      - role: source_of_propagation
      - static: remains unchanged in output
  - object: inner_area
    type: region
    properties:
      - location: enclosed by the border
      - composition: contains background pixels and obstacle objects
      - role: target_of_transformation
  - object: background_pixel
    type: pixel_type
    properties:
      - color: varies per example (blue=1 in train_1, yellow=4 in train_2)
      - location: fills most of the inner_area
      - role: medium_for_propagation
  - object: obstacle_shape
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: varies per example (magenta=6 in train_1, red=2 in train_2)
      - shape: multiple contiguous regions of obstacle color
      - location: scattered within the inner_area
      - role: barrier_to_propagation

actions:
  - action: propagation
    source: border segments
    target: inner_area pixels (background and obstacle)
    rule: Color spreads inwards from each border segment.
    effect: Changes the color of affected pixels to the color of the originating border segment.
  - action: stopping
    trigger: Propagation wave encounters an obstacle_shape pixel.
    effect: The wave colors the encountered obstacle pixel but does not continue past it along that path.
  - action: collision_resolution
    trigger: Propagation waves from different borders attempt to color the same pixel.
    effect: The pixel takes the color of the first wave to reach it (implicit in simultaneous, step-by-step propagation).

relationships:
  - relation: adjacency
    between: border segments and inner_area pixels
    relevance: Defines the starting points for propagation.
  - relation: containment
    between: inner_area and (background_pixels, obstacle_shapes)
    relevance: Defines the area where transformation occurs.
  - relation: blocking
    between: obstacle_shapes and propagation waves
    relevance: Obstacles halt the spread of color.
