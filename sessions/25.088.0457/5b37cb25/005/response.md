def transform(input_grid_list):

    Propagates colors from the four border edges inwards into an enclosed area,

    The transformation identifies a background color (most frequent in the inner area)
    and obstacle colors (other colors in the inner area). Colors from the middle of
    the top, right, bottom, and left borders are propagated inwards layer by layer
    using a simultaneous Breadth-First Search (BFS).

    Propagation Rules:
    1. Propagation starts from inner pixels adjacent to the border that match the
       background color. These pixels are immediately colored with the corresponding
       border color.
    2. Propagation continues orthogonally inwards, one step per layer (BFS level).
    3. Propagation only overwrites pixels that *originally* had the background color.
    4. Pixels initially identified as obstacles block propagation and remain unchanged.
    5. The 1-pixel border itself remains unchanged.
    6. If propagation waves from different directions reach the same pixel in the
       same BFS layer, the conflict is resolved by priority: Top > Right > Bottom > Left.
       The highest priority wave colors the pixel.
    7. Pixels (background or otherwise) that are not reached by any propagation wave
       retain their original color.
