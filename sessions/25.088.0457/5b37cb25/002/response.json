            "text": "The background/obstacle identification is consistent. The core issue was the propagation rule: it should only propagate *onto* background pixels, and *stop* at (but not color) obstacle pixels.\n\n**Final Check on Propagation Logic:**\n- Simultaneous BFS: Yes, process layer by layer from all sides.\n- Target Pixels: Only propagate onto pixels that are originally the `background_color`.\n- Obstacle Pixels: Obstacle pixels (identified as the non-background color(s) in the initial inner grid) are never changed and block propagation entirely.\n- Collision Handling: When waves from different directions reach the same background pixel in the same step, the processing order (e.g., T, R, B, L) determines which color wins. The first wave to reach and color a pixel claims it.\n- Border: The outermost 1-pixel border remains unchanged.\n\nThis revised logic seems to match the visual transformation in both examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted a color propagation mechanism based on analyzing the first example. It correctly identified the border colors, background color, and obstacle color. However, the propagation logic was flawed, leading to incorrect outputs for both training examples. The primary errors were:\n1.  Coloring the obstacle pixels instead of leaving them untouched.\n2.  Potentially incorrect handling of how propagation stops at obstacles or how simultaneous waves interact.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the propagation logic based on observations from both examples:\n- Propagation should only occur onto pixels that initially have the background color.\n- Obstacle pixels should remain unchanged and act as barriers, completely blocking propagation paths.\n- Propagation should occur simultaneously from all four sides, advancing one step per iteration.\n- A clear rule for resolving collisions where propagation waves meet is needed (likely based on processing order or first-arrival).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Size: 30x30\n- Output Size: 30x30\n- Border Colors (T, R, B, L): Green (3), Red (2), Yellow (4), Azure (8)\n- Inner Area Analysis (Input):\n    - Background Color: Blue (1) (most frequent)\n    - Obstacle Color: Magenta (6)\n- Transformation: Colors from the border propagate inwards over the Blue (1) background pixels. Magenta (6) obstacle pixels remain unchanged and block the spread of border colors. Pixels behind obstacles (relative to their nearest border) remain Blue (1).\n- Previous Code Result: Failed (496 pixels incorrect). The code incorrectly overwrote large areas, including obstacles, suggesting the propagation didn't respect obstacles correctly and potentially over-propagated.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Size: 30x30\n- Output Size: 30x30\n- Border Colors (T, R, B, L): Blue (1), Azure (8), Magenta (6), Green (3)\n- Inner Area Analysis (Input):\n    - Background Color: Yellow (4) (most frequent)\n    - Obstacle Color: Red (2)\n- Transformation: Similar to Example 1. Border colors propagate over the Yellow (4) background. Red (2) obstacles block propagation and remain unchanged. Background pixels shielded by obstacles remain Yellow (4).\n- Previous Code Result: Failed (543 pixels incorrect). Similar failure mode to Example 1, indicating the same flaw in the propagation logic.\n\n**Verification of Background/Obstacle Colors:**\n"

If `H <= 2` or `W <= 2`, return the input grid unchanged.\n    *   Identify the four border colors: `TopColor` from `Input[0, 1]`, `RightColor` from `Input[1, W-1]`, `BottomColor` from `Input[H-1, 1]`, `LeftColor` from `Input[1, 0]`.\n    *   Analyze the inner region `Input[1:H-1, 1:W-1]`. Find the `BackgroundColor` (the most frequent color) and the `ObstacleColor` (any other color present, assuming only one exists based on examples). If no `ObstacleColor` exists, proceed without obstacle blocking.\n3.  **Setup Propagation**:\n    *   Initialize four queues: `Q_top`, `Q_right`, `Q_bottom`, `Q_left`.\n    *   Create a boolean grid `ColoredMask[H, W]` initialized to `False`, to track which inner pixels have been colored by propagation.\n4.  **Seed Propagation**:\n    *   **Top**: For `c` from 1 to `W-2`: If `Input[1, c]` is `BackgroundColor`, set `Output[1, c] = TopColor`, set `ColoredMask[1, c] = True`, and add `(1, c)` to `Q_top`.\n    *   **Right**: For `r` from 1 to `H-2`: If `Input[r, W-2]` is `BackgroundColor` AND `ColoredMask[r, W-2]` is `False`, set `Output[r, W-2] = RightColor`, set `ColoredMask[r, W-2] = True`, and add `(r, W-2)` to `Q_right`.\n    *   **Bottom**: For `c` from 1 to `W-2`: If `Input[H-2, c]` is `BackgroundColor` AND `ColoredMask[H-2, c]` is `False`, set `Output[H-2, c] = BottomColor`, set `ColoredMask[H-2, c] = True`, and add `(H-2, c)` to `Q_bottom`.\n    *   **Left**: For `r` from 1 to `H-2`: If `Input[r, 1]` is `BackgroundColor` AND `ColoredMask[r, 1]` is `False`, set `Output[r, 1] = LeftColor`, set `ColoredMask[r, 1] = True`, and add `(r, 1)` to `Q_left`.\n5.  **Iterative Propagation**:\n    *   While any queue is not empty:\n        *   Create four empty `NextQueues` (for the next layer/iteration).\n        *   **Process `Q_top`**: For each `(r, c)` popped from `Q_top`: Check neighbor `(nr, nc) = (r+1, c)`. If `nr` is within the inner vertical bounds (1 to H-2), `Input[nr, nc]` is `BackgroundColor`, AND `ColoredMask[nr, nc]` is `False`: set `Output[nr, nc] = TopColor`, set `ColoredMask[nr, nc] = True`, and add `(nr, nc)` to `Next_Q_top`.\n        *   **Process `Q_right`**: For each `(r, c)` popped from `Q_right`: Check neighbor `(nr, nc) = (r, c-1)`. If `nc` is within the inner horizontal bounds (1 to W-2), `Input[nr, nc]` is `BackgroundColor`, AND `ColoredMask[nr, nc]` is `False`: set `Output[nr, nc] = RightColor`, set `ColoredMask[nr, nc] = True`, and add `(nr, nc)` to `Next_Q_right`.\n        *   **Process `Q_bottom`**: For each `(r, c)` popped from `Q_bottom`: Check neighbor `(nr, nc) = (r-1, c)`. If `nr` is within the inner vertical bounds (1 to H-2), `Input[nr, nc]` is `BackgroundColor`, AND `ColoredMask[nr, nc]` is `False`: set `Output[nr, nc] = BottomColor`, set `ColoredMask[nr, nc] = True`, and add `(nr, nc)` to `Next_Q_bottom`.\n        *   **Process `Q_left`**: For each `(r, c)` popped from `Q_left`: Check neighbor `(nr, nc) = (r, c+1)`. If `nc` is within the inner horizontal bounds (1 to W-2), `Input[nr, nc]` is `BackgroundColor`, AND `ColoredMask[nr, nc]` is `False`: set `Output[nr, nc] = LeftColor`, set `ColoredMask[nr, nc] = True`, and add `(nr, nc)` to `Next_Q_left`.\n        *   Replace the current queues (`Q_top`, `Q_right`, etc.) with the `NextQueues`.\n6.  **Return Output**: Return the modified `Output` grid. Pixels that were originally `ObstacleColor` or `BackgroundColor` but were never marked in `ColoredMask` remain unchanged from the input grid (as they were initialized in the copy)."
