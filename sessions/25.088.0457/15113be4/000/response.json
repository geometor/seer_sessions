            "text": "**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are large (23x23). They feature horizontal lines of yellow pixels (color 4) that act as dividers, creating rows of smaller subgrids.\n2.  **Subgrids:** Between the yellow dividers, the grid is composed of 3x3 pixel areas separated by columns of yellow pixels. These 3x3 areas are the primary focus of the transformation.\n3.  **Colors:**\n    *   White (0) acts as a background within the 3x3 subgrids.\n    *   Blue (1) pixels form patterns within the 3x3 subgrids. These are the pixels potentially targeted for change.\n    *   Yellow (4) pixels form the structural grid lines (horizontal and vertical separators). They remain unchanged.\n    *   A \"target\" color exists uniquely in each example's input grid (Magenta=6 in `train_1`, Azure=8 in `train_2`, Green=3 in `train_3`). These target colors also appear in the output, replacing specific blue pixels. These target colors also appear as pre-existing shapes/pixels in the input grid, which seem unaffected by the transformation logic itself.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *one specific* blue pixel (1) within each 3x3 subgrid to the \"target\" color identified for that specific training example.\n5.  **Pixel Selection Rule:** The blue pixel selected for change within each 3x3 subgrid is the one located at the minimum row index within that subgrid. If multiple blue pixels share the minimum row index, the one with the minimum column index is chosen (i.e., the top-leftmost blue pixel).\n6.  **Target Color Determination:** The color used to replace the selected blue pixel is derived from the input grid itself. It's the unique color present in the input grid other than white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4).\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
