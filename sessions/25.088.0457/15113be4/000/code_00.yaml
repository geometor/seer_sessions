Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: 23x23 (in examples)
    - Structure: Contains horizontal and vertical separator lines.
  Separators:
    - Color: Yellow (4)
    - Orientation: Horizontal lines every 4th row (indices 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 22 - though 22 is the last row), Vertical lines every 4th column (indices 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 22).
Subgrids:
  Definition: 3x3 areas located between the yellow separator lines.
  Contents:
    - Primary Colors: White (0), Blue (1)
Objects:
  - Type: Blue Pixels
    Color: 1
    Location: Within 3x3 subgrids.
    Role: Subject of transformation.
  - Type: Target Color Pixels
    Color: Varies per example (Magenta=6, Azure=8, Green=3)
    Location: Can exist as distinct shapes/pixels in the input grid AND is the result color for the transformation.
    Role: Defines the output color for the transformation.
  - Type: Separator Pixels
    Color: Yellow (4)
    Role: Define grid structure, unchanged.
  - Type: Background Pixels
    Color: White (0)
    Role: Background within subgrids, unchanged.
Action:
  - Name: Color Change
  - Input Pixel: The specific Blue (1) pixel within each 3x3 subgrid that has the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index (top-leftmost blue pixel).
  - Output Color: The unique color present in the *entire input grid* that is NOT White (0), Blue (1), or Yellow (4).
Relationship:
  - The target color for the transformation is determined by finding a unique, non-structural, non-primary color present anywhere in the input grid.
  - The transformation applies independently to each 3x3 subgrid defined by the yellow separators.
