            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying objects, grouping them by a primary \"frame\" color, designating one object with internal details as a \"template,\" and copying this internal pattern onto other \"target\" objects of the same frame color that are initially solid.\n\nThe code fails on all provided training examples. The core issue appears to be how the pattern is applied to the target objects. The expected outputs suggest that the pattern transfer is not a simple overwrite based on relative coordinates within the bounding box. Instead, the pattern transfer seems constrained by the actual shape and size of the *interior* of the target object. If the target object's interior is smaller than the template's pattern area, only the portion of the pattern that fits within the target's interior should be transferred. The current code seems to overwrite parts of the target frame or apply the pattern incorrectly when the target is smaller.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Analysis:** Improve the identification of the \"frame\" and the \"internal pattern\" for the template object. The pattern should consist only of pixels *within* the object's boundaries that differ from the frame color.\n2.  **Refine Target Identification:** Ensure target objects are genuinely solid blocks of the frame color.\n3.  **Implement Constrained Pattern Transfer:** Modify the pattern application logic. For each pixel in the template's pattern (defined by its relative coordinates `(dr, dc)` and color `p_color`), calculate the corresponding absolute coordinate `(abs_r, abs_c)` in the target object. Apply the `p_color` to `output_grid[abs_r, abs_c]` *only if* the pixel `(abs_r, abs_c)` exists within the *original set of pixels* belonging to the target object *and* its original color in the input grid was the frame color. This ensures the pattern fills the interior space available without altering the target's original frame or extending beyond its boundaries.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the objects and differences more formally for each example.\n\n"
