Objects:
  - Type: Rectangular shapes
  - Composition: Contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
  - Properties:
    - FrameColor: The dominant color forming the outer boundary.
    - InternalPattern: A configuration of pixels within the bounding box having colors different from the FrameColor. Can be absent (object is solid FrameColor).
    - BoundingBox: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object.
    - TopLeftCorner: Coordinates (row, column) of the top-left pixel.
    - Size: Height and width.

Relationships:
  - Grouping: Objects are grouped by their shared FrameColor.
  - Template-Target: Within a group sharing the same FrameColor:
    - TemplateObject: An object possessing an InternalPattern. Assumed to be unique per FrameColor group in these examples.
    - TargetObject: An object initially lacking an InternalPattern (solid FrameColor).

Actions:
  - IdentifyObjects: Locate all distinct non-white objects and their properties (FrameColor, BoundingBox, etc.).
  - GroupObjects: Categorize objects based on FrameColor.
  - FindTemplateAndTargets: For each FrameColor group, identify the TemplateObject (if any) and TargetObjects (if any).
  - ExtractPattern: Determine the relative positions and colors of the InternalPattern within the TemplateObject's BoundingBox.
  - ApplyPattern: For each TargetObject:
    - Iterate through the TemplateObject's InternalPattern elements (relative position `(dr, dc)`, color `p_color`).
    - Calculate the absolute position `(Tr + dr, Tc + dc)` in the grid, where `(Tr, Tc)` is the TargetObject's TopLeftCorner.
    - If the absolute position falls within the TargetObject's BoundingBox AND the pixel at `input[Tr + dr][Tc + dc]` is currently the FrameColor:
      - Change the pixel color at `output[Tr + dr][Tc + dc]` to `p_color`.
    - Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color (which is either the FrameColor or unchanged if the position was outside the target).

OutputGeneration:
  - Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - Apply the pattern(s) as described above to modify the copied grid.
  - The final modified grid is the output.
