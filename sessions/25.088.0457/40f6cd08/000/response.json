            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9 (colors). The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct rectangular objects composed of non-white colors. These objects often have a primary \"frame\" color.\n3.  **Internal Patterns:** Some objects have internal structures or patterns made of different colors, nested within the frame color. Other objects of the same frame color might be solid (lacking internal patterns).\n4.  **Grouping:** Objects seem to be related based on their primary frame color. In each example, there are multiple objects sharing the same frame color (e.g., red in train_1, green in train_2, azure in train_3).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying an object with an internal pattern (let's call it the \"template\") and copying this pattern into other objects of the *same frame color* that initially lack the pattern (let's call them \"targets\").\n6.  **Pattern Copying Mechanism:** The pattern is copied relative to the top-left corner of the target object. The frame of the target object remains untouched. Only the internal pixels of the target object (which initially match the frame color) are potentially overwritten with the pattern's colors. If a target object is smaller than the template's pattern area, only the part of the pattern that fits within the target is copied.\n7.  **Consistency:** This pattern transfer logic appears consistent across all three training examples, differing only in the specific frame colors and internal patterns involved.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Can be absent (object is solid FrameColor).\n    - BoundingBox: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object.\n    - TopLeftCorner: Coordinates (row, column) of the top-left pixel.\n    - Size: Height and width.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Grouping: Objects are grouped by their shared FrameColor.\n  - Template-Target: Within a group sharing the same FrameColor:\n    - TemplateObject: An object possessing an InternalPattern.
