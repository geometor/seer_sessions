The output grids are almost identical to the input grids, except that some white (0) pixels have been changed to azure (8).\n\nObserving the relationship between the input and output grids across all examples, the key change involves the interaction between red (2) pixels and their neighboring white (0) pixels. Specifically, any white (0) pixel that is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one red (2) pixel in the input grid is changed to azure (8) in the output grid. All other pixels, including the red (2) pixels themselves and the gray (5) pixels, retain their original colors. The transformation identifies a specific spatial relationship (adjacency) between two pixel colors (red and white) and applies a color change (white to azure) based on this relationship.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If the pixel is white (0), examine its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n5.
