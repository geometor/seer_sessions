elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    notes: Some white pixels change color based on proximity to red pixels.
  - role: inert
    color: gray (5)
    notes: Gray pixels are unchanged in the transformation.
  - role: trigger
    color: red (2)
    notes: Red pixels trigger a change in adjacent white pixels but remain unchanged themselves.
  - role: result
    color: azure (8)
    notes: Azure pixels appear in the output where white pixels were adjacent to red pixels in the input.

spatial_relations:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (Moore neighborhood).
    applies_to:
      - white (0) pixels
      - red (2) pixels
    notes: Adjacency between a white pixel and a red pixel is the condition for the transformation.
