Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.

**Perception:**

The input grids are composed primarily of white (0) and gray (5) pixels, with scattered clusters of red (2) pixels. The output grids are almost identical to the input grids, except that some white (0) pixels have been changed to azure (8).

Observing the relationship between the input and output grids across all examples, the key change involves the interaction between red (2) pixels and their neighboring white (0) pixels. Specifically, any white (0) pixel that is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one red (2) pixel in the input grid is changed to azure (8) in the output grid. All other pixels, including the red (2) pixels themselves and the gray (5) pixels, retain their original colors. The transformation identifies a specific spatial relationship (adjacency) between two pixel colors (red and white) and applies a color change (white to azure) based on this relationship.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    notes: Some white pixels change color based on proximity to red pixels.
  - role: inert
    color: gray (5)
    notes: Gray pixels are unchanged in the transformation.
  - role: trigger
    color: red (2)
    notes: Red pixels trigger a change in adjacent white pixels but remain unchanged themselves.
  - role: result
    color: azure (8)
    notes: Azure pixels appear in the output where white pixels were adjacent to red pixels in the input.

spatial_relations:
  - type: adjacency
    definition: Includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (Moore neighborhood).
    applies_to:
      - white (0) pixels
      - red (2) pixels
    notes: Adjacency between a white pixel and a red pixel is the condition for the transformation.

transformation:
  action: change_color
  input_conditions:
    - pixel_color: white (0)
    - adjacent_pixel_color: red (2)
  output_effect:
    - changed_pixel_color: azure (8)
  unchanged_elements:
    - red (2) pixels
    - gray (5) pixels
    - white (0) pixels not adjacent to red (2) pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For each pixel, check if its color is white (0).
4.  If the pixel is white (0), examine its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
5.  If any of these neighbors in the *input* grid has the color red (2), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to azure (8).
6.  If a pixel in the input grid is not white (0), or if it is white (0) but has no red (2) neighbors, its corresponding pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid copy.
7.  The final modified grid is the result.
