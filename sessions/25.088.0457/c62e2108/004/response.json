            "text": "Okay, the `yaml` module isn't available, but the printed object data confirms the bounding boxes and colors derived during the manual analysis.\n\nObject Properties:\n*   Example 1:\n    *   Object 1: azure (8), box=(8,8) to (11,11)\n    *   Object 2: azure (8), box=(14,2) to (17,5)\n*   Example 2:\n    *   Object 1: red (2), box=(2,2) to (5,5)\n*   Example 3:\n    *   Object 1: green (3), box=(5,6) to (8,9)\n    *   Object 2: green (3), box=(11,12) to (14,15)\n\nThese properties are consistent across the examples and support the revised hypothesis. The core operation involves these bounding box coordinates.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous transformation attempt correctly identified the core operation: finding non-white/non-blue objects and using their bounding boxes to modify the output grid. However, it incorrectly initialized the output grid as blank (all white). The comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` across the three examples reveals that the transformation should start with a *copy* of the input grid and then draw lines based on the bounding boxes over this copy. The `Transformed Output` generated by the previous code shows what happens when starting from a white grid, which explains the discrepancies (`Pixels Off`) and the `Match: False` results.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the initial step of the transformation: instead of creating a new white grid, create a copy of the input grid. Then, apply the previously determined logic of filling rows and columns based on the bounding boxes of the identified pattern objects.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered using `tool_code` to verify the properties of the pattern objects (color, bounding box) in each example.\n\n"
