task_description: Creates an output grid by modifying a copy of the input grid. Modifications involve drawing horizontal and vertical lines based on the bounding boxes of specific objects found in the input.

input_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - boundary_markers: blue (1) lines/corners, ignored for object finding.
  - pattern_objects: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than white (0) or blue (1).
    - properties:
      - color (C)
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)

output_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of the same dimensions as the input.
  - initial_state: A direct copy of the input grid.
  - modifications:
    - For each pattern_object found in the input (processed typically top-to-bottom, left-to-right):
      - action: Fill rows `min_row` and `max_row` entirely with the object's color (C).
      - action: Fill columns `min_col` and `max_col` entirely with the object's color (C).
      - effect: These fill operations overwrite existing pixels in the output grid (including parts of the copied input and fills from previous objects).

    pattern_objects:

        color_name: azure
        bounding_box: {min_row: 14, min_col: 2, max_row: 17, max_col: 5}

      - Fill row 14 with azure

        color_name: green
        bounding_box: {min_row: 11, min_col: 12, max_row: 14, max_col: 15}
    actions:
