Okay, the `yaml` module isn't available, but the printed object data confirms the bounding boxes and colors derived during the manual analysis.

Object Properties:
*   Example 1:
    *   Object 1: azure (8), box=(8,8) to (11,11)
    *   Object 2: azure (8), box=(14,2) to (17,5)
*   Example 2:
    *   Object 1: red (2), box=(2,2) to (5,5)
*   Example 3:
    *   Object 1: green (3), box=(5,6) to (8,9)
    *   Object 2: green (3), box=(11,12) to (14,15)

These properties are consistent across the examples and support the revised hypothesis. The core operation involves these bounding box coordinates.## General Assessment

The previous transformation attempt correctly identified the core operation: finding non-white/non-blue objects and using their bounding boxes to modify the output grid. However, it incorrectly initialized the output grid as blank (all white). The comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` across the three examples reveals that the transformation should start with a *copy* of the input grid and then draw lines based on the bounding boxes over this copy. The `Transformed Output` generated by the previous code shows what happens when starting from a white grid, which explains the discrepancies (`Pixels Off`) and the `Match: False` results.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the initial step of the transformation: instead of creating a new white grid, create a copy of the input grid. Then, apply the previously determined logic of filling rows and columns based on the bounding boxes of the identified pattern objects.

## Metrics

Metrics were gathered using `tool_code` to verify the properties of the pattern objects (color, bounding box) in each example.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Creates an output grid by modifying a copy of the input grid. Modifications involve drawing horizontal and vertical lines based on the bounding boxes of specific objects found in the input.

input_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - boundary_markers: blue (1) lines/corners, ignored for object finding.
  - pattern_objects: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than white (0) or blue (1).
    - properties:
      - color (C)
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)

output_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of the same dimensions as the input.
  - initial_state: A direct copy of the input grid.
  - modifications:
    - For each pattern_object found in the input (processed typically top-to-bottom, left-to-right):
      - action: Fill rows `min_row` and `max_row` entirely with the object's color (C).
      - action: Fill columns `min_col` and `max_col` entirely with the object's color (C).
      - effect: These fill operations overwrite existing pixels in the output grid (including parts of the copied input and fills from previous objects).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Pattern Objects**: Find all contiguous objects in the input grid whose color is neither white (0) nor blue (1). Record the color (C) and the bounding box (minimum row `min_r`, minimum column `min_c`, maximum row `max_r`, maximum column `max_c`) for each object found. Objects are typically processed in the order they are discovered (e.g., scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
3.  **Apply Bounding Box Lines**: For *each* identified pattern object:
    a.  Take the object's color (C).
    b.  Take the object's bounding box coordinates (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`).
    c.  In the output grid, fill the *entire* row `min_r` with color C.
    d.  In the output grid, fill the *entire* row `max_r` with color C.
    e.  In the output grid, fill the *entire* column `min_c` with color C.
    f.  In the output grid, fill the *entire* column `max_c` with color C.
4.  **Handle Overwrites**: If multiple pattern objects exist, the line-filling operations from objects processed later will overwrite any pixels previously set by earlier objects or copied from the input grid.
5.  **Final Output**: The resulting grid after all pattern objects have been processed is the final output.
