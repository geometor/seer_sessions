There are always one or more \"pattern\" objects (non-white, non-blue colors like azure, red, green) and several blue lines (horizontal or vertical). The output grid retains the original pattern objects but adds lines of the pattern object's color. These new lines seem to correspond to the locations of the original blue lines and also to the boundary rows and columns of the original pattern objects.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Let (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) be the bounding box of the current Pattern Object.\n        c.  For each recorded horizontal blue line row index `r`, fill the entire row `r` in the output grid with color C.\n        d.  For each recorded vertical blue line column index `c`, fill the entire column `c` in the output grid with color C.\n        e.  Fill the entire row `min_row` in the output grid with color C.\n        f.  Fill the entire row `max_row` in the output grid with color C.\n        g.  Fill the entire column `min_col` in the output grid with color C.\n        h.  Fill the entire column `max_col` in the output grid with color C.\n    6.
