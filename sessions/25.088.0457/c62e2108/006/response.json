            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core objects (non-white, non-blue shapes) and their bounding boxes. However, the transformation logic was flawed. Instead of simply drawing the entire rows and columns corresponding to the bounding box edges, the actual transformation involves a projection or \"smearing\" of the object's shape within its bounding box. Specifically, if any part of the object exists on a given row within its bounding box, the *entire row segment* across the bounding box's columns is filled with the object's color. Similarly, if any part of the object exists in a given column within its bounding box, the *entire column segment* across the bounding box's rows is filled. These horizontal and vertical projections are overlaid onto a copy of the original input grid. The blue lines (color 1) do not influence the transformation logic but can be overwritten.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze each example to refine the understanding. We need to find the non-white, non-blue objects, their pixels, their bounding boxes, and see how these relate to the expected output.\n\n"
