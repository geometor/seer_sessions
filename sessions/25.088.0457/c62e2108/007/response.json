Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1). These are 'pattern objects'.\n3. For each identified pattern object:\n    a. Determine its color (C).\n    b. Determine its bounding box (minimum row `min_r`, minimum column `min_c`, maximum row `max_r`, maximum column `max_c`).\n    c. Determine the set of all pixel coordinates `(r, c)` belonging to the object.\n    d. Perform Horizontal Projection: For each row `r` within the object's bounding box (from `min_r` to `max_r` inclusive), if the object has *any* pixel in that row `r`, then fill the entire horizontal segment of the output grid `output_grid[r, min_c:max_c+1]` with the object's color `C`.\n    e. Perform Vertical Projection: For each column `c` within the object's bounding box (from `min_c` to `max_c` inclusive), if the object has *any* pixel in that column `c`, then fill the entire vertical segment of the output grid `output_grid[min_r:max_r+1, c]` with the object's color `C`.\n4. If multiple pattern objects exist, the projection filling operations from later objects (typically found top-to-bottom, left-to-right) will overwrite the fills from earlier objects or the initial copied grid where projections overlap.\n5. Return the modified grid as the final output. Blue lines (color 1) in the input do not influence the projection logic but can be overwritten by the projections.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_objects_with_pixels(grid, colors_to_exclude={0, 1}):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous objects of colors not in colors_to_exclude,\n    returning their color, bounding box, and the set of pixels they occupy.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        colors_to_exclude (set): Set of colors to ignore.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents an object:\n              (color, min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col, pixel_set).\n              pixel_set is a set of (row, col) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if the pixel is part of a target object and not visited\n            if color not in colors_to_exclude and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj_color = color\n                q = deque([(r, c)]) # Use deque for efficient queue operations\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                min_r, min_c = r, c\n                max_r, max_c = r, c\n                current_object_pixels = set([(r, c)]) # Keep track of pixels\n\n                # Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find all connected pixels\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n\n                    # Update bounding box\n                    min_r = min(min_r, row)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, col)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, row)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, col)\n\n                    # Explore neighbors (4-connectivity)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds, color match, and if not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == obj_color:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            current_object_pixels.add((nr, nc))\n\n                # Add the found object (color, bbox, pixels) to the list\n                objects.append((obj_color, min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c, current_object_pixels))\n\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by projecting non-white, non-blue objects\n    horizontally and vertically within their bounding boxes onto a copy\n    of the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
