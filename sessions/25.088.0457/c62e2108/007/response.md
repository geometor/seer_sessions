Transformation Rule Description:
1. Initialize an output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1). These are 'pattern objects'.
3. For each identified pattern object:
    a. Determine its color (C).
    b. Determine its bounding box (minimum row `min_r`, minimum column `min_c`, maximum row `max_r`, maximum column `max_c`).
    c. Determine the set of all pixel coordinates `(r, c)` belonging to the object.
    d. Perform Horizontal Projection: For each row `r` within the object's bounding box (from `min_r` to `max_r` inclusive), if the object has *any* pixel in that row `r`, then fill the entire horizontal segment of the output grid `output_grid[r, min_c:max_c+1]` with the object's color `C`.
    e. Perform Vertical Projection: For each column `c` within the object's bounding box (from `min_c` to `max_c` inclusive), if the object has *any* pixel in that column `c`, then fill the entire vertical segment of the output grid `output_grid[min_r:max_r+1, c]` with the object's color `C`.
4. If multiple pattern objects exist, the projection filling operations from later objects (typically found top-to-bottom, left-to-right) will overwrite the fills from earlier objects or the initial copied grid where projections overlap.
5. Return the modified grid as the final output. Blue lines (color 1) in the input do not influence the projection logic but can be overwritten by the projections.
