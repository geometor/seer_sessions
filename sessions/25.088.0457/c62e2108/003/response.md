Transformation Rule Description:
1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
2. Identify all contiguous objects in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1). These are 'pattern objects'.
3. For each identified pattern object:
    a. Determine its color (C).
    b. Determine its bounding box (minimum row `min_r`, minimum column `min_c`, maximum row `max_r`, maximum column `max_c`).
    c. In the output grid, fill the entire row `min_r` with color C.
    d. In the output grid, fill the entire row `max_r` with color C.
    e. In the output grid, fill the entire column `min_c` with color C.
    f. In the output grid, fill the entire column `max_c` with color C.
4. If multiple pattern objects exist, the filling operations from later objects (in the order they are found, typically top-to-bottom, left-to-right) will overwrite the fills from earlier objects where rows or columns overlap.
5. The original blue lines and the internal structure of the pattern objects from the input grid do not directly appear in the output grid, except where they coincide with the filled rows/columns determined by the bounding boxes.
