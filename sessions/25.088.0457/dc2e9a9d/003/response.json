Find all distinct green (3) objects.\n2. For each object:\n   a. Extract its shape (mask) within its bounding box.\n   b. Check for vertical symmetry. If true: reflect horizontally, color blue (1), place adjacent to the right.\n   c. If not vertically symmetric, check for horizontal symmetry. If true: reflect vertically, color azure (8), place adjacent below.\n   d. If not symmetric:\n      i. If height > width: reflect vertically, color azure (8), place adjacent below.\n      ii. If width >= height: reflect horizontally, color blue (1), place adjacent to the right.\n3. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with the input grid's content.\n4. Place the calculated reflections onto the output grid.\n   - Horizontal reflections (blue) start at column `max_c` (right edge of the bounding box) and row `min_r`.\n   - Vertical reflections (azure) start at row `max_r` (bottom edge of the bounding box) and column `min_c`.\n5. If a reflection extends beyond the original grid boundaries, it is truncated to fit within the grid.\n6. Reflections overwrite existing pixels only where the reflection mask is true (non-zero).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef is_vertically_symmetric(mask):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a 2D boolean mask is vertically symmetric.\"\"\"\n    h, w = mask.shape\n    if w == 1: # Single column is always vertically symmetric\n        return True\n    mid = w // 2\n    left = mask[:, :mid]\n    right = mask[:, -mid:] # Take last 'mid' columns\n    return np.array_equal(left, np.fliplr(right))\n\ndef is_horizontally_symmetric(mask):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a 2D boolean mask is horizontally symmetric.\"\"\"\n    h, w = mask.shape\n    if h == 1: # Single row is always horizontally symmetric\n        return True\n    mid = h // 2\n    top = mask[:mid, :]\n    bottom = mask[-mid:, :] # Take last 'mid' rows\n    return np.array_equal(top, np.flipud(bottom))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the reflection transformation based on symmetry and aspect ratio,\n    placing reflections within the original grid boundaries (truncating if necessary).\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid_np = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n    H, W = output_grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Define the color of interest (green) and background\n    target_color = 3\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # Find connected components of the target color\n    labeled_array, num_features = label(input_grid_np == target_color)\n    \n    # Find the locations (slices) of these components\n    object_slices = find_objects(labeled_array)\n\n    # Store reflection details to apply after finding all objects\n    reflections_to_add = [] # List of (mask, color, place_r, place_c) tuples\n\n    # --- Analysis Phase: Determine reflections for each object ---\n    for i in range(num_features):\n        obj_slice = object_slices[i]\n        min_r, max_r = obj_slice[0].start, obj_slice[0].stop\n        min_c, max_c = obj_slice[1].start, obj_slice[1].stop\n        \n        # Extract the object's boolean mask within its bounding box\n        # Ensure we only consider pixels belonging to the current object label\n        object_mask = (labeled_array[obj_slice] == (i + 1))\n        \n        h, w = object_mask.shape\n\n        # Determine symmetry\n        vert_sym = is_vertically_symmetric(object_mask)\n        horiz_sym = is_horizontally_symmetric(object_mask)\n\n        reflected_mask = None\n        new_color = 0\n        place_r, place_c = 0, 0\n        reflection_type = None # 'h' for horizontal, 'v' for vertical\n\n        # Apply rules based on symmetry and aspect ratio\n        if vert_sym:\n            # Rule 1: Vertically symmetric -> Reflect horizontally, color blue, place right\n            reflected_mask = np.fliplr(object_mask)\n            new_color = 1  # blue\n            place_r = min_r\n            place_c = max_c # Place starting at the column *after* the bounding box\n            reflection_type = 'h'\n            \n        elif horiz_sym:\n            # Rule 2: Horizontally symmetric (and not vertically) -> Reflect vertically, color azure, place below\n            reflected_mask = np.flipud(object_mask)\n            new_color = 8  # azure\n            place_r = max_r # Place starting at the row *after* the bounding box\n            place_c = min_c\n            reflection_type = 'v'\n            \n        else: # Not symmetric\n            if h > w:\n                 # Rule 3: Not symmetric, height > width -> Reflect vertically, color azure, place below\n                reflected_mask = np.flipud(object_mask)\n                new_color = 8  # azure\n                place_r = max_r\n                place_c = min_c\n                reflection_type = 'v'\n            else: # width >= height\n                # Rule 4: Not symmetric, width >= height -> Reflect horizontally, color blue, place right\n                reflected_mask = np.fliplr(object_mask)\n                new_color = 1  # blue\n                place_r = min_r\n                place_c = max_c\n                reflection_type = 'h'\n\n        # Store the reflection details if a reflection was generated\n        if reflected_mask is not None:\n            reflections_to_add.append((reflected_mask, new_color, place_r, place_c))\n\n    # --- Placement Phase: Add reflections to the output grid (with truncation) ---\n    for mask, color, r, c in reflections_to_add:\n        h_shape, w_shape = mask.shape\n        \n        # Calculate the slice coordinates for the reflection in the output grid\n        grid_r_start = r\n        grid_c_start = c\n        grid_r_end = r + h_shape\n        grid_c_end = c + w_shape\n        \n        # Calculate the slice coordinates for the mask itself (init"
