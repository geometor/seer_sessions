            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a white (0) background and one or more distinct objects composed of green (3) pixels. These green objects often resemble letters or abstract shapes.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Contains the original green objects unchanged. Additionally, new objects colored blue (1) or azure (8) appear. These new objects are reflections of the original green objects, placed adjacent (either below or to the right) to the corresponding green object.\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are the connected components of green pixels. Each green object seems to trigger the creation of exactly one new object (either blue or azure).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves analyzing properties of each green object (symmetry, aspect ratio) to determine:\n    *   Whether to reflect it vertically or horizontally.\n    *   What color the reflection should be (blue or azure).\n    *   Where to place the reflection (below or to the right).\n5.  **Rules:**\n    *   **Vertical Symmetry:** If a green object is symmetric about its vertical axis, it is reflected horizontally, colored blue (1), and placed immediately to the right of its bounding box.\n    *   **Horizontal Symmetry:** If a green object is *not* vertically symmetric but *is* symmetric about its horizontal axis, it is reflected vertically, colored azure (8), and placed immediately below its bounding box.\n    *   **No Symmetry:** If a green object is symmetric neither vertically nor horizontally, its bounding box aspect ratio determines the transformation:\n        *   If height > width, it's treated like a horizontally symmetric object (reflect vertically, color azure, place below).\n        *   If width >= height, it's treated like a vertically symmetric object (reflect horizontally, color blue, place right).\n6.  **Placement:** The reflected object is placed adjacent to the original object's bounding box. The top-left corner of the reflected shape aligns with the row below the original (for vertical reflections) or the column to the right of the original (for horizontal reflections).\n7.  **Grid Size:** The output grid preserves the original dimensions but expands downwards or rightwards if necessary to accommodate the new reflected shapes.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Check if the extracted shape is perfectly symmetric when reflected across its vertical midline.\n        i.  If it is vertically symmetric: Create a new shape by reflecting the extracted shape horizontally (left-to-right). Color this new shape blue (1).

Ensure the output grid is large enough to contain all original pixels and all newly added pixels. If shapes were added beyond the original bounds, expand the grid accordingly, filling new areas with the background color (white, 0).\n5.  Return the final output grid."
