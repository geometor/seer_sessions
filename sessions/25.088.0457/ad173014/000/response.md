Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example pair.
2.  **Background and Frame:** The grids feature a white (0) background. Some examples (train\_1, train\_3) have a large blue (1) frame around the active area, which remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects of interest are hollow rectangular shapes constructed from red (2) pixels.
4.  **Container Contents:** Each red rectangle encloses a pattern made of a single, non-red, non-white color (e.g., magenta-6, green-3, azure-8, orange-7, yellow-4). White (0) pixels can also exist inside the red rectangle, forming the negative space of the pattern.
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the internal patterns within the red rectangles. Observing the examples:
    *   The red rectangular frames themselves do not move or change.
    *   The *shape* or *structure* of the pattern inside each rectangle seems to stay within its original rectangle.
    *   The *color* used to draw the pattern *changes*.
    *   Comparing the colors across rectangles between input and output, it appears the *pattern colors* are swapped or permuted among the rectangles.
6.  **Color Swapping Pattern:**
    *   In `train_1` (3 rectangles with colors 6, 3, 8), the output colors are 3, 8, 6 respectively. Color 6 moves to where 8 was, 3 moves to where 6 was, 8 moves to where 3 was.
    *   In `train_2` (4 rectangles with colors 3, 7, 8, 6), the output colors are 8, 3, 6, 7 respectively. Color 3 moves to where 7 was, 7 moves to where 6 was, 8 moves to where 3 was, 6 moves to where 8 was.
    *   In `train_3` (3 rectangles with colors 8, 3, 4), the output colors are 4, 8, 3 respectively. Color 8 moves to where 3 was, 3 moves to where 4 was, 4 moves to where 8 was.
7.  **Object Ordering:** The specific swap seems dependent on the number of rectangles (N) and potentially their spatial arrangement. Ordering them by their top-left corner (row first, then column) seems like a reasonable prior.
    *   Ex 1 Order (R1, R2, R3): Colors (6, 3, 8) -> (3, 8, 6). Mapping: R1 gets C(R2), R2 gets C(R3), R3 gets C(R1).
    *   Ex 2 Order (R1, R2, R3, R4): Colors (3, 7, 8, 6) -> (8, 3, 6, 7). Mapping: R1 gets C(R3), R2 gets C(R1), R3 gets C(R4), R4 gets C(R2).
    *   Ex 3 Order (R1, R3, R2): Colors (8, 4, 3) -> (4, 3, 8). Mapping: R1 gets C(R3), R3 gets C(R2), R2 gets C(R1). (Note: Using top-left order R1(1,8), R3(8,17), R2(10,1)).
8.  **Conclusion:** The task requires identifying these red-bordered containers, extracting their internal pattern color and shape/location, ordering the containers, and then re-coloring each container's internal pattern shape with the color from another container according to a fixed permutation rule based on the total number (N) of containers and their order.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Swap the fill colors of patterns contained within red rectangular frames according to a specific permutation based on the number and order of frames.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Static backdrop.
  - element: frame
    color: blue (1)
    properties: Optional outer border, static.
  - element: container
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - Hollow rectangular shape.
      - Defines a boundary for an internal pattern.
      - Position and shape are static.
  - element: pattern
    color: variable (not white, blue, or red)
    properties:
      - Located inside a red container.
      - Consists of pixels of a single color.
      - Shape/relative pixel positions are static within its container.
      - The specific color used for the pattern changes based on the transformation rule.

relationships:
  - Each pattern is uniquely associated with one container.
  - Containers can be ordered spatially (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on top-left corner).

actions:
  - identify: Locate all red (2) rectangular containers.
  - identify: For each container, determine the color and the set of pixel coordinates (relative to the container or grid) of its internal pattern.
  - order: Sort the identified containers based on their top-left corner coordinates (row index first, then column index).
  - determine_permutation: Based on the total number (N) of containers, find the specific source container for each destination container's new color.
      - If N=3: Container 1 gets color from Container 2; Container 2 gets color from Container 3; Container 3 gets color from Container 1. (Based on Ex1, Ex3 re-ordered)
      - If N=4: Container 1 gets color from Container 3; Container 2 gets color from Container 1; Container 3 gets color from Container 4; Container 4 gets color from Container 2. (Based on Ex2)
  - apply_transformation: Create the output grid. For each container `i` in the ordered list:
      - Find the source container `j = P(i)` according to the permutation rule.
      - Get the original pattern color `C_j` from container `j`.
      - Recolor the pixels forming the pattern shape inside container `i` using the color `C_j`.
      - Preserve all other pixels (background, blue frame, red container frames, white pixels within containers).

implicit_rules:
  - The number of containers (N) determines the specific color permutation rule.
  - The spatial order of containers is crucial for applying the permutation correctly.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Containers:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct hollow rectangular objects made of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Extract Pattern Info:** For each identified red container:
    a.  Find the single color (other than red or white) present within its boundaries. This is the container's 'pattern color'.
    b.  Record the coordinates of all pixels within the container that have this pattern color. These define the 'pattern shape'.
3.  **Order Containers:** Create an ordered list of the containers based on the row index, then the column index, of their top-left corner pixel.
4.  **Determine Color Mapping:** Let N be the total number of containers found. Apply the following rule to decide which original color goes into which container in the output:
    *   If N=3: The 1st container gets the original color of the 2nd; the 2nd gets the original color of the 3rd; the 3rd gets the original color of the 1st.
    *   If N=4: The 1st container gets the original color of the 3rd; the 2nd gets the original color of the 1st; the 3rd gets the original color of the 4th; the 4th gets the original color of the 2nd.
    *   *(Assume similar fixed permutations exist for other potential values of N)*.
5.  **Construct Output:**
    a.  Start with a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Iterate through the ordered list of containers (from step 3). For each container `i` (at index `i-1` in the list):
        i.  Determine the source container `j` based on the mapping rule from step 4 (e.g., if N=3 and `i=1`, the source is container 2).
        ii. Get the original pattern color `C_j` belonging to container `j`.
        iii. For all pixel coordinates recorded as the 'pattern shape' for container `i` (from step 2b), change their color in the output grid to `C_j`.
6.  **Finalize:** The modified grid is the final output.
