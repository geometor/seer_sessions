            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are consistently grids of pixels represented by integers (colors). The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example pair.\n2.  **Background and Frame:** The grids feature a white (0) background. Some examples (train\\_1, train\\_3) have a large blue (1) frame around the active area, which remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects of interest are hollow rectangular shapes constructed from red (2) pixels.\n4.  **Container Contents:** Each red rectangle encloses a pattern made of a single, non-red, non-white color (e.g., magenta-6, green-3, azure-8, orange-7, yellow-4). White (0) pixels can also exist inside the red rectangle, forming the negative space of the pattern.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the internal patterns within the red rectangles. Observing the examples:\n    *   The red rectangular frames themselves do not move or change.\n    *   The *shape* or *structure* of the pattern inside each rectangle seems to stay within its original rectangle.\n    *   The *color* used to draw the pattern *changes*.\n    *   Comparing the colors across rectangles between input and output, it appears the *pattern colors* are swapped or permuted among the rectangles.\n6.  **Color Swapping Pattern:**\n    *   In `train_1` (3 rectangles with colors 6, 3, 8), the output colors are 3, 8, 6 respectively. Color 6 moves to where 8 was, 3 moves to where 6 was, 8 moves to where 3 was.\n    *   In `train_2` (4 rectangles with colors 3, 7, 8, 6), the output colors are 8, 3, 6, 7 respectively. Color 3 moves to where 7 was, 7 moves to where 6 was, 8 moves to where 3 was, 6 moves to where 8 was.\n    *   In `train_3` (3 rectangles with colors 8, 3, 4), the output colors are 4, 8, 3 respectively. Color 8 moves to where 3 was, 3 moves to where 4 was, 4 moves to where 8 was.\n7.  **Object Ordering:** The specific swap seems dependent on the number of rectangles (N) and potentially their spatial arrangement. Ordering them by their top-left corner (row first, then column) seems like a reasonable prior.\n    *   Ex 1 Order (R1, R2, R3): Colors (6, 3, 8) -> (3, 8, 6). Mapping: R1 gets C(R2), R2 gets C(R3), R3 gets C(R1).\n    *   Ex 2 Order (R1, R2, R3, R4): Colors (3, 7, 8, 6) -> (8, 3, 6, 7). Mapping: R1 gets C(R3), R2 gets C(R1), R3 gets C(R4), R4 gets C(R2).\n    *   Ex 3 Order (R1, R3, R2): Colors (8, 4, 3) -> (4, 3, 8). Mapping: R1 gets C(R3), R3 gets C(R2), R2 gets C(R1). (Note: Using top-left order R1(1,8), R3(8,17), R2(10,1)).\n8.  **Conclusion:** The task requires identifying these red-bordered containers, extracting their internal pattern color and shape/location, ordering the containers, and then re-coloring each container's internal pattern shape with the color from another container according to a fixed permutation rule based on the total number (N) of containers and their order.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
