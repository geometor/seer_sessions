"""
Fill enclosed white regions within the input grid based on the color of the outermost frame enclosing them.

The transformation identifies enclosed areas by performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the grid boundaries. 
Pixels reachable from the boundary without crossing a colored 'frame' pixel are considered 'outside'. 
During the BFS, the algorithm tracks the color of the most recently crossed frame pixel encountered along the path from the boundary. 
Any white pixel encountered during the BFS is assigned the 'enclosing color' associated with the path that reached it. 
If a white pixel is reached via multiple paths (e.g., from different boundary points or after crossing different frames), 
the first assignment typically corresponds to the outermost frame due to the nature of BFS expansion. 
Finally, the output grid is constructed by copying the original non-white pixels and filling the white pixels 
with their determined enclosing frame color (if any, otherwise they remain white).
