## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code attempted to fill enclosed white regions based on the color of the *outermost* frame encountered during a Breadth-First Search (BFS) initiated from the grid boundaries. The results clearly indicate this approach is incorrect. The provided examples show nested frames, where the color of the *innermost* frame surrounding a white region dictates the fill color, not the outermost one.

The core issue lies in how the "enclosing color" was determined and propagated. The BFS from the boundary assigned the color of the first frame encountered, overwriting it potentially with subsequent frames, but ultimately failing to correctly identify the *immediate* frame for deeply nested regions.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Abandon Boundary-Based BFS:** The boundary-first approach seems ill-suited for handling nested structures correctly.
2.  **Focus on White Regions:** Shift the focus to identifying contiguous regions of white pixels first.
3.  **Identify Immediate Boundaries:** For each white region, determine the color(s) of the non-white pixels directly adjacent to it.
4.  **Apply Fill Rule:** If all non-white pixels immediately adjacent to a white region share the *same* color, fill that entire white region with that color. If adjacent pixels have different colors, or if the region touches the boundary (and thus isn't fully enclosed), leave it white.

This revised strategy directly addresses the nesting problem by examining the local boundary of each white component.

## Metrics

Let's gather some metrics to better understand the examples and the failure mode.
