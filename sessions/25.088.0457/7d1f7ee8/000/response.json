These frames enclose regions, which may initially contain other frames or just white space.\n3.  **Nesting:** Frames can be nested within other frames (e.g., `train_1` has a blue frame inside a yellow frame inside a red frame). There can also be multiple independent framed areas within the grid (e.g., `train_1` has a red-framed area and a blue-framed area).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling the white (0) regions *inside* these frames.\n5.  **Fill Color Rule:** The crucial observation is that a white region is filled with the color of the *outermost* frame that encloses it. If a pixel is inside multiple nested frames, the color of the largest, outermost frame containing that pixel determines the fill color for that pixel.\n6.  **Frame Integrity:** The pixels making up the frames themselves remain unchanged in the output.\n7.  **External Area:** White areas outside of any frame remain white.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
