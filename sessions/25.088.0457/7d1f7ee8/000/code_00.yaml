task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with the color of their respective outermost enclosing frame.

elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - background_color: white (0)

  - element: frame
    properties:
      - type: object
      - definition: A contiguous, closed loop of non-white pixels of the same color.
      - color: The single color making up the frame (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
      - pixels: List of coordinates forming the frame.
      - bounding_box: The minimum rectangle containing the frame.
      - relation: enclosure
        target: region, frame
        description: A frame can enclose a region or another frame if the region/frame cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing the enclosing frame.

  - element: region
    properties:
      - type: area
      - definition: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels.
      - state:
          - initial: white (0)
          - final: color of the outermost enclosing frame, or white (0) if not enclosed.
      - relation: enclosed_by
        target: frame
        description: A region is enclosed by one or more frames.

actions:
  - action: identify_frames
    description: Find all connected components of non-white pixels and determine if they form closed frames.
  - action: identify_regions
    description: Identify contiguous areas of white pixels.
  - action: determine_enclosure
    input: region (or pixel), frame
    output: boolean (true if frame encloses region/pixel)
    description: Check if a path exists from the region/pixel to the grid boundary without crossing the frame.
  - action: find_outermost_enclosing_frame
    input: pixel, set_of_enclosing_frames
    output: frame
    description: From a set of frames enclosing a specific pixel, identify the frame that is not itself enclosed by any other frame *in that set*.
  - action: fill_region
    input: region, color
    description: Change the color of all pixels within a specified region to the specified color.

transformation_rule:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all non-white connected components (potential frames).
  - step: For each pixel (r, c) in the grid:
  - step: If the input pixel is white (0):
  - step: Find the set 'E' of all frames that enclose the pixel (r, c).
  - step: If 'E' is empty, the pixel remains white (0) in the output.
  - step: If 'E' is not empty, find the frame 'f_outer' in 'E' such that no other frame 'f_prime' in 'E' encloses 'f_outer'.
  - step: Set the output pixel (r, c) to the color of 'f_outer'.
  - step: If the input pixel is non-white, keep its color in the output.
