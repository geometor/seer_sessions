Task: Repair a grid by removing noise and restoring a repeating background pattern.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains a repeating background pattern (tile).
    - Tile dimensions (Height H, Width W) vary per task instance but are consistent within an instance.
    - Pattern is occluded by patches of a specific noise color (blue, value 1).
    - Grid dimensions are preserved in the output.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Represents the fully restored repeating background pattern.
    - Noise color (blue) pixels from the input are replaced.
    - Dimensions match the input grid.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify the underlying repeating pattern and the noise color.
  Action: Determine the dimensions (H, W) of the pattern tile.
  Action: Determine the color for each cell (ph, pw) within the HxW pattern tile.
    - Method: Find the most frequent non-noise color at input grid locations (r, c) where r % H == ph and c % W == pw. If only the noise color exists at these locations, use the noise color for the pattern.
  Action: Reconstruct the grid by tiling the determined HxW pattern.

Relationships:
  - The output grid is derived solely from the input grid.
  - The value of an output pixel at (r, c) depends on its position relative to the pattern's tiling: output[r][c] = pattern[r % H][c % W].
  - Blue pixels (color 1) in the input act as indicators of areas needing repair but do not typically contribute to the final pattern color unless they are the only color present at corresponding pattern positions.

Key_Elements:
  - Repeating pattern (tile)
  - Pattern dimensions (H, W)
  - Noise color (blue, value 1)
