            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grid Size:** The input and output grids always have the same dimensions in each example. The dimensions vary across examples but are relatively large (e.g., 22x25).\n2.  **Background Pattern:** The most striking feature of the input grids is a repeating background pattern. This pattern forms a regular tiling of the grid. The size of the repeating unit (the tile) varies between examples (7x7 in train_1, 6x6 in train_2, 8x4 in train_3).\n3.  **Noise/Occlusion:** The repeating background pattern in the input is disrupted by patches of a single color: blue (color 1). These blue patches appear as noise or occlusions overlaid on the background. The shape and location of these blue patches vary.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid is essentially a 'cleaned' or 'repaired' version of the input grid. The blue (color 1) patches are removed, and the underlying background pattern is restored in those areas.\n5.  **Pattern Restoration:** The colors used to replace the blue pixels in the output are determined by the underlying repeating pattern. If a pixel at `(row, col)` is blue in the input, its color in the output is the color that *should* be at that position according to the regular tiling of the background pattern.\n6.  **Pattern Determination:** The core repeating pattern block can be inferred from the input grid by looking at the non-blue pixels. For any given position within the repeating block structure (e.g., top-left corner of each block instance), the non-blue pixels at corresponding locations across the grid typically share the same color, which defines the pattern's color for that position.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

This can be done by comparing rows/columns at different offsets or by finding the `H` and `W` that best explain the grid structure when ignoring the noise color.\n3.  **Infer Base Pattern Tile:** Create an empty pattern tile grid of size `H x W`. For each cell `(ph, pw)` in this pattern tile (where `0 <= ph < H`, `0 <= pw < W`):\n    a.  Collect all colors from the input grid at locations `(r, c)` where `r` modulo `H` equals `ph`, and `c` modulo `W` equals `pw`.\n    b.  Identify the most frequent color among the collected colors, *excluding* blue (color 1).\n    c.  If only blue (color 1) was found for this position, use blue as the pattern color. Otherwise, use the most frequent non-blue color identified in step 3b.\n    d.  Assign this determined color to the pattern tile grid at `(ph, pw)`.\n4.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n5.  **Fill Output Grid:** Populate the output grid by repeatedly tiling the `H x W` base pattern tile determined in step 3. The color for the output cell at `(r, c)` is taken from the pattern tile at `(r % H, c % W)`."
