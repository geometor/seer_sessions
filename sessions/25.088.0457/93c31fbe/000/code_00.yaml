Data:
  - Grid Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - Color Palette: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), azure (8) used. Other colors might be possible but not shown in examples.

Objects:
  - Background: white (0) pixels.
  - Paired Shapes:
    - Composed of non-blue, non-white colors (red, green, azure in examples).
    - Occur in pairs of identical shape and color.
    - Remain static from input to output.
  - Original Blue Pixels: Individual blue (1) pixels present in the input.
  - Filler Pixels: blue (1) pixels introduced in the output.

Relationships:
  - Paired shapes define areas to be filled.
  - Filler pixels (blue) occupy the rectangular space between paired shapes, within their combined bounding box.

Actions:
  - Identify all non-white, non-blue connected components (potential shapes).
  - Group these shapes into pairs based on identical color and pixel arrangement.
  - For each identified pair:
    - Determine the minimal bounding box containing both shapes.
    - Remove any original blue (1) pixels from the input grid.
    - Fill the interior of this bounding box with blue (1) pixels in the output grid.
  - Preserve the original paired shapes' pixels within the filled bounding box (i.e., do not overwrite them with blue).
  - Preserve all other pixels (background, shapes not part of a pair) from the input grid.

Result:
  - The output grid contains the original paired shapes, with the rectangular area between each pair filled with blue, and original input blue pixels removed.
