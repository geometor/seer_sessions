**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids containing pixels of different colors, primarily white (0) as the background.
2.  **Key Colors:** The significant colors involved are blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8), besides the white background (0).
3.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct objects. Notably, there are pairs of identical shapes (made of red, green, or azure pixels) scattered across the grid. There are also some blue pixels present in the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves the blue pixels (1).
    *   The paired shapes (red, green, azure) remain unchanged in their position and color from input to output.
    *   The original blue pixels present in the input seem to disappear in the output.
    *   New blue pixels are introduced in the output. These new blue pixels appear to fill the rectangular area *between* the identified pairs of identical shapes.
5.  **Filling Logic:** For each pair of identical shapes (e.g., the two azure 'U' shapes in `train_1`), a bounding box encompassing both shapes seems to be determined. The area within this bounding box, *excluding* the pixels of the original paired shapes themselves, is filled with blue (1).
6.  **Independence:** The process appears to apply independently to each identified pair of shapes.

**Facts**


```yaml
Data:
  - Grid Type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  - Color Palette: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), azure (8) used. Other colors might be possible but not shown in examples.

Objects:
  - Background: white (0) pixels.
  - Paired Shapes:
    - Composed of non-blue, non-white colors (red, green, azure in examples).
    - Occur in pairs of identical shape and color.
    - Remain static from input to output.
  - Original Blue Pixels: Individual blue (1) pixels present in the input.
  - Filler Pixels: blue (1) pixels introduced in the output.

Relationships:
  - Paired shapes define areas to be filled.
  - Filler pixels (blue) occupy the rectangular space between paired shapes, within their combined bounding box.

Actions:
  - Identify all non-white, non-blue connected components (potential shapes).
  - Group these shapes into pairs based on identical color and pixel arrangement.
  - For each identified pair:
    - Determine the minimal bounding box containing both shapes.
    - Remove any original blue (1) pixels from the input grid.
    - Fill the interior of this bounding box with blue (1) pixels in the output grid.
  - Preserve the original paired shapes' pixels within the filled bounding box (i.e., do not overwrite them with blue).
  - Preserve all other pixels (background, shapes not part of a pair) from the input grid.

Result:
  - The output grid contains the original paired shapes, with the rectangular area between each pair filled with blue, and original input blue pixels removed.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Remove all pixels with the color blue (1) from the output grid, replacing them with the background color white (0).
3.  Identify all distinct connected objects (shapes) in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1).
4.  Group these identified shapes into pairs where both shapes in a pair have the exact same color and the exact same pattern of relative pixel positions (i.e., they are identical shapes).
5.  For each identified pair of identical shapes:
    a.  Find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) coordinates that encompass *both* shapes in the pair. This defines the bounding box.
    b.  Iterate through all grid cells (`r`, `c`) within this bounding box (from `min_r` to `max_r` and `min_c` to `max_c`).
    c.  For each cell (`r`, `c`) inside the bounding box, if the cell in the *original input grid* was *not* part of either shape belonging to the current pair, set the corresponding cell (`r`, `c`) in the *output grid* to blue (1).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
