Notably, there are pairs of identical shapes (made of red, green, or azure pixels) scattered across the grid. There are also some blue pixels present in the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves the blue pixels (1).\n    *   The paired shapes (red, green, azure) remain unchanged in their position and color from input to output.\n    *   The original blue pixels present in the input seem to disappear in the output.\n    *   New blue pixels are introduced in the output. These new blue pixels appear to fill the rectangular area *between* the identified pairs of identical shapes.\n5.  **Filling Logic:** For each pair of identical shapes (e.g., the two azure 'U' shapes in `train_1`), a bounding box encompassing both shapes seems to be determined. The area within this bounding box, *excluding* the pixels of the original paired shapes themselves, is filled with blue (1).\n6.  **Independence:** The process appears to apply independently to each identified pair of shapes.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
