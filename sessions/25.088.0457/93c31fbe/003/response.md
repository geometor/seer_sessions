Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Set all original blue (1) pixels in the output grid to white (0).
3.  Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1).
4.  For each object, calculate its canonical shape signature based on the relative coordinates of its pixels from its top-leftmost point.
5.  Group the identified objects based on having the exact same color and shape signature.
6.  Identify groups that contain exactly two objects (these are the pairs).
7.  For each identified pair of objects (Object A and Object B):
    a.  Determine the fixed translation (row offset `dr`, column offset `dc`) that maps the position of each pixel in Object A to its corresponding pixel in Object B. This can be found by comparing the top-left coordinates of both objects.
    b.  Iterate through each pixel `(r_A, c_A)` belonging to Object A.
    c.  Find the corresponding pixel `(r_B, c_B)` in Object B using the translation: `r_B = r_A + dr`, `c_B = c_A + dc`.
    d.  Horizontal Connection: If the corresponding pixels are in the same row (`r_A == r_B`) and different columns (`c_A != c_B`): Draw a horizontal blue line segment by changing the color to blue (1) for all pixels `(r_A, c)` where `c` is strictly between `c_A` and `c_B`. Only change pixels in the output grid that are currently white (0).
    e.  Vertical Connection: If the corresponding pixels are in the same column (`c_A == c_B`) and different rows (`r_A != r_B`): Draw a vertical blue line segment by changing the color to blue (1) for all pixels `(r, c_A)` where `r` is strictly between `r_A` and `r_B`. Only change pixels in the output grid that are currently white (0).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
