Transformation Rule:

1. Identify all connected components (objects) in the input grid that are neither white (0) nor blue (1).
2. Group these objects based on their color and shape. A shape is defined by the relative positions of its pixels.
3. Find groups containing exactly two identical objects (pairs).
4. For each identified pair:
   a. Determine the minimum bounding box that encloses both objects in the pair.
   b. Create an initial output grid by copying the input grid and removing all original blue (1) pixels (setting them to white (0)).
   c. Within the calculated bounding box in the output grid, fill all cells with blue (1) *unless* the cell corresponds to a pixel belonging to either of the two objects forming the pair.
5. If no pairs are found, the output grid is simply the input grid with all original blue pixels removed.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

## General Assessment

The provided code correctly identifies pairs of identical objects (excluding white and blue). It also correctly removes the original blue pixels from the input grid to create the base for the output grid. However, the method for adding *new* blue pixels is flawed. The current code fills the entire bounding box between the paired objects (excluding the objects themselves) with blue. The expected outputs show that blue pixels are added much more selectively, typically forming straight lines (horizontal or vertical) that connect *corresponding* points of the paired objects. The strategy will be to revise the rule for adding blue pixels to reflect this line-drawing behavior between corresponding points.

## Metrics and Observations

Let's examine each example:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Contains multiple pairs of azure '8'-shaped objects. Some pairs are horizontally aligned, others vertically. Original blue pixels exist scatteredly.
*   **Expected Output:** Original blue pixels are removed. For each pair of '8's, blue lines connect corresponding pixels. If a pair is horizontal (same row), horizontal blue lines connect them. If vertical (same column), vertical blue lines connect them.
*   **Transformed Output:** Original blue pixels are removed. The bounding boxes are calculated correctly, but the code fills *all* cells within the box (excluding the '8's) with blue, resulting in large blue rectangles instead of selective lines.
*   **Discrepancy:** The code overfills the area between pairs with blue.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Contains pairs of red '2'-shaped objects, aligned horizontally or vertically. Original blue pixels exist.
*   **Expected Output:** Original blue pixels removed. Blue lines connect corresponding points of the paired '2's (horizontally for horizontal pairs, vertically for vertical pairs).
*   **Transformed Output:** Similar to Example 1, the code fills the entire bounding box between pairs, creating blue rectangles instead of lines.
*   **Discrepancy:** Code overfills with blue.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Contains pairs of green 'L'-shaped or 'bracket'-shaped objects, aligned horizontally or vertically. Original blue pixels exist.
*   **Expected Output:** Original blue pixels removed. Blue lines connect corresponding points of the paired shapes (horizontally for horizontal pairs, vertically for vertical pairs).
*   **Transformed Output:** The code fills the entire bounding boxes. In the first pair (top left), this creates a large block of blue. In the second pair (bottom right), it also fills the bounding box.
*   **Discrepancy:** Code massively overfills with blue. The bounding box approach is fundamentally incorrect for generating the desired output pattern.

**Summary of Observations:**

*   The initial step of removing existing blue pixels (1) is correct.
*   Identifying pairs of identical non-white, non-blue objects is correct.
*   The key error is filling the entire bounding box.
*   The correct behavior involves drawing straight lines (horizontal or vertical) between *corresponding* pixels of the paired objects.
*   A pixel `(r1, c1)` in the first object corresponds to a pixel `(r2, c2)` in the second object if they occupy the same relative position within their respective shapes.
*   If `r1 == r2`, a horizontal blue line is drawn between `c1` and `c2` at row `r1`.
*   If `c1 == c2`, a vertical blue line is drawn between `r1` and `r2` at column `c1`.
*   These blue lines should not overwrite the pixels of the paired objects themselves.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_name: connect_corresponding_points_of_pairs
description: Identifies pairs of identical non-background objects and draws blue lines between their corresponding points.
observations:
  - Objects are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, excluding white (0) and blue (1).
  - Object identity includes both color and shape (relative pixel positions).
  - The transformation targets pairs of identical objects.
  - The input grid may contain blue (1) pixels initially.
actions:
  - Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - Set all original blue (1) pixels in the copied grid to white (0).
  - Find all non-white, non-blue objects.
  - Group objects by color and shape signature.
  - Identify groups containing exactly two objects (pairs).
  - For each pair:
      - Determine the corresponding pixels between the two objects based on their identical shapes and relative positions.
      - For each pair of corresponding pixels (p1, p2) where p1 = (r1, c1) and p2 = (r2, c2):
          - If p1 and p2 are in the same row (r1 == r2):
              - Fill the cells (r1, c) with blue (1) for all 'c' strictly between c1 and c2.
          - If p1 and p2 are in the same column (c1 == c2):
              - Fill the cells (r, c1) with blue (1) for all 'r' strictly between r1 and r2.
          - Only fill cells that are currently white (0). Do not overwrite the pair objects.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid by copying the input grid.
2.  **Clear Existing Blue:** Change all blue (1) pixels in the new grid to white (0).
3.  **Identify Objects:** Find all connected components (objects) in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1). Record their color and the set of coordinates for each pixel belonging to the object.
4.  **Canonical Shape:** For each object, determine its canonical shape signature by calculating the relative coordinates of its pixels from its top-leftmost point.
5.  **Group by Shape and Color:** Group the objects based on having the exact same color and shape signature.
6.  **Find Pairs:** Identify groups that contain exactly two objects. These are the pairs to be processed.
7.  **Connect Pairs:** For each identified pair of objects (Object A and Object B):
    a.  **Establish Correspondence:** Since they have identical shapes, determine the fixed translation (row offset `dr`, column offset `dc`) that maps the position of each pixel in Object A to its corresponding pixel in Object B.
    b.  **Draw Connecting Lines:** Iterate through each pixel `(r_A, c_A)` belonging to Object A.
        i.  Find the corresponding pixel `(r_B, c_B)` in Object B using the translation: `r_B = r_A + dr`, `c_B = c_A + dc`.
        ii. **Horizontal Connection:** If the pixels are in the same row (`r_A == r_B`) and different columns (`c_A != c_B`): Draw a horizontal line segment by changing the color to blue (1) for all pixels `(r_A, c)` where `c` is strictly between `c_A` and `c_B`. Only change pixels that are currently white (0).
        iii. **Vertical Connection:** If the pixels are in the same column (`c_A == c_B`) and different rows (`r_A != r_B`): Draw a vertical line segment by changing the color to blue (1) for all pixels `(r, c_A)` where `r` is strictly between `r_A` and `r_B`. Only change pixels that are currently white (0).
8.  **Final Output:** The modified grid after processing all pairs is the final output.
