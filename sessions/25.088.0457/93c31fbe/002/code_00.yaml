task_name: connect_corresponding_points_of_pairs
description: Identifies pairs of identical non-background objects and draws blue lines between their corresponding points.
observations:
  - Objects are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, excluding white (0) and blue (1).
  - Object identity includes both color and shape (relative pixel positions).
  - The transformation targets pairs of identical objects.
  - The input grid may contain blue (1) pixels initially.
actions:
  - Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - Set all original blue (1) pixels in the copied grid to white (0).
  - Find all non-white, non-blue objects.
  - Group objects by color and shape signature.
  - Identify groups containing exactly two objects (pairs).
  - For each pair:
      - Determine the corresponding pixels between the two objects based on their identical shapes and relative positions.
      - For each pair of corresponding pixels (p1, p2) where p1 = (r1, c1) and p2 = (r2, c2):
          - If p1 and p2 are in the same row (r1 == r2):
              - Fill the cells (r1, c) with blue (1) for all 'c' strictly between c1 and c2.
          - If p1 and p2 are in the same column (c1 == c2):
              - Fill the cells (r, c1) with blue (1) for all 'r' strictly between r1 and r2.
          - Only fill cells that are currently white (0). Do not overwrite the pair objects.
