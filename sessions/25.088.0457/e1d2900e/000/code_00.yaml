elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors. White (0) is the background.
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    description: Single, isolated pixels. They remain unchanged in the output. They act as a condition for transformation.
  - type: object
    color: red (2)
    description: Typically small (e.g., 2x2) contiguous blocks of red pixels. They remain unchanged in the output. They act as a condition for transformation.
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    description: Background pixels. Some transform into blue pixels in the output.

actions:
  - type: color_change
    input_color: white (0)
    output_color: blue (1)
    condition: >
      The white pixel must be orthogonally adjacent (sharing an edge)
      to at least one red (2) pixel AND orthogonally adjacent
      to at least one blue (1) pixel in the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    direction: orthogonal (up, down, left, right)
    description: Determines which pixels influence the transformation of a white pixel.
