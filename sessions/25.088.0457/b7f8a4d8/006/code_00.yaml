task_description: "Identify specific 3x3 objects with a colored frame and a different colored center pixel. If the frame/center color pair matches a trigger condition, draw lines extending right and down from the center pixel using the center pixel's color."

grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  max_size: 30x30
  color_palette: 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)

objects:
  - type: "Framed Square"
    definition: "A 3x3 area where the 8 border pixels are of the same non-white color (frame_color) and the single central pixel is of a different non-white color (center_color)."
    properties:
      - frame_color: "The color of the 8 border pixels (non-white)."
      - center_color: "The color of the single central pixel (non-white)."
      - top_left_coord: "(r, c) coordinates of the top-left pixel."
      - center_coord: "(r+1, c+1) coordinates of the center pixel."

actions:
  - name: "Draw Lines"
    condition: "Performed if a 'Framed Square' object's (frame_color, center_color) pair matches one of the trigger pairs."
    trigger_pairs:
      - [frame=Green(3), center=Yellow(4)]
      - [frame=Green(3), center=Azure(8)]
      - [frame=Red(2), center=Green(3)]
      - [frame=Red(2), center=Blue(1)]
      - [frame=Blue(1), center=Green(3)]
    drawing_details:
      - origin: "The center pixel (r+1, c+1) of the triggering 'Framed Square'."
      - color: "The center_color of the triggering 'Framed Square'."
      - direction_1: "Horizontal, extending rightwards from column c+2."
      - direction_2: "Vertical, extending downwards from row r+2."
      - termination: "Drawing stops in a direction if a non-white(0) pixel is encountered or the grid boundary is reached. Only white(0) pixels are overwritten."

input_output_relationship:
  - "The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid."
  - "The grid is scanned to find all 'Framed Square' objects."
  - "For each 'Framed Square' matching a trigger pair, the 'Draw Lines' action is applied to the output grid."
