## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying 4x4 objects with a frame and a 2x2 center. It then checks if the frame/center color combination matches specific trigger pairs and draws lines horizontally and vertically from the center rows/columns if a match occurs.

However, the code fails on all training examples. The primary reason for failure appears to be an incorrect identification of the target object's structure. Visual inspection of the input/output pairs suggests the objects of interest are 3x3, not 4x4. These 3x3 objects have a 1-pixel thick frame of one color and a single central pixel of a different color.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly identify the structure of the objects that trigger the transformation (3x3 framed squares with a single center pixel).
2.  Re-verify the trigger conditions (frame\_color, center\_color pairs) based on this corrected object structure.
3.  Define the drawing mechanism accurately: lines should originate from the *single center pixel* of the 3x3 object, extending horizontally rightwards and vertically downwards, using the *center pixel's color*, and stopping at non-white pixels or grid boundaries.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples focusing on 3x3 objects with a frame and a single center pixel.

**Color Mappings:** 0:white, 1:blue, 2:red, 3:green, 4:yellow, 8:azure

**Example 1 Analysis:**
*   Objects present:
    *   Green(3) frame, Red(2) center (3x3): Multiple instances, no change in output.
    *   Green(3) frame, Azure(8) center (3x3): Top-right instance at (2, 16), causes drawing. Bottom-right instance at (17, 26), causes drawing. Top-right instance at (17, 16), causes drawing.
    *   Green(3) frame, Yellow(4) center (3x3): Middle-left instance at (12, 6), causes drawing. Middle-right instance at (12, 21), causes drawing. Bottom-left instance at (22, 6), causes drawing.
*   Triggering Pairs Observed: (Frame=3, Center=8), (Frame=3, Center=4).
*   Non-Triggering Pair Observed: (Frame=3, Center=2).
*   Drawing Action: From the center pixel (e.g., (3, 17) for the first Azure one), draw horizontally right and vertically down with the center color (Azure=8 or Yellow=4) until a non-white pixel or boundary is hit.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
*   Objects present:
    *   Red(2) frame, Yellow(4) center (3x3): Multiple instances, no change in output.
    *   Red(2) frame, Green(3) center (3x3): Top-middle instances at (2, 11) and (2, 16), cause drawing. Bottom-middle instances at (12, 11) and (12, 16), cause drawing.
    *   Red(2) frame, Blue(1) center (3x3): Middle-left instance at (7, 6), causes drawing. Middle-right instance at (7, 21), causes drawing. Bottom-left instance at (17, 6), causes drawing. Bottom-right instance at (17, 21), causes drawing.
*   Triggering Pairs Observed: (Frame=2, Center=3), (Frame=2, Center=1).
*   Non-Triggering Pair Observed: (Frame=2, Center=4).
*   Drawing Action: From the center pixel, draw horizontally right and vertically down with the center color (Green=3 or Blue=1) until a non-white pixel or boundary is hit.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
*   Objects present:
    *   Blue(1) frame, Red(2) center (3x3): Multiple instances, no change in output.
    *   Blue(1) frame, Green(3) center (3x3): Middle-left instance at (8, 1), causes drawing. Middle-right instance at (8, 16), causes drawing. Bottom-left instance at (20, 1), causes drawing. Bottom-right instance at (20, 16), causes drawing.
*   Triggering Pairs Observed: (Frame=1, Center=3).
*   Non-Triggering Pair Observed: (Frame=1, Center=2).
*   Drawing Action: From the center pixel, draw horizontally right and vertically down with the center color (Green=3) until a non-white pixel or boundary is hit.

**Summary of Triggering Pairs across Examples:**
*   (Green=3, Yellow=4) -> Draw Yellow(4)
*   (Green=3, Azure=8) -> Draw Azure(8)
*   (Red=2, Green=3) -> Draw Green(3)
*   (Red=2, Blue=1) -> Draw Blue(1)
*   (Blue=1, Green=3) -> Draw Green(3)

These exactly match the trigger pairs used in the previous code, confirming the issue was the object identification (4x4 vs 3x3) and the line drawing origin (center rows/cols vs single center pixel).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Define the set of triggering color pairs (frame\_color, center\_color): `{(Green, Yellow), (Green, Azure), (Red, Green), (Red, Blue), (Blue, Green)}`. Corresponding integer values: `{(3, 4), (3, 8), (2, 3), (2, 1), (1, 3)}`.
3.  Iterate through the `input_grid` to find all instances of 3x3 "Framed Squares". A "Framed Square" is located at top-left position (r, c) if:
    *   The 8 pixels forming the border (grid[r, c:c+3], grid[r+2, c:c+3], grid[r+1, c], grid[r+1, c+2]) are all the same non-white color (`frame_color`).
    *   The central pixel at (r+1, c+1) is a non-white color (`center_color`).
    *   `frame_color` is different from `center_color`.
4.  For each identified "Framed Square" with its center at (`r_center`, `c_center`) = (`r+1`, `c+1`), `frame_color`, and `center_color`:
    *   Check if the pair (`frame_color`, `center_color`) is in the set of triggering pairs.
    *   If it is a trigger pair:
        *   Set the `draw_color` to `center_color`.
        *   **Draw Horizontal Line:** Starting from column `c_draw = c_center + 1`, iterate rightwards (`c_draw < grid_width`). If `output_grid[r_center, c_draw]` is white (0), change it to `draw_color`. Stop if a non-white pixel is encountered or the grid edge is reached.
        *   **Draw Vertical Line:** Starting from row `r_draw = r_center + 1`, iterate downwards (`r_draw < grid_height`). If `output_grid[r_draw, c_center]` is white (0), change it to `draw_color`. Stop if a non-white pixel is encountered or the grid edge is reached.
5.  Return the modified `output_grid`.
