Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Background: white (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Pattern Square
    Size: 3x3
    Frame:
      Color: blue (1)
      Shape: Square border
    Center:
      Color: Varies (red=2 or green=3 in this example)
      Position: Geometric center of the 3x3 square
    Arrangement: Grid pattern, separated by white (0) rows/columns
Transformation:
  Action: Add pixels
  Trigger:
    Object: Pattern Square
    Condition: Center pixel color is green (3)
  Added Pixels:
    Color: Same as the trigger center pixel color (green=3)
    Placement:
      - Horizontal Line: Starts in the white (0) cell immediately right of the trigger square's center row, extends right until non-white pixel or grid edge.
      - Vertical Line: Starts in the white (0) cell immediately below the trigger square's center column, extends down until non-white pixel or grid edge.
Relationship:
  - The color of the added lines is determined by the color of the central pixel of the triggering square.
  - The position of the added lines is relative to the position of the triggering square.
  - Squares with a red (2) center pixel do not trigger any pixel additions.
