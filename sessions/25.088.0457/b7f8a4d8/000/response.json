            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation logic for the provided ARC task example.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grid is large (26x29) and contains a repeating pattern. It's composed of white (0) background pixels forming a grid-like structure separating smaller object blocks.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects are 3x3 squares framed by blue (1) pixels. Each square has a central pixel of a different color. In this example, the central pixels are either red (2) or green (3). These 3x3 squares are arranged in a larger grid pattern, separated by rows and columns of white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Input Variation:** The key variation within the input grid is the color of the central pixel within the 3x3 blue squares. Some are red (2), and some are green (3).\n4.  **Output Changes:** Comparing the input and output grids reveals that the original structure (blue squares and their central pixels) remains unchanged. However, new green (3) pixels appear in the output grid.\n5.  **Location of Changes:** The new green (3) pixels appear exclusively in the white (0) areas adjacent to the 3x3 blue squares *that have a green (3) central pixel*.\n6.  **Pattern of Added Pixels:**\n    *   For each 3x3 blue square with a green (3) center, a horizontal line of green (3) pixels is drawn starting immediately to the right of the square, in the same row as the central green pixel. This line extends rightwards through the white (0) pixels until it hits the next non-white pixel (the start of the next blue square frame) or the edge of the grid.\n    *   Simultaneously, a vertical line of green (3) pixels is drawn starting immediately below the square, in the same column as the central green pixel. This line extends downwards through the white (0) pixels until it hits the next non-white pixel (the start of the next blue square frame) or the edge of the grid.\n7.  **Color Consistency:** The color used for the added lines (green=3) is the same as the color of the central pixel that triggered the addition (green=3). Squares with a red (2) center do not trigger any additions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
