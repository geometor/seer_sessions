Iterate through the input grid to find potential top-left corners (r, c) of 3x3 objects.\n2. For each potential corner, check if it forms a 3x3 square with a solid, \n   single-color frame (frame_color != 0) and a center pixel (center_color) \n   that is different from the frame_color.\n3. If such a 3x3 object is found:\n   a. Check if the center_color is one of the \"active\" colors (NOT red=2 and NOT yellow=4).\n   b. If center_color is an \"active\" color:\n      i. Get the coordinates of the center pixel: r_center = r + 1, c_center = c + 1.\n      ii. Draw Horizontal Line: Starting from the column immediately right of the \n          object (c_center + 2), move rightwards. Fill white (0) cells in the \n          center row (r_center) with the center_color until a non-white pixel \n          or the grid edge is encountered.\n      iii. Draw Vertical Line: Starting from the row immediately below the object \n           (r_center + 2), move downwards. Fill white (0) cells in the center \n           column (c_center) with the center_color until a non-white pixel or \n           the grid edge is encountered.\n4.
