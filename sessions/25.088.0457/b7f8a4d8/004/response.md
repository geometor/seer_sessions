## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying specific 4x4 framed square objects and drawing lines based on their center color. However, the results show that the code fails on all training examples, producing outputs different from the expected ones.

1.  **Incorrect Trigger Condition:** The initial assumption that lines are drawn only if the center color is *not* red (2) and *not* yellow (4) is incorrect. Example 1 shows yellow centers *do* trigger line drawing when the frame is green. Example 2 shows yellow centers *do not* trigger when the frame is red, but green and blue centers *do*. Example 3 shows green centers trigger when the frame is blue, but red centers *do not*. This indicates the trigger condition depends on the combination of frame color and center color.
2.  **Potential Implementation Bug:** Even when the code's trigger condition (`!=2 and !=4`) correctly identifies squares that *should* have lines drawn in the expected output (e.g., the green-centered squares in Ex 2 and Ex 3, the azure-centered squares in Ex 1), the transformed output sometimes lacks these lines entirely (Ex 2, Ex 3) or partially (Ex 1). This suggests a possible bug within the line-drawing part of the code itself, separate from the trigger logic error.

The strategy is to:
1.  Analyze the relationship between frame color and center color in the *expected* outputs to deduce the correct trigger condition.
2.  Confirm the drawing mechanism (extend right and down from the center rows/columns using the center color until a non-white pixel or boundary is hit).
3.  Formulate a new natural language program based on these refined observations. The coder will need to address both the trigger logic and the potential implementation bug.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the trigger conditions observed in the *Expected Outputs*:

**Object Definition:** A 4x4 square with a 1-pixel thick frame of a single non-white color (`frame_color`) and a 2x2 center of a different single non-white color (`center_color`).

**Action:** If triggered, draw lines extending horizontally to the right and vertically downwards from the two center rows/columns of the square. The drawing uses the `center_color` and proceeds only over white (0) pixels, stopping at the first non-white pixel or the grid boundary in each of the four directions (right for row 1, right for row 2, down for col 1, down for col 2).

**Trigger Analysis across Examples:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Squares (Frame=Green(3)): (G, R), (G, Y), (G, A)
    *   Expected Output Actions: Triggered for (G, Y) and (G, A). Not triggered for (G, R).
    *   Code Output Actions: Triggered only for (G, A) due to `!=2 and !=4` rule. (Also seems to have drawing bugs).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Squares (Frame=Red(2)): (R, Y), (R, G), (R, B)
    *   Expected Output Actions: Triggered for (R, G) and (R, B). Not triggered for (R, Y).
    *   Code Output Actions: Trigger condition `!=2 and !=4` *would* trigger for (R, G) and (R, B), but *no lines are drawn*, suggesting an implementation bug.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Squares (Frame=Blue(1)): (B, R), (B, G)
    *   Expected Output Actions: Triggered for (B, G). Not triggered for (B, R).
    *   Code Output Actions: Trigger condition `!=2 and !=4` *would* trigger for (B, G), but *no lines are drawn*, suggesting an implementation bug.

**Summary of Triggering Pairs (Frame, Center) from Expected Outputs:**
*   (Green=3, Yellow=4) -> Trigger
*   (Green=3, Azure=8) -> Trigger
*   (Red=2, Green=3) -> Trigger
*   (Red=2, Blue=1) -> Trigger
*   (Blue=1, Green=3) -> Trigger

**Summary of Non-Triggering Pairs (Frame, Center) from Expected Outputs:**
*   (Green=3, Red=2) -> No Trigger
*   (Red=2, Yellow=4) -> No Trigger
*   (Blue=1, Red=2) -> No Trigger

**Conclusion on Trigger Rule:** A square triggers the drawing action if its center color is *not* Red(2), **AND** if the specific (Frame, Center) pair is one of the observed triggering combinations: (Green, Yellow), (Green, Azure), (Red, Green), (Red, Blue), (Blue, Green). Alternatively stated:
    *   If Frame is Green(3), trigger if Center is Yellow(4) or Azure(8).
    *   If Frame is Red(2), trigger if Center is Green(3) or Blue(1).
    *   If Frame is Blue(1), trigger if Center is Green(3).
    *   (Center color Red(2) never triggers).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all instances of "Framed Square" objects. A "Framed Square" is a 4x4 area where:
    *   The 12 pixels forming the 1-pixel thick border are all of the same non-white color (`frame_color`).
    *   The 4 pixels forming the 2x2 center are all of the same non-white color (`center_color`).
    *   The `frame_color` is different from the `center_color`.
3.  For each "Framed Square" found at top-left position (r, c) with `frame_color` and `center_color`:
    *   Check if the specific pair (`frame_color`, `center_color`) matches any of the following triggering conditions:
        *   `frame_color` is Green (3) AND `center_color` is Yellow (4).
        *   `frame_color` is Green (3) AND `center_color` is Azure (8).
        *   `frame_color` is Red (2) AND `center_color` is Green (3).
        *   `frame_color` is Red (2) AND `center_color` is Blue (1).
        *   `frame_color` is Blue (1) AND `center_color` is Green (3).
    *   If a triggering condition is met:
        *   Set the `draw_color` to be the `center_color` of the square.
        *   Define the center rows: `r1 = r + 1`, `r2 = r + 2`.
        *   Define the center columns: `c1 = c + 1`, `c2 = c + 2`.
        *   **Draw Horizontal Lines:**
            *   Starting from column `c + 4`, iterate rightwards across the grid for row `r1`. Change any white (0) pixel to `draw_color`. Stop this horizontal line for row `r1` upon encountering the first non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
            *   Repeat the process for row `r2`, starting from column `c + 4`.
        *   **Draw Vertical Lines:**
            *   Starting from row `r + 4`, iterate downwards across the grid for column `c1`. Change any white (0) pixel to `draw_color`. Stop this vertical line for column `c1` upon encountering the first non-white pixel or the grid boundary.
            *   Repeat the process for column `c2`, starting from row `r + 4`.
4.  After checking all found "Framed Squares", return the modified output grid.
