task_context: "Identify specific 4x4 framed square objects in the input grid and, based on a condition involving the frame and center colors, draw lines extending horizontally rightwards and vertically downwards from the object's center rows/columns."

objects:
  - object: "Framed Square"
    definition: "A 4x4 area within the grid."
    properties:
      - frame: "A 1-pixel thick border (12 pixels total)."
      - frame_color: "A single, non-white color filling the frame pixels."
      - center: "A 2x2 block of pixels inside the frame."
      - center_color: "A single, non-white color filling the center pixels."
      - condition: "`frame_color` must be different from `center_color`."
      - location: "Defined by the top-left corner coordinates (row, col)."

trigger_condition:
  description: "A 'Framed Square' object triggers the drawing action based on its specific frame_color and center_color combination."
  rules:
    - "IF frame_color is Green(3) AND center_color is Yellow(4) THEN trigger."
    - "IF frame_color is Green(3) AND center_color is Azure(8) THEN trigger."
    - "IF frame_color is Red(2) AND center_color is Green(3) THEN trigger."
    - "IF frame_color is Red(2) AND center_color is Blue(1) THEN trigger."
    - "IF frame_color is Blue(1) AND center_color is Green(3) THEN trigger."
    - "OTHERWISE, do not trigger."
  notes: "Red(2) center_color never triggers the action regardless of frame_color."

action:
  description: "Draw lines extending from triggered 'Framed Square' objects."
  actor: "The 'Framed Square' object itself, specifically its center."
  target: "White(0) pixels in the grid located horizontally to the right of and vertically below the object."
  effect:
    - "Identify the center rows (r+1, r+2) and center columns (c+1, c+2) of the triggered square at (r, c)."
    - "Use the `center_color` as the `draw_color`."
    - "Horizontal Drawing:"
      - "For row r+1, starting at column c+4, move right. Fill each White(0) pixel with `draw_color` until a non-white pixel or the grid's right edge is reached."
      - "For row r+2, starting at column c+4, move right. Fill each White(0) pixel with `draw_color` until a non-white pixel or the grid's right edge is reached."
    - "Vertical Drawing:"
      - "For column c+1, starting at row r+4, move down. Fill each White(0) pixel with `draw_color` until a non-white pixel or the grid's bottom edge is reached."
      - "For column c+2, starting at row r+4, move down. Fill each White(0) pixel with `draw_color` until a non-white pixel or the grid's bottom edge is reached."
  output: "The initial grid modified with all drawn lines."
