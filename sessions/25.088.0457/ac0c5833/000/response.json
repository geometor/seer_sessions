This source red object seems uniquely identified by having a single yellow pixel (color 4) adjacent (touching sides or corners) to its bounding box.\n    *   There are multiple instances of a specific horizontal yellow pattern: `4 0 4` (yellow, white, yellow). These seem to act as \"target\" locations.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves copying the \"source\" red object and placing these copies onto the grid at positions relative to each \"target\" `4 0 4` pattern.\n6.  **Placement Rule:** The placement of the copied red object seems consistent across examples. The top-left corner of the bounding box of the copied red object is positioned 2 rows below and 1 column to the right of the *first* yellow pixel (the leftmost `4`) of the `4 0 4` target pattern.\n7.  **Overwriting:** The newly placed red pixels overwrite the existing pixels (typically white background) at the target locations.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
