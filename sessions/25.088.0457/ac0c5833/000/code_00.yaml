elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: colored pixels/objects
  - object: red_object
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: variable (connected red pixels)
      - role: potential source template OR pre-existing object
  - object: yellow_pixel
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - role: potential identifier for the source red object
  - object: yellow_pattern
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4), white (0)
      - shape: horizontal sequence `[4, 0, 4]`
      - role: target marker for placing copies

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: source red_object, single yellow_pixel
    description: A unique red object in the input is adjacent (border or corner touching) to a unique single yellow pixel. This identifies the source red object.
  - type: relative_positioning
    between: yellow_pattern, copied red_object
    description: A copy of the source red object is placed relative to each yellow_pattern.
    details: The top-left corner of the copied object is placed at (row + 2, col + 1), where (row, col) is the coordinate of the first '4' in the '4 0 4' pattern.

actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: source red_object
    using: adjacency to a single yellow_pixel
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: all yellow_patterns (`[4, 0, 4]`)
    using: pattern matching
  - action: copy
    actor: system
    source: source red_object
    destination: output grid
    condition: for each identified yellow_pattern
  - action: place
    actor: system
    object: copied red_object
    location: calculated relative to the corresponding yellow_pattern's starting '4' pixel (offset +2 rows, +1 column)
    effect: overwrites existing pixels in the output grid
