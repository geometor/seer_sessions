These frames and any colored objects fully enclosed within them remain unchanged between input and output.\n    *   Blue (1) pixels form various shapes outside of these gray frames.\n    *   The core transformation involves changing the color of the blue shapes located outside the gray frames.\n    *   The color used to replace the blue pixels is determined by the color of the object(s) found *inside* a gray frame in the input grid.\n    *   In each example, there is one dominant non-gray color inside a frame: red (2) in train_1 and train_4, and green (3) in train_2 and train_3. This color dictates the replacement color for the external blue shapes.\n    *   All other elements of the grid (background, gray frames, shapes inside frames) are preserved in the output.\n\n*   **Facts YAML**:\n    "
