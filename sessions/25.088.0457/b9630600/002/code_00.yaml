task_description: Fill enclosed white areas bounded by green pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (up to 30x30)
  - colors: Primarily white (0) and green (3). Other colors might be present but seem unaffected by the core transformation.

objects:
  - type: Boundary
    color: green (3)
    definition: Contiguous group of green pixels. Must form a closed loop to enclose an area.
    properties:
      - connectivity: Can be 4-connected (adjacent) or 8-connected (adjacent or diagonal) - Requires clarification based on examples. (The BFS code uses 4-connectivity for filling).
      - interaction_with_edge: A boundary touching the grid edge cannot enclose an area relative to that edge.
  - type: Background/Exterior
    color: white (0)
    definition: Areas of white pixels connected to the grid boundary via a path of white pixels (4-connectivity).
  - type: Interior
    color: white (0)
    definition: Areas of white pixels not connected to the grid boundary via a path of white pixels without crossing a non-white pixel (specifically, the green boundary).
    properties:
      - location: Must be spatially surrounded by the green boundary pixels.

actions:
  - name: Identify Boundary
    input: input_grid
    output: Set of coordinates for green pixels potentially forming boundaries.
  - name: Identify Exterior White Pixels
    input: input_grid
    method: Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all white pixels on the grid edges.
    connectivity: 4-way (horizontal/vertical steps only).
    output: Set of coordinates of all white pixels reachable from the grid edge.
  - name: Identify Interior White Pixels
    input: input_grid, set of exterior white pixel coordinates
    method: Find all white pixels in the grid that are *not* in the set of exterior white pixels.
    output: Set of coordinates of interior white pixels.
  - name: Fill Interior
    input: input_grid, set of interior white pixel coordinates
    output: output_grid
    change: Change the color of pixels at the interior coordinates from white (0) to green (3).
    preservation: All other pixels (green boundary, other colors, exterior white pixels) retain their original color.

invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain unchanged.
  - Pixels that are not white (0) in the input remain unchanged in the output, except potentially green boundary pixels if the definition changes. (Current logic: green pixels remain unchanged).
  - Pixels that are white (0) but are connected to the grid boundary remain white (0).

potential_issues:
  - The definition of "contiguous" and "enclosed" needs to be precise (4-way vs 8-way connectivity). The previous code implicitly used 4-way connectivity for the fill search.
  - Performance of the exterior pixel identification (BFS) on large or complex grids caused a timeout.
