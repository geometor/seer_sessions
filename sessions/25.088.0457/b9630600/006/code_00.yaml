task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with green.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - name: pixel
    type: A single cell in the grid.
  - name: white pixel
    type: A pixel with value 0.
  - name: green pixel
    type: A pixel with value 3.
  - name: boundary
    type: The set of pixels forming the top, bottom, left, or right edges of the grid.
  - name: path
    type: A sequence of adjacent (up, down, left, right) pixels.
  - name: boundary-connected white pixel
    type: A white pixel for which there exists a path consisting entirely of white pixels connecting it to the boundary.
  - name: interior white pixel
    type: A white pixel that is not boundary-connected.

input_features:
  - grid: The input grid containing pixels of various colors (0-9).
  - objects: Implicitly defined regions of contiguous pixels of the same color. Focus is on white regions (color 0).

output_features:
  - grid: The transformed grid.
  - structure: Dimensions remain the same as the input grid.
  - color_changes: Only interior white pixels change color.

actions:
  - action: identify
    condition: For each white pixel in the input grid.
    details: Determine if the white pixel is boundary-connected or interior. This can be done using a search algorithm (like BFS or DFS) starting from all boundary white pixels and marking all reachable white pixels.
  - action: change_color
    condition: If a white pixel is identified as interior.
    details: Change the color of the pixel from white (0) to green (3).
  - action: keep_color
    condition: If a pixel is not an interior white pixel (i.e., it's non-white or it's a boundary-connected white pixel).
    details: The pixel's color remains unchanged from the input grid.

constraints:
  - Grid dimensions are unchanged.
  - Only white pixels (0) can potentially change color.
  - The new color for changed pixels is always green (3).
  - Connectivity is based on 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right).
