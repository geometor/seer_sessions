task_description: Fill enclosed white regions with green.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - fill_color: green (3)
  - shapes: Formed by non-white pixels (various colors observed, e.g., blue, red).
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    properties: Can be 'exterior' (connected to grid boundary via white path) or 'interior' (enclosed by non-white pixels, not connected to boundary).
  - type: shapes/walls
    color: non-white (1-9)
    properties: Define boundaries that enclose interior white regions.
actions:
  - name: identify_exterior_white
    input: input_grid
    target: white pixels (0)
    condition: Connected to any grid boundary pixel via a path of adjacent (up, down, left, right) white pixels.
    output: Set of exterior white pixel coordinates.
  - name: identify_interior_white
    input: input_grid
    target: white pixels (0)
    condition: Not identified as 'exterior_white'.
    output: Set of interior white pixel coordinates.
  - name: fill_interior
    input: input_grid, interior_white_coordinates
    target: Pixels at interior_white_coordinates.
    output_grid_update: Change pixel color to green (3).
    condition: All other pixels retain their original color.
observations:
  - The original algorithm implementing 'identify_exterior_white' using BFS and coordinate sets timed out on at least one example, suggesting inefficiency for large connected exterior regions.
  - An alternative flood-fill approach modifying a grid copy seems logically equivalent and potentially more efficient.
  - Adjacency is assumed to be 4-way (up, down, left, right) based on standard ARC practice and the previous code.
