"""
Identifies white pixels (color 0) enclosed by non-white pixels and fills them with green (color 3). 
Enclosed means the white pixels are not connected to the grid boundary via a path of other white pixels.
Uses a flood-fill algorithm starting from the boundary white pixels to mark all 'exterior' white pixels. 
Any remaining white pixels after the flood-fill are considered 'interior' and are filled.
