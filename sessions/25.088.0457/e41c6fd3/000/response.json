These shapes are scattered across the grid. The output grids show the same shapes, preserving their internal structure (size and relative pixel arrangement), but repositioned. Specifically, all shapes in the output are aligned horizontally such that their top edges are on the same row. The horizontal positioning of each shape in the output corresponds to the horizontal position (leftmost column) of its bounding box in the input grid. The specific row chosen for alignment appears to be determined by the vertical position of the Azure-colored (color 8) shape in the input. The top row of the Azure shape's bounding box in the input dictates the alignment row for all shapes in the output.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
