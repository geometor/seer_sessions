## Perception

The input grids contain several distinct geometric shapes, each made of a single solid color (excluding white, which is the background). These shapes are scattered across the grid. The output grids show the same shapes, preserving their internal structure (size and relative pixel arrangement), but repositioned. Specifically, all shapes in the output are aligned horizontally such that their top edges are on the same row. The horizontal positioning of each shape in the output corresponds to the horizontal position (leftmost column) of its bounding box in the input grid. The specific row chosen for alignment appears to be determined by the vertical position of the Azure-colored (color 8) shape in the input. The top row of the Azure shape's bounding box in the input dictates the alignment row for all shapes in the output.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. White (0) is the background.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-white color. These represent distinct shapes.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) representing the color of the object's pixels.
      - shape: The specific arrangement of pixels forming the object.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object. Defined by top-left (y_min, x_min) and bottom-right (y_max, x_max) coordinates.
      - position: The location of the object's bounding box within the grid.
      - size: Height and width of the bounding box.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all distinct contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - action: find_bounding_boxes
    description: Determine the bounding box for each identified object.
  - action: locate_reference_object
    description: Find the object with the specific color Azure (8).
  - action: determine_alignment_row
    description: Get the top y-coordinate (y_min) from the bounding box of the Azure (8) object.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: reposition_objects
    description: >
      For each object identified in the input, copy its pixels to the output grid.
      The object's new top-left position in the output grid is set to (alignment_row, original_x_min),
      where alignment_row is the determined alignment row and original_x_min is the
      leftmost x-coordinate of the object's bounding box in the input grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: spatial_alignment
    description: >
      All objects in the output grid are aligned horizontally along a common row,
      determined by the Azure object's position in the input.
  - relationship: horizontal_order_preservation
    description: >
      The relative horizontal order of the objects (based on their leftmost x-coordinates)
      is preserved from input to output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected objects (contiguous groups of pixels of the same non-white color) in the input grid.
3.  For each identified object, determine its color and its bounding box (topmost row, bottommost row, leftmost column, rightmost column).
4.  Find the object whose color is Azure (8).
5.  Determine the target alignment row by taking the topmost row index (minimum y-coordinate) from the bounding box of the Azure object found in step 4.
6.  For each object identified in step 2 (including the Azure object):
    a.  Note its original leftmost column index (minimum x-coordinate) from its bounding box.
    b.  Calculate the object's new top-left position in the output grid: the row index is the target alignment row (from step 5), and the column index is the object's original leftmost column index (from step 6a).
    c.  Copy the pixels corresponding to this object from their original positions in the input grid to the output grid, starting at the calculated new top-left position. Ensure the relative positions of pixels within the object are maintained.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
