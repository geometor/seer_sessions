"""
Aligns all non-white objects horizontally based on the top row of the Azure (8) object.

1. Finds all contiguous objects of non-white colors in the input grid.
2. Determines the bounding box for each object.
3. Locates the Azure-colored (8) object.
4. Uses the top row index of the Azure object's bounding box as the target alignment row.
5. Creates an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
6. Copies each object from the input grid to the output grid, placing its top-left corner 
   at (target_alignment_row, original_leftmost_column_index).
