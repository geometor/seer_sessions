Task: Pattern Deviation Highlighting

InputGrid:
  Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  Properties:
    - Size: Fixed at 29x29
    - Background: Implicitly defined by repeating patterns and separators
    - Contains:
        - Separators:
            - Color: green (3)
            - Structure: Single rows and columns
            - Position: Indices 5, 11, 17, 23 for both rows and columns (i.e., r % 6 == 5 or c % 6 == 5)
        - Pattern Blocks:
            - Size: 5x5
            - Tiling: Arranged in a 5x5 meta-grid separated by the green separators.
            - Content: Mostly copies of a BasePattern, but may contain Deviations.

BasePattern:
  Source: InputGrid top-left 5x5 subgrid (rows 0-4, cols 0-4)
  Size: 5x5
  Role: Template for Pattern Blocks and basis for OutputGrid.

Deviations:
  Definition: A pixel at `(r, c)` within a Pattern Block in the InputGrid is a deviation if `InputGrid[r][c]` is not equal to `BasePattern[r % 6][c % 6]`.
  Location: Defined by the coordinates `(r, c)` in the InputGrid.
  MappedLocation: The corresponding coordinates `(pr, pc)` within the 5x5 BasePattern structure, where `pr = r % 6` and `pc = c % 6`.

OutputGrid:
  Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  Properties:
    - Size: Fixed at 5x5
  DerivationRule:
    - Initialize OutputGrid as a copy of the BasePattern.
    - Find all Deviations in the InputGrid.
    - For each Deviation found, identify its MappedLocation `(pr, pc)`.
    - Set the color of the pixel at `OutputGrid[pr][pc]` to blue (1).

HighlightColor: blue (1) - Used to mark deviation locations in the OutputGrid.
