Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 29x29. They exhibit a clear repeating structure. A 5x5 pattern appears tiled across the grid.
2.  **Separators:** These 5x5 patterns are separated by single rows and columns filled entirely with the color green (3). These separators occur at indices 5, 11, 17, and 23 (i.e., every 6th row/column starting from index 5).
3.  **Base Pattern:** The fundamental 5x5 pattern can be identified by looking at the top-left 5x5 subgrid (rows 0-4, columns 0-4) of the input.
4.  **Deviations:** While the input grid largely consists of repetitions of the base pattern, there are specific locations *within* the tiled 5x5 blocks where the pixel color differs from the corresponding pixel in the base pattern. These are deviations or anomalies.
5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a 5x5 grid.
6.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The output grid seems to be derived directly from the 5x5 base pattern found in the input. The modifications made to the base pattern to produce the output are determined by the locations of the deviations found within the larger input grid. Specifically, the locations *within the 5x5 pattern structure* where deviations occur in the input are marked with blue (1) in the output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Pattern Deviation Highlighting

InputGrid:
  Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  Properties:
    - Size: Fixed at 29x29
    - Background: Implicitly defined by repeating patterns and separators
    - Contains:
        - Separators:
            - Color: green (3)
            - Structure: Single rows and columns
            - Position: Indices 5, 11, 17, 23 for both rows and columns (i.e., r % 6 == 5 or c % 6 == 5)
        - Pattern Blocks:
            - Size: 5x5
            - Tiling: Arranged in a 5x5 meta-grid separated by the green separators.
            - Content: Mostly copies of a BasePattern, but may contain Deviations.

BasePattern:
  Source: InputGrid top-left 5x5 subgrid (rows 0-4, cols 0-4)
  Size: 5x5
  Role: Template for Pattern Blocks and basis for OutputGrid.

Deviations:
  Definition: A pixel at `(r, c)` within a Pattern Block in the InputGrid is a deviation if `InputGrid[r][c]` is not equal to `BasePattern[r % 6][c % 6]`.
  Location: Defined by the coordinates `(r, c)` in the InputGrid.
  MappedLocation: The corresponding coordinates `(pr, pc)` within the 5x5 BasePattern structure, where `pr = r % 6` and `pc = c % 6`.

OutputGrid:
  Type: 2D Array (Grid)
  Properties:
    - Size: Fixed at 5x5
  DerivationRule:
    - Initialize OutputGrid as a copy of the BasePattern.
    - Find all Deviations in the InputGrid.
    - For each Deviation found, identify its MappedLocation `(pr, pc)`.
    - Set the color of the pixel at `OutputGrid[pr][pc]` to blue (1).

HighlightColor: blue (1) - Used to mark deviation locations in the OutputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the "base pattern" as the 5x5 subgrid located at the top-left corner (rows 0-4, columns 0-4) of the input grid.
2.  Create the initial output grid by making an exact copy of this 5x5 base pattern.
3.  Examine every pixel `(r, c)` in the 29x29 input grid.
4.  Ignore any pixel that lies on a green separator line (where the row index `r` or column index `c` leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 6).
5.  For pixels *not* on a separator line, calculate their corresponding position within the 5x5 pattern structure: `pattern_row = r % 6`, `pattern_col = c % 6`.
6.  Compare the color of the input pixel `input[r][c]` with the color of the pixel at the corresponding position in the base pattern: `base_pattern[pattern_row][pattern_col]`.
7.  If the colors are different, this signifies a deviation. Modify the output grid by changing the color of the pixel at `output[pattern_row][pattern_col]` to blue (1).
8.  After checking all non-separator pixels in the input grid, the resulting modified 5x5 grid is the final output.
