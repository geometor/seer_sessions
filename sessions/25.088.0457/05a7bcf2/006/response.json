            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code, based on the initial analysis, failed with a timeout during execution on the training set. This indicates that while the core concept of an azure divider separating regions with distinct transformations might be correct, the implementation of the transformation logic, particularly the filling process, is either computationally too expensive or contains errors leading to infinite loops or excessive processing, possibly related to edge cases or interactions between rules within a region.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the transformation rules based on a careful review of all examples. We need to confirm the divider's role, the color change rule (yellow to green), and meticulously examine the filling mechanism:\n1.  What triggers the fill (presence of yellow/red anywhere in the region, or specific locations)?\n2.  Which cells are filled (only white cells, or overwriting existing colors)?\n3.  How is the boundary of the fill determined (closest pixel)?\n4.  How are conflicts handled if both yellow and red are present in the same region, triggering both yellow and azure fills?\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples to refine our understanding. We'll focus on the first training example initially, as it likely informed the previous attempt.\n\n*Assuming access to Example 1 (Input/Output Pair):*\n"

Determine its orientation (horizontal or vertical) and index (row or column number).\n2.  **Define Regions**: Based on the divider, identify the two distinct regions of the grid (e.g., Region 1: above/left, Region 2: below/right).\n3.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.\n4.  **Process Each Region Independently**: Apply the following steps sequentially within each region, using the *input* grid to determine conditions and locations, and modifying the *output* grid:\n    a.  **Color Change**: Check the *input* pixels within the current region. If any yellow (4) pixels are present, change *all* corresponding yellow (4) pixels in the *output* grid for this region to green (3). Red (2) pixels from the input remain red (2) in the output (this is handled by the initial copy unless overwritten by subsequent fills).\n    b.  **Fill Towards Divider**: For each line perpendicular to the divider (i.e., each column for a horizontal divider, each row for a vertical divider) that intersects the current region:\n        i.  **Yellow Fill**: Check if the *input* grid region originally contained *any* yellow (4) pixels. If yes:\n            - Find the yellow (4) pixel in the *input* grid on the current line that is closest to the divider.\n            - If such a pixel exists, identify all the cells on this line in the *output* grid strictly *between* that closest yellow pixel's original position and the divider.\n            - For each identified cell, if its corresponding cell in the *input* grid was white (0), change its color in the *output* grid to yellow (4).\n        ii. **Azure Fill**: Check if the *input* grid region originally contained *any* red (2) pixels. If yes:\n            - Find the red (2) pixel in the *input* grid on the current line that is closest to the divider.\n            - If such a pixel exists, identify all the cells on this line in the *output* grid strictly *between* that closest red pixel's original position and the divider.\n            - For each identified cell, if its corresponding cell in the *input* grid was white (0), change its color in the *output* grid to azure (8). (Note: This implies azure fill might overwrite a cell previously filled with yellow if both conditions are met and target the same original white cell, although this specific interaction scenario might not occur in the provided examples. If red and yellow occur in the same region, the exact behaviour in case of overlap needs confirmation from examples.)\n5.  **Final Output**: The modified output grid after processing both regions is the result."
