"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Locate the divider line (a full row or column of azure (8)).
2. Identify the orientation of the divider (horizontal or vertical).
3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4. For each yellow (4) pixel on one side of the divider:
   a. Change the yellow pixel to green (3) in the output grid.
   b. Fill the cells between the original yellow pixel's position and the divider line (along the axis perpendicular to the divider) with yellow (4) in the output grid.
5. For each red (2) pixel on the other side of the divider:
   a. Fill the cells between the divider line and the original red pixel's position (along the axis perpendicular to the divider) with azure (8) in the output grid. The original red pixel remains red.
