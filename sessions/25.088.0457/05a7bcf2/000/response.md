Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (30x30).
2.  **Key Colors:** The prominent colors are white (0 - background), yellow (4), red (2), and azure (8). Green (3) appears only in the output.
3.  **Divider:** A distinct feature in each input is a line (either a full row or a full column) composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. This line acts as a divider, separating the grid into two regions.
4.  **Objects:**
    *   Yellow (4) objects appear exclusively on one side of the azure divider.
    *   Red (2) objects appear exclusively on the other side of the azure divider.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve 'projecting' or 'extruding' the yellow and red objects towards the azure divider, changing the color of the original yellow objects and filling the space between the objects and the divider.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Properties:
    Size: Typically 30x30 in examples.
    Background: white (0).
Elements:
  - Type: Divider
    Color: azure (8)
    Shape: A single, continuous line (either horizontal row or vertical column) spanning the grid.
    Role: Separates the grid into two distinct regions.
  - Type: Object_Set_1
    Color: yellow (4)
    Location: Exclusively in the region on one side of the Divider.
    Shape: Variable, can be single pixels or contiguous blocks.
  - Type: Object_Set_2
    Color: red (2)
    Location: Exclusively in the region on the opposite side of the Divider relative to Object_Set_1.
    Shape: Variable, can be single pixels or contiguous blocks.
Transformation:
  - Action: Identify_Divider
    Input: Input grid
    Output: Divider line (row index or column index) and its orientation (horizontal or vertical).
  - Action: Process_Yellow_Objects
    Input: Yellow objects, Divider location/orientation
    Output: Modified grid section
    Rule:
      - For each yellow pixel (r, c):
        - Change its color to green (3) in the output.
        - Fill the space between this pixel and the Divider (along the row if divider is vertical, along the column if divider is horizontal) with yellow (4). Fill stops just before the divider line.
  - Action: Process_Red_Objects
    Input: Red objects, Divider location/orientation
    Output: Modified grid section
    Rule:
      - For each red pixel (r, c):
        - Keep its color red (2) in the output.
        - Fill the space between the Divider and this pixel (along the row if divider is vertical, along the column if divider is horizontal) with azure (8). Fill starts just after the divider line and stops just before the red pixel.
Relationships:
  - Yellow objects and Red objects are separated by the azure Divider.
  - The transformation (filling) happens *towards* the Divider.
  - Original yellow pixels change color; original red pixels do not.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  **Find Divider:** Scan the input grid to locate the divider, which is the first complete row or complete column consisting solely of azure (8) pixels. Record its index (`d_r` or `d_c`) and orientation ('horizontal' or 'vertical').
3.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct, contiguous objects composed of yellow (4) pixels and all distinct, contiguous objects composed of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Process Based on Divider Orientation:**
    *   **If the Divider is Horizontal (at row `d_r`):**
        *   Select yellow objects that are entirely *above* the divider (`max_row < d_r`).
        *   Select red objects that are entirely *below* the divider (`min_row > d_r`).
        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected yellow object:
            *   Set the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).
            *   Fill the column `c` in the output grid from row `r + 1` up to (but not including) row `d_r` with yellow (4).
        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected red object:
            *   Fill the column `c` in the output grid from row `d_r + 1` up to (but not including) row `r` with azure (8). (The original red pixel at `(r, c)` remains red from the initial copy).
    *   **If the Divider is Vertical (at column `d_c`):**
        *   Select yellow objects that are entirely to the *left* of the divider (`max_col < d_c`).
        *   Select red objects that are entirely to the *right* of the divider (`min_col > d_c`).
        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected yellow object:
            *   Set the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).
            *   Fill the row `r` in the output grid from column `c + 1` up to (but not including) column `d_c` with yellow (4).
        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected red object:
            *   Fill the row `r` in the output grid from column `d_c + 1` up to (but not including) column `c` with azure (8). (The original red pixel at `(r, c)` remains red from the initial copy).
5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the result.
