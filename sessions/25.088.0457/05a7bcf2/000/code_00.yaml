Grid:
  Properties:
    Size: Typically 30x30 in examples.
    Background: white (0).
Elements:
  - Type: Divider
    Color: azure (8)
    Shape: A single, continuous line (either horizontal row or vertical column) spanning the grid.
    Role: Separates the grid into two distinct regions.
  - Type: Object_Set_1
    Color: yellow (4)
    Location: Exclusively in the region on one side of the Divider.
    Shape: Variable, can be single pixels or contiguous blocks.
  - Type: Object_Set_2
    Color: red (2)
    Location: Exclusively in the region on the opposite side of the Divider relative to Object_Set_1.
    Shape: Variable, can be single pixels or contiguous blocks.
Transformation:
  - Action: Identify_Divider
    Input: Input grid
    Output: Divider line (row index or column index) and its orientation (horizontal or vertical).
  - Action: Process_Yellow_Objects
    Input: Yellow objects, Divider location/orientation
    Output: Modified grid section
    Rule:
      - For each yellow pixel (r, c):
        - Change its color to green (3) in the output.
        - Fill the space between this pixel and the Divider (along the row if divider is vertical, along the column if divider is horizontal) with yellow (4). Fill stops just before the divider line.
  - Action: Process_Red_Objects
    Input: Red objects, Divider location/orientation
    Output: Modified grid section
    Rule:
      - For each red pixel (r, c):
        - Keep its color red (2) in the output.
        - Fill the space between the Divider and this pixel (along the row if divider is vertical, along the column if divider is horizontal) with azure (8). Fill starts just after the divider line and stops just before the red pixel.
Relationships:
  - Yellow objects and Red objects are separated by the azure Divider.
  - The transformation (filling) happens *towards* the Divider.
  - Original yellow pixels change color; original red pixels do not.
