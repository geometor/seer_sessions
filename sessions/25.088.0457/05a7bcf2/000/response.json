Green (3) appears only in the output.\n3.  **Divider:** A distinct feature in each input is a line (either a full row or a full column) composed entirely of azure (8) pixels. This line acts as a divider, separating the grid into two regions.\n4.  **Objects:**\n    *   Yellow (4) objects appear exclusively on one side of the azure divider.\n    *   Red (2) objects appear exclusively on the other side of the azure divider.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve 'projecting' or 'extruding' the yellow and red objects towards the azure divider, changing the color of the original yellow objects and filling the space between the objects and the divider.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Record its index (`d_r` or `d_c`) and orientation ('horizontal' or 'vertical').\n3.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct, contiguous objects composed of yellow (4) pixels and all distinct, contiguous objects composed of red (2) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Process Based on Divider Orientation:**\n    *   **If the Divider is Horizontal (at row `d_r`):**\n        *   Select yellow objects that are entirely *above* the divider (`max_row < d_r`).\n        *   Select red objects that are entirely *below* the divider (`min_row > d_r`).\n        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected yellow object:\n            *   Set the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).\n            *   Fill the column `c` in the output grid from row `r + 1` up to (but not including) row `d_r` with yellow (4).\n        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected red object:\n            *   Fill the column `c` in the output grid from row `d_r + 1` up to (but not including) row `r` with azure (8). (The original red pixel at `(r, c)` remains red from the initial copy).\n    *   **If the Divider is Vertical (at column `d_c`):**\n        *   Select yellow objects that are entirely to the *left* of the divider (`max_col < d_c`).\n        *   Select red objects that are entirely to the *right* of the divider (`min_col > d_c`).\n        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected yellow object:\n            *   Set the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).\n            *   Fill the row `r` in the output grid from column `c + 1` up to (but not including) column `d_c` with yellow (4).\n        *   For each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to a selected red object:\n            *   Fill the row `r` in the output grid from column `d_c + 1` up to (but not including) column `c` with azure (8).
