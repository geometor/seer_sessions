task_description: "Transform grid based on a divider line, filling areas and changing colors relative to the divider."

grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - divider:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: single full row or column
      orientation: horizontal or vertical
      persistence: remains unchanged in the output

objects:
  - type: source_yellow
    color: yellow (4)
    location: one side of the divider (e.g., above horizontal, left of vertical)
    actions:
      - change_color: to green (3) at original location
      - conditional_fill:
          condition: if space exists between this pixel and the divider along the axis perpendicular to the divider.
          target_area: cells between the pixel's location and the divider along the perpendicular axis.
          fill_color: yellow (4)
          interaction: Only the source_yellow pixel closest to the divider in its row/column triggers the fill for that row/column.
  - type: source_red
    color: red (2)
    location: the other side of the divider (e.g., below horizontal, right of vertical)
    actions:
      - retain_color: remains red (2) at original location
      - conditional_fill:
          condition: if space exists between this pixel and the divider along the axis perpendicular to the divider.
          target_area: cells between the pixel's location and the divider along the perpendicular axis.
          fill_color: azure (8)
          interaction: Only the source_red pixel closest to the divider in its row/column triggers the fill for that row/column.

output_grid:
  derivation: Start with a copy of the input grid, then apply modifications based on source_yellow and source_red objects.
