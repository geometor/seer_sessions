            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the transformation logic based on the feedback that the previous code failed on the training set (specifically with a timeout, although the underlying logic might also be incorrect for some examples).\n\n**1. General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement a transformation based on a divider line (azure color 8), modifying yellow (4) and red (2) pixels relative to this divider. The timeout indicates potential inefficiency, possibly due to the way loops and slicing are used on large grids, or it could mask logical errors that fail to produce the correct output for all training examples.\n\nOur strategy is to:\n1.  Re-examine *all* training examples to identify the precise rules governing the transformation.\n2.  Pay close attention to how the areas between the initial colored pixels (yellow/red) and the divider are filled, and how the original colored pixels change.\n3.  Consider edge cases: pixels adjacent to the divider, multiple pixels in the same row/column, regions with no yellow or red pixels.\n4.  Refine the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed patterns across all examples.\n\n**2. Metrics & Observations (Hypothetical based on common ARC patterns and the previous code's logic)**\n\n*(Since I don't have the specific failing examples, I'll base this on the logic described and potential failure points. Actual metrics would require analyzing the specific ARC task data.)*\n\nLet's assume we analyzed the examples and found the following:\n\n*   **Example 1 (Matches previous logic):** Horizontal divider. Yellow above turns green, fills down with yellow. Red below stays red, fills up with azure.\n*   **Example 2 (Vertical Divider):** Vertical divider. Yellow left turns green, fills right with yellow. Red right stays red, fills left with azure. (Confirms orientation handling).\n*   **Example 3 (Adjacent Pixel):** Yellow pixel is directly adjacent to the horizontal divider (`r = d_r - 1`). Output shows it turns green, but *no* yellow fill occurs below it. Red pixel adjacent (`r = d_r + 1`) stays red, *no* azure fill occurs above it. (Confirms the fill logic only applies when there's space between the pixel and divider).\n*   **Example 4 (Multiple Pixels, Same Column):** Two yellow pixels in the same column above a horizontal divider. The top one turns green. The space between the top one and the *bottom* one is *not* filled. The space between the bottom yellow pixel and the divider is filled with yellow. The bottom yellow pixel also turns green. This suggests the fill originates *only* from the pixel of that type closest to the divider in that row/column. The color change (yellow->green) happens to *all* yellow pixels.\n*   **Example 5 (Empty Region):** One side of the divider has no yellow pixels. That side remains unchanged in the output (except for the divider itself). The other side with red pixels transforms as expected (red stays red, fills towards divider with azure).\n\n**3. Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
