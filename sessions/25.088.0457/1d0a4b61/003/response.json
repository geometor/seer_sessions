Determine the grid dimensions (Height H, Width W). Handle grids too small \n    for a border and pattern.\n2.  Identify the repeating pattern's period, `p`. Find the smallest integer `p >= 1` \n    such that the non-white pixels in the subgrid `input[1:1+p, 1:1+p]` are \n    consistent with the non-white pixels in the subgrids to its right \n    (`input[1:1+p, 1+p:1+2*p]`) and below it (`input[1+p:1+2*p, 1:1+p]`).\n    Handle cases where a period cannot be determined.\n3.  Reconstruct the canonical `p x p` pattern unit, `clean_pattern_unit`. \n    Initialize a `p x p` grid with white (0). Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` \n    in the interior of the input grid (`1 <= r < H-1`, `1 <= c < W-1`). If \n    `input[r, c]` is not white (0), determine its position `(pr, pc)` within \n    the pattern (`pr = (r-1)%p`, `pc = (c-1)%p`). If the corresponding cell \n    `clean_pattern_unit[pr, pc]` is still white (0), update it with the value \n    from `input[r, c]`. This ensures the clean pattern is built from the first \n    observed non-white pixel for each pattern position.\n4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions H x W.\n5.  Set the border of the output grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1) \n    to blue (color 1).\n6.  Fill the interior of the output grid (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2) \n    by tiling the reconstructed `clean_pattern_unit`. For each cell `(r, c)` \n    where `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set the output cell color to \n    `output[r, c] = clean_pattern_unit[(r-1) % p, (c-1) % p]`.\n7.
