Determine the grid dimensions (Height H, Width W).\n2.  Identify the repeating pattern's period, `p`. This is done by finding the \n    smallest integer `p >= 1` such that the subgrid `input[1:1+p, 1:1+p]` is \n    consistent with the subgrids to its right (`input[1:1+p, 1+p:1+2*p]`) and \n    below it (`input[1+p:1+2*p, 1:1+p]`), ignoring any white (0) pixels during \n    the comparison. This assumes the top-left `p x p` area inside the border is \n    representative and potentially noise-free enough to define the pattern.\n3.  Extract the canonical `p x p` pattern unit, `P`, from the top-left corner \n    inside the border: `P = input[1 : 1+p, 1 : 1+p]`.\n4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions H x W.\n5.  Set the border of the output grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1) \n    to blue (color 1).\n6.  Fill the interior of the output grid (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2) \n    by repeating the pattern unit `P`. For each cell `(r, c)` where \n    `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set the output cell color to \n    `output[r, c] = P[(r-1) % p, (c-1) % p]`.\n7.
