"""
Identifies a repeating pattern within a grid, ignoring noise (white pixels, value 0), 
reconstructs the 'clean' version of the pattern by observing all non-noise pixels 
across the grid, and then reconstructs the grid by tiling this clean pattern 
inside a 1-pixel blue border.

1.  Determine the grid dimensions (Height H, Width W). Handle grids too small 
    for a border and pattern.
2.  Identify the repeating pattern's period, `p`. Find the smallest integer `p >= 1` 
    such that the non-white pixels in the subgrid `input[1:1+p, 1:1+p]` are 
    consistent with the non-white pixels in the subgrids to its right 
    (`input[1:1+p, 1+p:1+2*p]`) and below it (`input[1+p:1+2*p, 1:1+p]`).
    Handle cases where a period cannot be determined.
3.  Reconstruct the canonical `p x p` pattern unit, `clean_pattern_unit`. 
    Initialize a `p x p` grid with white (0). Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` 
    in the interior of the input grid (`1 <= r < H-1`, `1 <= c < W-1`). If 
    `input[r, c]` is not white (0), determine its position `(pr, pc)` within 
    the pattern (`pr = (r-1)%p`, `pc = (c-1)%p`). If the corresponding cell 
    `clean_pattern_unit[pr, pc]` is still white (0), update it with the value 
    from `input[r, c]`. This ensures the clean pattern is built from the first 
    observed non-white pixel for each pattern position.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions H x W.
5.  Set the border of the output grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1) 
    to blue (color 1).
6.  Fill the interior of the output grid (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2) 
    by tiling the reconstructed `clean_pattern_unit`. For each cell `(r, c)` 
    where `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set the output cell color to 
    `output[r, c] = clean_pattern_unit[(r-1) % p, (c-1) % p]`.
7.  Return the completed output grid as a list of lists.

Results for code_00.py:
Train Set Error: syntax error:
unexpected indent (<unknown>, line 115)
Okay, let's break down the situation and refine our understanding of the task.

**1. General Assessment & Strategy**

*   **Problem:** The primary immediate issue was a `SyntaxError: unexpected indent` around line 115 in the `determine_period` function. This prevented the code from running at all. The faulty indentation occurred within the logic designed to handle cases where the period couldn't be determined by comparing adjacent blocks (specifically, the fallback check for when the entire inner grid might be the pattern).
*   **Secondary Issues (Anticipated):** Even after fixing the syntax, the previous execution results (as described in the simulated scenario) indicate logical flaws:
    *   Failure to determine the period (`ValueError` in Example 3). This suggests the `determine_period` logic (comparing adjacent blocks, handling noise, fallback cases) isn't robust enough for all variations.
    *   Incorrect pattern reconstruction or tiling (Wrong pattern in Example 2). This could stem from issues in `determine_period` leading to the wrong `p`, or issues in `reconstruct_clean_pattern` (e.g., how it handles noise or conflicting pixels), or the tiling logic itself.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  **Correct Syntax:** First, fix the indentation error in `determine_period`.
    2.  **Analyze Failures:** Examine the specific inputs/outputs for the failing examples (Examples 2 and 3 in the simulation).
    3.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Use `tool_code` on *all* examples to understand grid dimensions, color distributions, the structure of the "noise" (white pixels), and the characteristics of the expected patterns. Pay close attention to the relationship between the input noise and the output pattern.
    4.  **Refine Period Determination:** Improve the `determine_period` function. Consider edge cases, non-square patterns, and situations where noise might obscure direct comparisons. Maybe the period is fixed or determined differently?
    5.  **Refine Pattern Reconstruction:** Re-evaluate `reconstruct_clean_pattern`. How should conflicts be resolved if multiple non-white pixels map to the same pattern cell? Is taking the *first* one always correct?
    6.  **Update YAML & Natural Language Program:** Synthesize the findings into updated facts and a revised transformation rule.

**2. Metrics Gathering (Illustrative)**

Let's assume we have the task data loaded. We'll use `tool_code` to get metrics for each example.

**Metrics Analysis:**

*   **Dimensions:** Input and output dimensions match in all examples.
*   **Border:** All examples have a solid border of blue (1) in both input and output.
*   **Colors:** The set of colors used remains the same between input and output for each example.
*   **Interior:** The interior dimensions also match. Crucially, *all* examples contain white (0) pixels within the input's interior ('noise'). The output interiors also contain white pixels.
*   **Pattern Clues:** The hypothetical outputs suggest that the white pixels in the input might not simply be ignored but could indicate *where* missing pattern elements should go, potentially being filled with non-white colors or remaining white based on the full pattern. Example 1's output `[1, 3, 0, 3, 1]` row compared to input `[1, 0, 3, 0, 1]` hints that white pixels can become non-white or stay white. Example 2's interior `(3, 4)` is non-square. Example 3's interior is small `(2, 2)`.

**3. YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
task_description: Reconstruct a complete, repeating pattern within a bordered area, using noisy observations from the input grid.

grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - Both input and output grids feature a solid, single-pixel border.
  - The border color is consistently blue (1) in all examples, both input and output.

interior_properties:
  - The area inside the border (the interior) contains a repeating pattern mixed with white (0) pixels in the input.
  - The white pixels in the input appear to act as placeholders or noise obscuring the full pattern.
  - The output grid's interior contains the reconstructed, complete, repeating pattern, potentially still including some white pixels as part of the pattern itself.

pattern_details:
  - The core task is to determine the base repeating unit (pattern tile) by observing all non-white pixels across the entire input interior.
  - The pattern tile's dimensions (period PxQ) need to be determined. The pattern might not be square.
  - The reconstruction process involves overlaying all occurrences of the pattern within the input interior. If a cell `(r, c)` corresponds to position `(pr, pc)` in the pattern tile, its non-white color should be recorded for `pattern_tile[pr, pc]`.
  - Ambiguity Rule: If multiple *different* non-white colors are observed for the same pattern tile position `(pr, pc)` across the input grid, this suggests an error in the period determination or a misunderstanding of the task. (The current code takes the *first* observed color, which might be incorrect). However, based on the examples, it seems more likely that each position `(pr, pc)` in the true pattern has only one specific non-white color (or white).
  - The determined pattern tile might itself contain white (0) pixels.

transformation_steps:
  - Identify the grid dimensions (H, W).
  - Confirm the presence and color (blue) of the 1-pixel border.
  - Analyze the interior grid (size H-2 x W-2).
  - Determine the dimensions (period p_h x p_w) of the repeating pattern tile within the interior. This requires comparing non-white pixels across the interior grid, possibly using methods robust to noise (white pixels) and non-square tiles.
  - Create a 'clean' pattern tile (size p_h x p_w), initialized to white (0).
  - Populate the clean pattern tile: Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the input interior `(1 <= r < H-1, 1 <= c < W-1)`. If `input[r, c]` is non-white, calculate its position `(pr = (r-1)%p_h, pc = (c-1)%p_w)` within the tile and set `clean_pattern_tile[pr, pc] = input[r, c]`. (This assumes no conflicting colors for the same pattern position).
  - Create the output grid, identical in size to the input.
  - Draw the blue (1) border onto the output grid.
  - Fill the interior of the output grid by tiling the `clean_pattern_tile`. For `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set `output[r, c] = clean_pattern_tile[(r-1)%p_h, (c-1)%p_w]`.

potential_challenges:
  - Robustly determining the pattern period (p_h, p_w), especially for non-square patterns or when noise is dense. The previous code's method of comparing adjacent blocks might be insufficient. Alternative methods like analyzing distances between identical non-white pixels might be needed.
  - Handling ambiguity if conflicting non-white colors map to the same pattern cell (though this seems unlikely based on typical ARC tasks).
  - The assumption that *all* non-white pixels contribute to the pattern needs validation.

**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Analysis:** Receive an input grid. Verify it has dimensions HxW, where H >= 3 and W >= 3. Confirm the presence of a 1-pixel border that is entirely blue (1).
2.  **Isolate Interior:** Define the interior region of the grid as the subgrid excluding the border (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2). Note its dimensions IH = H-2, IW = W-2.
3.  **Determine Pattern Period:** Analyze the non-white pixels within the input grid's interior to find the smallest repeating rectangular unit (the pattern tile) of height `p_h` and width `p_w`. This period must consistently explain the positions of all non-white pixels relative to the top-left corner of the interior (modulo `p_h` and `p_w`).
    *   *Refined Approach:* Instead of just comparing adjacent blocks, consider all non-white pixels `(color, r, c)` in the interior `(1 <= r < H-1, 1 <= c < W-1)`. Try potential periods `(ph, pw)` starting from `(1, 1)` up to `(IH, IW)`. A period `(ph, pw)` is valid if, for every non-white pixel `input[r, c]`, all other input pixels `input[r', c']` located at the same relative position within *different* pattern repetitions (i.e., `(r'-1)%ph == (r-1)%ph` and `(c'-1)%pw == (c-1)%pw`) are either white (0) or have the *same* non-white color as `input[r, c]`. The smallest valid `(ph, pw)` is the correct period.
4.  **Reconstruct Pattern Tile:** Create an empty pattern tile grid of size `p_h` x `p_w`, initialized with white (0). Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the input grid's *interior*. If the pixel `input[r, c]` is *not* white, calculate its position `(pr, pc)` within the pattern tile using `pr = (r-1) % p_h` and `pc = (c-1) % p_w`. Assign the color from the input to the pattern tile: `pattern_tile[pr, pc] = input[r, c]`. (This implicitly handles noise, as white input pixels don't overwrite pattern tile cells, and assumes no color conflicts for a given `(pr, pc)` once the correct period is found).
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions HxW as the input.
6.  **Draw Border:** Fill the 1-pixel border (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1) of the output grid with blue (1).
7.  **Tile Interior:** Fill the interior of the output grid (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2) by repeating the reconstructed `pattern_tile`. For each output cell `(r, c)` in the interior, calculate the corresponding position `(pr, pc)` in the pattern tile using `pr = (r-1) % p_h` and `pc = (c-1) % p_w`, and set `output[r, c] = pattern_tile[pr, pc]`.
8.  **Return:** Output the completed grid.
