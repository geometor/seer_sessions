Task: Repair noisy repeating patterns within a border.

Elements:
  - Grid: A 2D array of colored pixels.
    Properties:
      - dimensions: Same for input and output (e.g., 25x25).
      - background_color: Blue (1), typically forms a 1-pixel border.
      - noise_color: White (0), appears only in input grids.
  - Pattern: A rectangular unit of pixels that tiles the area inside the border.
    Properties:
      - size: Varies per example (e.g., 7x7, 6x6, 4x4).
      - location: Tiles the grid area inside the 1-pixel border.
    Relationships:
      - Corrupted by: Noise pixels (white) in the input grid.
      - Restored in: Output grid.
  - Border: A 1-pixel wide frame around the grid.
    Properties:
      - color: Blue (1).
      - location: Outermost rows and columns.

Actions:
  - Identify:
      - Grid dimensions.
      - The repeating pattern unit (size and content) from an undamaged area of the input.
      - The locations of noise pixels (white).
  - Reconstruct:
      - Create an output grid of the same dimensions.
      - Copy the border from the input (or assume a blue border).
      - Fill the interior of the output grid by tiling the identified pattern unit.

Relationships:
  - The output grid is a "cleaned" version of the input grid.
  - White pixels in the input are replaced by the corresponding pixel from the underlying pattern in the output.
  - The pattern repeats modulo its dimensions within the inner grid area (excluding the border).
