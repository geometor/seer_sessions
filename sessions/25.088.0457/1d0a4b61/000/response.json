            "text": "Okay, let's analyze these examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 25x25 grids for both input and output.\n2.  **Border:** There is a consistent 1-pixel wide border of blue (color 1) around the edge of the grids in both input and output, although sometimes the input border is interrupted by white pixels.\n3.  **Repeating Patterns:** The area inside the blue border is filled with a repeating pattern of colors. The pattern itself and its size differ between examples:\n    *   Example 1 uses a 7x7 repeating unit.\n    *   Example 2 uses a 6x6 repeating unit.\n    *   Example 3 uses a 4x4 repeating unit.\n4.  **Noise/Damage:** The input grids contain areas where the underlying pattern is replaced by white pixels (color 0). These white areas appear as noise or damage corrupting the pattern.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation consists of \"repairing\" the input grid. The white noise pixels are removed, and the underlying repeating pattern is restored in those locations. The output grid is a perfectly tiled version of the pattern, enclosed within the blue border.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Find the smallest integer `p >= 2` such that the subgrid `input[1:1+p, 1:1+p]` matches the subgrids `input[1+p:1+2*p, 1:1+p]` and `input[1:1+p, 1+p:1+2*p]`, ignoring any white (0) pixels during the comparison and ensuring indices stay within the bounds `[1, H-2]` and `[1, W-2]`.\n3.  Extract the canonical `p x p` pattern unit, `P`, from the top-left corner inside the border: `P = input[1 : 1+p, 1 : 1+p]`. Assume this area is not corrupted by noise (which holds true in the examples).\n4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions H x W.\n5.  Set the border of the output grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1) to blue (color 1).\n6.  Fill the interior of the output grid (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2) by repeating the pattern unit `P`. For each cell `(r, c)` where `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set the output cell color to `output[r, c] = P[(r-1) % p, (c-1) % p]`.\n7.  Return the completed output grid."
