Okay, let's analyze these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use 25x25 grids for both input and output.
2.  **Border:** There is a consistent 1-pixel wide border of blue (color 1) around the edge of the grids in both input and output, although sometimes the input border is interrupted by white pixels.
3.  **Repeating Patterns:** The area inside the blue border is filled with a repeating pattern of colors. The pattern itself and its size differ between examples:
    *   Example 1 uses a 7x7 repeating unit.
    *   Example 2 uses a 6x6 repeating unit.
    *   Example 3 uses a 4x4 repeating unit.
4.  **Noise/Damage:** The input grids contain areas where the underlying pattern is replaced by white pixels (color 0). These white areas appear as noise or damage corrupting the pattern.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation consists of "repairing" the input grid. The white noise pixels are removed, and the underlying repeating pattern is restored in those locations. The output grid is a perfectly tiled version of the pattern, enclosed within the blue border.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
Task: Repair noisy repeating patterns within a border.

Elements:
  - Grid: A 2D array of colored pixels.
    Properties:
      - dimensions: Same for input and output (e.g., 25x25).
      - background_color: Blue (1), typically forms a 1-pixel border.
      - noise_color: White (0), appears only in input grids.
  - Pattern: A rectangular unit of pixels that tiles the area inside the border.
    Properties:
      - size: Varies per example (e.g., 7x7, 6x6, 4x4).
      - location: Tiles the grid area inside the 1-pixel border.
    Relationships:
      - Corrupted by: Noise pixels (white) in the input grid.
      - Restored in: Output grid.
  - Border: A 1-pixel wide frame around the grid.
    Properties:
      - color: Blue (1).
      - location: Outermost rows and columns.

Actions:
  - Identify:
      - Grid dimensions.
      - The repeating pattern unit (size and content) from an undamaged area of the input.
      - The locations of noise pixels (white).
  - Reconstruct:
      - Create an output grid of the same dimensions.
      - Copy the border from the input (or assume a blue border).
      - Fill the interior of the output grid by tiling the identified pattern unit.

Relationships:
  - The output grid is a "cleaned" version of the input grid.
  - White pixels in the input are replaced by the corresponding pixel from the underlying pattern in the output.
  - The pattern repeats modulo its dimensions within the inner grid area (excluding the border).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the input grid.
2.  Identify the repeating pattern's period, `p`. Find the smallest integer `p >= 2` such that the subgrid `input[1:1+p, 1:1+p]` matches the subgrids `input[1+p:1+2*p, 1:1+p]` and `input[1:1+p, 1+p:1+2*p]`, ignoring any white (0) pixels during the comparison and ensuring indices stay within the bounds `[1, H-2]` and `[1, W-2]`.
3.  Extract the canonical `p x p` pattern unit, `P`, from the top-left corner inside the border: `P = input[1 : 1+p, 1 : 1+p]`. Assume this area is not corrupted by noise (which holds true in the examples).
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions H x W.
5.  Set the border of the output grid (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1) to blue (color 1).
6.  Fill the interior of the output grid (rows 1 to H-2, columns 1 to W-2) by repeating the pattern unit `P`. For each cell `(r, c)` where `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set the output cell color to `output[r, c] = P[(r-1) % p, (c-1) % p]`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
