task_description: Reconstruct a complete, repeating pattern within a bordered area, using noisy observations from the input grid.

grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - Both input and output grids feature a solid, single-pixel border.
  - The border color is consistently blue (1) in all examples, both input and output.

interior_properties:
  - The area inside the border (the interior) contains a repeating pattern mixed with white (0) pixels in the input.
  - The white pixels in the input appear to act as placeholders or noise obscuring the full pattern.
  - The output grid's interior contains the reconstructed, complete, repeating pattern, potentially still including some white pixels as part of the pattern itself.

pattern_details:
  - The core task is to determine the base repeating unit (pattern tile) by observing all non-white pixels across the entire input interior.
  - The pattern tile's dimensions (period PxQ) need to be determined. The pattern might not be square.
  - The reconstruction process involves overlaying all occurrences of the pattern within the input interior. If a cell `(r, c)` corresponds to position `(pr, pc)` in the pattern tile, its non-white color should be recorded for `pattern_tile[pr, pc]`.
  - Ambiguity Rule: If multiple *different* non-white colors are observed for the same pattern tile position `(pr, pc)` across the input grid, this suggests an error in the period determination or a misunderstanding of the task. (The current code takes the *first* observed color, which might be incorrect). However, based on the examples, it seems more likely that each position `(pr, pc)` in the true pattern has only one specific non-white color (or white).
  - The determined pattern tile might itself contain white (0) pixels.

transformation_steps:
  - Identify the grid dimensions (H, W).
  - Confirm the presence and color (blue) of the 1-pixel border.
  - Analyze the interior grid (size H-2 x W-2).
  - Determine the dimensions (period p_h x p_w) of the repeating pattern tile within the interior. This requires comparing non-white pixels across the interior grid, possibly using methods robust to noise (white pixels) and non-square tiles.
  - Create a 'clean' pattern tile (size p_h x p_w), initialized to white (0).
  - Populate the clean pattern tile: Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` in the input interior `(1 <= r < H-1, 1 <= c < W-1)`. If `input[r, c]` is non-white, calculate its position `(pr = (r-1)%p_h, pc = (c-1)%p_w)` within the tile and set `clean_pattern_tile[pr, pc] = input[r, c]`. (This assumes no conflicting colors for the same pattern position).
  - Create the output grid, identical in size to the input.
  - Draw the blue (1) border onto the output grid.
  - Fill the interior of the output grid by tiling the `clean_pattern_tile`. For `1 <= r < H-1` and `1 <= c < W-1`, set `output[r, c] = clean_pattern_tile[(r-1)%p_h, (c-1)%p_w]`.

potential_challenges:
  - Robustly determining the pattern period (p_h, p_w), especially for non-square patterns or when noise is dense. The previous code's method of comparing adjacent blocks might be insufficient. Alternative methods like analyzing distances between identical non-white pixels might be needed.
  - Handling ambiguity if conflicting non-white colors map to the same pattern cell (though this seems unlikely based on typical ARC tasks).
  - The assumption that *all* non-white pixels contribute to the pattern needs validation.
