"""
Identify all white (0) pixels directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) 
to any azure (8) pixel in the input grid. Starting from these adjacent white 
pixels, perform a flood fill using yellow (4). The fill should only spread 
into other white (0) pixels and stop at the grid boundaries or any non-white 
pixel (including the original azure pixels and any other colored objects). 
All original non-white pixels retain their color.
