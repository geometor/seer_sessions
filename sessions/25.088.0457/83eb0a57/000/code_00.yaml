observations:
  - item: Grid Properties
    properties:
      - Input grids are large (30x30).
      - Output grids are smaller and vary in size.
      - Each input grid has a single dominant background color.
  - item: Objects
    properties:
      - Inputs contain 2 or 3 distinct, contiguous, non-background objects.
      - Objects are composed of 1 or 2 colors plus the common color (if applicable).
      - Objects can be identified by finding connected components of non-background colors.
  - item: Color Analysis
    properties:
      - A 'common color' often exists, appearing in multiple non-background objects within the same input (Green in T1, Red in T2, Blue in T3).
      - Each non-background object also possesses 'unique colors' not shared (or shared differently) with others (Blue/Red in T1, Blue/Green in T2, Red/Azure/Yellow in T3).
  - item: Transformation Rules
    properties:
      - Rule seems dependent on the number of non-background objects and their color composition.
      - Rule involves selecting object(s) based on common/unique colors and possibly size.
      - Rule involves color substitution: common colors might be replaced by unique colors from other objects, or unique colors might be mapped based on roles (e.g., border, fill).
      - Rule involves structure selection/combination: the spatial pattern of the output comes from one or a combination of input objects.
      - Rule involves background/framing: the output background color is derived from a unique color of one specific input object (potentially the largest or one otherwise unused).
  - item: Relationships
    properties:
      - There's a relationship between the colors of the different objects in the input.
      - The output structure is derived from the structure of specific input object(s).
      - The output colors are derived from the colors of potentially *all* input objects through specific substitution rules.
      - The output background/frame color is linked to the unique color of a particular input object.
