Embedded within the background are two or three smaller, distinct, contiguous objects (shapes) made of different colors.\n2.  **Objects:** These objects are composed of one or two colors different from the background. They often involve a border color and an internal color or pattern. Some objects in different examples share structural similarities (e.g., a frame with internal elements).\n3.  **Color Relationships:** There's a recurring pattern involving a \"common\" color present in multiple objects within the same input grid (e.g., green in train_1, red in train_2, blue in train_3) and \"unique\" colors specific to each object.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is a smaller grid representing one or a combination of the input objects, potentially with color transformations and framing. The output grid size seems determined by the extracted/transformed object(s).\n5.  **Transformation Core Logic:** The transformation appears to involve:\n    *   Identifying the relevant input object(s) based on color properties (common vs. unique colors) and possibly size.\n    *   Selecting a structural template from one object (or combining structures).\n    *   Performing color substitutions based on the unique/common colors found across the input objects.\n    *   Determining the output background/framing color, often related to the unique color of one of the input objects (potentially the largest one in some cases).\n    *   Extracting the final pattern into the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
