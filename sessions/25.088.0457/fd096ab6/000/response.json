In the examples, these colors include yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), green (3), and red (2).\n3.  **Object Structure (Input):** The non-blue objects in the input grids appear incomplete. They look like partial outlines or fragments of small shapes.\n4.  **Object Structure (Output):** In the output grids, these incomplete objects have been transformed. They now form complete 3x3 squares of their respective colors. The original pixels of the object are part of this completed square.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying these non-blue objects, recognizing they are meant to be 3x3 squares, and filling in the missing pixels within their 3x3 bounding box to complete the square shape.\n6.  **Background:** The blue background pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
