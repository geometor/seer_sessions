task_type: object_completion
components:
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      role: static_canvas
  - type: object
    properties:
      color: non-blue (yellow, magenta, orange, azure, green, red observed)
      structure: contiguous pixels
      input_state: incomplete shape fragment
      output_state: completed 3x3 square
      relationship_to_background: embedded within
identification:
  - find contiguous regions of non-background pixels (objects)
transformation:
  - for each identified object:
    - determine its bounding box (minimum rectangle containing all its pixels)
    - calculate the dimensions (height and width) of the bounding box
    - condition: if the bounding box height is 3 and width is 3
    - action: fill all pixels within that 3x3 bounding box area with the object's color in the output grid
  - copy all background pixels from input to output unchanged
