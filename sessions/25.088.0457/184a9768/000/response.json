The input grids contain several distinct types of elements:\n    1.  **Container Objects:** Large shapes (like blue 'U' in ex 1, red 'S' in ex 2, blue shape in ex 3) that enclose contiguous regions of the background color (white). These containers persist into the output grid, but their internal white regions are modified.\n    2.  **Filler Objects:** Smaller, solid colored objects (red, green, yellow, azure, magenta in the examples) scattered around the grid, usually not adjacent to the containers. These objects do not appear directly in the output grid but determine the color used to fill the containers.\n    3.  **Marker Objects:** Single pixels of gray color (5). These markers also do not appear in the output grid but act as intermediaries, linking specific filler objects to specific internal regions of the containers.\n    4.  **Background:** White pixels (0).\n\n    The core transformation involves identifying the internal white regions within the container objects. For each such region, a specific gray marker pixel is identified (the one closest to the region). Then, the filler object closest to *that* gray marker pixel dictates the color used to fill the corresponding internal white region in the container. Finally, the output grid consists only of the modified container objects against a white background; the original filler objects and gray markers are removed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
