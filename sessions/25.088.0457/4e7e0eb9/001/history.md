**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are composed of a background (white, 0) and distinct 3x3 blocks of solid colors.
2.  **Separators:** These 3x3 blocks are separated by single-pixel-wide lines, either horizontally or vertically. These lines can be white (0) or other colors (yellow=4, orange=7, gray=5).
3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are the 3x3 blocks of uniform color. The separator lines act as boundaries or modifiers.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of the 3x3 blocks based on the color of the separator line(s) adjacent to them. Some separators induce swaps, while others cause blocks to adopt colors from neighboring blocks or pairs.
5.  **Pairing:** Blocks often seem to operate in pairs (two blocks adjacent horizontally or vertically, separated by a white line). Special colored separators then act *between* these pairs or between a pair and a single block.
6.  **Locality:** The rules seem mostly local, depending on the immediate separator color and adjacent block colors, although the Orange(7) rule appears to reference a block further away.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  background_color: white (0)
  elements:
    - type: Object
      description: 3x3 block of uniform, non-white color.
    - type: Separator
      description: Single pixel line (horizontal or vertical) separating 3x3 blocks.
      properties:
        color: white(0), yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5)

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: 3x3 blocks are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
    mediated_by: Separator Line

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is Yellow (4)
    action: The two 3x3 blocks directly adjacent to the yellow separator swap their colors. Applies across the yellow line.

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is Orange (7) (Horizontal)
    action: The 3x3 block immediately *above* the orange line changes its color. It adopts the color of the *right-hand* block belonging to the pair situated directly *above* the current block's pair. (Pair defined as two blocks separated by white space).

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is Gray (5) (Vertical)
    action:
      - Left Pair: For the pair of blocks (L1, L2) immediately to the *left* of the gray line, both L1 and L2 adopt the color of L2.
      - Right Pair: For the pair of blocks (R1, R2) immediately to the *right* of the gray line, R1 and R2 swap their colors.

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is White (0) or Gray (5) (Horizontal)
    action: No direct action imposed by this separator itself. Blocks maintain their color unless changed by rules associated with adjacent Yellow, Orange, or Vertical Gray separators. Changes propagate from active separators.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct 3x3 blocks of uniform color within the input grid, ignoring the white (0) background.
2.  Identify all single-pixel horizontal and vertical separator lines between these blocks. Note the color of each separator segment (white, yellow, orange, gray).
3.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
4.  Iterate through the separators and apply color changes to the adjacent 3x3 blocks in the output grid based on the separator's color:
    *   **If the separator is Yellow (4):** The two 3x3 blocks directly adjacent to (on opposite sides of) the yellow line swap their colors in the output grid.
    *   **If the separator is Orange (7) (and horizontal):** Find the 3x3 block located immediately *above* the orange line. Identify the pair of blocks this block belongs to (i.e., find its horizontal neighbor separated by white space). Then, identify the pair of blocks located directly *above* this pair. The block above the orange line takes the color of the *right-hand* block from that upper pair.
    *   **If the separator is Gray (5) (and vertical):**
        *   Consider the pair of blocks (L1, L2) immediately to the left of the gray line (L1 left, L2 right, separated by white space). In the output grid, change the color of both L1 and L2 to the original color of L2.
        *   Consider the pair of blocks (R1, R2) immediately to the right of the gray line (R1 left, R2 right, separated by white space). In the output grid, swap the colors of R1 and R2 (R1 takes R2's color, R2 takes R1's color).
    *   **If the separator is White (0) or Horizontal Gray (5):** These separators do not initiate changes themselves. The colors of the adjacent blocks are determined by the initial state or by changes propagating from Yellow, Orange, or Vertical Gray separators they might also be adjacent to.
5.  Ensure that changes are applied based on the *input* grid's colors and configurations. Multiple rules might affect the same block; the order or precedence might need clarification if examples showed conflicts (though they seem distinct here). The described rules appear sufficient for the examples.
