      description: 3x3 block of uniform, non-white color.
    - type: Separator
      description: Single pixel line (horizontal or vertical) separating 3x3 blocks.
      properties:
        color: white(0), yellow(4), orange(7), gray(5)

Relationships_and_Actions:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: 3x3 blocks are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
    mediated_by: Separator Line

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is Yellow (4)
    action: The two 3x3 blocks directly adjacent to the yellow separator swap their colors. Applies across the yellow line.

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is Orange (7) (Horizontal)
    action: The 3x3 block immediately *above* the orange line changes its color. It adopts the color of the *right-hand* block belonging to the pair situated directly *above* the current block's pair. (Pair defined as two blocks separated by white space).

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is Gray (5) (Vertical)
    action:
      - Left Pair: For the pair of blocks (L1, L2) immediately to the *left* of the gray line, both L1 and L2 adopt the color of L2.
      - Right Pair: For the pair of blocks (R1, R2) immediately to the *right* of the gray line, R1 and R2 swap their colors.

  - type: TransformationRule
    trigger: Separator Color is White (0) or Gray (5) (Horizontal)
    action: No direct action imposed by this separator itself. Blocks maintain their color unless changed by rules associated with adjacent Yellow, Orange, or Vertical Gray separators. Changes propagate from active separators.
