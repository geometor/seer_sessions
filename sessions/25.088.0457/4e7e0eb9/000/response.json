These lines can be white (0) or other colors (yellow=4, orange=7, gray=5).\n3.  **Objects:** The primary objects are the 3x3 blocks of uniform color. The separator lines act as boundaries or modifiers.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the colors of the 3x3 blocks based on the color of the separator line(s) adjacent to them. Some separators induce swaps, while others cause blocks to adopt colors from neighboring blocks or pairs.\n5.  **Pairing:** Blocks often seem to operate in pairs (two blocks adjacent horizontally or vertically, separated by a white line). Special colored separators then act *between* these pairs or between a pair and a single block.\n6.  **Locality:** The rules seem mostly local, depending on the immediate separator color and adjacent block colors, although the Orange(7) rule appears to reference a block further away.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all single-pixel horizontal and vertical separator lines between these blocks. Note the color of each separator segment (white, yellow, orange, gray).\n3.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through the separators and apply color changes to the adjacent 3x3 blocks in the output grid based on the separator's color:\n    *   **If the separator is Yellow (4):** The two 3x3 blocks directly adjacent to (on opposite sides of) the yellow line swap their colors in the output grid.\n    *   **If the separator is Orange (7) (and horizontal):** Find the 3x3 block located immediately *above* the orange line. Identify the pair of blocks this block belongs to (i.e., find its horizontal neighbor separated by white space). Then, identify the pair of blocks located directly *above* this pair. The block above the orange line takes the color of the *right-hand* block from that upper pair.\n    *   **If the separator is Gray (5) (and vertical):**\n        *   Consider the pair of blocks (L1, L2) immediately to the left of the gray line (L1 left, L2 right, separated by white space). In the output grid, change the color of both L1 and L2 to the original color of L2.\n        *   Consider the pair of blocks (R1, R2) immediately to the right of the gray line (R1 left, R2 right, separated by white space). In the output grid, swap the colors of R1 and R2 (R1 takes R2's color, R2 takes R1's color).\n    *   **If the separator is White (0) or Horizontal Gray (5):** These separators do not initiate changes themselves. The colors of the adjacent blocks are determined by the initial state or by changes propagating from Yellow, Orange, or Vertical Gray separators they might also be adjacent to.\n5.  Ensure that changes are applied based on the *input* grid's colors and configurations. Multiple rules might affect the same block; the order or precedence might need clarification if examples showed conflicts (though they seem distinct here). The described rules appear sufficient for the examples."
