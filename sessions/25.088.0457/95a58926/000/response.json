They feature prominent gray (5) structures, specifically solid horizontal lines that span the width and some vertical columns or partial columns made of gray.\n2.  **Delimiter Lines:** The solid horizontal gray lines act as delimiters, visually separating the grid into horizontal sections or bands.\n3.  **Active Colors:** Within the sections defined by the gray lines (or above the first line / below the last), there are scattered pixels of other colors: green (3) in the first example, red (2) in the second, and yellow (4) in the third. These appear to be the \"active\" colors causing the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The goal is to modify the grid based on the location of these active colors relative to the gray delimiter lines.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the basic gray structures (vertical columns and horizontal lines), but the scattered active colors from the input disappear from their original locations (replaced by white). Crucially, some gray pixels *on the horizontal delimiter lines* change to match the active color that was located above them in the same column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a list to store planned modifications for the delimiter lines.\n4.  Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n5.  Check the color `C` of the input cell `input[r][c]`.\n6.

If such a delimiter line `dr` exists, record a planned modification: change the cell at `(dr, c)` to color `C`.\n    c.  Check if the current row `r` itself is *not* one of the identified delimiter line rows. If it is not a delimiter row, change the corresponding cell in the *output grid* to white (0) (i.e., `output[r][c] = 0`).\n7.  After checking all input cells, apply the recorded modifications: iterate through the planned modifications, and for each modification `(dr, c, C)`, set the cell `output[dr][c]` in the output grid to color `C`. (This ensures modifications overwrite the initial gray color or any previous modification planned for the same cell).\n8.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
