Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids contain a background of white (0) pixels. They feature prominent gray (5) structures, specifically solid horizontal lines that span the width and some vertical columns or partial columns made of gray.
2.  **Delimiter Lines:** The solid horizontal gray lines act as delimiters, visually separating the grid into horizontal sections or bands.
3.  **Active Colors:** Within the sections defined by the gray lines (or above the first line / below the last), there are scattered pixels of other colors: green (3) in the first example, red (2) in the second, and yellow (4) in the third. These appear to be the "active" colors causing the transformation.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The goal is to modify the grid based on the location of these active colors relative to the gray delimiter lines.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the basic gray structures (vertical columns and horizontal lines), but the scattered active colors from the input disappear from their original locations (replaced by white). Crucially, some gray pixels *on the horizontal delimiter lines* change to match the active color that was located above them in the same column.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid:
  Background: White (0)
  Objects:
    - Type: Structure
      Color: Gray (5)
      Shape:
        - Horizontal Lines (spanning width)
        - Vertical Columns (partial or full height)
      Role: Delimiter (horizontal lines), Static Background (vertical columns)
    - Type: Signal Pixel
      Color: Variable (Green=3, Red=2, Yellow=4, depending on example)
      Location: Scattered within sections defined by gray horizontal lines, sometimes on the lines themselves.
      Role: Input signal for transformation.
Transformation:
  Action: Project Color Downwards
  Input: Signal Pixels (non-white, non-gray)
  Target: Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines
  Rule: For each Signal Pixel at (r, c) with color C:
    1. Find the first Horizontal Gray Delimiter Line at or below row r (let its row index be dr).
    2. Change the color of the cell (dr, c) on that delimiter line to C.
  Cleanup: Replace original Signal Pixels with White (0), unless they were on a delimiter line that was modified.
Output:
  Grid:
    - Background remains White (0) where it was White.
    - Original Signal Pixel locations become White (0).
    - Gray Vertical Columns remain Gray (5).
    - Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines remain Gray (5) except where modified by the projection rule.
    - Modified cells on Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines take the color C projected onto them.
Relationships:
  - Spatial: The transformation depends on the vertical alignment (same column) between a Signal Pixel and the Horizontal Gray Delimiter Line at or below it.
  - Sections: Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines implicitly define sections. Signal Pixels within a section (or on its lower boundary line) affect the color of that lower boundary line.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all horizontal lines in the input grid that consist entirely of gray (5) pixels. Record the row indices of these "delimiter lines".
3.  Create a list to store planned modifications for the delimiter lines.
4.  Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.
5.  Check the color `C` of the input cell `input[r][c]`.
6.  If the color `C` is *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5):
    a.  Find the row index `dr` of the first delimiter line whose row index is greater than or equal to the current row `r`.
    b.  If such a delimiter line `dr` exists, record a planned modification: change the cell at `(dr, c)` to color `C`.
    c.  Check if the current row `r` itself is *not* one of the identified delimiter line rows. If it is not a delimiter row, change the corresponding cell in the *output grid* to white (0) (i.e., `output[r][c] = 0`).
7.  After checking all input cells, apply the recorded modifications: iterate through the planned modifications, and for each modification `(dr, c, C)`, set the cell `output[dr][c]` in the output grid to color `C`. (This ensures modifications overwrite the initial gray color or any previous modification planned for the same cell).
8.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
