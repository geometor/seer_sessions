Grid:
  Background: White (0)
  Objects:
    - Type: Structure
      Color: Gray (5)
      Shape:
        - Horizontal Lines (spanning width)
        - Vertical Columns (partial or full height)
      Role: Delimiter (horizontal lines), Static Background (vertical columns)
    - Type: Signal Pixel
      Color: Variable (Green=3, Red=2, Yellow=4, depending on example)
      Location: Scattered within sections defined by gray horizontal lines, sometimes on the lines themselves.
      Role: Input signal for transformation.
Transformation:
  Action: Project Color Downwards
  Input: Signal Pixels (non-white, non-gray)
  Target: Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines
  Rule: For each Signal Pixel at (r, c) with color C:
    1. Find the first Horizontal Gray Delimiter Line at or below row r (let its row index be dr).
    2. Change the color of the cell (dr, c) on that delimiter line to C.
  Cleanup: Replace original Signal Pixels with White (0), unless they were on a delimiter line that was modified.
Output:
  Grid:
    - Background remains White (0) where it was White.
    - Original Signal Pixel locations become White (0).
    - Gray Vertical Columns remain Gray (5).
    - Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines remain Gray (5) except where modified by the projection rule.
    - Modified cells on Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines take the color C projected onto them.
Relationships:
  - Spatial: The transformation depends on the vertical alignment (same column) between a Signal Pixel and the Horizontal Gray Delimiter Line at or below it.
  - Sections: Horizontal Gray Delimiter Lines implicitly define sections. Signal Pixels within a section (or on its lower boundary line) affect the color of that lower boundary line.
