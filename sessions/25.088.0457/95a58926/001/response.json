Identify horizontal lines composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5). These are 'delimiter lines'.\n2. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3. Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.\n4. If a cell contains a 'signal' color (not white 0 and not gray 5):\n   a. Check if the cell's row 'r' is a delimiter line row.\n   b. If 'r' IS a delimiter row, the signal pixel remains unchanged in the output grid (it persists).\n   c. If 'r' IS NOT a delimiter row:\n      i. Find the first delimiter line row 'dr' that is strictly below row 'r'.\n      ii. If such a delimiter line 'dr' exists, store a planned modification to change the color of the cell (dr, c) in the output grid to the signal color.\n      iii. Change the color of the original signal pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to white (0) (erase it).\n5. After iterating through all input cells, apply all stored modifications to the output grid. If multiple signals project to the same delimiter cell, the one processed last (typically from the lowest row) will determine the final color, though in this task, it seems consistent that any signal suffices.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_delimiter_rows(grid: np.ndarray) -> Set[int]:\n    \"\"\"Identifies rows composed entirely of gray pixels (5).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    delimiter_rows = set()\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if np.all(grid[r, :] == 5):\n            delimiter_rows.add(r)\n    return delimiter_rows\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule: projects signal colors downwards onto the\n    next gray delimiter line and removes the original signal pixel unless it's\n    already on a delimiter line.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_np = input_np.copy()\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n\n    # Find the rows that act as delimiters (all gray)\n    delimiter_rows = find_delimiter_rows(input_np)\n\n    # Store modifications planned for delimiter lines: {(row, col): color}\n    modifications: Dict[Tuple[int, int], int] = {}\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = input_np[r, c]\n\n            # Check if the current cell has a signal color (not white, not gray)\n            if color != 0 and color != 5:\n                # Case 1: Signal pixel is ON a delimiter line - it persists\n                if r in delimiter_rows:\n                    continue  # Leave it as is in the output copy\n\n                # Case 2: Signal pixel is NOT on a delimiter line\n                else:\n                    # Find the next delimiter row strictly below the current row 'r'\n                    next_delimiter_row = -1\n                    for dr in range(r + 1, rows):\n                        if dr in delimiter_rows:\n                            next_delimiter_row = dr\n                            break\n\n                    # If a delimiter row exists below\n                    if next_delimiter_row != -1:\n                        # Plan to modify the cell on the delimiter line in the same column\n                        modifications[(next_delimiter_row, c)] = color\n\n                    # Erase the original signal pixel from the output grid\n                    output_np[r, c] = 0\n\n    # Apply the planned modifications to the delimiter lines in the output grid\n    for (dr, c), mod_color in modifications.items():\n        output_np[dr, c] = mod_color\n\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    return output_np.tolist()\n```"
