"""
Recolor white (0) pixels based on their adjacency to the grid's absolute outer border.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
3. If the pixel at (r, c) is white (0):
    a. Check if any of its 8 neighbours (including diagonals) lie on the absolute border of the grid (row 0, row height-1, column 0, or column width-1).
    b. If any neighbour is on the border, set the output pixel at (r, c) to red (2).
    c. Otherwise (if no neighbour is on the border), set the output pixel at (r, c) to green (3).
4. If the pixel is not white, its color remains unchanged (already copied in step 1).
5. Return the modified output grid.
