The metrics confirm the dimensions and border indices. My hypothesis holds: In Example 2, the middle-right component contains pixels where `c=18` (the last column), and the bottom-middle/right components contain pixels where `r=18` (the last row). According to the hypothesis, these components *should* be Red (2). The failure confirms the bug was in the implementation of the border check.

- YAML Facts: Will structure based on objects (white components), properties (location, border status), and actions (recoloring).
- Natural Language Program: Will clearly state the revised rule about components touching the border.**General Assessment**

The provided code successfully identifies connected components of white pixels (color 0) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS). It attempts to recolor these components based on their proximity to the grid's border.

The results indicate:
- The code works correctly for Examples 1 and 3.
- The code fails for Example 2. Specifically, some white components that *should* be colored Red (2) according to the expected output were incorrectly colored Green (3).

The error stems from the logic used to determine if a component is "border adjacent". The previous code's check was unnecessarily complex and flawed, checking neighbours' positions and relating them back to the current pixel's distance from the edge.

The successful examples (1 and 3) and the failure pattern in Example 2 strongly suggest a simpler rule: A connected component of white pixels should be colored Red (2) if *any pixel belonging to that component lies on the absolute border* of the grid (i.e., its row index is 0 or H-1, or its column index is 0 or W-1). Otherwise, the component should be colored Green (3).

The strategy is to correct the border-checking condition within the BFS algorithm to reflect this simpler, more accurate rule.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor connected components of white pixels based on their position relative to the grid border.

definitions:
  - object: white_component
    description: A contiguous group of one or more white (0) pixels, connected 8-directionally (including diagonals).
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: Any pixel in the input grid that is not white (0). In these examples, only blue (1) pixels exist besides white.
  - property: is_on_border
    description: A boolean property of a white_component. True if at least one pixel within the component has a row index equal to 0 or the maximum row index (height-1), or a column index equal to 0 or the maximum column index (width-1). False otherwise.
  - property: color
    description: The integer value (0-9) representing the pixel's color.

input_grid:
  - objects:
      - white_component
      - non_white_pixel (blue)
  - properties:
      - Grid dimensions (height, width) vary per example.
      - White components can be single pixels or larger shapes.
      - Blue pixels act as separators.

output_grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - non_white_pixels retain their original color.
  - white_components are recolored based on the `is_on_border` property:
      - If `is_on_border` is True, all pixels in the component become Red (2).
      - If `is_on_border` is False, all pixels in the component become Green (3).

actions:
  - Identify all distinct white_components in the input grid using 8-way connectivity.
  - For each white_component:
      - Determine its `is_on_border` status by checking the coordinates of every pixel within it against the grid boundaries.
      - Recolor all pixels of the component in the output grid to Red (2) or Green (3) based on the determined status.
  - Copy all non_white_pixels from the input to the output grid without changing their color.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Create a data structure (e.g., a 2D boolean array) of the same dimensions as the input grid to keep track of visited white pixels, initially all False.
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
4.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0) and has not been visited:
    a.  Start a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from `(r, c)` to find all connected white pixels forming a single component. Use 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).
    b.  Maintain a list of coordinates `component_pixels` belonging to the current component being searched.
    c.  Initialize a flag `component_is_on_border` to False for this component.
    d.  During the search, for each white pixel `(curr_r, curr_c)` added to the component:
        i.  Mark `(curr_r, curr_c)` as visited.
        ii. Check if this pixel `(curr_r, curr_c)` lies on the grid's border (i.e., if `curr_r == 0` or `curr_r == height - 1` or `curr_c == 0` or `curr_c == width - 1`).
        iii. If it lies on the border, set the `component_is_on_border` flag to True. (Once set to True, it remains True for the rest of this component's search).
        iv. Add valid, unvisited, white neighbours of `(curr_r, curr_c)` to the search queue/stack.
    e.  After the search completes for the component:
        i.  Determine the `target_color`: If `component_is_on_border` is True, the `target_color` is Red (2). Otherwise, the `target_color` is Green (3).
        ii. Iterate through all coordinates `(comp_r, comp_c)` in the `component_pixels` list and set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the `target_color`.
5.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` was not white (0), or was white but already visited (part of a previously found component), continue to the next pixel.
6.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, return the modified output grid.
