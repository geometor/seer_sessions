task_description: Recolor connected components of white pixels based on their position relative to the grid border.

definitions:
  - object: white_component
    description: A contiguous group of one or more white (0) pixels, connected 8-directionally (including diagonals).
  - object: non_white_pixel
    description: Any pixel in the input grid that is not white (0). In these examples, only blue (1) pixels exist besides white.
  - property: is_on_border
    description: A boolean property of a white_component. True if at least one pixel within the component has a row index equal to 0 or the maximum row index (height-1), or a column index equal to 0 or the maximum column index (width-1). False otherwise.
  - property: color
    description: The integer value (0-9) representing the pixel's color.

input_grid:
  - objects:
      - white_component
      - non_white_pixel (blue)
  - properties:
      - Grid dimensions (height, width) vary per example.
      - White components can be single pixels or larger shapes.
      - Blue pixels act as separators.

output_grid:
  - Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - non_white_pixels retain their original color.
  - white_components are recolored based on the `is_on_border` property:
      - If `is_on_border` is True, all pixels in the component become Red (2).
      - If `is_on_border` is False, all pixels in the component become Green (3).

actions:
  - Identify all distinct white_components in the input grid using 8-way connectivity.
  - For each white_component:
      - Determine its `is_on_border` status by checking the coordinates of every pixel within it against the grid boundaries.
      - Recolor all pixels of the component in the output grid to Red (2) or Green (3) based on the determined status.
  - Copy all non_white_pixels from the input to the output grid without changing their color.
