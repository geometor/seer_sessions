            "text": "The metrics confirm the dimensions and border indices. My hypothesis holds: In Example 2, the middle-right component contains pixels where `c=18` (the last column), and the bottom-middle/right components contain pixels where `r=18` (the last row). According to the hypothesis, these components *should* be Red (2). The failure confirms the bug was in the implementation of the border check.\n\n- YAML Facts: Will structure based on objects (white components), properties (location, border status), and actions (recoloring).\n- Natural Language Program: Will clearly state the revised rule about components touching the border.**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies connected components of white pixels (color 0) using a Breadth-First Search (BFS). It attempts to recolor these components based on their proximity to the grid's border.\n\nThe results indicate:\n- The code works correctly for Examples 1 and 3.\n- The code fails for Example 2. Specifically, some white components that *should* be colored Red (2) according to the expected output were incorrectly colored Green (3).\n\nThe error stems from the logic used to determine if a component is \"border adjacent\". The previous code's check was unnecessarily complex and flawed, checking neighbours' positions and relating them back to the current pixel's distance from the edge.\n\nThe successful examples (1 and 3) and the failure pattern in Example 2 strongly suggest a simpler rule: A connected component of white pixels should be colored Red (2) if *any pixel belonging to that component lies on the absolute border* of the grid (i.e., its row index is 0 or H-1, or its column index is 0 or W-1). Otherwise, the component should be colored Green (3).\n\nThe strategy is to correct the border-checking condition within the BFS algorithm to reflect this simpler, more accurate rule.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
