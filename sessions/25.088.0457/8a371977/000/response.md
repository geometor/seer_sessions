Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a frame or grid lines made of blue (1) pixels. Within the compartments formed by these blue lines, there are areas filled with white (0) pixels. The white areas can be single pixels (example 1) or larger contiguous blocks (examples 2 and 3).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids maintain the exact same blue (1) frame/line structure as the corresponding input grids. The transformation exclusively affects the white (0) pixels from the input.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The white (0) pixels in the input are replaced by either red (2) or green (3) pixels in the output. No other colors are introduced, and the blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The decision to change a white (0) pixel to red (2) or green (3) appears to depend on its proximity to the absolute edge of the entire grid.
    *   White pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any part of the outermost border of the grid (the very first row, last row, first column, or last column) are changed to red (2).
    *   White pixels that are *not* adjacent to the outermost border of the grid are changed to green (3).
    *   This rule applies consistently whether the white pixels are isolated or part of a larger block. If any pixel within a white block is adjacent to the outer border, the entire block does not necessarily become red; the rule is applied pixel by pixel based on its individual adjacency to the border. However, observing the examples, it seems the *intention* might be based on blocks: if a block of white touches the border region, it becomes red, otherwise green. Let's re-examine Example 1. Pixel (1,1) is white, touches border via diagonal (0,0), becomes red. Pixel (3,3) is white, does not touch the border, becomes green. Example 2: Block (1:5, 1:5) is white, touches border, becomes red. Block (7:11, 7:11) is white, doesn't touch border, becomes green. Example 3: Block (1:4, 1:4) touches border, becomes red. Block (5:8, 5:8) does not touch border, becomes green. It seems the rule applies to individual white pixels: check adjacency for *each* white pixel.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Recolor white pixels based on their adjacency to the grid's outer border.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable height and width across examples.
  - background_color: Not explicitly defined, but areas outside the main pattern are typically blue (1).

objects:
  - object: boundary_lines
    color: blue (1)
    description: Forms a grid structure or frame. Remains static between input and output.
    attributes:
      - position: Forms rows and columns dividing the grid. Includes the outermost border.
  - object: fill_pixels
    color: white (0) in input
    description: Pixels located within the areas defined by boundary_lines. These are the pixels subject to transformation.
    attributes:
      - position: Specific row and column within the grid.
      - adjacency_to_border: Boolean property indicating if the pixel has at least one neighbour (including diagonals) located on the outermost row or column of the grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_white_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: list of coordinates of white (0) pixels
  - action: check_border_adjacency
    input: coordinates of a white pixel, grid dimensions
    output: boolean (True if adjacent to border, False otherwise)
    description: Checks the 8 neighbours of the pixel. If any neighbour's row is 0 or max_row-1, or column is 0 or max_col-1, returns True.
  - action: recolor_pixel
    input: input_grid, pixel_coordinates, adjacency_result
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Copies the input grid to the output grid.
      For the given pixel coordinates:
      If the input pixel is white (0) and adjacency_result is True, set the output pixel to red (2).
      If the input pixel is white (0) and adjacency_result is False, set the output pixel to green (3).
      Otherwise (if the input pixel is not white), keep the original color in the output grid.

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: fill_pixels (white), outermost_border_pixels
    description: The core condition determining the output color for white pixels. Adjacency includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbours.

transformation_rule:
  - condition: Pixel color is white (0).
  - check: Is the pixel adjacent (including diagonals) to the absolute outermost border of the grid?
  - result:
    - If yes: Change color to red (2).
    - If no: Change color to green (3).
  - fallback: If pixel color is not white (0), keep the original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row (r) and column (c) index.
3.  Get the color of the pixel at `input_grid[r][c]`.
4.  **Check if the current pixel is white (0):**
    *   **If it is white:**
        *   Determine if this pixel at `(r, c)` is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the outermost border of the grid. A pixel is adjacent to the border if its row `r` is 1 or `height-2`, or its column `c` is 1 or `width-2`, AND the neighbouring pixel on the border (row 0, row `height-1`, col 0, or col `width-1`) is actually part of the border frame (usually blue, but the check is purely positional).
        *   *Correction*: A simpler way to check adjacency: Determine if any of the 8 neighbouring coordinates `(nr, nc)` satisfy `nr == 0` or `nr == height-1` or `nc == 0` or `nc == width-1`.
        *   **If it is adjacent to the border:** Set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2) (`output_grid[r][c] = 2`).
        *   **If it is *not* adjacent to the border:** Set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3) (`output_grid[r][c] = 3`).
    *   **If it is not white (i.e., it's blue):**
        *   Copy the color directly from the input grid to the output grid (`output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]`).
5.  After iterating through all pixels, return the completed output grid.
