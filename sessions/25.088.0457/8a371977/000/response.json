            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a frame or grid lines made of blue (1) pixels. Within the compartments formed by these blue lines, there are areas filled with white (0) pixels. The white areas can be single pixels (example 1) or larger contiguous blocks (examples 2 and 3).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids maintain the exact same blue (1) frame/line structure as the corresponding input grids. The transformation exclusively affects the white (0) pixels from the input.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The white (0) pixels in the input are replaced by either red (2) or green (3) pixels in the output. No other colors are introduced, and the blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The decision to change a white (0) pixel to red (2) or green (3) appears to depend on its proximity to the absolute edge of the entire grid.\n    *   White pixels that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any part of the outermost border of the grid (the very first row, last row, first column, or last column) are changed to red (2).\n    *   White pixels that are *not* adjacent to the outermost border of the grid are changed to green (3).\n    *   This rule applies consistently whether the white pixels are isolated or part of a larger block. If any pixel within a white block is adjacent to the outer border, the entire block does not necessarily become red; the rule is applied pixel by pixel based on its individual adjacency to the border. However, observing the examples, it seems the *intention* might be based on blocks: if a block of white touches the border region, it becomes red, otherwise green. Let's re-examine Example 1. Pixel (1,1) is white, touches border via diagonal (0,0), becomes red. Pixel (3,3) is white, does not touch the border, becomes green. Example 2: Block (1:5, 1:5) is white, touches border, becomes red. Block (7:11, 7:11) is white, doesn't touch border, becomes green. Example 3: Block (1:4, 1:4) touches border, becomes red. Block (5:8, 5:8) does not touch border, becomes green. It seems the rule applies to individual white pixels: check adjacency for *each* white pixel.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
