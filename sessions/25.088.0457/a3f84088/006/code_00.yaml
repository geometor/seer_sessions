task_description: Fill an area enclosed by a frame based on distance to the frame.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2D
objects:
  - type: frame
    color: gray (5)
    description: A contiguous boundary enclosing an area. Typically rectangular but can be irregular.
    properties: [static]
  - type: interior_area
    color: white (0)
    description: Pixels initially white (0) that are enclosed by the frame and not reachable from the grid border via other white pixels.
    properties: [target_for_transformation]
  - type: exterior_area
    color: white (0)
    description: Pixels initially white (0) that are connected to the grid border via a path of only white pixels.
    properties: [unchanged]
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: General term for pixels not part of the frame or interior_area. Includes exterior_area.
    properties: [unchanged]
actions:
  - name: identify_regions
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [frame_pixels, interior_pixels, exterior_pixels]
    description: Differentiate pixels into frame (gray 5), interior (enclosed white 0), and exterior (unenclosed white 0) using connectivity analysis (BFS from borders for exterior).
  - name: calculate_distance
    inputs: [interior_pixels, frame_pixels, grid_dimensions]
    outputs: [distance_map]
    description: For each interior pixel, calculate the minimum Manhattan distance ('d') to the nearest frame pixel using BFS starting from frame pixels.
  - name: apply_color_rule
    inputs: [interior_pixels, distance_map]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input. Then, for each interior pixel, determine its new color based on its distance 'd' using the cyclical rule (d % 4): 1->red(2), 2->gray(5), 3->white(0), 0->gray(5). Update the pixel in the output grid. Frame and exterior pixels remain unchanged.
distance_metric: Manhattan
color_palette_transformation:
  input_colors: [white(0), gray(5)] # Relevant colors
  output_colors: [white(0), red(2), gray(5)] # Colors used in the output fill
  rule: Cyclical based on (Manhattan distance to frame % 4)
