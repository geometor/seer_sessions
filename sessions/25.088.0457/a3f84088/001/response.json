Identify the hollow region within the input grid, which consists of white pixels (0) completely enclosed by a frame of gray pixels (5).\n2.  For each white pixel within this enclosed region, calculate its minimum Manhattan distance (number of horizontal/vertical steps) to the nearest gray pixel (5) of the surrounding frame.\n3.  Determine the fill color for each of these interior white pixels based on its calculated distance `d` using a repeating four-step pattern indexed by the remainder of `d` divided by 4:\n    - If `d % 4 == 1`, the color is red (2).\n    - If `d % 4 == 2`, the color is gray (5).\n    - If `d % 4 == 3`, the color is white (0).\n    - If `d % 4 == 0`, the color is gray (5).\n4.  Construct the output grid by replacing the original white pixels in the identified interior region with their calculated fill colors.
