Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a prominent hollow rectangle constructed from gray pixels (color 5). This rectangle is situated on a background of white pixels (color 0). The size and position of the rectangle vary across examples.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original gray rectangle and the white background. The key change is that the hollow interior of the gray rectangle is filled with a pattern of colors.
3.  **Filling Pattern:** The filling uses specific colors: primarily red (2) and gray (5), with some areas potentially remaining white (0). The pattern appears layered or nested, like concentric rings or frames shrinking inwards from the original gray rectangle boundary.
4.  **Color Sequence:** Observing the layers inwards from the boundary:
    *   The layer immediately inside the original gray (5) frame is consistently red (2).
    *   The layer inside the red (2) frame is consistently gray (5).
    *   The layer inside this second gray (5) frame is often white (0), but not always (see Example 2).
    *   Subsequent layers seem to follow a repeating pattern, often involving gray (5) and red (2), sometimes interrupted by white (0).

**YAML Block of Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill the interior of a hollow rectangle.
Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    location: Everywhere initially, outside the rectangle in output.
  - type: Frame
    color: gray (5)
    shape: Hollow Rectangle
    location: Defines the boundary for filling. Persists in output.
  - type: Fill Region
    color: white (0)
    location: Interior of the Frame in the input.
    action: Is filled with a pattern in the output.
  - type: Fill Pattern
    colors: [red (2), gray (5), white (0)]
    structure: Concentric layers inward from the Frame.
    relationship: Determined by the distance from the Frame boundary.
Transformation:
  - Identify: Locate the hollow region (white pixels) enclosed by the gray Frame.
  - Calculate: For each pixel within the hollow region, determine its minimum distance (e.g., Manhattan distance) to the Frame boundary.
  - Apply Pattern: Color each pixel based on its calculated distance according to a repeating sequence.
Pattern Sequence (based on distance 'd'):
  - d=1: red (2)
  - d=2: gray (5)
  - d=3: white (0)
  - d=4: gray (5)
  - d=5: red (2)
  - d=6: gray (5)
  - d=7: white (0)
  - d=8: gray (5)
  - ... (repeats [red, gray, white, gray])
Possible Edge Cases:
  - Behavior might change for very small remaining internal regions (e.g., Example 2, Example 4). The standard pattern seems to be the primary rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous region of white pixels (0) that are completely enclosed by the gray pixels (5) forming the input rectangle. This is the "target region".
2.  For every pixel within this target region, calculate its shortest distance (using Manhattan distance: number of steps horizontally or vertically) to the nearest pixel *outside* the target region (i.e., to the original gray frame).
3.  Determine the fill color for each pixel based on its calculated distance `d` using a repeating four-step pattern:
    *   If the distance `d` divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1 (i.e., `d % 4 == 1`), color the pixel red (2).
    *   If the distance `d` divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2 (i.e., `d % 4 == 2`), color the pixel gray (5).
    *   If the distance `d` divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3 (i.e., `d % 4 == 3`), color the pixel white (0).
    *   If the distance `d` divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 0 (i.e., `d % 4 == 0`), color the pixel gray (5).
4.  Replace the original white pixels in the target region with their calculated fill colors. Leave all pixels outside the target region (the original gray frame and the external background) unchanged.
