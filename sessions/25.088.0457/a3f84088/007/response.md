Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Regions:** Analyze the input grid to distinguish three types of pixels:
    *   The **frame**: Pixels with gray (5) color.
    *   The **exterior**: White (0) pixels that can reach the border of the grid through a path of only white pixels. Identify these using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all border white pixels.
    *   The **interior**: White (0) pixels that are *not* part of the exterior (i.e., they are enclosed by the frame).
2.  **Calculate Interior Distances:** Compute the minimum Manhattan distance (`d`) for each *interior* white pixel to the nearest gray (5) frame pixel. This is achieved using a BFS starting simultaneously from all frame pixels, propagating only through interior white pixels. Initialize distances to infinity, set frame pixel distances to 0.
3.  **Determine Fill Colors:** For each *interior* white pixel, determine its output color based on its calculated distance `d` using the following cyclical pattern (modulo 4):
    *   If `d % 4 == 1`, the color is red (2).
    *   If `d % 4 == 2`, the color is gray (5).
    *   If `d % 4 == 3`, the color is white (0).
    *   If `d % 4 == 0`, the color is gray (5).
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create the output grid. Initialize it as a copy of the input grid. Then, update the color of each *interior* white pixel according to the color determined in step 3. Pixels identified as the gray frame or the exterior white area remain unchanged from the input grid.
