Identify these using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all border white pixels.\n    *   The **interior**: White (0) pixels that are *not* part of the exterior (i.e., they are enclosed by the frame).\n2.  **Calculate Interior Distances:** Compute the minimum Manhattan distance (`d`) for each *interior* white pixel to the nearest gray (5) frame pixel. This is achieved using a BFS starting simultaneously from all frame pixels, propagating only through interior white pixels. Initialize distances to infinity, set frame pixel distances to 0.\n3.  **Determine Fill Colors:** For each *interior* white pixel, determine its output color based on its calculated distance `d` using the following cyclical pattern (modulo 4):\n    *   If `d % 4 == 1`, the color is red (2).\n    *   If `d % 4 == 2`, the color is gray (5).\n    *   If `d % 4 == 3`, the color is white (0).\n    *   If `d % 4 == 0`, the color is gray (5).\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create the output grid. Initialize it as a copy of the input grid. Then, update the color of each *interior* white pixel according to the color determined in step 3. Pixels identified as the gray frame or the exterior white area remain unchanged from the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _identify_exterior_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies white (0) pixels connected to the grid border using BFS.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of (row, col) tuples representing exterior white pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    exterior_pixels = set()\n    q = deque()\n\n    #
