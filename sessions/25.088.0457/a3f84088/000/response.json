            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a prominent hollow rectangle constructed from gray pixels (color 5). This rectangle is situated on a background of white pixels (color 0). The size and position of the rectangle vary across examples.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original gray rectangle and the white background. The key change is that the hollow interior of the gray rectangle is filled with a pattern of colors.\n3.  **Filling Pattern:** The filling uses specific colors: primarily red (2) and gray (5), with some areas potentially remaining white (0). The pattern appears layered or nested, like concentric rings or frames shrinking inwards from the original gray rectangle boundary.\n4.  **Color Sequence:** Observing the layers inwards from the boundary:\n    *   The layer immediately inside the original gray (5) frame is consistently red (2).\n    *   The layer inside the red (2) frame is consistently gray (5).\n    *   The layer inside this second gray (5) frame is often white (0), but not always (see Example 2).\n    *   Subsequent layers seem to follow a repeating pattern, often involving gray (5) and red (2), sometimes interrupted by white (0).\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"
