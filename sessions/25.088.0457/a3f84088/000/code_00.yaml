Task: Fill the interior of a hollow rectangle.
Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    location: Everywhere initially, outside the rectangle in output.
  - type: Frame
    color: gray (5)
    shape: Hollow Rectangle
    location: Defines the boundary for filling. Persists in output.
  - type: Fill Region
    color: white (0)
    location: Interior of the Frame in the input.
    action: Is filled with a pattern in the output.
  - type: Fill Pattern
    colors: [red (2), gray (5), white (0)]
    structure: Concentric layers inward from the Frame.
    relationship: Determined by the distance from the Frame boundary.
Transformation:
  - Identify: Locate the hollow region (white pixels) enclosed by the gray Frame.
  - Calculate: For each pixel within the hollow region, determine its minimum distance (e.g., Manhattan distance) to the Frame boundary.
  - Apply Pattern: Color each pixel based on its calculated distance according to a repeating sequence.
Pattern Sequence (based on distance 'd'):
  - d=1: red (2)
  - d=2: gray (5)
  - d=3: white (0)
  - d=4: gray (5)
  - d=5: red (2)
  - d=6: gray (5)
  - d=7: white (0)
  - d=8: gray (5)
  - ... (repeats [red, gray, white, gray])
Possible Edge Cases:
  - Behavior might change for very small remaining internal regions (e.g., Example 2, Example 4). The standard pattern seems to be the primary rule.
