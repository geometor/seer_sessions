- task_type: object_transformation
- description: Fill an enclosed area based on distance to the boundary.
- objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
          - colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
          - contains:
              - object: frame
                color: gray (5)
                shape: rectangle (potentially irregular or incomplete in test cases, but rectangular in examples)
                connectivity: closed loop enclosing an interior area
              - object: interior_area
                color: white (0)
                location: completely enclosed by the frame
              - object: exterior_area (optional)
                color: white (0)
                location: outside the frame, potentially extending to the grid boundaries
- actions:
    - identify: the gray (5) frame boundary pixels.
    - identify: the white (0) pixels belonging to the interior_area (those not reachable from the grid border without crossing the frame).
    - calculate: for each interior_area pixel, the minimum Manhattan distance `d` to the nearest frame pixel.
    - determine_color: based on the distance `d` using the rule:
        - d % 4 == 1: red (2)
        - d % 4 == 2: gray (5)
        - d % 4 == 3: white (0)
        - d % 4 == 0: gray (5)
    - update_grid: Replace the interior_area white pixels with their determined colors.
    - maintain_pixels: Keep the frame pixels (gray) and exterior_area pixels (white) unchanged.
