Transformation rule:
1. Find all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
2. For each red pixel:
   a. Identify the connected object consisting of the red pixel and all orthogonally adjacent green pixels (color 3).
   b. Determine the local orientation of the object relative to the red pixel by checking its immediate green neighbors:
      - If green neighbors are only horizontal (left/right), the orientation is 'horizontal'.
      - If green neighbors are only vertical (up/down), the orientation is 'vertical'.
   c. Determine the expansion direction based on the orientation and adjacent white pixels (color 0):
      - If 'horizontal' orientation: check up/down from the red pixel for a white pixel. If white is above, direction is 'Up'; if white is below, direction is 'Down'.
      - If 'vertical' orientation: check left/right from the red pixel for a white pixel. If white is left, direction is 'Left'; if white is right, direction is 'Right'.
   d. Expand the object: For every pixel belonging to the identified object, fill the adjacent white pixels in the determined expansion direction with the original color of that object pixel, continuing until a non-white pixel or the grid boundary is encountered. This expansion happens on a copy of the input grid.
3. Return the modified grid.
