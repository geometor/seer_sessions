Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Locate all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
3. For each red pixel found at coordinates (R, C):
    a. Identify the connected object consisting of this red pixel and all orthogonally adjacent green pixels (color 3) recursively connected to it. Store the coordinates of all pixels belonging to this object.
    b. Find the single orthogonally adjacent white pixel (color 0) next to the *red* pixel at (R, C). Determine the direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right) from the red pixel to this white pixel. This is the expansion direction for the entire object.
    c. For every pixel (obj_r, obj_c) belonging to the identified connected object:
        i. Retrieve the original color of this pixel from the input grid (it will be either red or green).
        ii. Determine the directional step (dr, dc) corresponding to the expansion direction (e.g., Up is (-1, 0), Right is (0, 1)).
        iii. Start tracing a path from the pixel adjacent to (obj_r, obj_c) in the expansion direction. Let the current trace coordinates be (trace_r, trace_c) = (obj_r + dr, obj_c + dc).
        iv. While the coordinates (trace_r, trace_c) are within the grid boundaries and the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the *output* grid is white (0):
            1. Color the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the output grid with the original color retrieved in step 3.c.i.
            2. Update the trace coordinates to the next step in the expansion direction: (trace_r, trace_c) = (trace_r + dr, trace_c + dc).
4. Return the modified output grid.
