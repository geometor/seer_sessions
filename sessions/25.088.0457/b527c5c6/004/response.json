            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding or incorrect implementation of the transformation rule. The transformed outputs show patterns related to the original objects and expansion directions, but the extent and interaction of these expansions are incorrect. Specifically, the expansions seem to overwrite existing non-white pixels or extend much further than intended in the expected outputs.\n\nThe core issue appears to be in step 3.c.iv of the previous natural language program: `While the coordinates (trace_r, trace_c) are within the grid boundaries and the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the *output* grid is white (0):`. This allowed expansions to continue into space potentially filled by the expansion of another part of the same object or a different object processed earlier.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the expansion condition. Based on comparing the inputs and expected outputs, it seems the expansion path for each pixel should only proceed through cells that were *originally* white (color 0) in the input grid. Expansions from different pixels (whether from the same object or different objects) happen conceptually simultaneously, writing onto the output grid, and stop only when hitting a boundary or an *originally* non-white cell.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nLet's re-examine the relationship between input, expected output, and the incorrectly transformed output for each example, focusing on the expansion rule.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Top Object (Marker @ 3,5; Dir: Up): The expected output shows the object's top row (row 3) projected upwards into the white space (rows 0-2). The transformed output incorrectly projected *all* pixels upwards until the boundary.\n    *   Bottom Object (Marker @ 14,10; Dir: Left): The expected output shows the object's left column (col 10) projected leftwards into the white space (cols 0-9). The transformed output incorrectly projected *all* pixels leftwards until the boundary.\n    *   *Observation:* Expansion seems limited by the original grid's non-white cells. Only the object pixels directly facing the expansion direction seem to initiate a successful projection into the adjacent white space.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Top Object (Marker @ 4,14; Dir: Up): Expected output shows row 4 projected into rows 0-3. Transformed output projected rows 4 and 5 upwards.\n    *   Bottom Object (Marker @ 15,9; Dir: Right): Expected output shows col 9 projected into cols 10-19. Transformed output projected cols 7, 8, and 9 rightwards.\n    *   *Observation:* Confirms the pattern from Example 1. Expansion stops when the path hits a non-white cell in the *original* input grid.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Top Object (Marker @ 4,4; Dir: Down): Expected output shows row 4 projected downwards into white space.\n    *   Bottom Object (Marker @ 12,15; Dir: Right): Expected output shows col 15 projected rightwards into white space.\n    *   *Observation:* Consistent with previous examples.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Left Object (Marker @ 4,3; Dir: Left): Expected output shows col 3 projected leftwards.\n    *   Right Object (Marker @ 5,8; Dir: Down): Expected output shows row 5 projected downwards. Note the overlap area (e.g., cell (7,8)) takes the color from the downward projection (Red from (5,8)).\n    *   *Observation:* The projection rule holds. When multiple projections might land on the same originally white cell, the output simply takes the color being projected there. Since the code iterates through objects and then pixels within objects, the \"last write wins\" principle applies implicitly, but the outcome seems consistent regardless of processing order because the path check relies on the static input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
