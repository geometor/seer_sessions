            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Composition:** The grids primarily consist of a white background (0) and green objects (3). Each green object contains exactly one red pixel (2).\n2.  **Objects:** The core objects are contiguous blocks of green pixels, each marked by a single red pixel. These objects can be lines (horizontal or vertical) or potentially more complex shapes connected orthogonally.\n3.  **Red Pixel Role:** The red pixel acts as a focal point or a \"seed\" within its connected green object.\n4.  **Transformation Trigger:** The relationship between the red pixel and its immediate green neighbors determines the primary direction of action.\n5.  **Action - Expansion/Filling:** The transformation involves expanding the colors (red and green) of the object into adjacent white space. The expansion follows a specific direction determined by the object's structure around the red pixel.\n6.  **Expansion Direction Logic:**\n    *   If the green pixels immediately adjacent to the red pixel are only horizontal (left/right), the expansion direction is vertical (either up or down).\n    *   If the green pixels immediately adjacent to the red pixel are only vertical (up/down), the expansion direction is horizontal (either left or right).\n    *   The specific direction (up vs. down, or left vs. right) is determined by checking the orthogonal direction from the red pixel *not* occupied by an adjacent green pixel. The expansion occurs towards the direction that initially points to a white cell.\n7.  **Expansion Process:** Once the direction is determined for an object, *every* pixel (red or green) belonging to that connected object expands its own color in that direction, filling contiguous white cells along that line until a non-white cell or the grid boundary is encountered.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
