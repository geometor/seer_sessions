task_description: Fill adjacent empty space based on the orientation of a colored shape relative to a unique marker pixel within it.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
  - element: object
    description: Contiguous shape made of green pixels.
    color: green (3)
    contains:
      - element: marker
        color: red (2)
        count_per_object: 1
        role: Determines expansion characteristics.

properties:
  - object: marker (red pixel)
    property: adjacent_green_pixels
    value: Location of green pixels orthogonally touching the red pixel.
  - object: marker (red pixel)
    property: local_orientation
    value: Derived from adjacent_green_pixels (Horizontal or Vertical).
  - object: marker (red pixel)
    property: expansion_direction
    value: Derived from local_orientation and the color of the orthogonal neighbor not part of the adjacent_green_pixels (Up, Down, Left, or Right).

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [list_of_objects]
    description: Find all connected components of green and red pixels containing exactly one red pixel.
  - action: determine_expansion_direction
    inputs: [object, red_pixel_location]
    outputs: [direction]
    description: Based on the red pixel's immediate green neighbors and the color of the neighbor in the orthogonal direction. If horizontal green neighbors, check up/down for white; if vertical green neighbors, check left/right for white.
  - action: expand_object
    inputs: [object, direction, output_grid]
    outputs: [modified_output_grid]
    description: For each pixel in the object, fill white space in the specified direction with the pixel's color.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    from: object (green shape)
    to: marker (red pixel)
  - type: adjacency
    from: marker (red pixel)
    to: green pixels
    relation: Determines local_orientation.
  - type: adjacency
    from: marker (red pixel)
    to: white pixel (in non-green adjacent direction)
    relation: Determines specific expansion_direction (e.g., up vs down).
  - type: causation
    event: expansion
    cause: object properties (local_orientation, expansion_direction)
    effect: White pixels adjacent to the object in the expansion direction are recolored.

transformation_goal: For each object identified by a red marker, determine its expansion direction and fill the adjacent white space accordingly in the output grid.
