Transformation Rule:
1. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2. Locate all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid, which act as markers.
3. Keep track of coordinates already processed as part of an object to avoid redundant calculations.
4. For each red pixel (marker) found at (marker_r, marker_c):
    a. If this marker has already been processed, continue to the next one.
    b. Identify the connected 'composite object' consisting of this red marker and all orthogonally connected green pixels (color 3) recursively attached to it. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for connectivity. Store the coordinates of all pixels in this object.
    c. Mark all coordinates of the identified object as processed.
    d. Determine the expansion direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) by finding the single orthogonally adjacent white pixel (color 0) next to the *marker* pixel (marker_r, marker_c) in the *input* grid. Represent this direction as a vector (dr, dc).
    e. If a valid, unique expansion direction is found:
        i. Iterate through each pixel (obj_r, obj_c) belonging to the composite object.
        ii. Retrieve the original color 'C' of this pixel from the input grid (input_grid[obj_r, obj_c]).
        iii. Initialize trace coordinates (trace_r, trace_c) starting one step from the object pixel in the expansion direction: (obj_r + dr, obj_c + dc).
        iv. Begin a loop: While the trace coordinates (trace_r, trace_c) are within the grid boundaries AND the pixel at these coordinates in the *original input grid* (input_grid[trace_r, trace_c]) is white (0):
            1. Set the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the *output* grid to the color 'C'.
            2. Update the trace coordinates by moving one more step in the expansion direction: (trace_r, trace_c) = (trace_r + dr, trace_c + dc).
5. Return the modified output grid.
