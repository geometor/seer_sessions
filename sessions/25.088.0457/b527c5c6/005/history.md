Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Locate all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.
3. For each red pixel found at coordinates (R, C):
    a. Identify the connected object consisting of this red pixel and all orthogonally adjacent green pixels (color 3) recursively connected to it. Store the coordinates of all pixels belonging to this object.
    b. Find the single orthogonally adjacent white pixel (color 0) next to the *red* pixel at (R, C). Determine the direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right) from the red pixel to this white pixel. This is the expansion direction for the entire object.
    c. For every pixel (obj_r, obj_c) belonging to the identified connected object:
        i. Retrieve the original color of this pixel from the input grid (it will be either red or green).
        ii. Determine the directional step (dr, dc) corresponding to the expansion direction (e.g., Up is (-1, 0), Right is (0, 1)).
        iii. Start tracing a path from the pixel adjacent to (obj_r, obj_c) in the expansion direction. Let the current trace coordinates be (trace_r, trace_c) = (obj_r + dr, obj_c + dc).
        iv. While the coordinates (trace_r, trace_c) are within the grid boundaries and the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the *output* grid is white (0):
            1. Color the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the output grid with the original color retrieved in step 3.c.i.
            2. Update the trace coordinates to the next step in the expansion direction: (trace_r, trace_c) = (trace_r + dr, trace_c + dc).
4. Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the failures and refine the approach.

**General Assessment**

The previous code failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding or incorrect implementation of the transformation rule. The transformed outputs show patterns related to the original objects and expansion directions, but the extent and interaction of these expansions are incorrect. Specifically, the expansions seem to overwrite existing non-white pixels or extend much further than intended in the expected outputs.

The core issue appears to be in step 3.c.iv of the previous natural language program: `While the coordinates (trace_r, trace_c) are within the grid boundaries and the pixel at (trace_r, trace_c) in the *output* grid is white (0):`. This allowed expansions to continue into space potentially filled by the expansion of another part of the same object or a different object processed earlier.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the expansion condition. Based on comparing the inputs and expected outputs, it seems the expansion path for each pixel should only proceed through cells that were *originally* white (color 0) in the input grid. Expansions from different pixels (whether from the same object or different objects) happen conceptually simultaneously, writing onto the output grid, and stop only when hitting a boundary or an *originally* non-white cell.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's re-examine the relationship between input, expected output, and the incorrectly transformed output for each example, focusing on the expansion rule.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Top Object (Marker @ 3,5; Dir: Up): The expected output shows the object's top row (row 3) projected upwards into the white space (rows 0-2). The transformed output incorrectly projected *all* pixels upwards until the boundary.
    *   Bottom Object (Marker @ 14,10; Dir: Left): The expected output shows the object's left column (col 10) projected leftwards into the white space (cols 0-9). The transformed output incorrectly projected *all* pixels leftwards until the boundary.
    *   *Observation:* Expansion seems limited by the original grid's non-white cells. Only the object pixels directly facing the expansion direction seem to initiate a successful projection into the adjacent white space.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Top Object (Marker @ 4,14; Dir: Up): Expected output shows row 4 projected into rows 0-3. Transformed output projected rows 4 and 5 upwards.
    *   Bottom Object (Marker @ 15,9; Dir: Right): Expected output shows col 9 projected into cols 10-19. Transformed output projected cols 7, 8, and 9 rightwards.
    *   *Observation:* Confirms the pattern from Example 1. Expansion stops when the path hits a non-white cell in the *original* input grid.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Top Object (Marker @ 4,4; Dir: Down): Expected output shows row 4 projected downwards into white space.
    *   Bottom Object (Marker @ 12,15; Dir: Right): Expected output shows col 15 projected rightwards into white space.
    *   *Observation:* Consistent with previous examples.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Left Object (Marker @ 4,3; Dir: Left): Expected output shows col 3 projected leftwards.
    *   Right Object (Marker @ 5,8; Dir: Down): Expected output shows row 5 projected downwards. Note the overlap area (e.g., cell (7,8)) takes the color from the downward projection (Red from (5,8)).
    *   *Observation:* The projection rule holds. When multiple projections might land on the same originally white cell, the output simply takes the color being projected there. Since the code iterates through objects and then pixels within objects, the "last write wins" principle applies implicitly, but the outcome seems consistent regardless of processing order because the path check relies on the static input grid.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Project colored objects into adjacent background space based on a directional marker."

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - name: background_pixel
    type: grid cell with value 0 (white).
  - name: marker_pixel
    type: grid cell with value 2 (red).
  - name: body_pixel
    type: grid cell with value 3 (green).
  - name: composite_object
    type: A connected group of one marker_pixel and its orthogonally adjacent body_pixels. Connectivity includes marker-to-body and body-to-body.
  - name: expansion_direction
    type: A vector (dr, dc) indicating Up (-1,0), Down (1,0), Left (0,-1), or Right (0,1). Determined by the single background_pixel orthogonally adjacent to the marker_pixel in the input grid.

input_features:
  - presence of one or more composite_objects.
  - each composite_object has exactly one marker_pixel.
  - each marker_pixel has exactly one orthogonally adjacent background_pixel in the input grid, defining the expansion_direction for its object.
  - background_pixels define empty space where expansion can occur.

transformations:
  - step: 1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 2. Identify all marker_pixels in the input grid.
  - step: 3. For each identified marker_pixel (r_m, c_m):
      - action: Determine the composite_object connected to this marker_pixel using orthogonal adjacency for marker_pixel and body_pixels.
      - check: Ensure this object hasn't been processed already (if multiple markers could belong to the same conceptual object, though not seen in examples).
      - action: Determine the expansion_direction (dr, dc) based on the single background_pixel adjacent to the marker_pixel (r_m, c_m) in the input grid.
      - action: For every pixel (r_obj, c_obj) belonging to the identified composite_object:
          - sub_action: Get the original color C = input_grid[r_obj, c_obj].
          - sub_action: Initialize trace coordinates (r_trace, c_trace) = (r_obj + dr, c_obj + dc).
          - loop: While the trace coordinates (r_trace, c_trace) are within the grid boundaries AND the pixel at input_grid[r_trace, c_trace] is a background_pixel (0):
              - update: Set output_grid[r_trace, c_trace] = C.
              - step: Move trace coordinates: (r_trace, c_trace) = (r_trace + dr, c_trace + dc).
  - step: 4. Return the final output grid.

output_features:
  - The output grid contains the original objects plus the colored paths projected from them.
  - Projected paths fill the originally adjacent background_pixels along the expansion_direction.
  - Projection stops at grid boundaries or originally non-background_pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates of all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid. These act as markers.
3.  Maintain a set of coordinates that have already been processed as part of an object to avoid redundant processing.
4.  Iterate through each found red pixel coordinate (marker\_r, marker\_c):
    a.  If (marker\_r, marker\_c) has already been processed, skip to the next red pixel.
    b.  Identify the full connected 'composite object' starting from (marker\_r, marker\_c). This object includes the initial red pixel and all orthogonally connected green pixels (color 3). Use a search algorithm (like BFS or DFS) restricted to red and green pixels. Record all coordinates belonging to this object.
    c.  Mark all coordinates of the found object as processed.
    d.  Find the single orthogonally adjacent white pixel (color 0) next to the *marker* pixel (marker\_r, marker\_c) in the *input* grid. Determine the direction vector (dr, dc) from the marker pixel to this white pixel (e.g., Up: (-1, 0), Right: (0, 1)). This is the `expansion_direction` for the entire object. If no single adjacent white pixel exists, this object does not expand (though this case is not expected based on examples).
    e.  Iterate through *each* pixel coordinate (obj\_r, obj\_c) belonging to the identified composite object:
        i.  Get the pixel's original color, `C`, from the input grid at `input_grid[obj_r, obj_c]`.
        ii. Initialize the trace coordinates `(trace_r, trace_c)` to the first step in the expansion direction: `(obj_r + dr, obj_c + dc)`.
        iii. Start a loop: While the current trace coordinates `(trace_r, trace_c)` are within the grid boundaries *and* the corresponding pixel in the *input* grid `input_grid[trace_r, trace_c]` is white (0):
            1.  Color the pixel in the *output* grid at `output_grid[trace_r, trace_c]` with the color `C`.
            2.  Update the trace coordinates by taking another step in the expansion direction: `(trace_r, trace_c) = (trace_r + dr, trace_c + dc)`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
