"""
Identifies connected components in the input grid. A component consists of contiguous pixels that are not white (0), connected both cardinally and diagonally (8-way).
A component is considered 'valid' if it contains exactly one 'marker' pixel. A marker pixel is any pixel whose color is not white (0) and not blue (1).
For each valid component:
  - Identify the color of the unique marker pixel (the 'marker color').
  - Identify all the blue (1) pixels belonging to this component.
  - For each blue pixel in the component, determine if it is 'interior'. A blue pixel is defined as 'interior' if *all* of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also pixels belonging to the *same* connected component (i.e., they are non-white and part of the component found using 8-way connectivity).
  - Change the color of all identified 'interior' blue pixels within the valid component to the marker color in the output grid.
Pixels belonging to invalid components (those with zero or more than one marker pixel), blue pixels in valid components that are not interior, marker pixels themselves, and the original white background pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
