"""
Identifies connected components in the input grid. A component consists of contiguous pixels that are not white (0), connected cardinally and diagonally. 
A component is considered "valid" if it contains exactly one pixel whose color is not blue (1) and not white (0). This unique non-blue, non-white pixel is the "marker".
For each valid component:
  - Identify the marker's color.
  - Identify all the blue (1) pixels belonging to this component.
  - For each blue pixel in the component, determine if it is "interior". A blue pixel is interior if none of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are white (0) pixels OR fall outside the grid boundary.
  - Change the color of all interior blue pixels within the valid component to the marker's color in the output grid.
Pixels in invalid components (those with zero or more than one marker) and pixels not part of any component (white pixels) remain unchanged.

Okay, let's break down the results and refine our understanding.

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying connected components of non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity), validating them based on the presence of a single unique non-blue/non-white 'marker' pixel, and then coloring 'interior' blue pixels within valid components with the marker's color. The code defines 'interior' based on cardinal neighbors not being white or out-of-bounds in the original input grid.

The results show that this code fails on all three training examples, indicated by the `Match: False` and non-zero `Pixels Off` counts. The core logic of identifying components and markers seems plausible, but the definition or application of 'interior' is likely incorrect, causing the wrong set of blue pixels to be colored.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate the 'Interior' Definition:** The current definition (`is_interior`) checks if any cardinal neighbor is white (0) or out-of-bounds. Comparing the transformed outputs with the expected outputs suggests this rule is too simplistic or misapplied. Pixels adjacent to the white background *or* potentially adjacent to other pixels *not* part of the current component seem to be excluded in the expected output, while the code might be including them (or vice-versa).
2.  **Hypothesize a New Rule:** A likely refinement is that a blue pixel is 'interior' if and only if *all* its cardinal neighbors are also part of the *same connected component*. This means the neighbors must be non-white and reachable via 8-way connectivity from the component's starting point, specifically excluding adjacency to the white background *or* pixels outside the component's boundary.
3.  **Verify with Examples:** Mentally trace or use code execution (if needed) to see if this revised 'interior' definition aligns better with the expected outputs across all examples.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this more accurate definition of 'interior' pixels.

**2. Metrics**

Based on the provided results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 11
    *   Observation: The transformed output incorrectly colors some blue pixels near the component edges and fails to color others that should be interior according to the expected output. This strongly suggests the 'interior' definition is the point of failure.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 30
    *   Observation: Similar issue to Example 1, but on a larger scale with more complex components. The number of errors indicates a systematic misapplication of the coloring rule.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Match: False
    *   Pixels Off: 14
    *   Observation: Again, the pattern of incorrect coloring of blue pixels persists, confirming the 'interior' definition needs revision.

**3. YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Cell Values: Integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Component
    Definition: A contiguous group of non-white pixels.
    Connectivity: Cardinal and Diagonal (8-way).
    Properties:
      - Pixels: List of coordinates and colors forming the component.
      - Markers: List of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels within the component.
      - Validity: Determined by the count of unique marker pixels.
        - Valid: Contains exactly one marker pixel.
        - Invalid: Contains zero or more than one marker pixel.
      - Marker Color: The color of the unique marker pixel (if valid).
  - Type: Blue Pixel
    Definition: A pixel with color Blue (1).
    Properties:
      - Location: Coordinate (row, col).
      - Membership: Belongs to a specific Component.
      - Interiority: Status determined by neighborhood within its component.
        - Interior: If all cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also part of the same component.
        - Boundary: If at least one cardinal neighbor is white (0), out-of-bounds, or part of a different component.

Actions:
  1. Find all distinct connected Components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  2. For each Component:
     a. Identify all marker pixels within it.
     b. Determine if the Component is Valid (exactly one marker pixel).
     c. If Valid:
        i. Store the Marker Color.
        ii. Identify all Blue Pixels belonging to this component.
        iii. Create a set of all pixel coordinates belonging to this component for efficient lookup.
        iv. For each Blue Pixel in the component:
           - Check its cardinal neighbors.
           - Determine if the Blue Pixel is Interior (all cardinal neighbors are within the component's coordinate set).
           - If Interior, mark this pixel to be changed.
  3. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
  4. For all marked Interior Blue Pixels belonging to Valid Components, change their color in the output grid to their respective Component's Marker Color.
  5. Pixels in Invalid Components, Boundary Blue Pixels in Valid Components, and Background Pixels remain unchanged.

```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all connected components in the input grid. A component consists of contiguous pixels that are not white (0), connected both cardinally and diagonally (8-way connectivity). Keep track of which pixels belong to which component.
3.  For each identified component:
    a.  Count the number of unique 'marker' pixels within it. A marker pixel is any pixel whose color is not white (0) and not blue (1).
    b.  If a component contains *exactly one* marker pixel, it is considered a 'valid' component. Note the color of this unique marker pixel (the 'marker color').
    c.  If a component is valid:
        i.  Identify all the blue (1) pixels that belong to this component.
        ii. For each blue pixel within this valid component, check if it is 'interior'. A blue pixel is defined as 'interior' if *all* of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also pixels belonging to the *same* connected component (i.e., they are non-white and part of the group identified in step 2).
        iii. Change the color of all identified 'interior' blue pixels in the output grid to the marker color determined in step 3b.
4.  Pixels belonging to invalid components (those with zero or more than one marker pixel), blue pixels in valid components that were determined *not* to be interior, marker pixels themselves, and the original white background pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
5.  Return the final output grid.
