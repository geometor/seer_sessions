            "text": "Okay, let's break down the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**1. General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying connected components of non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity), validating them based on the presence of a single unique non-blue/non-white 'marker' pixel, and then coloring 'interior' blue pixels within valid components with the marker's color. The code defines 'interior' based on cardinal neighbors not being white or out-of-bounds in the original input grid.\n\nThe results show that this code fails on all three training examples, indicated by the `Match: False` and non-zero `Pixels Off` counts. The core logic of identifying components and markers seems plausible, but the definition or application of 'interior' is likely incorrect, causing the wrong set of blue pixels to be colored.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the 'Interior' Definition:** The current definition (`is_interior`) checks if any cardinal neighbor is white (0) or out-of-bounds. Comparing the transformed outputs with the expected outputs suggests this rule is too simplistic or misapplied. Pixels adjacent to the white background *or* potentially adjacent to other pixels *not* part of the current component seem to be excluded in the expected output, while the code might be including them (or vice-versa).\n2.  **Hypothesize a New Rule:** A likely refinement is that a blue pixel is 'interior' if and only if *all* its cardinal neighbors are also part of the *same connected component*. This means the neighbors must be non-white and reachable via 8-way connectivity from the component's starting point, specifically excluding adjacency to the white background *or* pixels outside the component's boundary.\n3.  **Verify with Examples:** Mentally trace or use code execution (if needed) to see if this revised 'interior' definition aligns better with the expected outputs across all examples.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this more accurate definition of 'interior' pixels.\n\n**2. Metrics**\n\nBased on the provided results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 11\n    *   Observation: The transformed output incorrectly colors some blue pixels near the component edges and fails to color others that should be interior according to the expected output. This strongly suggests the 'interior' definition is the point of failure.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 30\n    *   Observation: Similar issue to Example 1, but on a larger scale with more complex components. The number of errors indicates a systematic misapplication of the coloring rule.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 14\n    *   Observation: Again, the pattern of incorrect coloring of blue pixels persists, confirming the 'interior' definition needs revision.\n\n**3.
