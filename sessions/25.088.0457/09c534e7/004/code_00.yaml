Grid:
  Type: 2D Array
  Cell Values: Integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  Background Color: White (0)

Objects:
  - Type: Component
    Definition: A contiguous group of non-white pixels.
    Connectivity: Cardinal and Diagonal (8-way).
    Properties:
      - Pixels: List of coordinates and colors forming the component.
      - Markers: List of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels within the component.
      - Validity: Determined by the count of unique marker pixels.
        - Valid: Contains exactly one marker pixel.
        - Invalid: Contains zero or more than one marker pixel.
      - Marker Color: The color of the unique marker pixel (if valid).
  - Type: Blue Pixel
    Definition: A pixel with color Blue (1).
    Properties:
      - Location: Coordinate (row, col).
      - Membership: Belongs to a specific Component.
      - Interiority: Status determined by neighborhood within its component.
        - Interior: If all cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also part of the same component.
        - Boundary: If at least one cardinal neighbor is white (0), out-of-bounds, or part of a different component.

Actions:
  1. Find all distinct connected Components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  2. For each Component:
     a. Identify all marker pixels within it.
     b. Determine if the Component is Valid (exactly one marker pixel).
     c. If Valid:
        i. Store the Marker Color.
        ii. Identify all Blue Pixels belonging to this component.
        iii. Create a set of all pixel coordinates belonging to this component for efficient lookup.
        iv. For each Blue Pixel in the component:
           - Check its cardinal neighbors.
           - Determine if the Blue Pixel is Interior (all cardinal neighbors are within the component's coordinate set).
           - If Interior, mark this pixel to be changed.
  3. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
  4. For all marked Interior Blue Pixels belonging to Valid Components, change their color in the output grid to their respective Component's Marker Color.
  5. Pixels in Invalid Components, Boundary Blue Pixels in Valid Components, and Background Pixels remain unchanged.
