task_type: object_modification
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static_frame
  - type: shape
    color: blue (1)
    role: container
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - can contain a single marker pixel
  - type: marker
    color: red (2), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6) # Variable colors
    role: seed_or_fill_color
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - located strictly inside a blue shape (not adjacent to white)
      - determines the fill color for the containing shape's interior
relationship: containment
  - marker is inside a blue shape
action: conditional_fill
  condition: if a blue shape contains exactly one marker pixel
  target: interior blue pixels within that shape
  effect: change color of target pixels to the marker's color
definitions:
  - interior_pixel: A blue pixel within a shape that has no cardinally adjacent white (0) pixels.
  - boundary_pixel: A blue pixel within a shape that has at least one cardinally adjacent white (0) pixel.
invariants:
  - background color (white=0)
  - boundary pixels of marked shapes
  - shapes without markers
  - marker pixel position and color (relative to the shape)
