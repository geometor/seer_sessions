            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**1. Perception of Task Elements**\n\n*   **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is consistently white (0).\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects appear to be contiguous shapes made of blue (1) pixels. Some of these blue shapes contain a single pixel of a different color (red=2, green=3, yellow=4, magenta=6). These non-blue, non-white pixels seem to act as markers or seeds within their respective blue shapes.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves modifying the blue shapes based on the internal marker pixel. Specifically, the \"interior\" blue pixels of a shape are changed to match the color of the marker contained within that shape. The \"exterior\" or boundary blue pixels remain unchanged. Pixels outside these marked shapes (including unmarked blue shapes) also remain unchanged.\n*   **Boundary vs. Interior:** A blue pixel appears to be part of the boundary if it is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a white (0) pixel. Blue pixels surrounded only by other non-white pixels (blue or the marker color) are considered interior.\n*   **Consistency:** This fill pattern based on an internal marker is consistent across all three training examples, handling different shapes, sizes, marker colors, and positions.\n\n**2. Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
