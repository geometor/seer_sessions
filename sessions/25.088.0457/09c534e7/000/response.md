Okay, let's break down this task.

**1. Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is consistently white (0).
*   **Objects:** The primary objects appear to be contiguous shapes made of blue (1) pixels. Some of these blue shapes contain a single pixel of a different color (red=2, green=3, yellow=4, magenta=6). These non-blue, non-white pixels seem to act as markers or seeds within their respective blue shapes.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves modifying the blue shapes based on the internal marker pixel. Specifically, the "interior" blue pixels of a shape are changed to match the color of the marker contained within that shape. The "exterior" or boundary blue pixels remain unchanged. Pixels outside these marked shapes (including unmarked blue shapes) also remain unchanged.
*   **Boundary vs. Interior:** A blue pixel appears to be part of the boundary if it is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a white (0) pixel. Blue pixels surrounded only by other non-white pixels (blue or the marker color) are considered interior.
*   **Consistency:** This fill pattern based on an internal marker is consistent across all three training examples, handling different shapes, sizes, marker colors, and positions.

**2. Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: object_modification
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static_frame
  - type: shape
    color: blue (1)
    role: container
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - can contain a single marker pixel
  - type: marker
    color: red (2), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6) # Variable colors
    role: seed_or_fill_color
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - located strictly inside a blue shape (not adjacent to white)
      - determines the fill color for the containing shape's interior
relationship: containment
  - marker is inside a blue shape
action: conditional_fill
  condition: if a blue shape contains exactly one marker pixel
  target: interior blue pixels within that shape
  effect: change color of target pixels to the marker's color
definitions:
  - interior_pixel: A blue pixel within a shape that has no cardinally adjacent white (0) pixels.
  - boundary_pixel: A blue pixel within a shape that has at least one cardinally adjacent white (0) pixel.
invariants:
  - background color (white=0)
  - boundary pixels of marked shapes
  - shapes without markers
  - marker pixel position and color (relative to the shape)
```


**3. Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous shapes formed by blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified blue shape:
    a.  Scan the pixels within the bounding box of the shape to find if it contains exactly one non-blue, non-white pixel (a marker pixel). Let the color of this marker be `marker_color`.
    b.  If such a unique `marker_color` is found for the shape:
        i.  Iterate through all the blue (1) pixels belonging to this specific shape.
        ii. For each blue pixel, check its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        iii. If none of the cardinal neighbors are white (0), then this blue pixel is an "interior" pixel.
        iv. Change the color of this interior blue pixel in the output grid to `marker_color`.
4.  Return the modified output grid. Shapes without a unique marker, or pixels not part of any shape, remain unchanged from the input.
