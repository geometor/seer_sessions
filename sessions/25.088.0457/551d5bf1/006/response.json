            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the concept of filling enclosed white areas (\"lakes\") and identifying points where these filled areas touch the exterior white space (\"leak points\"). However, the mechanism for propagating the fill color (azure) from these leak points into the exterior white space was incorrect. The code propagated the leaks in straight lines, whereas the expected outputs show a flood-fill behavior originating from the leak points, filling the entire connected exterior white region accessible from those points.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the leak propagation step. Instead of linear propagation, we need to initiate a flood fill (like BFS or DFS) starting from *all* identified leak points simultaneously, filling all reachable exterior white pixels with azure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the pixel counts and differences for each example.\n\n"

These are the 'leak points'. Collect the coordinates of all such leak points.\n4.  **Flood Fill from Leaks:** Perform a second flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search) starting simultaneously from *all* identified leak points. This flood fill should only spread into white pixels that were marked as 'exterior' in Step 1. Change the color of all reachable exterior white pixels during this flood fill to azure (8). The fill stops at grid boundaries, non-white pixels, or pixels already visited in *this* flood fill step.\n5.  **Return Result:** The final modified grid is the output."
