**General Assessment:**

The previous code correctly identified the concept of filling enclosed white areas ("lakes") and identifying points where these filled areas touch the exterior white space ("leak points"). However, the mechanism for propagating the fill color (azure) from these leak points into the exterior white space was incorrect. The code propagated the leaks in straight lines, whereas the expected outputs show a flood-fill behavior originating from the leak points, filling the entire connected exterior white region accessible from those points.

The strategy is to modify the leak propagation step. Instead of linear propagation, we need to initiate a flood fill (like BFS or DFS) starting from *all* identified leak points simultaneously, filling all reachable exterior white pixels with azure.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the pixel counts and differences for each example.

**Findings from Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The transformed output has only 24 azure pixels compared to the expected 103. All 79 mismatched pixels are cases where azure was expected, but another color (primarily white) was present in the transformed output. No pixels were incorrectly changed *to* azure.
*   **Example 2:** Similar pattern. The transformed output has 32 azure pixels versus the expected 113. All 81 mismatches are pixels that should have been azure but were not.

This confirms the assessment: the initial fill of enclosed areas is likely correct (or mostly correct), but the propagation into the exterior white areas is severely insufficient. The code fails to color large regions of exterior white that should become azure. The problem lies entirely in *under-filling*, specifically during the leak propagation phase.

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill enclosed white areas with azure, then flood-fill all connected exterior white areas starting from points adjacent to the initial fill.

definitions:
  grid: 2D array of integers 0-9 representing colors.
  white: Pixel value 0.
  blue: Pixel value 1 (acts as a boundary/wall).
  azure: Pixel value 8 (the fill color).
  exterior_white: White pixels connected to the grid border via a path of white pixels.
  interior_white: White pixels not connected to the grid border (enclosed by non-white pixels).
  initial_fill_area: The set of interior_white pixels.
  leak_point: An exterior_white pixel that is orthogonally adjacent to any pixel in the initial_fill_area.

input_objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of different colors (white, blue, potentially others).
      - blue pixels often form closed or partially closed shapes.
      - contains areas of white pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify_exterior_white
    tool: Flood fill (BFS)
    input: grid, border white pixels
    output: set of coordinates of exterior white pixels.
  - action: identify_and_fill_interior_white
    input: grid, set of exterior white pixels
    output: modified grid where interior white pixels are changed to azure, set of coordinates of initially filled azure pixels.
    logic: Iterate through the grid. If a pixel is white and NOT in the exterior set, change it to azure.
  - action: identify_leak_points
    input: grid (after initial fill), set of exterior white pixels, set of initially filled azure coordinates.
    output: set of coordinates of leak points.
    logic: For each initially filled azure pixel, check orthogonal neighbors. If a neighbor is an exterior white pixel, add its coordinates to the set of leak points.
  - action: flood_fill_exterior_from_leaks
    tool: Flood fill (BFS)
    input: grid (after initial fill), set of leak points
    output: final grid
    logic: Initialize a queue with all leak points. Perform a BFS: For each pixel dequeued, change its color to azure. Enqueue its white neighbors that haven't been visited or queued yet. Stop expansion when hitting non-white pixels or grid boundaries.

output_grid:
  properties:
    - Same dimensions as the input grid.
    - Contains original non-white pixels.
    - Interior white areas are filled with azure.
    - Exterior white areas connected to the initial fill (via leak points) are also filled with azure.
    - White pixels remain only if they are exterior AND not reachable by the flood fill starting from leak points.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Exterior White Space:** Perform a flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search) starting from all white (0) pixels located on the borders of the input grid. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.
2.  **Initial Fill of Interior:** Create a copy of the input grid. Iterate through this grid. Any white pixel that was *not* marked as 'exterior' in Step 1 is considered 'interior'. Change the color of all these interior white pixels to azure (8). Keep track of the coordinates of these initially filled azure pixels.
3.  **Identify Leak Points:** Find all exterior white pixels (identified in Step 1) that are orthogonally adjacent to any of the initially filled azure pixels (from Step 2). These are the 'leak points'. Collect the coordinates of all such leak points.
4.  **Flood Fill from Leaks:** Perform a second flood fill (e.g., Breadth-First Search) starting simultaneously from *all* identified leak points. This flood fill should only spread into white pixels that were marked as 'exterior' in Step 1. Change the color of all reachable exterior white pixels during this flood fill to azure (8). The fill stops at grid boundaries, non-white pixels, or pixels already visited in *this* flood fill step.
5.  **Return Result:** The final modified grid is the output.
