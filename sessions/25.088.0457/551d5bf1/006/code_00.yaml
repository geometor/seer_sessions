task_description: Fill enclosed white areas with azure, then flood-fill all connected exterior white areas starting from points adjacent to the initial fill.

definitions:
  grid: 2D array of integers 0-9 representing colors.
  white: Pixel value 0.
  blue: Pixel value 1 (acts as a boundary/wall).
  azure: Pixel value 8 (the fill color).
  exterior_white: White pixels connected to the grid border via a path of white pixels.
  interior_white: White pixels not connected to the grid border (enclosed by non-white pixels).
  initial_fill_area: The set of interior_white pixels.
  leak_point: An exterior_white pixel that is orthogonally adjacent to any pixel in the initial_fill_area.

input_objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of different colors (white, blue, potentially others).
      - blue pixels often form closed or partially closed shapes.
      - contains areas of white pixels.

actions:
  - action: identify_exterior_white
    tool: Flood fill (BFS)
    input: grid, border white pixels
    output: set of coordinates of exterior white pixels.
  - action: identify_and_fill_interior_white
    input: grid, set of exterior white pixels
    output: modified grid where interior white pixels are changed to azure, set of coordinates of initially filled azure pixels.
    logic: Iterate through the grid. If a pixel is white and NOT in the exterior set, change it to azure.
  - action: identify_leak_points
    input: grid (after initial fill), set of exterior white pixels, set of initially filled azure coordinates.
    output: set of coordinates of leak points.
    logic: For each initially filled azure pixel, check orthogonal neighbors. If a neighbor is an exterior white pixel, add its coordinates to the set of leak points.
  - action: flood_fill_exterior_from_leaks
    tool: Flood fill (BFS)
    input: grid (after initial fill), set of leak points
    output: final grid
    logic: Initialize a queue with all leak points. Perform a BFS: For each pixel dequeued, change its color to azure. Enqueue its white neighbors that haven't been visited or queued yet. Stop expansion when hitting non-white pixels or grid boundaries.

output_grid:
  properties:
    - Same dimensions as the input grid.
    - Contains original non-white pixels.
    - Interior white areas are filled with azure.
    - Exterior white areas connected to the initial fill (via leak points) are also filled with azure.
    - White pixels remain only if they are exterior AND not reachable by the flood fill starting from leak points.
