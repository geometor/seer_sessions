Identify Exterior White Pixels: Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all white (0) pixels on the grid borders. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.\n3. Initial Fill: Iterate through the grid. Change any white (0) pixel that was *not* marked as 'exterior' to azure (8). Keep track of the coordinates of these 'initially filled' azure pixels.\n4. Identify Leak Points and Directions: Iterate through the initially filled azure pixels. For each azure pixel, check its four orthogonal neighbors. If a neighbor is white (0) *and* was marked as 'exterior' in Step 2, then this neighbor is a 'leak point'. Record the coordinates of the leak point and the direction *away* from the initial azure pixel (e.g., if the white neighbor is above the azure pixel, the leak direction is 'Up'). Store these leak points along with their respective propagation directions. Store these as tuples: `(r, c, dr, dc)`.\n5. Propagate Leaks:\n   - Initialize a set `filled_by_leak` to store coordinates of pixels colored azure during this step. Add coordinates of initially filled azure pixels from Step 3 to this set initially to prevent leaks from overwriting the initial fill areas.\n   - Iterate through each identified leak point and its direction `(start_r, start_c, dr, dc)`:\n     - Start at the leak point coordinates `r, c = start_r, start_c`.\n     - Repeatedly step in the determined direction:\n       - Check the current cell `(r, c)`:\n         - Is `(r, c)` outside the grid boundaries? Stop.\n         - Is `output_grid[r, c]` not white (0)? Stop.\n         - Is `(r, c)` already in `filled_by_leak`? Stop.\n       - If none of the stopping conditions are met:\n         - Change `output_grid[r, c]` to azure (8).\n         - Add `(r, c)` to the `filled_by_leak` set.\n         - Update coordinates for the next step: `r, c = r + dr, c + dc`.\n       - If any stopping condition is met, break the inner loop and move to the next leak point.\n6.
