Transformation Rule:
1. Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
2. Identify Exterior White Pixels: Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all white (0) pixels on the grid borders. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.
3. Initial Fill: Iterate through the grid. Change any white (0) pixel that was *not* marked as 'exterior' to azure (8). Keep track of the coordinates of these 'initially filled' pixels.
4. Identify Leak Points and Directions: Iterate through the initially filled azure pixels. Check their orthogonal neighbors. If a neighbor is white (0), it's a leak point. Determine the leak direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) based on the relative position of the white neighbor to the initial azure pixel. Add the leak point coordinates to corresponding directional lists/queues.
5. Propagate Right Leaks: For each leak point in the Right list, if it's still white, change it to azure (fills 1 pixel).
6. Propagate Down Leaks: For each leak point in the Down list: if it's white, change it to azure; then check the cell below - if it's within bounds and white, change it to azure (fills up to 2 pixels).
7. Propagate Up Leaks: Process the Up queue using BFS. For each dequeued white pixel, change it to azure and enqueue the pixel above it. Stop propagation upwards if boundary, blue pixel, or another azure pixel is hit.
8. Propagate Left Leaks: Process the Left queue using BFS. For each dequeued white pixel, change it to azure and enqueue the pixel to its left. Stop propagation leftwards if boundary, blue pixel, or another azure pixel is hit.
9. Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempts to implement a "fill and leak" transformation. It correctly identifies enclosed white areas (Step 3: Initial Fill) in some cases, but the logic for propagating the "leaks" (Steps 4-8) does not accurately reflect the patterns shown in the expected outputs across both examples. The fixed propagation distances (1 for right, 2 for down) and the different propagation methods (BFS vs. simple fill) for different directions in the previous code are the primary source of errors.

The discrepancies indicate that the leak propagation should likely continue in each identified direction (up, down, left, right) from the initial leak point until an obstacle (grid boundary or blue pixel) is encountered, rather than stopping after a fixed number of steps or using different algorithms for different directions. A consistent propagation mechanism (like BFS or iterative stepping) should be applied for all four directions.

**Strategy:**

1.  Verify the initial fill step again.
2.  Re-analyze the leak propagation mechanism:
    *   Confirm that leaks originate only from white pixels adjacent to the *initial* azure fill.
    *   Determine the stopping condition for propagation in each direction (boundary or blue pixel).
    *   Implement a consistent propagation method (e.g., iterative step-by-step or BFS per direction) for all four leak directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).
3.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts based on these refined observations.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's compare the outputs more formally.
