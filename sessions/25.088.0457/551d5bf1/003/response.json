Identify Exterior White Pixels: Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all white (0) pixels on the grid borders. Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.\n3. Initial Fill: Iterate through the grid. Change any white (0) pixel that was *not* marked as 'exterior' to azure (8). Keep track of the coordinates of these 'initially filled' pixels.\n4. Identify Leak Points and Directions: Iterate through the initially filled azure pixels. Check their orthogonal neighbors. If a neighbor is white (0), it's a leak point. Determine the leak direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) based on the relative position of the white neighbor to the initial azure pixel. Add the leak point coordinates to corresponding directional lists/queues.\n5. Propagate Right Leaks: For each leak point in the Right list, if it's still white, change it to azure (fills 1 pixel).\n6. Propagate Down Leaks: For each leak point in the Down list: if it's white, change it to azure; then check the cell below - if it's within bounds and white, change it to azure (fills up to 2 pixels).\n7. Propagate Up Leaks: Process the Up queue using BFS. For each dequeued white pixel, change it to azure and enqueue the pixel above it. Stop propagation upwards if boundary, blue pixel, or another azure pixel is hit.\n8. Propagate Left Leaks: Process the Left queue using BFS. For each dequeued white pixel, change it to azure and enqueue the pixel to its left. Stop propagation leftwards if boundary, blue pixel, or another azure pixel is hit.\n9. Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a fill and leak transformation to the input grid based on the refined rules.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = input_array.copy() # Step 1: Copy input\n    rows, cols = input_array.shape\n    \n    white = 0\n    blue = 1\n    azure = 8\n\n    # Helper to check if coordinates are within grid bounds\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    # Step 2: Identify Exterior White Pixels using flood fill from borders\n    visited_exterior = np.zeros_like(input_array, dtype=bool)\n    q_exterior = deque()\n\n    # Add all border white cells to the queue\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols -
