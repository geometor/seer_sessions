            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by first identifying and filling enclosed white areas with azure, and then handling 'leaks' where the enclosure is incomplete. The results show that the initial filling works for some completely enclosed areas, but the 'leak' propagation logic is flawed and fails to match the expected outputs.\n\nSpecifically, the actual outputs indicate:\n1.  The initial fill might not be correctly identifying all enclosed areas (e.g., the middle area in Example 1's actual output is not filled initially).\n2.  The rules for propagating the azure color from the leak points are incorrect. The directions and distances of propagation do not match the expected behavior (e.g., rightward leak in Example 1, upward/leftward leaks).\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n1.  Verify the initial flood fill logic ensures all truly enclosed white areas are identified.\n2.  Re-analyze the relationship between the leak location (the gap in the blue frame) relative to the initially filled area and the resulting azure spread pattern in the expected outputs.\n3.  Refine the leak propagation rules based on this analysis, paying close attention to the direction, extent (fixed distance vs. until boundary/obstacle), and stopping conditions for the azure spread.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between leak points and spread in the expected outputs.\n\n**Example 1 Expected Output Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Grid size: 24x25\n    *   Colors: White (0), Blue (1)\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    *   Grid size: 24x25\n    *   Colors: White (0), Blue (1), Azure (8)\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   **Top-Left Frame:** Input (1,1) to (6,6). Enclosed. Output: Filled (2,2) to (5,5) with Azure. Correct initial fill.\n    *   **Top-Right Frame:** Input (1,15) to (5,22). Gap at (3,22) (should be blue). Output: Initially fills (2,16) to (4,21) with Azure. Then, Azure spreads right from (3,22) to the edge (3,24).\n    *   **Middle Frame:** Input (8,10) to (13,16). Gaps at (10,10) (left) and (8,13) (top). Output: Initially fills (9,11) to (12,15). Azure spreads left from (10,10) to edge (10,0). Azure spreads up from (8,13) to edge (0,13). *Correction*: Looking closely, the upward spread from (8,13) actually seems to originate from the filled cell (9,13) leaking upwards to (8,13). Similarly, the leftward spread from (10,10) originates from the filled cell (10,11) leaking leftwards to (10,10).\n    *   **Bottom-Left Frame:** Input (16,2) to (21,9). Gap at (21,5). Output: Initially fills (17,3) to (20,8). Azure spreads down from (21,5) by two cells, filling (21,5) and (22,5). *Correction*: The leak point is (21,5), adjacent to filled cells like (20,5). Azure fills (21,5) and (22,5).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Frame:** Input (17,16) to (22,21). Gap at (17,19). Output: Initially fills (18,17) to (21,20). Azure spreads up from (17,19) until it hits the blue frame above (the middle frame's bottom edge at row 13). *Correction*: The leak point is (17,19), adjacent to filled cell (18,19). Azure fills (17,19) upwards until row 14 (cell (14,19) is blue).\n\n**Example 2 Expected Output Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Grid size: 24x28\n    *   Colors: White (0), Blue (1)\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    *   Grid size: 24x28\n    *   Colors: White (0), Blue (1), Azure (8)\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   **Top-Left Frame:** Input (1,2) to (5,8). Gap at (1,5). Output: Initially fills (2,3) to (4,7). Azure spreads up from leak point (1,5) to edge (0,5).\n    *   **Top-Right Frame:** Input (1,19) to (5,26). Gap at (3,26). Output: Initially fills (2,20) to (4,25). Azure spreads right from leak point (3,26) to edge (3,27).\n    *   **Middle Frame:** Input (7,12) to (13,20). Gap at (7,15). Output: Initially fills (8,13) to (12,19). Azure spreads up from leak point (7,15) to edge (0,15).\n    *   **Bottom-Left Frame:** Input (14,5) to (20,10). Enclosed. Output: Filled (15,6) to (19,9) with Azure.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Frame:** Input (18,19) to (22,24). Gap at (18,22). Output: Initially fills (19,20) to (21,23). Azure spreads up from leak point (18,22) until it hits the blue frame above (the middle frame's bottom edge at row 13).\n\n**Refined Leak Understanding:**\n\n1.  **Initial Fill:** Correct. Fill white areas enclosed by blue/boundaries with azure.\n2.  **Identify Leak Points:** Find white cells `(r, c)` that are orthogonally adjacent to any of the *initially filled* azure cells. These white cells represent the gaps.\n3.  **Determine Leak Direction:** The direction is *away* from the adjacent initial azure cell towards the white leak point cell.\n    *   If initial azure is at `(r+1, c)` and white leak point is `(r, c)`, the leak direction is **Up**.\n    *   If initial azure is at `(r-1, c)` and white leak point is `(r, c)`, the leak direction is **Down**.\n    *   If initial azure is at `(r, c+1)` and white leak point is `(r, c)`, the leak direction is **Left**.\n    *   If initial azure is at `(r, c-1)` and white leak point is `(r, c)`, the leak direction is **Right**.\n4.  **Propagate Leak:** Start filling from the identified white leak point `(r, c)` in the determined direction.\n    *   **Up/Left:** Fill the leak point `(r, c)` with azure. Continue filling subsequent cells in the same direction (up or left) as long as they are white (0) and within bounds. Stop if a non-white cell (blue, existing azure, etc.) or the grid boundary is encountered.\n    *   **Down:** Fill the leak point `(r, c)` and the cell directly below it `(r+1, c)` with azure, provided they are white (0) and within bounds. Stop. (Total 2 cells filled).\n    *   **Right:** Fill the leak point `(r, c)` with azure, provided it is white (0) and within bounds. Stop. (Total 1 cell filled).\n\n**Implementation Note:** Need to handle the processing order carefully. It might be best to:\n1. Perform the initial fill and identify all *initially filled* azure coordinates.\n2. Identify all *potential leak points* (white cells adjacent to initial azure).\n3. Process leaks based on direction:\n    * Fill all \"Right\" leak points (1 step).\n    * Fill all \"Down\" leak points (2 steps).\n    * Use queues/iterative filling for \"Up\" leaks.\n    * Use queues/iterative filling for \"Left\" leaks.\n    Ensure that during propagation, you don't overwrite blue pixels and stop correctly at existing azure pixels (whether initial or filled by another leak).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Mark all reachable white pixels as 'exterior'.\n3.  **Initial Fill:** Iterate through the grid. Change any white (0) pixel that was *not* marked as 'exterior' in step 2 to azure (8). Keep track of the coordinates `(r, c)` of all pixels changed to azure in this step (these are the 'initially filled' pixels).\n4.  **Identify Leak Points and Directions:** Create lists or queues for each potential leak direction (Up, Down, Left, Right). Iterate through all initially filled azure pixels found in step 3. For each such pixel at `(r_az, c_az)`, check its four orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)`:\n    *   If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds and is white (0) in the *current* output grid state, then `(nr, nc)` is a leak point.\n    *   Determine the leak direction based on the relative position of the leak point `(nr, nc)` to the initial azure pixel `(r_az, c_az)`:\n        *   If `nr < r_az`: Direction is **Up**. Add `(nr, nc)` to the Up-leak queue.\n        *   If `nr > r_az`: Direction is **Down**. Add `(nr, nc)` to the Down-leak list.\n        *   If `nc < c_az`: Direction is **Left**. Add `(nr, nc)` to the Left-leak queue.\n        *   If `nc > c_az`: Direction is **Right**. Add `(nr, nc)` to the Right-leak list.\n5.  **Propagate Right Leaks:** Iterate through the Right-leak list. For each coordinate `(r, c)`, if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid is currently white (0), change it to azure (8).\n6.  **Propagate Down Leaks:** Iterate through the Down-leak list. For each coordinate `(r, c)`:\n    *   If the pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0), change it to azure (8).\n    *   Check the pixel below at `(r+1, c)`. If it's within bounds and is white (0), change it to azure (8).\n7.  **Propagate Up Leaks:** Process the Up-leak queue (using BFS or iterative approach). Maintain a set of 'visited_for_up_leak' coordinates to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue `(r, c)`.\n        *   If `(r, c)` is out of bounds, or not white (0), or already visited for up-leaks, continue to the next iteration.\n        *   Change the pixel at `(r, c)` to azure (8) and mark it as visited for up-leaks.\n        *   Enqueue the cell directly above: `(r-1, c)`.\n8.  **Propagate Left Leaks:** Process the Left-leak queue similarly to Up-leaks. Maintain a set of 'visited_for_left_leak' coordinates.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue `(r, c)`.\n        *   If `(r, c)` is out of bounds, or not white (0), or already visited for left-leaks, continue.\n        *   Change the pixel at `(r, c)` to azure (8) and mark it as visited for left-leaks.\n        *   Enqueue the cell directly to the left: `(r, c-1)`.\n9.  **Return** the modified output grid."
