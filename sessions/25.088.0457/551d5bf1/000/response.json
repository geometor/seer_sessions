            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple shapes made of blue pixels (1) set against a white background (0). These shapes resemble hollow rectangles or frames.\n2.  **Object Integrity:** Some blue frames are complete, forming fully enclosed rectangular boundaries. Others are incomplete: they might have gaps (missing blue pixels) in their sides, or they might run up against the edge of the grid, effectively using the grid boundary as part of their enclosure.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action is filling the areas *inside* these blue frames. The white pixels (0) enclosed by blue pixels (1) or the grid boundaries are changed to azure pixels (8).\n4.  **Secondary Transformation (Leaks):** When a blue frame has a gap, the azure fill \"leaks\" out through that gap into the surrounding white area. The way it leaks depends on the orientation of the gap:\n    *   **Horizontal Gap (Bottom):** If a blue pixel is missing on the bottom edge of a frame, the azure color leaks *downwards* for exactly two pixels from the gap location.\n    *   **Vertical Gap (Right):** If a blue pixel is missing on the right edge of a frame, the azure color leaks *rightwards* for exactly one pixel from the gap location.\n    *   **Horizontal Gap (Top):** If a blue pixel is missing on the top edge, the azure color leaks *upwards* from the gap, continuing until it hits another object (blue pixel), the fill color (azure pixel), or the grid boundary.\n    *   **Vertical Gap (Left):** If a blue pixel is missing on the left edge, the azure color leaks *leftwards* from the gap, continuing until it hits another object, the fill color, or the grid boundary.\n5.  **Color Consistency:** The original blue frames remain unchanged in the output. Only enclosed white pixels and leaked areas change color to azure.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

An interior pixel is one from which you cannot reach the grid's border by moving only through white pixels (without crossing a blue (1) pixel).\n3.  Change the color of all identified interior white pixels to azure (8) in the working grid.\n4.  Scan the working grid to find \"leak source\" points. A leak source is an azure (8) pixel that has an adjacent white (0) pixel neighbor in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n5.  For each identified leak source adjacent to a white pixel:\n    a.  **Downward Leak:** If the white pixel is *below* the azure pixel, change the color of the white pixel *and* the pixel directly below it (if within bounds and also white) to azure (8). (Total leak distance: 2 pixels down).\n    b.  **Rightward Leak:** If the white pixel is to the *right* of the azure pixel, change the color of that white pixel (if within bounds) to azure (8). (Total leak distance: 1 pixel right).\n    c.  **Upward Leak:** If the white pixel is *above* the azure pixel, change its color to azure (8). Then, continue checking the pixel above the newly changed one. If it's within bounds and white (0), change it to azure (8) and repeat. Stop this upward propagation when you hit the grid boundary, a blue (1) pixel, or an existing azure (8) pixel.\n    d.  **Leftward Leak:** If the white pixel is to the *left* of the azure pixel, change its color to azure (8). Then, continue checking the pixel to the left of the newly changed one. If it's within bounds and white (0), change it to azure (8) and repeat. Stop this leftward propagation when you hit the grid boundary, a blue (1) pixel, or an existing azure (8) pixel.\n6.  Apply leak propagation rules carefully, ensuring that a pixel is only changed if it is currently white (0) to avoid conflicts between overlapping leaks or re-coloring the initial fill. The upward and leftward leaks should propagate fully before considering the next leak source for those directions.\n7.  The final state of the working grid after applying all fills and leaks is the output."
