description: Analysis of the frame-filling and leaking task.
observations:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - frame_color: blue (1)
      - fill_color: azure (8)
  - element: objects
    type: frames
    description: Hollow rectangular shapes made of blue pixels.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - status: can be complete or incomplete (gaps, touching grid edge)
  - element: regions
    type: interior
    description: Areas of white pixels enclosed by blue frames or grid boundaries.
    properties:
      - initial_color: white (0)
      - final_color: azure (8)
  - element: gaps
    description: Missing segments in the blue frame boundaries allowing interaction between interior and exterior regions.
    properties:
      - location: associated with an adjacent interior (azure) pixel and an exterior (white) pixel.
      - orientation: top, bottom, left, right relative to the interior.
actions:
  - name: detect_interior
    input: input_grid
    output: set of interior pixel coordinates
    description: Identify all white pixels enclosed by blue pixels or grid boundaries.
  - name: fill_interior
    input: set of interior pixel coordinates
    output: modified_grid
    description: Change the color of interior pixels from white (0) to azure (8).
  - name: detect_leaks
    input: modified_grid (after filling)
    output: list of leak sources (coordinate, direction)
    description: Find azure pixels adjacent to white pixels where a blue frame gap exists.
  - name: propagate_leaks
    input: modified_grid, list of leak sources
    output: final_output_grid
    description: Extend azure color from leak sources into adjacent white pixels according to direction-specific rules (down 2, right 1, up/left until boundary/obstacle).
relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    description: Blue frames and grid boundaries enclose white regions.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Leaks occur where interior azure pixels are adjacent to exterior white pixels across a gap.
  - type: directional_propagation
    description: The extent and direction of a leak depend on the orientation of the gap relative to the filled interior.
