**General Assessment:**

The provided code attempts to implement a "fill and leak" transformation. It correctly identifies enclosed white areas (Step 3: Initial Fill) in some cases, but the logic for propagating the "leaks" (Steps 4-8) does not accurately reflect the patterns shown in the expected outputs across both examples. The fixed propagation distances (1 for right, 2 for down) and the different propagation methods (BFS vs. simple fill) for different directions in the previous code are the primary source of errors.

The discrepancies indicate that the leak propagation should likely continue in each identified direction (up, down, left, right) from the initial leak point until an obstacle (grid boundary or blue pixel) is encountered, rather than stopping after a fixed number of steps or using different algorithms for different directions. A consistent propagation mechanism (like BFS or iterative stepping) should be applied for all four directions.

**Strategy:**

1.  Verify the initial fill step again.
2.  Re-analyze the leak propagation mechanism:
    *   Confirm that leaks originate only from white pixels adjacent to the *initial* azure fill.
    *   Determine the stopping condition for propagation in each direction (boundary or blue pixel).
    *   Implement a consistent propagation method (e.g., iterative step-by-step or BFS per direction) for all four leak directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).
3.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts based on these refined observations.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's compare the outputs more formally.
