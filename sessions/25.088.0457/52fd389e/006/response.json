            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed that the triggering object must be a *solid* yellow rectangle. The examples show that the object is a contiguous group of yellow pixels which may contain \"holes\" filled with other colors. The transformation rule applies if these \"holes\" (internal pixels that are not yellow and not white) within the bounding box of the yellow component *all share the same color*. The number of these internal pixels determines the thickness of the border, and their shared color determines the border color.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correctly identify contiguous components of yellow pixels.\n2.  Determine the bounding box for each yellow component.\n3.  Identify all non-yellow, non-white pixels strictly *within* that bounding box.\n4.  Verify if these internal pixels exist and all share a single color.\n5.  If the condition is met, calculate the border thickness (count of internal pixels) and color (shared color of internal pixels).\n6.  Draw the border by expanding the bounding box outwards by the calculated thickness, filling the new area with the border color.\n7.  Ensure the original yellow pixels within the bounding box remain yellow in the final output.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains two yellow components.\n    *   Component 1 (Top): Bounding box (rows 2-4, cols 3-5). Contains 1 internal non-yellow/non-white pixel: Green (3) at (3,4).\n    *   Component 2 (Bottom): Bounding box (rows 12-17, cols 11-17). Contains 4 internal non-yellow/non-white pixels: Red (2) at (13,13), (15,16), (16,12), (16,16).\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    *   Component 1: Gets a Green (3) border of thickness 1.\n    *   Component 2: Gets a Red (2) border of thickness 4.\n*   **Analysis:** The internal pixels for each component share a single color (Green for component 1, Red for component 2). The border thickness matches the count of internal pixels for each component.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains two yellow components.\n    *   Component 1 (Top): Bounding box (rows 2-7, cols 2-7). Contains 2 internal non-yellow/non-white pixels: Red (2) at (3,3) and (6,5).\n    *   Component 2 (Bottom): Bounding box (rows 15-20, cols 13-20). Contains 3 internal non-yellow/non-white pixels: Blue (1) at (16,16), (18,14), (19,16).\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    *   Component 1: Gets a Red (2) border of thickness 2.\n    *   Component 2: Gets a Blue (1) border of thickness 3.\n*   **Analysis:** The internal pixels for each component share a single color (Red for component 1, Blue for component 2). The border thickness matches the count of internal pixels for each component.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains two yellow components.\n    *   Component 1 (Top): Bounding box (rows 2-5, cols 6-9). Contains 1 internal non-yellow/non-white pixel: Blue (1) at (3,7).\n    *   Component 2 (Bottom): Bounding box (rows 12-19, cols 8-17). Contains 4 internal non-yellow/non-white pixels: Azure (8) at (13,10), (14,14), (16,11), (18,14).\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    *   Component 1: Gets a Blue (1) border of thickness 1.\n    *   Component 2: Gets an Azure (8) border of thickness 4.\n*   **Analysis:** The internal pixels for each component share a single color (Blue for component 1, Azure for component 2). The border thickness matches the count of internal pixels for each component.\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"

For each component found:\n    a.  Record the set of coordinates `(r, c)` for all yellow pixels belonging to this component.\n    b.  Determine the minimal bounding box `(min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)` that encloses all yellow pixels of this component.\n3.  **Analyze Each Component**: For every identified yellow component and its bounding box:\n    a.  **Find Internal Pixels**: Search within the component's bounding box `(min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)` in the *input* grid. Identify all pixels whose color is *not* yellow (4) and *not* white (0). Record the color and coordinates of each such internal pixel found.\n    b.  **Check Border Conditions**: Examine the list of internal pixels found for the component:\n        i.  If no internal pixels were found, this component does not get a border. Proceed to the next component.\n        ii. If internal pixels *were* found, check if they *all* share the exact same color.\n        iii.If they do not all share the same color, this component does not get a border. Proceed to the next component.\n    c.  **Qualify for Border**: If internal pixels exist and they all share the same single color (let's call this the `inner_color`), then this component qualifies for a border.\n        i.  **Calculate Thickness**: The border thickness (`T`) is equal to the total *number* of internal pixels found for this component.\n        ii. **Store Information**: Keep track of the component's original yellow pixel coordinates, its bounding box, the calculated `inner_color`, and the calculated thickness `T`.\n4.  **Draw Borders**: After analyzing all yellow components, iterate through the list of *qualifying* components:\n    a.  For each qualifying component, retrieve its bounding box `(min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)`, `inner_color`, and thickness `T`.\n    b.  **Calculate Expanded Box**: Determine the coordinates of an expanded bounding box by extending the original bounding box outwards by `T` pixels in all four directions (up, down, left, right). Ensure these coordinates stay within the grid boundaries (clamp at 0 and grid dimension minus 1). Let the expanded box be `(exp_min_r, exp_min_c, exp_max_r, exp_max_c)`.\n    c.  **Fill Border Area**: Iterate through all coordinates `(r, c)` within the *expanded* bounding box. If a coordinate `(r, c)` falls *outside* the *original* bounding box (`r < min_r` or `r > max_r` or `c < min_c` or `c > max_c`), set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to the `inner_color`.\n5.  **Preserve Original Yellow**: After drawing all borders, iterate through the list of *qualifying* components again:\n    a.  For each qualifying component, retrieve the set of its original yellow pixel coordinates.\n    b.  For every coordinate `(r, c)` in this set, set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid back to yellow (4). This ensures the original yellow shape is preserved and corrects any pixels that might have been overwritten by a border.\n6.  **Final Output**: Return the modified output grid."
