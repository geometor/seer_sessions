task_elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    scope: entire_grid
  - element: primary_object
    shape: rectangle
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - bounding_box: defines extent
      - contains: internal_pixels
  - element: internal_pixels
    location: strictly inside the bounding_box of a primary_object
    color: non-white (0), non-yellow (4)
    constraint: all internal_pixels within a single primary_object must share the same color (inner_color)
    properties:
      - count: N
      - color: inner_color
  - element: output_object
    derivation: transformation of a primary_object
    components:
      - core:
          shape: same as primary_object rectangle
          color: yellow (4) (original internal_pixels are changed to yellow)
      - border:
          location: surrounding the core
          shape: rectangular frame
          color: inner_color (from the corresponding primary_object)
          thickness: T (number of pixels extending outwards)
          relationship: T = N (count of internal_pixels) # Acknowledging the single anomaly in train_1.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: primary_object (yellow rectangles)
    sub_actions:
      - find_bounding_box
      - find_internal_pixels
      - verify_single_inner_color
      - count_internal_pixels (N)
      - determine_inner_color
  - action: transform_object
    input: primary_object, N, inner_color
    output: output_object
    steps:
      - create_core: copy primary_object shape, fill with yellow (4)
      - determine_border_thickness: T = N
      - draw_border: create frame of thickness T around the core using inner_color

grid_properties:
  - size: variable (up to 30x30)
  - colors: standard ARC color map
