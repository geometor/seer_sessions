This ensures internal pixels are not directly overwritten by their *own* object's border drawing process. They could only be overwritten by the border of a *different* object if the borders overlap.\n\nConclusion: The single necessary change is in Pass 2, to stop overwriting the internal pixels with yellow.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies the core components of the transformation: yellow rectangles and the \"internal\" non-background, non-yellow pixels within their bounding boxes. It correctly uses the count of these internal pixels (if they all share the same color) to determine the thickness of a border and the color of the internal pixels for the border color.\n\nThe errors observed in all three examples stem from a single issue in the implementation: during the final step where the original yellow rectangle area is processed, the code incorrectly overwrites the identified \"internal\" pixels with yellow. The expected output clearly shows that these internal pixels should retain their original color within the final yellow shape.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the part of the code responsible for filling the yellow rectangle area in the output grid. Instead of setting both original yellow pixels and original internal pixels to yellow, it should *only* set the originally yellow pixels to yellow, leaving the internal pixels with their original color (unless they were already overwritten by a border drawn in the previous step, which appears correct based on the examples).\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution analysis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n-   **Object 1:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 2,3 to 4,5). Internal: 1 green pixel (3) at (3,4). Rule: Border color green(3), thickness 1.\n-   **Object 2:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 12,11 to 17,17). Internal: 3 red pixels (2) at (13,13), (15,16), (16,12). Rule: Border color red(2), thickness 3.\n-   **Error:** Code incorrectly changes the green pixel at (3,4) and the three red pixels at (13,13), (15,16), (16,12) to yellow in the output. Expected output retains these pixels' original colors. (4 pixels off).\n\n**Example 2:**\n-   **Object 1:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 2,2 to 7,7). Internal: 2 red pixels (2) at (3,3), (6,5). Rule: Border color red(2), thickness 2.\n-   **Object 2:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 15,13 to 20,20). Internal: 3 blue pixels (1) at (16,16), (18,14), (19,16). Rule: Border color blue(1), thickness 3.\n-   **Error:** Code incorrectly changes the two red pixels and the three blue pixels to yellow. Expected output retains original colors. (5 pixels off).\n\n**Example 3:**\n-   **Object 1:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 2,6 to 5,9). Internal: 1 blue pixel (1) at (3,7). Rule: Border color blue(1), thickness 1.\n-   **Object 2:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 12,8 to 19,17). Internal: 4 azure pixels (8) at (13,10), (14,14), (16,11), (18,14). Rule: Border color azure(8), thickness 4.\n-   **Error:** Code incorrectly changes the one blue pixel and the four azure pixels to yellow. Expected output retains original colors. (5 pixels off).\n\n## YAML Fact Sheet\n\n"
