Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct rectangular blocks composed of yellow (4) pixels.
2. For each yellow rectangle:
    a. Find all pixels strictly inside its bounding box that are neither yellow (4) nor white (0). These are the "internal pixels".
    b. If internal pixels exist and all share the same color (the "inner color"):
        i. Count the number of internal pixels (N).
        ii. The border thickness (T) is equal to N.
        iii. In the output grid, draw a solid border of the inner color with thickness T around the original yellow rectangle's bounding box.
        iv. Fill the area corresponding to the original yellow rectangle with yellow (4), ensuring any original internal pixels are changed to yellow.
3. Rectangles without valid internal pixels (none found, or multiple colors) remain unchanged except for being potentially overwritten by borders of other rectangles.
4. The background remains white (0) unless overwritten by a border.
