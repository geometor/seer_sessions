For each yellow rectangle:\n    a. Find all pixels strictly inside its bounding box that are neither yellow (4) nor white (0). These are the \"internal pixels\".\n    b. If internal pixels exist and all share the same color (the \"inner color\"):\n        i. Count the number of internal pixels (N).\n        ii. The border thickness (T) is equal to N.\n        iii. In the output grid, draw a solid border of the inner color with thickness T around the original yellow rectangle's bounding box.\n        iv. Fill the area corresponding to the original yellow rectangle with yellow (4), ensuring any original internal pixels are changed to yellow.\n3. Rectangles without valid internal pixels (none found, or multiple colors) remain unchanged except for being potentially overwritten by borders of other rectangles.\n4. The background remains white (0) unless overwritten by a border.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all connected components of a given color.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    components = []\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                component_coords = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                component_coords.add((r, c))\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    # Check 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            component_coords.add((nr, nc))\n                if component_coords:\n                    components.append(component_coords)\n    return components\n\ndef get_bounding_box(coords):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the bounding box of a set of coordinates.\"\"\"\n    if not coords:\n        return None\n    rows = [r for r, c in coords]\n    cols = [c for r, c in coords]\n    return min(rows), min(cols), max(rows), max(cols)\n\ndef find_internal_pixels(grid, bbox):\n    \"\"\"Finds pixels inside the bbox that are not yellow (4) or white (0).\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\n    internal_pixels = []\n    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n            color = grid[r, c]\n            if color != 4 and color != 0:\n                internal_pixels.append({'coord': (r, c), 'color': color})\n    return internal_pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int) # Start with a copy\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Find all yellow components (potential rectangles)\n    yellow_components = find_connected_components(input_grid_np, 4)\n\n    objects_to_process = []\n\n    # Analyze each yellow component\n    for coords in yellow_components:\n        bbox = get_bounding_box(coords)\n        if bbox is None:\n            continue\n            \n        # Check if it's a solid rectangle (optional, assumes input guarantees rectangles)\n        # min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\n        # is_solid_rect = True\n        # for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        #     for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n        #         if input_grid_np[r,c] != 4 and (r,c) not in internal_pixels_coords: # needs refinement if checking\n        #             is_solid_rect = False\n        #             break\n        #     if not is_solid_rect:\n        #         break\n        # if not is_solid_rect:\n        #      continue # Skip non-rectangular yellow shapes\n\n        # Find internal pixels within this bounding box\n        internal_pixels = find_internal_pixels(input_grid_np, bbox)\n\n        if not internal_pixels:\n            continue # No internal pixels, skip border drawing\n\n        # Check if all internal pixels have the same color\n        first_inner_color = internal_pixels[0]['color']\n        all_same_color = all(p['color'] == first_inner_color for p in internal_pixels)\n\n        if all_same_color:\n            inner_color = first_inner_color\n            count_n = len(internal_pixels)\n            thickness_t = count_n\n            objects_to_process.append({\n                'bbox': bbox,\n                'inner_color': inner_color,\n                'thickness': thickness_t,\n                'internal_coords': {p['coord'] for p in internal_pixels}\n            })\n\n    # Process the objects: draw borders first, then fill interiors\n    # This order helps handle overlaps correctly if borders are drawn first.\n    \n    # Create a temporary grid to draw borders without modifying the original yellow\n    # or internal pixels yet, which are needed for the fill step.\n    # Alternatively, modify output_grid directly in two passes.
