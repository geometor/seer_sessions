Transformation Rule:
1. Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify all distinct, contiguous, rectangular blocks composed solely of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
3. For each identified yellow rectangle:
    a. Determine its bounding box.
    b. Find all pixels strictly inside this bounding box in the input grid that are *not* yellow (4) and *not* white (0). These are the "internal pixels".
    c. Check if any internal pixels were found.
    d. If internal pixels exist, check if they *all* share the same single color (the "inner color").
    e. If internal pixels exist and all share the same inner color:
        i. Count the number of internal pixels (N). This count determines the "border thickness" (T = N).
        ii. Calculate the coordinates of an expanded bounding box by extending the original bounding box outwards by the border thickness T in all four directions (up, down, left, right), ensuring the coordinates stay within the grid limits.
        iii. In the output grid, fill all pixels that are within the *expanded* bounding box but *outside* the *original* bounding box with the inner color.
        iv. In the output grid, ensure all pixels within the *original* bounding box that were yellow (4) in the *input* grid are set to yellow (4). (This preserves the original internal pixels unless they were overwritten by the border drawing in step iii).
4. Yellow rectangles that do not have internal pixels, or whose internal pixels have multiple different colors, are not explicitly processed for border drawing, but their yellow pixels are implicitly retained via the initial copy and potentially modified by step 3.e.iv if they were part of a qualified object, or overwritten if they fall within the border area of another processed rectangle.
5. Return the modified output grid.
