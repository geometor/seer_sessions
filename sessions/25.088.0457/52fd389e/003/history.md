Transformation Rule:
1. Identify all distinct rectangular blocks composed of yellow (4) pixels.
2. For each yellow rectangle:
    a. Find all pixels strictly inside its bounding box that are neither yellow (4) nor white (0). These are the "internal pixels".
    b. If internal pixels exist and all share the same color (the "inner color"):
        i. Count the number of internal pixels (N).
        ii. The border thickness (T) is equal to N.
        iii. In the output grid, draw a solid border of the inner color with thickness T around the original yellow rectangle's bounding box.
        iv. Fill the area corresponding to the original yellow rectangle with yellow (4), ensuring any original internal pixels are changed to yellow.
3. Rectangles without valid internal pixels (none found, or multiple colors) remain unchanged except for being potentially overwritten by borders of other rectangles.
4. The background remains white (0) unless overwritten by a border.

Okay, the code execution confirms the analysis:
- The identification of yellow components, their bounding boxes, the internal pixels (coordinates, color, count), and the resulting border color and thickness derived by the code match what's needed for the expected outputs.
- The *only* discrepancy lies in the final state of the pixels that were *originally* the "internal pixels". The code changes them to yellow, while the expected output preserves their original color.

This requires a modification to the second pass of the `transform` function. Instead of filling the entire bounding box area with yellow, it should only change the pixels that were *originally* yellow (color 4) to yellow in the output. The internal pixels (which were identified in the first pass) should retain their original colors.

**Refined Logic for Pass 2:**

Instead of:

```python
    # Pass 2: Fill the original rectangle areas with yellow, overwriting internal colors
    for obj in objects_to_process:
        min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = obj['bbox']
        internal_coords = obj['internal_coords']

        for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
            for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
                 # Check if the coordinate corresponds to an original yellow pixel or an internal pixel
                 original_color = input_grid_np[r,c]
                 if original_color == 4 or (r,c) in internal_coords:
                     output_grid_np[r, c] = 4 # Set to yellow
```

It should be something like:

```python
    # Pass 2: Ensure original yellow pixels within the bbox are yellow in the output,
    # and preserve the original internal pixels colors if they haven't been overwritten by borders.
    for obj in objects_to_process:
        min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = obj['bbox']
        internal_coords = obj['internal_coords']

        for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
            for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
                 # Check if the current coordinate is within the original bounding box
                 coord = (r, c)
                 original_color = input_grid_np[r, c]

                 # If the pixel was originally yellow, ensure it's yellow in the output
                 if original_color == 4:
                     output_grid_np[r, c] = 4
                 # If the pixel was one of the designated 'internal' pixels for this object,
                 # ensure it retains its original color in the output, *unless* it was already
                 # overwritten by a border in Pass 1.
                 # The current state `output_grid_np[r, c]` reflects Pass 1 changes.
                 # If `output_grid_np[r, c]` is still the same as `original_color`, it wasn't
                 # overwritten by a border. We only need to explicitly handle the case where
                 # the border drawing (Pass 1) might have overwritten an internal pixel, which
                 # shouldn't happen given the border is drawn *outside* the original bbox.
                 # A simpler logic: If it was originally yellow, set to yellow. If it was an internal pixel,
                 # leave it as whatever color it currently is (either original or overwritten by border).
                 # We only need to explicitly set the yellow pixels.
                 # The initial copy `output_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)` handles preserving
                 # internal colors initially. Pass 1 draws borders. Pass 2 just needs to ensure the
                 # original yellow area becomes yellow.

                 # Revised Pass 2 Logic:
                 # Only touch pixels that were originally yellow within the bbox.
                 if original_color == 4:
                     output_grid_np[r, c] = 4
```

Let's re-think the interaction.
1.  `output_grid = copy(input_grid)`
2.  Find yellow rect `R` with bbox `B`. Find internal pixels `I` (all same color `C`, count `N`). Thickness `T=N`.
3.  Draw border: For pixels `P` where `P` is within `T` distance of `B` but *outside* `B`, set `output_grid[P] = C`.
4.  Fill yellow: For pixels `P` where `P` is within `B` and `input_grid[P] == yellow`, set `output_grid[P] = yellow`.

The previous `Pass 2` incorrectly set `output_grid[P] = yellow` if `P` was in `I`. The new logic avoids this. The internal pixels `I` will only change color if they are overwritten by a border from *another* object (which seems unlikely given the problem structure, but possible in theory) or if they were already the border color (in which case they stay that color).

The original code's Pass 2 logic:

```python
                 # Check if the coordinate corresponds to an original yellow pixel or an internal pixel
                 original_color = input_grid_np[r,c]
                 if original_color == 4 or (r,c) in internal_coords:
                     output_grid_np[r, c] = 4 # Set to yellow
```

This explicitly sets internal pixels to yellow.

The fix should be:

```python
                 # Check if the coordinate corresponds to an original yellow pixel
                 original_color = input_grid_np[r,c]
                 if original_color == 4:
                     output_grid_np[r, c] = 4 # Set ONLY original yellow pixels to yellow
```

This preserves the internal colors unless overwritten by a border.

Final check on the border drawing logic:

```python
        # Draw the border
        for r in range(exp_min_r, exp_max_r + 1):
            for c in range(exp_min_c, exp_max_c + 1):
                # Check if the pixel is outside the original bounding box
                is_outside = (r < min_r or r > max_r or c < min_c or c > max_c)
                if is_outside:
                     output_grid_np[r, c] = inner_color
```

This correctly draws the border *only* in the expanded area outside the original bounding box. This ensures internal pixels are not directly overwritten by their *own* object's border drawing process. They could only be overwritten by the border of a *different* object if the borders overlap.

Conclusion: The single necessary change is in Pass 2, to stop overwriting the internal pixels with yellow.## General Assessment

The provided code successfully identifies the core components of the transformation: yellow rectangles and the "internal" non-background, non-yellow pixels within their bounding boxes. It correctly uses the count of these internal pixels (if they all share the same color) to determine the thickness of a border and the color of the internal pixels for the border color.

The errors observed in all three examples stem from a single issue in the implementation: during the final step where the original yellow rectangle area is processed, the code incorrectly overwrites the identified "internal" pixels with yellow. The expected output clearly shows that these internal pixels should retain their original color within the final yellow shape.

The strategy is to modify the part of the code responsible for filling the yellow rectangle area in the output grid. Instead of setting both original yellow pixels and original internal pixels to yellow, it should *only* set the originally yellow pixels to yellow, leaving the internal pixels with their original color (unless they were already overwritten by a border drawn in the previous step, which appears correct based on the examples).

## Metrics

Based on the code execution analysis:

**Example 1:**
-   **Object 1:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 2,3 to 4,5). Internal: 1 green pixel (3) at (3,4). Rule: Border color green(3), thickness 1.
-   **Object 2:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 12,11 to 17,17). Internal: 3 red pixels (2) at (13,13), (15,16), (16,12). Rule: Border color red(2), thickness 3.
-   **Error:** Code incorrectly changes the green pixel at (3,4) and the three red pixels at (13,13), (15,16), (16,12) to yellow in the output. Expected output retains these pixels' original colors. (4 pixels off).

**Example 2:**
-   **Object 1:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 2,2 to 7,7). Internal: 2 red pixels (2) at (3,3), (6,5). Rule: Border color red(2), thickness 2.
-   **Object 2:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 15,13 to 20,20). Internal: 3 blue pixels (1) at (16,16), (18,14), (19,16). Rule: Border color blue(1), thickness 3.
-   **Error:** Code incorrectly changes the two red pixels and the three blue pixels to yellow. Expected output retains original colors. (5 pixels off).

**Example 3:**
-   **Object 1:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 2,6 to 5,9). Internal: 1 blue pixel (1) at (3,7). Rule: Border color blue(1), thickness 1.
-   **Object 2:** Yellow rectangle (bbox: 12,8 to 19,17). Internal: 4 azure pixels (8) at (13,10), (14,14), (16,11), (18,14). Rule: Border color azure(8), thickness 4.
-   **Error:** Code incorrectly changes the one blue pixel and the four azure pixels to yellow. Expected output retains original colors. (5 pixels off).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous, rectangular blocks composed solely of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified yellow rectangle:
    a.  Determine its bounding box.
    b.  Find all pixels strictly inside this bounding box in the input grid that are *not* yellow (4) and *not* white (0). These are the "internal pixels".
    c.  Check if any internal pixels were found.
    d.  If internal pixels exist, check if they *all* share the same single color (the "inner color").
    e.  If internal pixels exist and all share the same inner color:
        i.  Count the number of internal pixels (N). This count determines the "border thickness" (T = N).
        ii. Calculate the coordinates of an expanded bounding box by extending the original bounding box outwards by the border thickness T in all four directions (up, down, left, right), ensuring the coordinates stay within the grid limits.
        iii. In the output grid, fill all pixels that are within the *expanded* bounding box but *outside* the *original* bounding box with the inner color.
        iv. In the output grid, ensure all pixels within the *original* bounding box that were yellow (4) in the *input* grid are set to yellow (4). (This preserves the original internal pixels unless they were overwritten by the border drawing in step iii).
4.  Yellow rectangles that do not have internal pixels, or whose internal pixels have multiple different colors, are not explicitly processed for border drawing, but their yellow pixels are implicitly retained via the initial copy and potentially modified by step 3.e.iv if they were part of a qualified object, or overwritten if they fall within the border area of another processed rectangle.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
