task_description: Fill regions adjacent to specific shapes based on connectivity to single pixels.

elements:
  - type: grid
    background_color: 0 # white
  - type: object
    role: boundary_shape
    description: Connected components, typically L-shaped or U-shaped (or rotations/reflections), made of a single non-white color. Act as boundaries for the fill operation.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., green, magenta, yellow, blue)
      - shape: L-like, U-like, connected component
  - type: object
    role: seed_pixel
    description: Isolated single pixels of a non-white color. Determine the fill color and act as starting points for connectivity checks.
    properties:
      - color: non-white (e.g., yellow, azure, red, magenta)
      - shape: single pixel
  - type: path
    description: A sequence of adjacent white (0) pixels connecting a boundary_shape and a seed_pixel.
    properties:
      - connectivity: 8-way (includes diagonals)
      - medium: white pixels only

actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Locate all distinct boundary_shapes and seed_pixels in the input grid.
  - name: check_connectivity
    description: For each pair of (boundary_shape, seed_pixel), determine if a path of white pixels exists between them.
  - name: identify_fill_area
    description: If connectivity exists, find the set of white pixels that are adjacent to the boundary_shape and reachable from the seed_pixel via a path of only white pixels.
  - name: fill_area
    description: Change the color of the pixels in the identified fill_area to the color of the connected seed_pixel.

relationships:
  - type: connectivity
    from: seed_pixel
    to: boundary_shape
    condition: Existence of a path through white pixels between them.
  - type: determines_fill_color
    from: seed_pixel
    to: fill_area
    condition: The color of the seed_pixel dictates the color used to fill the area.
  - type: defines_boundary
    from: boundary_shape
    to: fill_area
    condition: The boundary_shape borders the area to be filled.
  - type: determines_fill_location
    from: seed_pixel
    via: connectivity
    to: boundary_shape
    condition: The connected pair determines which adjacent white pixels near the boundary_shape get filled.
