            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe input grids contain several distinct objects on a white background (color 0). These objects generally fall into two categories:\n1.  **Shapes:** These are connected components of pixels, often resembling 'L' shapes, 'U' shapes, or variations (like rotated or reflected versions). They consist of a single color (e.g., green, magenta, yellow, blue).\n2.  **Single Pixels:** These are isolated pixels of a specific color (e.g., yellow, azure, red, magenta).\n\nThe output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but with specific areas filled in. The filled areas are always adjacent to one of the 'Shapes' and the color used for filling corresponds to the color of one of the 'Single Pixels'.\n\nIt appears there's a relationship between a specific Shape and a specific Single Pixel. If they can be \"connected\" through a path of white background pixels, an area \"inside\" or adjacent to the Shape gets filled with the color of the Single Pixel. The area to be filled seems to be the white region that is both adjacent to the Shape and reachable from the Single Pixel without crossing any other colored object.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through every possible pair consisting of one Boundary Shape (S) and one Seed Pixel (P).\n5.  For each pair (S, P), perform a reachability check: Determine if there exists at least one path connecting the pixel P to *any* pixel belonging to shape S, where the path consists *exclusively* of white (0) pixels. Use 8-way adjacency (including diagonals) for path finding.\n6.  If such a white path exists between S and P:\n    a.  Identify all white pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (8-way) to *any* pixel belonging to the Boundary Shape S. Let this set be `Adjacent_Whites`.\n    b.  Perform a flood fill or reachability search starting from the Seed Pixel P, allowed to move only through white pixels (0).\n    c.  Find the subset of `Adjacent_Whites` that are reachable from P in the search performed in step 6b. Let this subset be `Fill_Pixels`.\n    d.  For each pixel coordinate corresponding to a pixel in `Fill_Pixels`, update the color of that pixel in the *output grid* to the color of the Seed Pixel P.\n7.  After checking all pairs (S, P), return the final output grid."
