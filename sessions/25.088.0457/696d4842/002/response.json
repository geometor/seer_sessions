            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying \"seeds\" (single pixels) and \"shapes\" (multi-pixel objects) and then coloring white areas based on connectivity. However, the results show that the code fails on all training examples, producing outputs that differ significantly from the expected ones. The primary issue seems to be the logic for determining *which* white pixels get colored and *with which* seed's color.\n\nThe original code colors *all* white pixels that are reachable via a white path from a seed *and* are adjacent to *any* shape reachable from that seed. This approach over-colors the grid and doesn't correctly associate specific seeds with specific shapes.\n\nAnalysis of the input-output pairs suggests a more refined logic:\n1.  **Shape-Seed Association:** Each shape seems to be associated with the *closest* seed, where distance is measured by the shortest path through adjacent white pixels (8-way connectivity).\n2.  **Targeted Coloring:** Once a shape is associated with its closest seed, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) originates from that seed, moving only through white pixels. The pixels that get colored are those white pixels visited during this BFS *that are also adjacent* (8-way) to the associated shape.\n\nThis refined hypothesis successfully explains the transformations in all three training examples. The previous code failed because it lacked the \"closest seed\" association mechanism and potentially colored pixels based on reachability from any seed, not just the closest one.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on visual analysis and the refined hypothesis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Seeds: Azure (8) at (10, 6), Yellow (4) at (5, 10)\n    *   Shapes: Green (3) L-shape, Magenta (6) L-shape\n    *   Background: White (0)\n*   **Closest Seed Association:**\n    *   Green Shape is closest to Azure Seed (distance ~1).\n    *   Magenta Shape is closest to Yellow Seed (distance ~5).\n*   **Output Changes:**\n    *   White pixels adjacent to the Green shape that are reachable via white space from the Azure seed are colored Azure (8).\n    *   White pixels adjacent to the Magenta shape that are reachable via white space from the Yellow seed are colored Yellow (4).\n*   **Code Failure:** The code likely failed by not implementing the \"closest seed\" rule, perhaps coloring areas around the Green shape with Yellow (4) or vice-versa, or coloring *all* reachable adjacent white pixels instead of just those connected to the *closest* seed. The Transformed Output shows excessive Azure (8) coloring, indicating the BFS from the Azure seed colored white pixels adjacent to *both* shapes or spread too far.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Seeds: Red (2) at (14, 18), Magenta (6) at (22, 3)\n    *   Shapes: Yellow (4) L-shape, Blue (1) C-shape\n    *   Background: White (0)\n*   **Closest Seed Association:**\n    *   Yellow Shape is closest to Red Seed (distance ~7).\n    *   Blue Shape is closest to Magenta Seed (distance ~6).\n*   **Output Changes:**\n    *   White pixels adjacent to the Yellow shape reachable from the Red seed are colored Red (2).\n    *   White pixels adjacent to the Blue shape reachable from the Magenta seed are colored Magenta (6).\n*   **Code Failure:** Similar to Example 1, the code likely misapplied the coloring rule, resulting in incorrect colors and excessive filling. The Transformed Output shows Magenta (6) coloring around the Yellow shape, which contradicts the \"closest seed\" rule.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Seeds: Magenta (6) at (0, 8), Azure (8) at (16, 18)\n    *   Shapes: Yellow (4) complex shape, Green (3) complex shape\n    *   Background: White (0)\n*   **Closest Seed Association:**\n    *   Yellow Shape is closest to Magenta Seed.\n    *   Green Shape is closest to Azure Seed (distance ~7).\n*   **Output Changes:**\n    *   White pixels adjacent to the Yellow shape reachable from the Magenta seed are colored Magenta (6).\n    *   White pixels adjacent to the Green shape reachable from the Azure seed are colored Azure (8).\n*   **Code Failure:** Again, the code failed to correctly associate seeds with shapes and apply the coloring rule precisely, leading to widespread incorrect coloring (mostly Azure (8) in the transformed output).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
