"""
Identifies seeds (single non-white pixels) and shapes (connected components > 1 pixel of the same non-white color, 4-way connected).
For each shape, determines the closest seed based on the shortest path distance through adjacent (8-way) white pixels.
For each shape and its assigned closest seed, performs a BFS starting from the seed through adjacent (8-way) white pixels.
Colors all visited white pixels from this BFS that are also adjacent (8-way) to the associated shape with the color of the seed.

Okay, the distance calculation confirms the Green shape is closest to the Azure seed (distance 0, they are adjacent via (10,6) and (9,6)). However, the Magenta shape is closest to the Azure seed (distance 3) not the Yellow seed (distance 4) according to the BFS path distance through white pixels.

This contradicts the expected output where Magenta is colored Yellow. What could be wrong?

1.  **Distance Metric:** Maybe it's not path distance through white. What about Manhattan or Chebyshev distance directly?
    *   Green points: e.g., (9,6). Magenta points: e.g., (10,10), (15,9). Seeds: Azure (10,6), Yellow (5,10).
    *   Dist(Green(9,6), Azure(10,6)) = M:1, C:1
    *   Dist(Green(4,6), Azure(10,6)) = M:6, C:6
    *   Dist(Green(9,6), Yellow(5,10)) = M:8, C:4
    *   Dist(Green(4,2), Yellow(5,10)) = M:9, C:8
    *   Dist(Magenta(10,10), Azure(10,6)) = M:4, C:4
    *   Dist(Magenta(15,9), Azure(10,6)) = M:8, C:5
    *   Dist(Magenta(10,10), Yellow(5,10)) = M:5, C:5
    *   Dist(Magenta(15,9), Yellow(5,10)) = M:11, C:10

    If we take the minimum distance between *any* point of the shape and the seed:
    *   MinDist(Green, Azure): 1 (Chebyshev) or 1 (Manhattan) - e.g. (9,6) to (10,6)
    *   MinDist(Green, Yellow): 4 (Chebyshev) or 8 (Manhattan) - e.g. (9,6) to (5,10)
    *   MinDist(Magenta, Azure): 4 (Chebyshev) or 4 (Manhattan) - e.g. (10,10) to (10,6)
    *   MinDist(Magenta, Yellow): 5 (Chebyshev) or 5 (Manhattan) - e.g. (10,10) to (5,10)

    Using simple geometric distance (Manhattan or Chebyshev), Green is closest to Azure, and Magenta is closest to Azure. Still doesn't explain the output.

2.  **Assignment Rule:** Maybe it's not strictly closest? Could there be a 1:1 assignment constraint? If Green takes Azure (the closest), maybe Magenta must take the *next* available seed, which is Yellow? This seems plausible.

3.  **Coloring Rule:** The previous code colored *all* adjacent white pixels reachable via BFS from the seed. Let's re-examine the expected output for Example 1.
    *   Green shape assigned Azure(8). Output colors (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) with Azure(8). These are adjacent to the green shape. Are they reachable from Azure seed (10,6) via white path? Yes. Are *only* these colored? No, the code's output colored many more pixels. Why only these specific ones?
        *   (4,2) is adjacent to Green(4,3).
        *   (4,3) is adjacent to Green(4,3), Green(4,4).
        *   (4,4) is adjacent to Green(4,4), Green(4,5).
        *   These colored pixels form a line segment. Is it related to the closest point on the shape? Closest point on Green to Azure(10,6) is (9,6). Closest point on Green to Yellow(5,10) is maybe (4,6)? The colored pixels (4,2-4) are near the top-left part of the green shape. The Azure seed is below it. This doesn't immediately make sense.
    *   Magenta shape assigned Yellow(4). Output colors (15,4), (15,5), (15,6), (15,7), (15,8) with Yellow(4). These are adjacent to the magenta shape (specifically, the vertical part at col 10 and the horizontal part at row 15). The Yellow seed is at (5,10). The colored pixels are along the bottom horizontal part of the Magenta shape. Closest point on Magenta to Yellow(5,10) is (10,10) or (15,10)? The colored pixels are along the bottom leg (15,4) to (15,8). The seed (5,10) is far away.

Let's rethink the coloring mechanism. Could it be filling *towards* the seed?
*   For Green (assigned Azure seed at 10,6): Color adjacent white pixels. Maybe color only those adjacent white pixels that lie "between" the shape and the seed? Or color pixels adjacent to the shape point *closest* to the seed? Closest Green point to Azure seed (10,6) is (9,6). Pixels adjacent to (9,6): (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (10,5), (10,7). None of these match the output colored pixels (4,2-4). This hypothesis is wrong.
*   What if the coloring isn't based on adjacency to the *whole* shape, but adjacency to a specific *part*?

Let's reconsider the transformed output vs expected output for Example 1.
*   Transformed Output: Colors *vast* areas around the shapes based on the seed assignment (Green->Azure, Magenta->Azure based on distance). It uses the BFS flood fill approach.
*   Expected Output: Colors *very specific, small groups* of pixels adjacent to the shapes. Green -> Azure colors (4,2-4). Magenta -> Yellow colors (15,4-8).

Maybe the rule is:
1.  Identify shapes (connected > 1 pixel, 4-way) and seeds (single pixel).
2.  Assign each shape to the *closest* seed based on some distance (maybe geometric, maybe path-based). Resolve ties/ensure 1:1 assignment (e.g., closest gets priority, next closest takes next available seed?).
3.  For each shape, find the point(s) on the shape `P_shape` that are *closest* to its assigned seed `S`.
4.  Find the white pixel(s) `P_white` that are adjacent (8-way) to `P_shape`.
5.  Color `P_white` with the color of seed `S`.

Let's test this hypothesis on Example 1:
*   Green shape, assigned Azure seed (10,6). Closest point on Green shape to (10,6) is (9,6). White pixels adjacent to (9,6)? (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,5), (9,7), (10,5), (10,7). None of these are white in the input (except maybe 9,5 and 9,7 - check grid). (9,5) is 0, (9,7) is 0. Let's check the expected output: Azure coloring is at (4,2-4). This hypothesis doesn't work either.

What if the coloring is related to the *path*?
*   Find the shortest path (through white) from the assigned seed to the shape.
*   Color the white pixels adjacent to the shape that are "near" the path's endpoint on the shape?

Let's re-examine the *distance* calculation in the previous code. `bfs_shortest_distance` calculates the number of *white steps*.
*   `dist_green_azure = 0` because seed (10,6) is 8-adjacent to shape pixel (9,6).
*   `dist_green_yellow = 3`. Path: (5,10) -> (5,9) [1] -> (5,8) [2] -> (5,7) [3] -> adjacent to shape pixel (4,6) or (5,6). Yes, distance 3 seems right.
*   `dist_magenta_azure = 3`. Path: (10,6) -> (10,7) [1] -> (10,8) [2] -> (10,9) [3] -> adjacent to shape pixel (10,10) or (11,10). Yes, distance 3.
*   `dist_magenta_yellow = 4`. Path: (5,10) -> (6,10) [1] -> (7,10) [2] -> (8,10) [3] -> (9,10) [4] -> adjacent to shape pixel (10,10). Yes, distance 4.

So, based on shortest white path distance:
*   Green -> Azure (Dist 0)
*   Magenta -> Azure (Dist 3)

The expected output requires:
*   Green -> Azure
*   Magenta -> Yellow

Maybe the assignment rule is: Assign based on closest distance, but each seed can only be assigned once. If multiple shapes are closest to the same seed, the shape with the *shortest* distance gets it.
*   Green Dist(Azure)=0, Dist(Yellow)=3. Closest: Azure.
*   Magenta Dist(Azure)=3, Dist(Yellow)=4. Closest: Azure.
*   Green gets Azure (dist 0). Azure is now assigned.
*   Magenta must choose from remaining seeds. Only Yellow is left. So Magenta -> Yellow.

This assignment logic matches the expected output coloring!

Now, let's refine the coloring rule based on this assignment (Green->Azure, Magenta->Yellow).
*   **Green Shape / Azure Seed (10,6):** Expected output colors (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) with Azure(8). These pixels are adjacent to the green shape. Why these specific ones? They form a horizontal line segment of length 3. Is there anything of size 3 associated with the seed or shape interaction? The *distance* was 0 (direct adjacency). The seed itself is size 1. The shape is large.
*   **Magenta Shape / Yellow Seed (5,10):** Expected output colors (15,4), (15,5), (15,6), (15,7), (15,8) with Yellow(4). These pixels are adjacent to the magenta shape. They form a horizontal line segment of length 5. The *distance* was 4. The seed is size 1. The shape is large.

This is still puzzling. Let's look at Example 2.

**Detailed Analysis (Example 2):**

*   **Input:**
    *   Shape 1 (Yellow, vertical + horizontal): (4,6)-(14,6), (14,7)-(14,11). Color 4.
    *   Shape 2 (Blue, C-shape): (22,9)-(22,11), (23,11), (24,11), (25,11)-(25,13). Color 1.
    *   Seed 1 (Red): (14,18). Color 2.
    *   Seed 2 (Magenta): (22,3). Color 6.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   Yellow shape's vertical bar (rows 4-9, col 6) is recolored Red(2). Original pixels: (4,6)-(9,6).
    *   Blue shape remains. White pixels *around* it are colored Magenta(6). Specifically: (22,8), (23,8), (24,8), (25,8) (left); (22,12), (24,12) (right, top/bottom); (23,12) is blue; (21,9)-(21,11) (above C); (26,11)-(26,13) (below C); (23,10) (inside C opening). This looks like a bounding box or dilation.
    *   Let's re-read the expected output carefully.
        *   Original Yellow shape: (4,6)-(14,6) and (14,7)-(14,11).
        *   Output: Pixels (4,6)-(9,6) are now Red(2). Pixels (10,6)-(14,6) and (14,7)-(14,11) are still Yellow(4). Pixels (14,12)-(14,18) seem newly colored Yellow(4).
        *   Original Blue shape: C-shape (color 1).
        *   Output: Pixels (22,8)-(25,8) are Magenta(6). Pixel (22,12) is Magenta(6). Pixel (24,12) is Magenta(6). Pixels (21,9)-(21,11) are Magenta(6). Pixels (26,11)-(26,13) are Magenta(6). The original blue shape seems *gone*, replaced by Magenta coloring around its original location? No, wait, comparing sizes. Input Blue is 3+1+1+3 = 8 pixels. Output shows the original Blue shape (1) still present. The magenta pixels are *added* around it. (22,3) is the Magenta seed. (14,18) is the Red seed.
        *   Output also has Magenta pixels (color 6) at (23,3) and (23,11) and (25,11) and (25,13)? Let me diff the input/output grids.
