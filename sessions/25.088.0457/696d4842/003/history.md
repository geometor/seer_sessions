"""
Identify distinct shapes (connected components > 1 pixel) and seeds (single pixels) in the input grid.
For each seed pixel, perform a search (like BFS) outwards through adjacent white (0) pixels.
Determine which shapes are reachable from the seed via this white-pixel path.
For each reachable shape, identify all white pixels that were visited during the search AND are adjacent (8-way) to that specific shape.
Fill these identified adjacent white pixels with the color of the seed pixel in the output grid.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying "seeds" (single pixels) and "shapes" (multi-pixel objects) and then coloring white areas based on connectivity. However, the results show that the code fails on all training examples, producing outputs that differ significantly from the expected ones. The primary issue seems to be the logic for determining *which* white pixels get colored and *with which* seed's color.

The original code colors *all* white pixels that are reachable via a white path from a seed *and* are adjacent to *any* shape reachable from that seed. This approach over-colors the grid and doesn't correctly associate specific seeds with specific shapes.

Analysis of the input-output pairs suggests a more refined logic:
1.  **Shape-Seed Association:** Each shape seems to be associated with the *closest* seed, where distance is measured by the shortest path through adjacent white pixels (8-way connectivity).
2.  **Targeted Coloring:** Once a shape is associated with its closest seed, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) originates from that seed, moving only through white pixels. The pixels that get colored are those white pixels visited during this BFS *that are also adjacent* (8-way) to the associated shape.

This refined hypothesis successfully explains the transformations in all three training examples. The previous code failed because it lacked the "closest seed" association mechanism and potentially colored pixels based on reachability from any seed, not just the closest one.

## Metrics

Based on visual analysis and the refined hypothesis:

**Example 1:**
*   **Input:**
    *   Seeds: Azure (8) at (10, 6), Yellow (4) at (5, 10)
    *   Shapes: Green (3) L-shape, Magenta (6) L-shape
    *   Background: White (0)
*   **Closest Seed Association:**
    *   Green Shape is closest to Azure Seed (distance ~1).
    *   Magenta Shape is closest to Yellow Seed (distance ~5).
*   **Output Changes:**
    *   White pixels adjacent to the Green shape that are reachable via white space from the Azure seed are colored Azure (8).
    *   White pixels adjacent to the Magenta shape that are reachable via white space from the Yellow seed are colored Yellow (4).
*   **Code Failure:** The code likely failed by not implementing the "closest seed" rule, perhaps coloring areas around the Green shape with Yellow (4) or vice-versa, or coloring *all* reachable adjacent white pixels instead of just those connected to the *closest* seed. The Transformed Output shows excessive Azure (8) coloring, indicating the BFS from the Azure seed colored white pixels adjacent to *both* shapes or spread too far.

**Example 2:**
*   **Input:**
    *   Seeds: Red (2) at (14, 18), Magenta (6) at (22, 3)
    *   Shapes: Yellow (4) L-shape, Blue (1) C-shape
    *   Background: White (0)
*   **Closest Seed Association:**
    *   Yellow Shape is closest to Red Seed (distance ~7).
    *   Blue Shape is closest to Magenta Seed (distance ~6).
*   **Output Changes:**
    *   White pixels adjacent to the Yellow shape reachable from the Red seed are colored Red (2).
    *   White pixels adjacent to the Blue shape reachable from the Magenta seed are colored Magenta (6).
*   **Code Failure:** Similar to Example 1, the code likely misapplied the coloring rule, resulting in incorrect colors and excessive filling. The Transformed Output shows Magenta (6) coloring around the Yellow shape, which contradicts the "closest seed" rule.

**Example 3:**
*   **Input:**
    *   Seeds: Magenta (6) at (0, 8), Azure (8) at (16, 18)
    *   Shapes: Yellow (4) complex shape, Green (3) complex shape
    *   Background: White (0)
*   **Closest Seed Association:**
    *   Yellow Shape is closest to Magenta Seed.
    *   Green Shape is closest to Azure Seed (distance ~7).
*   **Output Changes:**
    *   White pixels adjacent to the Yellow shape reachable from the Magenta seed are colored Magenta (6).
    *   White pixels adjacent to the Green shape reachable from the Azure seed are colored Azure (8).
*   **Code Failure:** Again, the code failed to correctly associate seeds with shapes and apply the coloring rule precisely, leading to widespread incorrect coloring (mostly Azure (8) in the transformed output).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct "shapes" (connected components of the same non-white color with size > 1, using 4-way connectivity) and "seeds" (single non-white pixels). Record the coordinates and color of each seed and the set of coordinates and color for each shape.
2.  **Determine Closest Seed for Each Shape:**
    *   For each shape, calculate the shortest path distance to every seed. A path consists of steps between adjacent (8-way) white pixels only. The distance is the number of white pixels in the path (minimum steps).
    *   Assign each shape to its closest seed based on this distance. If a shape is unreachable from any seed via white pixels, it is not assigned. (Assume no ties in distance for simplicity, or define a tie-breaking rule if necessary, e.g., lowest row/col seed).
3.  **Color Adjacent White Pixels:**
    *   Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    *   For each shape that has been assigned a closest seed:
        *   Let the shape be `H` and the closest seed be `S` with color `C`.
        *   Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the seed `S`. The BFS can only explore adjacent (8-way) white pixels. Keep track of all white pixels visited during this search (`visited_white_pixels`).
        *   Identify all pixels `p` that meet two conditions:
            a.  `p` is in `visited_white_pixels`.
            b.  `p` is adjacent (8-way) to any pixel belonging to the shape `H`.
        *   For every identified pixel `p`, change its color in the output grid to the seed color `C`.
4.  **Output:** The final modified grid is the result.
