**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors (0-9). The grids have the same dimensions in input and output for each example.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4).
3.  **Objects:**
    *   Yellow pixels (4) appear as individual, isolated points in the input.
    *   Blue pixels (1) sometimes form contiguous shapes in the input (e.g., 'L' shapes in `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`, or rectangles in `train_3`). These blue shapes can sometimes contain yellow pixels.
    *   The background is primarily white (0).
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   All yellow pixels from the input are preserved in their original locations in the output.
    *   All blue pixels/shapes from the input are preserved in their original locations in the output.
    *   The key transformation is the addition of *new* blue pixels (1) in the output grid, replacing some of the original white pixels (0).
5.  **Pattern:** The placement of the *new* blue pixels appears to be determined by the relative positions of the yellow pixels. Specifically, for every pair of yellow pixels in the input, the rectangular area (bounding box) defined by these two pixels seems relevant. If a cell within such a bounding box was originally white (0) in the input, it becomes blue (1) in the output. This effect is cumulative across all possible pairs of yellow pixels. Existing yellow or blue pixels within these bounding boxes remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill rectangular areas defined by pairs of yellow pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixels:
    - white (0): Background.
    - blue (1): Can form shapes, sometimes containing yellow pixels.
    - yellow (4): Appear as individual points.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels:
    - white (0): Background, potentially reduced compared to input.
    - blue (1): Includes original blue pixels plus newly added blue pixels.
    - yellow (4): Preserved from input.

Transformation_Elements:
  - Objects:
    - yellow_pixels: Source points defining rectangular regions. Coordinates are critical.
    - white_pixels: Target pixels within defined regions that change color.
    - blue_pixels: Original blue pixels are preserved. New blue pixels are created.
  - Relationships:
    - Pairs: Every distinct pair of yellow pixels defines a bounding box.
    - Containment: White pixels located within any of these bounding boxes are affected.
  - Actions:
    - Identify: Locate all yellow pixels in the input grid.
    - Pairwise_Combination: Consider every possible pair of identified yellow pixels.
    - Define_Region: For each pair, determine the minimum bounding rectangle enclosing them.
    - Conditional_Fill: Iterate through all cells within each bounding rectangle. If an input cell is white (0), change the corresponding output cell to blue (1).
    - Preserve: Ensure original yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels remain unchanged in the output.

Output_Rule: The output grid is the input grid modified by changing specific white pixels to blue pixels. A white pixel at (row, col) is changed to blue if and only if it falls within the bounding box defined by at least one pair of yellow pixels from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels with the color yellow (4) in the input grid. Store these coordinates in a list.
3.  Iterate through all unique pairs of coordinates `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` from the list of yellow pixel locations.
4.  For each pair:
    a.  Determine the minimum row (`min_r = min(r1, r2)`), maximum row (`max_r = max(r1, r2)`), minimum column (`min_c = min(c1, c2)`), and maximum column (`max_c = max(c1, c2)`). This defines a bounding box.
    b.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` within this bounding box (where `min_r <= r <= max_r` and `min_c <= c <= max_c`).
    c.  Check the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *original input grid*.
    d.  If the color in the input grid at `(r, c)` is white (0), change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to blue (1). (If it's already non-white in the output due to a previous pair, it remains unchanged by this step, though the rule implies it would become blue anyway if it wasn't already).
5.  After checking all pairs and filling the corresponding regions, the resulting output grid is the final result.
