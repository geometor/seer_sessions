The grids have the same dimensions in input and output for each example.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4).\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   Yellow pixels (4) appear as individual, isolated points in the input.\n    *   Blue pixels (1) sometimes form contiguous shapes in the input (e.g., 'L' shapes in `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`, or rectangles in `train_3`). These blue shapes can sometimes contain yellow pixels.\n    *   The background is primarily white (0).\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   All yellow pixels from the input are preserved in their original locations in the output.\n    *   All blue pixels/shapes from the input are preserved in their original locations in the output.\n    *   The key transformation is the addition of *new* blue pixels (1) in the output grid, replacing some of the original white pixels (0).\n5.  **Pattern:** The placement of the *new* blue pixels appears to be determined by the relative positions of the yellow pixels. Specifically, for every pair of yellow pixels in the input, the rectangular area (bounding box) defined by these two pixels seems relevant. If a cell within such a bounding box was originally white (0) in the input, it becomes blue (1) in the output. This effect is cumulative across all possible pairs of yellow pixels. Existing yellow or blue pixels within these bounding boxes remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Coordinates are critical.\n    - white_pixels: Target pixels within defined regions that change color.\n    - blue_pixels: Original blue pixels are preserved. New blue pixels are created.\n  - Relationships:\n    - Pairs: Every distinct pair of yellow pixels defines a bounding box.\n    - Containment: White pixels located within any of these bounding boxes are affected.\n  - Actions:\n    - Identify: Locate all yellow pixels in the input grid.\n    - Pairwise_Combination: Consider every possible pair of identified yellow pixels.\n    - Define_Region: For each pair, determine the minimum bounding rectangle enclosing them.\n    - Conditional_Fill: Iterate through all cells within each bounding rectangle. If an input cell is white (0), change the corresponding output cell to blue (1).\n    - Preserve: Ensure original yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels remain unchanged in the output.\n\nOutput_Rule: The output grid is the input grid modified by changing specific white pixels to blue pixels.
