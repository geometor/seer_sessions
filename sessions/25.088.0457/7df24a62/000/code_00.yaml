Task: Fill rectangular areas defined by pairs of yellow pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Pixels:
    - white (0): Background.
    - blue (1): Can form shapes, sometimes containing yellow pixels.
    - yellow (4): Appear as individual points.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Pixels:
    - white (0): Background, potentially reduced compared to input.
    - blue (1): Includes original blue pixels plus newly added blue pixels.
    - yellow (4): Preserved from input.

Transformation_Elements:
  - Objects:
    - yellow_pixels: Source points defining rectangular regions. Coordinates are critical.
    - white_pixels: Target pixels within defined regions that change color.
    - blue_pixels: Original blue pixels are preserved. New blue pixels are created.
  - Relationships:
    - Pairs: Every distinct pair of yellow pixels defines a bounding box.
    - Containment: White pixels located within any of these bounding boxes are affected.
  - Actions:
    - Identify: Locate all yellow pixels in the input grid.
    - Pairwise_Combination: Consider every possible pair of identified yellow pixels.
    - Define_Region: For each pair, determine the minimum bounding rectangle enclosing them.
    - Conditional_Fill: Iterate through all cells within each bounding rectangle. If an input cell is white (0), change the corresponding output cell to blue (1).
    - Preserve: Ensure original yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels remain unchanged in the output.

Output_Rule: The output grid is the input grid modified by changing specific white pixels to blue pixels. A white pixel at (row, col) is changed to blue if and only if it falls within the bounding box defined by at least one pair of yellow pixels from the input grid.
