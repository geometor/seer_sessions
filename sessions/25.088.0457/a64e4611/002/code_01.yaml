task_description: Fill rows within a specific vertical block based on the content of the corresponding rows in the input grid.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - pixels: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9)
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
  - object: vertical_strip
    properties:
      - columns: a contiguous range of column indices (start_col, end_col)
      - width: integer (end_col - start_col + 1)
  - object: white_column
    properties:
      - column_index: integer
      - condition: all pixels in this column in the input grid are white (0)
  - object: target_block
    properties:
      - type: vertical_strip
      - derivation: selected based on criteria applied to white_columns in the input grid.

input_grid_properties:
  - contains: pixels of various colors (0-9)
  - contains: columns that may be entirely white (0)

actions_on_input:
  - action: identify_white_columns
    description: Find all columns in the input grid where every pixel is white (0).
  - action: identify_contiguous_white_strips
    input: indices of white_columns
    output: list of vertical_strips representing contiguous blocks of white columns.
    properties_recorded: start_col, end_col, width for each strip.
  - action: select_target_block
    input: list of contiguous white vertical_strips
    output: the single target_block (vertical_strip)
    selection_criteria:
      - rule_1: Choose the strip(s) with the maximum width.
      - rule_2 (tie-breaker): Among those with maximum width, choose the one with the minimum start_col (leftmost).
    fallback: If no white columns exist, no target_block is selected.

transformation:
  - step: initialize_output
    description: Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
  - step: check_target_block
    condition: Was a target_block selected?
    if_false: Return the initialized output grid.
  - step: process_rows
    condition: A target_block was selected (cols target_start_col to target_end_col).
    iteration: For each row_index 'r' from 0 to height-1:
      - check: Does input_grid[r, :] (the entire input row r) contain any pixel with color > 0?
      - if_true:
        - modify: Set output_grid[r, target_start_col : target_end_col + 1] = green (3)
      - if_false:
        - no_change: The segment output_grid[r, target_start_col : target_end_col + 1] remains white (0), as it was part of the identified white block.
  - step: finalize
    description: Return the modified output grid. Pixels outside the target_block columns were unchanged from the initial copy.
