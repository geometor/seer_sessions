            "text": "The tests on `find_largest_contiguous_empty_block` (both original fixed and V2) show it correctly identifies the *first* largest block if there are ties (e.g., Grid 3, Grid 6). The V2 implementation is perhaps slightly cleaner and avoids the intermediate list of column indices. Both seem functionally correct for finding the block based on the \"largest contiguous block of fully white columns\" definition, prioritizing the first one encountered in case of a tie in length.\n\nGiven this function seems robust (though maybe not the most performant possible, it shouldn't time out on 30x30), the timeout error likely stems from either:\n1.  Extremely large inputs (beyond ARC constraints? Unlikely).\n2.  The transformation logic itself being incorrect for some examples, leading the grader to timeout because the output is wrong (some test frameworks might have timeouts linked to failure detection).\n3.  The definition of the \"block\" or the \"fill condition\" is wrong, and the correct logic requires a much more complex (and potentially slower) search or analysis.\n\nLet's stick to the hypothesis that the definition of the block or the fill condition needs refinement based on the broader set of examples.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation identifies a specific vertical segment in the grid and fills certain rows within that segment with green.\n1.  **Block Identification:** The target vertical segment corresponds to the *widest* contiguous block of columns that are entirely white (color 0) in the input grid. If there are multiple blocks of the same maximum width, the *leftmost* one is chosen.\n2.  **Row Filling:** For each row, the portion within the identified block columns is filled with green (color 3) *if and only if* the corresponding row in the *input* grid contains at least one non-white pixel (color > 0). If the input row is entirely white, the corresponding segment in the output remains white.\n3.  **Outside the Block:** All pixels outside the identified block columns remain unchanged from the input grid.\n\nThis hypothesis matches the code's intent and the tested behavior of the block-finding function. If this still fails, the rule must be different. Possible variations: the block isn't defined by white columns, or the fill condition is more complex. But this is the most direct interpretation of the initial code. The timeout remains the main puzzle - perhaps it signals a fundamental misunderstanding of the task revealed by other examples.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy:**\n\nThe timeout error suggests either a performance issue or, more likely, a logical flaw in the transformation rule derived from the initial example(s). The provided code implements a specific rule: find the first, widest block of purely white columns, and fill rows within it green if the corresponding input row had *any* non-white pixels. The `find_largest_contiguous_empty_block` function seems logically sound for its defined purpose (finding the first, widest block) and unlikely to be the sole cause of a timeout within ARC constraints unless the grid structure is pathological (e.g., alternating single white/non-white columns across a wide grid, forcing many block checks).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the core logic based on the tests run on the block finding function.\n2.  Assume the timeout implies this logic is incorrect for at least one training example.\n3.  Refine the natural language program to precisely state the current (potentially flawed) hypothesis, acknowledging the tie-breaking behavior (leftmost block).\n4.  Prepare for the possibility that the block definition or the fill condition is fundamentally different, requiring re-analysis when the specific failing examples are available.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the code's logic and the helper function tests:\n*   **Input Object:** The input grid.\n*   **Intermediate Object:** The set of columns that are entirely white (value 0).\n*   **Intermediate Object:** Contiguous blocks of these white columns.\n*   **Key Property:** Width of these contiguous blocks.\n*   **Identified Object:** The *widest* contiguous block of white columns. In case of ties, the *leftmost* one is selected. Let its column indices be `C_start` to `C_end`.\n*   **Input Property Checked per Row:** Does row `r` of the *input* grid contain *any* pixel with value > 0?\n*   **Output Modification:** If the check is true for row `r`, the segment `output[r, C_start:C_end+1]` is set to green (value 3). Otherwise, it remains white (value 0).\n*   **Output Preservation:** Pixels outside the columns `C_start` to `C_end` in the output are identical to the input.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n"

Identify all columns in the input grid that consist entirely of white pixels (0).\n3.  Find all contiguous blocks (sequences) of these white columns.\n4.  Select the target block: Choose the contiguous block with the greatest width (number of columns). If there is a tie in width, choose the block that appears furthest to the left (minimum starting column index).\n5.  If no entirely white columns exist in the input, return the initial copy of the input grid.\n6.  Otherwise, for each row `r` of the grid:\n    a.

If the input row `r` consists *only* of white pixels, the pixels in the output grid within the target block's columns for that row remain white (as they were identified as part of a white block).\n7.  Return the modified output grid. Pixels outside the target block's columns are unchanged from the input.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying the largest contiguous block of fully white columns in the input and then filling rows within that block in the output grid with green (3) if the corresponding input row contains any non-white pixels. The code failed with a timeout error on the training set.\n\nThis suggests several possibilities:\n1.  **Incorrect Logic:** The rule derived (\"largest white column block\", \"fill if any non-white pixel in row\") might be wrong for some examples. ARC tasks often involve more subtle conditions (e.g., specific colors, shapes, relative positions, exact counts).\n2.  **Performance Issue:** While the block-finding logic seems reasonably efficient (roughly O(W*H)), perhaps certain grid configurations in the hidden examples lead to worst-case performance, or the interaction with the row-checking loop causes unexpected slowness. A timeout often points towards an infinite loop or grossly inefficient algorithm for the scale of the problem, which seems less likely here unless the grid dimensions are much larger than typical or the logic has an unforeseen flaw.\n3.  **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the case of no white columns. It also implicitly handles ties for the largest block by selecting the first one encountered during its scan (which happens to be the leftmost due to the implementation). Perhaps other edge cases (e.g., grid full of non-white pixels, grid entirely white) are not handled correctly according to the task's requirements for those scenarios.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Carefully re-examine *all* provided training examples (input/output pairs) to confirm or refute the current hypothesis. Pay close attention to:\n    *   How is the vertical block in the output *truly* determined? Is it always the widest white column block? Is it always the leftmost in case of ties? Are columns required to be *fully* white?\n    *   What is the exact condition for filling a row segment within the block? Is it *any* non-white pixel, or specific colors, shapes, or locations within the input row?\n    *   Is the fill color always green (3)?\n    *   Are pixels outside the block *always* an exact copy?\n2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the re-evaluation, update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation across all examples.\n3.  **Address Timeout:** If the logic seems correct after re-evaluation, consider optimizations (though the current approach isn't obviously inefficient for ARC scale). If the logic is incorrect, correcting it is the priority, as the timeout might be a symptom of the testing framework detecting a wrong answer over time rather than pure computational slowness.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nUsing the provided code's logic as a basis for expected metrics:\n"
