observations:
  - task: Identify specific columns in the input grid based on their content and transform them in the output grid.
  - object_input: Input grid contains pixels of various colors (0-9). White pixels (0) are significant.
  - object_focus: Contiguous blocks of columns where all pixels are white (all-white columns).
  - properties_focus:
      - Location (start_col, end_col) of these blocks.
      - Width (number of columns) of these blocks.
  - analysis_example_0:
      - input_shape: (5, 6)
      - all_white_columns: [2, 3]
      - white_blocks: [{'start': 2, 'end': 3, 'width': 2}]
      - widest_leftmost_block: {'start': 2, 'end': 3, 'width': 2}
      - output_green_block: {'start': 2, 'end': 3, 'width': 2}
      - comparison: Output green block matches the widest, leftmost all-white block.
  - analysis_example_1:
      - input_shape: (8, 10)
      - all_white_columns: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
      - white_blocks: [{'start': 1, 'end': 3, 'width': 3}, {'start': 7, 'end': 8, 'width': 2}]
      - widest_leftmost_block: {'start': 1, 'end': 3, 'width': 3}
      - output_green_block: {'start': 1, 'end': 3, 'width': 3}
      - comparison: Output green block matches the widest, leftmost all-white block.
  - analysis_example_2:
      - input_shape: (12, 9)
      - all_white_columns: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]
      - white_blocks: [{'start': 0, 'end': 1, 'width': 2}, {'start': 5, 'end': 8, 'width': 4}]
      - widest_leftmost_block: {'start': 5, 'end': 8, 'width': 4} # Identified by previous code
      - output_green_block: {'start': 0, 'end': 1, 'width': 2} # Actual output transformation
      - comparison: Output green block DOES NOT match the widest, leftmost all-white block. It matches the block {'start': 0, 'end': 1, 'width': 2}, which is the *leftmost* block overall, but not the widest.
  - action: A specific block of all-white columns is selected based on a rule.
  - transformation: The selected block of columns is filled entirely with green (3) in the output grid, replacing the original white pixels. All other pixels remain unchanged.
  - inference: The selection rule "widest, leftmost" is incorrect based on Example 2. A potential revised rule is "Select the leftmost block of all-white columns, regardless of its width".
  - potential_timeout_cause: While Example 2 analysis reveals a logic flaw, the timeout could still be related to performance on larger grids or a higher number of examples in the actual test set, possibly exacerbated by the complexity of finding the 'widest' block unnecessarily if the rule is simpler.
