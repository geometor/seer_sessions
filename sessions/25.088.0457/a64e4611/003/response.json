Examine the input grid to find all columns where every pixel is white (color 0).\n3. Identify all contiguous blocks (sequences) of these entirely white columns. Determine the width (number of columns) of each block.\n4. Select the \"target block\" from these contiguous white blocks based on the following criteria:\n    a. Choose the block(s) with the largest width.\n    b. If there are multiple blocks with the same largest width, select the one that is furthest to the left (i.e., has the smallest starting column index).\n5. If no entirely white columns were found in the input grid (and thus no target block was selected), the process stops, and the initial (unmodified) output grid is returned.\n6. If a target block was selected (spanning from column `C_start` to `C_end`):\n    a. Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom (row index `r`).\n    b. For the current row `r`, check if *any* pixel across the *entire width* of the input grid in that row has a color other than white (i.e., color is 1 through 9).\n    c. If such a non-white pixel exists in input row `r`, then in the output grid, change the color of all pixels in row `r` *within the columns of the target block* (from `C_start` to `C_end`) to green (color 3).\n    d. If input row `r` contains only white pixels, then the corresponding segment in the output grid (row `r`, columns `C_start` to `C_end`) remains unchanged (it will be white).\n7. After checking and potentially modifying all rows, return the final output grid. Pixels outside the target block's columns are unchanged from the input.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_widest_leftmost_white_block(grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int | None, int | None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the start and end column indices of the widest contiguous block \n    of columns that contain only white pixels (0).
