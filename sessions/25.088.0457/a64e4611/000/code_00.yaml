task_elements:
  - Input Grid:
      description: A 2D grid with a white background (0) and scattered pixels of a single non-white color.
      properties:
        - contains_white_pixels: true
        - contains_non_white_pixels: true
        - unique_non_white_color: present in each example (1, 8, or 2)
        - contains_empty_columns: true (columns composed entirely of white pixels)
  - Output Grid:
      description: A 2D grid derived from the input grid.
      properties:
        - dimensions_match_input: true
        - preserves_pixels_outside_target_region: true
        - introduces_green_pixels: true (color 3)
        - target_region_is_column_block: true

actions:
  - Identify Empty Columns:
      description: Find all columns in the input grid that contain only white (0) pixels.
      input: Input Grid
      output: Set of column indices
  - Find Contiguous Empty Block:
      description: Identify the largest contiguous sequence of column indices from the set of empty columns. If multiple blocks of the same max size exist, the specific rule (e.g., first one) might need clarification, but examples suggest only one primary block.
      input: Set of empty column indices
      output: Start column index (C_start), End column index (C_end)
  - Process Rows:
      description: Iterate through each row of the input grid to determine modifications for the output grid.
      input: Input Grid, C_start, C_end
      output: Modified Output Grid
      sub_steps:
        - Create initial Output Grid (copy of Input Grid).
        - For each row 'r':
          - Check if Input Grid row 'r' contains any non-white pixel.
          - If yes: Set Output Grid pixels from (r, C_start) to (r, C_end) to green (3).
          - If no (row is all white): Do nothing (Output Grid row 'r' remains unchanged from the initial copy).

relationships:
  - The location of the green fill in the output depends entirely on the location of the block of fully white columns in the input.
  - Whether a specific row within the green fill region actually becomes green depends on whether the corresponding input row contained *any* non-white pixels at all.
  - The original non-white color in the input does not influence the final green color or the location.
