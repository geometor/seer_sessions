Let's call this the \"empty block\".\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation modifies the output grid within the column boundaries of this \"empty block\". For each row:\n    *   If the corresponding row in the *input* grid contains *any* non-white pixel (any pixel with value > 0) anywhere across the row's full width, then all pixels within the \"empty block\" columns for that specific row in the *output* grid are changed to green (3).\n    *   If the corresponding row in the *input* grid is *entirely* white (all pixels are 0), then the pixels within the \"empty block\" columns for that row in the *output* grid remain white (0).\n5.  **Color Invariance:** The specific non-white color present in the input (blue, azure, or red) does not affect the output color (which is always green) or the logic itself; it only serves to distinguish rows that trigger the green fill from rows that remain entirely white.\n6.  **Grid Preservation:** Pixels outside the identified \"empty block\" columns are never modified; they retain their original color from the input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Scan the input grid column by column to identify all columns that consist entirely of white pixels (value 0).\n3.  Determine the start and end column indices (`C_start`, `C_end`) of the largest contiguous block of these \"empty\" columns. (Based on examples, assume there is one unique, largest block).\n4.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid (from row 0 to the last row).\n5.  For the current row `r`, check if it contains any pixel with a value greater than 0 (any non-white pixel) across its entire width (from column 0 to the last column).\n6.  If row `r` *does* contain at least one non-white pixel, then modify the *output* grid: set the color of all pixels in row `r` from column `C_start` to column `C_end` (inclusive) to green (value 3).\n7.  If row `r` consists *only* of white pixels (value 0), make no changes to the output grid for this row within the `C_start` to `C_end` columns (they remain white from the initial copy).\n8.  After checking all rows, the final state of the output grid represents the solution."
