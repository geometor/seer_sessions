Examine each column of the input grid. Identify all columns where every pixel is white (color 0).\n3. Group adjacent \"all-white\" columns into contiguous blocks. Record the start column index, end column index, and width for each block.\n4. If no \"all-white\" columns were found (and thus no blocks exist), return the unmodified output grid (the copy of the input).\n5. If blocks were found, determine the maximum width among all identified blocks.\n6. Select the \"target block\":\n    a. Consider only the blocks that have the maximum width found in the previous step.\n    b. Among these maximum-width blocks, choose the one that appears furthest to the left (i.e., the one with the smallest starting column index).\n7. Modify the output grid: Change the color of all pixels located within the column range of the target block (from its start column index to its end column index, inclusive) and covering all rows (from row 0 to the grid height minus 1) to green (color 3). Pixels outside this rectangular region remain unchanged from the initial copy.\n8.
