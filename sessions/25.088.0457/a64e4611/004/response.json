Let's re-calculate `is_col_empty` carefully.\nCol 0: `[0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` -> Not empty (contains 1)\nCol 1: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` -> Not empty\nCol 2: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]` -> Not empty (contains 1)\nCol 3: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]` -> Not empty (contains 1)\nCol 4: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` -> Not empty\nCol 5: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` -> Empty!\nCol 6: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` -> Empty!\nCol 7: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` -> Not empty\nCol 8: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]` -> Not empty\nCol 9: `[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]` -> Not empty (contains 1)\n\nSo, `is_col_empty` should be `[F, F, F, F, F, T, T, F, F, F]`.\nThe code output `is_col_empty=[np.False_, np.False_, np.False_, np.False_, np.False_, np.True_, np.True_, np.False_, np.False_, np.False_]` which matches.\n\nNow, find the blocks:\n- Block 1: cols 5-6 (width 2)\nThere are no other blocks.\nThe widest block is cols 5-6. It's also the leftmost.\nResult: `start_col=5, end_col=6`.\n\nThe code's `find_widest_leftmost_white_block` function seems correct based on its definition and the test case result.\n\nLet's re-check the other examples against the code output:\n- Example 3: Code output `start=5, end=8`. `is_col_empty=[F, T, T, F, F, T, T, T, T, F]`. Blocks: cols 1-2 (width 2), cols 5-8 (width 4). Widest is 5-8. Correct.\n- Example 2: Code output `start=2, end=2`. `is_col_empty=[F, F, T, F, F]`. Block: col 2 (width 1). Correct.\n- Example 1: Code output `start=3, end=4`. `is_col_empty=[F, F, F, T, T, F, F]`. Block: cols 3-4 (width 2). Correct.\n\nSo, the block finding logic/implementation seems correct. The issue must have been the second part of the original transformation logic (the row-by-row check) which was both incorrect according to Example 2 and potentially the cause of the timeout (though less likely now).\n\nThe revised logic (find the block, fill it entirely with green) seems consistent with all examples and is simpler. This should avoid the timeout and produce the correct outputs.\n\nFinal checks:\n- Color to fill: Green (3).\n- Condition: Find the widest block of *all-white* columns. Tie-break with leftmost.\n- Action: Fill that entire block region (all rows, columns `C_start` to `C_end`) with green.\n- Edge case: If no all-white columns, return input unchanged.\n\nThis looks solid.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying the widest, leftmost block of completely white columns and then conditionally filling segments of those columns based on whether the corresponding row contained any non-white pixels elsewhere. This code resulted in a timeout error on the first training example, suggesting either a significant inefficiency, a subtle infinite loop, or a fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule leading to unexpected complexity.\n\nAnalysis of the provided examples reveals a simpler pattern:\n1.  Identify columns composed entirely of white pixels.\n2.  Find the contiguous block of such columns that is the widest.\n3.  If multiple blocks share the maximum width, select the leftmost one.\n4.  Fill this entire selected block (all rows within the block's columns) with green.\n5.  If no such block exists, the grid remains unchanged.\n\nThe previous code's row-by-row check (step 6b/6c/6d in its description) was incorrect based on Example 2, where the output shows the entire vertical white bar filled green, even though some input rows corresponding to that bar were entirely white. This incorrect conditional logic might also have contributed to the timeout, although the exact cause remains unclear without deeper profiling.\n\nThe strategy is to implement the simpler, revised logic: find the specific block and fill it entirely, unconditionally, with green.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCode execution was used to verify the core logic of identifying the target block (`find_widest_leftmost_white_block`) against all training examples and the test example.\n\n*   **Input Grid Dimensions:**\n    *   Train 1: 7x7\n    *   Train 2: 5x5\n    *   Train 3: 10x10\n    *   Test 1: 10x10\n*   **All-White Columns (`is_col_empty`):**\n    *   Train 1: `[F, F, F, T, T, F, F]`\n    *   Train 2: `[F, F, T, F, F]`\n    *   Train 3: `[F, T, T, F, F, T, T, T, T, F]`\n    *   Test 1: `[F, F, F, F, F, T, T, F, F, F]`\n*   **Identified Target Block (Widest, Leftmost):**\n    *   Train 1: Start=3, End=4 (Width 2)\n    *   Train 2: Start=2, End=2 (Width 1)\n    *   Train 3: Start=5, End=8 (Width 4) - *Selected over block at 1-2 (Width 2)*\n    *   Test 1: Start=5, End=6 (Width 2) - *Verification confirmed this over initial manual analysis*\n*   **Output Action:** In all examples where a block was found, the output shows the entire identified block (all rows, columns `start` to `end`) filled with green (3).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
