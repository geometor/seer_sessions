Examine each column of the input grid. Identify all columns where every pixel is white (color 0).\n3. Group adjacent \"all-white\" columns into contiguous blocks. Record the start column index and end column index for each block.\n4. If no \"all-white\" columns were found (and thus no blocks exist), return the unmodified output grid (the copy of the input).\n5. If one or more blocks were found, select the \"target block\" which is the one that appears furthest to the left (i.e., the block with the smallest starting column index). Disregard the width of the blocks for selection purposes.\n6. Modify the output grid: Change the color of all pixels located within the column range of the target block (from its start column index to its end column index, inclusive) and covering all rows (from row 0 to the grid height minus 1) to green (color 3). Pixels outside this rectangular region remain unchanged from the initial copy.\n7.
