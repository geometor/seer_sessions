These lines divide the main grid area into smaller, identical rectangular cells.\n2.  **Cell Size:** The areas bounded by the grid lines (the content cells) are consistently 3x3 pixels. The grid lines themselves are 1 pixel thick, making the repeating unit effectively 4x4 (3x3 content + 1 row/column of grid line).\n3.  **Unique Pattern Object:** Within exactly one of these 3x3 content cells in each input grid, there is a distinct pattern composed of a third color (yellow, green, or red). This pattern object is the key element being manipulated. The rest of the 3x3 content cells are initially filled with the background color (white).\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid retains the exact same grid line structure as the input. The transformation involves replicating the unique 3x3 pattern object into multiple other 3x3 content cells based on a specific rule related to position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the dimensions of the content cells (which are 3x3) bounded by these lines. Mentally (or actually) index these cells by row and column, starting from 0 (e.g., cell (0,0) is the top-left 3x3 content area).\n2.  **Locate Unique Pattern:** Iterate through the 3x3 content cells and identify the single cell that contains pixels of a color different from both the background (white) and the grid lines. Extract this 3x3 pattern. Record the row index (`pattern_row`) and column index (`pattern_col`) of the cell where this pattern was found.\n3.  **Determine Parity:** Find the parity (whether they are even or odd) of `pattern_row` and `pattern_col`.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially copying the grid line structure precisely. Fill all 3x3 content areas with the background color (white).\n5.  **Replicate Pattern:** Iterate through all possible cell locations (row `r`, column `c`) in the grid structure. For each cell location:\n    *   Check if the parity of `r` matches the parity of `pattern_row`.\n    *   Check if the parity of `c` matches the parity of `pattern_col`.\n    *   If *both* parity conditions are met, copy the extracted 3x3 pattern into the 3x3 content area corresponding to cell (`r`, `c`) in the output grid.\n6.  **Finalize:** The constructed grid after placing the pattern in all qualifying cells is the final output."
