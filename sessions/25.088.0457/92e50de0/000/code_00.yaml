Grid:
  Properties:
    - BackgroundColor: white (0)
    - GridLines:
        - Type: Horizontal and Vertical
        - Thickness: 1 pixel
        - Color: Varies per example (red(2), blue(1), azure(8)), but consistent within an example.
        - Function: Divide the grid into equal rectangular cells.
  Structure:
    - Cells:
        - Definition: Rectangular areas bounded by grid lines.
        - ContentAreaSize: 3x3 pixels.
        - Arrangement: Tiled arrangement forming rows and columns of cells.

PatternObject:
  Properties:
    - Size: Fits within a 3x3 pixel area.
    - Color: Varies per example (yellow(4), green(3), red(2)), distinct from background and grid lines.
    - Uniqueness: Appears in exactly one cell in the input grid.
  Location:
    - Resides within a single 3x3 content cell.
    - Identified by the row and column index of the cell it occupies.

Transformation:
  Action: Replication
  Source: The unique 3x3 PatternObject found in the input grid.
  TargetCells: Multiple 3x3 content cells in the output grid.
  Rule:
    - Identify the row index (R_pattern) and column index (C_pattern) of the cell containing the PatternObject in the input.
    - Determine the parity (even/odd) of R_pattern and C_pattern.
    - The PatternObject is placed into all cells in the output grid whose row index (R_cell) and column index (C_cell) satisfy:
        - parity(R_cell) == parity(R_pattern)
        - parity(C_cell) == parity(C_pattern)
  Preservation:
    - The grid lines (color and position) are unchanged from input to output.
    - Cells not designated as target cells remain filled with the background color.
