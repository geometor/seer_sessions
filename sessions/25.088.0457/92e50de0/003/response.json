The grid lines are 1 pixel thick and define cells whose content area is 3x3 pixels. The grid lines appear every 4 pixels (indices 3, 7, 11, ...), resulting in a repeating 4x4 unit structure (3x3 content + 1 row/col of grid line).\n\nThe transformation identifies the 3x3 pattern and the row/column index (0-based) of the cell it occupies in the conceptual grid of 3x3 cells. It then determines the parity (even/odd) of this source cell's row and column index.\n\nThe output grid is constructed with the same dimensions and background color as the input. The grid lines from the input are reconstructed in the output. The identified 3x3 pattern is then replicated into all 3x3 content cells (respecting grid boundaries) whose conceptual row and column indices have the *same parity* as the source cell's row and column indices, respectively. Cells not meeting this parity requirement remain background colored (except for the grid lines).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_grid_params_and_pattern(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies grid structure, locates the unique pattern, and finds its cell coordinates.\n    Assumes a regular grid structure with 3x3 content cells and 1px lines (4x4 unit).\n\n    Args:\n        grid_np: numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing:\n        - pattern (np.array): The 3x3 pattern found.\n        - pattern_cell_row (int): The row index of the cell containing the pattern.\n        - pattern_cell_col (int): The column index of the cell containing the pattern.\n        - grid_unit_size (tuple): The size of the repeating unit (e.g., (4, 4)).\n        - cell_content_size (tuple): The size of the content area within a cell (e.g., (3, 3)).\n        - num_cell_rows (int): The number of cells vertically.\n        - num_cell_cols (int): The number of cells horizontally.\n        - grid_line_color (int): The color of the grid lines.\n        - background_color (int): The background color (assumed 0).\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the pattern cannot be found or grid parameters are ambiguous.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n    background_color = 0  # Assume background is white (0)\n\n    # Fixed parameters based on the task description\n    cell_content_size = (3, 3)\n    grid_unit_size = (4, 4)\n    grid_line_width = 1\n\n    # Robustly calculate the number of cells based on potential start indices\n    num_cell_rows = len([i for i in range(height) if i % grid_unit_size[0] == 0])\n    num_cell_cols = len([i for i in range(width) if i % grid_unit_size[1] == 0])\n\n    # Find grid line color - check rows/cols at index 3, 7, etc.\n    grid_line_color = -1\n    potential_line_coords = []\n    for r in range(grid_line_width, height, grid_unit_size[0]):\n         potential_line_coords.extend([(r, c) for c in range(width)])\n    for c in range(grid_line_width, width, grid_unit_size[1]):\n         potential_line_coords.extend([(r, c) for r in range(height)])\n\n    line_colors = [grid_np[r,c] for r,c in potential_line_coords if grid_np[r,c] != background_color]\n\n    if not line_colors:\n         # Fallback: Check intersection point if grid large enough\n         if height > grid_line_width and width > grid_line_width and grid_np[grid_line_width, grid_line_width] != background_color:\n              grid_line_color = grid_np[grid_line_width, grid_line_width]\n         else:\n              # Try another common spot\n                if height > 0 and width > grid_line_width and grid_np[0, grid_line_width] != background_color:\n                     grid_line_color = grid_np[0, grid_line_width]\n                elif height > grid_line_width and width > 0 and grid_np[grid_line_width, 0] != background_color:\n                     grid_line_color = grid_np[grid_line_width, 0]\n                else:\n                    # If still not found, maybe there are no lines?
