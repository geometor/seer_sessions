Transformation Description:
The input grid consists of a background color (white, 0), grid lines of a single color (e.g., red, blue, azure), and a unique 3x3 pattern located within one of the cells defined by the grid lines. The grid lines are 1 pixel thick and define cells whose content area is 3x3 pixels. The grid lines appear every 4 pixels (indices 3, 7, 11, ...), resulting in a repeating 4x4 unit structure (3x3 content + 1 row/col of grid line).

The transformation identifies the 3x3 pattern and the row/column index (0-based) of the cell it occupies in the conceptual grid of 3x3 cells. It then determines the parity (even/odd) of this source cell's row and column index.

The output grid is constructed with the same dimensions and background color as the input. The grid lines from the input are reconstructed in the output. The identified 3x3 pattern is then replicated into all 3x3 content cells (respecting grid boundaries) whose conceptual row and column indices have the *same parity* as the source cell's row and column indices, respectively. Cells not meeting this parity requirement remain background colored (except for the grid lines).
