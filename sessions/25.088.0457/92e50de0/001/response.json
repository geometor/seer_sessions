The grid lines are 1 pixel thick and define 3x3 content cells, making a repeating 4x4 unit (3x3 content + 1 row/col of grid line).\n\nThe transformation identifies the 3x3 pattern and the row/column index of the cell it occupies in the input. It then determines the parity (even/odd) of this source cell's row and column index. \n\nThe output grid maintains the same grid line structure as the input. The identified 3x3 pattern is replicated into all 3x3 content cells whose row and column indices have the *same parity* as the source cell's row and column indices, respectively. Cells not meeting this parity requirement retain the background color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_grid_and_pattern_params(grid_np):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies grid line color, cell size, grid spacing, \n    and locates the unique pattern and its cell coordinates.\n    Assumes a regular grid structure with 3x3 content cells and 1px lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Assume grid lines are at indices 3, 7, 11...\n    # Grid line color can be inferred from these positions (assuming not background)\n    grid_line_color = -1\n    if height > 3 and grid_np[3, 0] != 0:\n        grid_line_color = grid_np[3, 0]\n    elif width > 3 and grid_np[0, 3] != 0:\n        grid_line_color = grid_np[0, 3]\n    else:\n        # Fallback or error handling if grid is too small or unusual\n        # For this problem, we can likely assume a valid grid structure\n        # Let's check a few more points if the first ones were background (unlikely given examples)\n         if height > 3 and width > 3:\n            if grid_np[3,3] != 0: # Check a grid intersection point, might be the grid color\n                 # Need to be careful this isn't the pattern color.\n                 # Let's stick to checking the lines themselves first.\n                 # A more robust way might be to find the most frequent non-background color on rows/cols 3, 7,...\n                 pass # Simple assumption might be okay for ARC\n\n    # Assuming background is 0\n    background_color = 0\n    \n    # Cell dimensions based on problem description\n    cell_content_size = (3, 3)\n    grid_unit_size = (4, 4) # 3x3 content + 1px border\n\n    num_cell_rows = height // grid_unit_size[0]\n    num_cell_cols = width // grid_unit_size[1]\n\n    pattern = None\n    pattern_cell_row = -1\n    pattern_cell_col = -1\n\n    # Find the unique pattern and its location\n    for r_cell in range(num_cell_rows):\n        for c_cell in range(num_cell_cols):\n            r_start = r_cell * grid_unit_size[0]\n            c_start = c_cell * grid_unit_size[1]\n            \n            cell_content = grid_np[r_start:r_start + cell_content_size[0], \n                                   c_start:c_start + cell_content_size[1]]\n            \n            # Check if the cell contains anything other than the background\n            if np.any(cell_content != background_color):\n                pattern = cell_content\n                pattern_cell_row = r_cell\n                pattern_cell_col = c_cell\n                break # Found the pattern\n        if pattern is not None:\n            break\n            \n    if pattern is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Pattern not found in input grid.\")\n\n    return pattern, pattern_cell_row, pattern_cell_col, grid_unit_size, cell_content_size, num_cell_rows, num_cell_cols\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the pattern replication based on cell index parity.\n    \n    1.
