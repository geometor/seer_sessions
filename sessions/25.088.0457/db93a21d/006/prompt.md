"""
Colors white background pixels based on their proximity (Chebyshev distance)
to distinct maroon rectangular objects, but only within the convex hull
enclosing all maroon pixels. Pixels outside this hull remain white.

1. Find all distinct maroon (9) objects (4-directional connectivity).
2. Determine the set of all maroon pixels across all objects.
3. Calculate the 2D convex hull of these maroon pixels.
4. Create a boolean mask representing the area inside or on the boundary of this convex hull.
5. Perform a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all maroon pixels, using 8-directional (Chebyshev) distance.
6. Calculate the shortest distance from each grid cell to the nearest maroon object(s).
7. Track the set of unique maroon object IDs that are equidistant at the shortest distance for each cell.
8. Create the output grid:
   - Maroon pixels remain maroon (9).
   - Originally white pixels (0) that fall *within* the convex hull mask are colored:
     - Green (3) if closest to exactly one maroon object.
     - Blue (1) if equidistant from multiple maroon objects.
     - White (0) if unreachable by the BFS (infinitely far), though this is unlikely within the hull.
   - Originally white pixels (0) *outside* the convex hull mask remain white (0).
   - Other pixels (if any) are assumed to become white (0).
