Input_Analysis:
  - Objects:
      - Primary objects are contiguous areas of maroon (9) pixels (using 4-connectivity).
      - The background is primarily white (0) pixels.
  - Properties:
      - Maroon objects act as sources for a distance calculation.
      - The spatial arrangement of maroon objects is important.

Output_Analysis:
  - Objects:
      - Original maroon (9) objects are preserved.
      - New colored areas appear: green (3) and blue (1).
  - Properties:
      - Output colors depend on the input configuration of maroon objects and white space.
      - A boundary, defined by the convex hull of all maroon pixels, restricts the colored areas.

Transformations:
  - Action: Identify all distinct maroon (9) objects.
  - Action: Determine the set of all pixels belonging to any maroon object.
  - Action: Calculate the 2D convex hull enclosing all these maroon pixels. Define this hull's interior and boundary as the Region of Interest (ROI).
  - Action: Calculate the shortest distance (Chebyshev/8-directional) from each pixel within the ROI to the nearest maroon pixel(s). Use a multi-source BFS starting from all maroon pixels simultaneously.
  - Action: Preserve original maroon (9) pixels.
  - Action: Color pixels based on the distance calculation and ROI:
      - Input white (0) pixels *outside* the ROI remain white (0).
      - Input white (0) pixels *inside* the ROI are colored:
          - Green (3) if they are closest to exactly one maroon object.
          - Blue (1) if they are equidistant between two or more maroon objects.
          - White (0) if unreachable by the BFS (theoretically possible but unlikely within the hull if maroon objects exist).
  - Action: Handle any other input pixel colors (non-maroon, non-white) by converting them to white (0) in the output. (This needs verification against examples).
