            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying maroon objects, defining a region of interest (ROI) using their convex hull, and coloring the background within this ROI based on proximity (Chebyshev distance) to the nearest maroon object(s). Pixels uniquely closest to one object become green, while pixels equidistant from multiple objects become blue. Pixels outside the hull remain white.\n\nThe immediate error, `No module named 'skimage'`, is an execution environment issue \u2013 the `scikit-image` library is required but not available. This needs to be resolved in the coder phase by ensuring the library is installed or by finding an alternative method for polygon filling if the library cannot be used.\n\nHowever, the core logic needs validation against all training examples. The strategy is:\n1.  Assume the conceptual steps derived from the first example (maroon objects, convex hull ROI, distance-based coloring) are potentially correct but need confirmation.\n2.  Re-evaluate these concepts against *all* provided examples (once accessible) to check for edge cases or variations. Key questions include:\n    *   Is the convex hull always the correct boundary?\n    *   Is Chebyshev (8-directional) distance always the correct metric?\n    *   Are the coloring rules (green=1 source, blue=>1 source, white outside hull) consistent?\n    *   How are non-white, non-maroon pixels handled in the input (if any)? The current code defaults them to white in the output.\n3.  Refine the natural language program based on a comprehensive analysis of all examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nSince the examples are not directly viewable here, I cannot compute specific metrics. However, the following metrics would be crucial for analysis:\n\n*   **Input/Output Grid Dimensions:** Record `(height, width)` for each pair.\n*   **Maroon Objects:**\n    *   Number of distinct maroon (9) objects per input.\n    *   Set of coordinates `{(r, c), ...}` for each maroon object.\n    *   Total number of maroon pixels per input.\n*   **Convex Hull:**\n    *   Coordinates of the vertices of the convex hull of all maroon pixels.\n    *   Area (number of pixels) inside the convex hull.\n*   **Output Colors:**\n    *   Count of green (3) pixels in the output.\n    *   Count of blue (1) pixels in the output.\n    *   Count of white (0) pixels in the output (both inside and outside the hull).\n    *   Count of maroon (9) pixels in the output (should match input).\n*   **Pixel Analysis:**\n    *   For a sample of green pixels: verify they are uniquely closest to one maroon object using Chebyshev distance and inside the hull.\n    *   For a sample of blue pixels: verify they are equidistant to multiple maroon objects using Chebyshev distance and inside the hull.\n    *   For a sample of output white pixels: verify they were either outside the hull or unreachable/originally non-white (if applicable).\n\n**Facts (Based on Code Interpretation)**\n\n"

Identify all distinct connected regions (objects) of maroon pixels (color 9) in the input grid, considering pixels connected horizontally or vertically (4-connectivity).\n2.  Collect the coordinates of all maroon pixels from all identified objects.\n3.  Determine the 2D convex hull that encloses all these maroon pixel coordinates. Define the area inside and on the boundary of this hull as the Region of Interest (ROI).\n4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but potentially defaulting non-maroon pixels to white (needs verification - the code initializes to white then places maroon). A safer approach: Initialize output grid to white (0).\n5.  Iterate through all maroon pixel coordinates identified in step 2. Mark their corresponding positions in the output grid as maroon (9).\n6.  Perform a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all maroon pixels. Use Chebyshev distance (maximum difference in row or column coordinates, equivalent to 8-directional steps). Keep track of:\n    a.  The shortest distance found so far from any maroon source to every other pixel (`distance`).\n    b.  The set of unique maroon *object IDs* (from step 1) that are equidistant at that shortest distance for each pixel (`sources`).\n7.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the grid:\n    a.  If the pixel `(r, c)` is maroon (9) in the input, ensure it is maroon (9) in the output.\n    b.  If the pixel `(r, c)` was originally white (0) in the input *and* falls within the ROI (calculated in step 3):\n        i.  Check the BFS results for this pixel.\n        ii. If the pixel was reached by the BFS (`distance[r, c]` is finite) and the number of distinct source object IDs in `sources[r, c]` is exactly 1, color the output pixel green (3).\n        iii. If the pixel was reached by the BFS and the number of distinct source object IDs in `sources[r, c]` is greater than 1, color the output pixel blue (1).\n        iv. If the pixel was not reached by the BFS (or potentially if `sources[r, c]` is empty), leave the output pixel white (0).\n    c.  If the pixel `(r, c)` was originally white (0) but falls *outside* the ROI, leave the output pixel white (0).\n    d.  If the pixel `(r, c)` had any other original color (not white or maroon), color the output pixel white (0). (This rule needs confirmation from examples)."
