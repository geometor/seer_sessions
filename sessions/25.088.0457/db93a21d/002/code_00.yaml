description: Color white background pixels based on proximity to distinct maroon rectangular objects.
priors:
    - Objectness: Input contains distinct maroon (9) rectangular objects on a white (0) background. These objects persist unchanged in the output.
    - Geometry & Topology: The transformation depends on the spatial relationship (proximity) between background pixels and the maroon objects. Adjacency (8-directional/Chebyshev) seems relevant for defining proximity.
    - Colors:
        - Input: White (0), Maroon (9)
        - Output: White (0), Blue (1), Green (3), Maroon (9)

observations:
    - input_grid: Contains a white (0) background and one or more distinct, non-overlapping, rectangular objects of maroon (9) color.
    - output_grid:
        - Maroon (9) pixels from the input remain unchanged.
        - White (0) pixels from the input are transformed based on proximity to the maroon objects.
        - Some white (0) pixels remain white (0) if they are sufficiently "far" from any maroon object.
        - White (0) pixels closest to exactly one maroon object become green (3).
        - White (0) pixels equidistant from two or more maroon objects become blue (1).
    - distance_metric: The boundaries between colored regions (green/blue) suggest that distance is measured using 8-directional (Chebyshev) adjacency. A pixel (x, y) is distance 1 from a maroon object if any of its 8 neighbors is part of that object.
    - algorithm_intuition: The process resembles creating a Voronoi diagram where the maroon objects are the sites. Green regions are the Voronoi cells for single objects, and blue regions are the boundaries equidistant from multiple objects.

derived_facts:
    - Transformation acts only on white (0) pixels.
    - Transformation preserves maroon (9) pixels.
    - Coloring (green/blue) depends on the count of the *nearest* distinct maroon objects.
    - A multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all maroon pixels simultaneously seems appropriate.
    - The BFS should calculate the shortest distance (in 8-directional steps) from each white pixel to any maroon pixel.
    - The BFS must also track the set of source object IDs corresponding to the shortest paths found so far for each pixel.

potential_challenges:
    - Correctly implementing the multi-source BFS, especially handling distance updates and source set merging for equidistant paths.
    - Ensuring the BFS correctly terminates and doesn't color pixels that should remain white (those potentially infinitely far if the grid were unbounded, or simply not reached if the grid is finite but large). Need to handle `distance == infinity`.
    - Accurately identifying the distinct maroon objects and assigning unique IDs.
