            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in the implemented logic or its translation into code. The core idea was to color white pixels based on their proximity to distinct maroon objects (green for closest to one, blue for equidistant to multiple), effectively creating a Voronoi diagram. However, the generated outputs differ significantly from the expected ones, often coloring pixels incorrectly or failing to leave distant white pixels untouched.\n\nThe strategy for resolution involves:\n1.  **Re-evaluating the distance calculation and propagation**: The previous BFS started from neighbors of maroon pixels. A potentially more robust approach is a multi-source BFS starting *from* all maroon pixels simultaneously.\n2.  **Confirming the distance metric**: While 8-directional (Chebyshev) distance seemed plausible and was used, we should verify if 4-directional (Manhattan) might fit the patterns better, although visual inspection suggests 8-directional is likely correct.\n3.  **Refining the Object Identification**: Ensure maroon objects are correctly identified as contiguous blocks (current 4-directional seems okay).\n4.  **Careful Implementation**: Re-implement the BFS logic meticulously, paying close attention to initialization, distance updates, source propagation (especially for equidistant paths), and the final coloring step based on source counts.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the differences between the expected output and the failed transformed output for Example 1 to pinpoint the errors.\n\n"

The expected output correctly preserves some white pixels.\n*   **White Pixels:** The most glaring error is that *all* 153 pixels that should have remained white (0) were incorrectly colored green (3) or blue (1) by the transformation function. This suggests the distance calculation or the BFS termination condition is wrong, causing it to \"reach\" and color every background pixel.\n*   **Green/Blue Pixels:** While some green and blue pixels were placed correctly, the vast majority were incorrect (179 wrongly green, 21 wrongly blue). Many pixels that should have been blue ended up green (e.g., pixel (12,15)), and vice-versa, or pixels that should have been white became colored.\n*   **Specific Pixels:** The top-left corner (0,0), far from any maroon object, should be white (0) but became green (3). Pixel (9,1) should be white (0) but became blue (1). Pixel (12,15) should be blue (1) but became green (3). This points to errors in both distance calculation (affecting which object(s) are deemed closest) and potentially the BFS propagation extent.\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The previous BFS implementation incorrectly expands to fill the entire grid and miscalculates the closest source(s) for many pixels. The logic needs fundamental revision, likely starting with a multi-source BFS originating *from* the maroon pixels and using 8-directional distance.\n\n## Fact Documentation\n\n"
