"""
Transforms the input grid based on the proximity of white pixels to distinct maroon objects within a defined region.

1.  Identifies all distinct connected regions (objects) of maroon pixels (color 9) using 4-directional connectivity.
2.  Collects the coordinates of all maroon pixels from all identified objects.
3.  Determines the 2D convex hull enclosing all these maroon pixel coordinates. The area inside and on the boundary of this hull defines the Region of Interest (ROI).
4.  Initializes the output grid to white (0).
5.  Copies the original maroon pixels (9) to the output grid.
6.  Performs a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting simultaneously from all maroon pixels, using Chebyshev distance (8-directional steps). This calculates the shortest distance from each grid cell to the nearest maroon object(s) and identifies which object(s) are closest.
7.  Colors the output grid pixels based on the input color, ROI status, and BFS results:
    a.  Maroon (9) input pixels remain maroon (9).
    b.  White (0) input pixels *within* the ROI are colored:
        i.   Green (3) if uniquely closest to one maroon object.
        ii.  Blue (1) if equidistant from multiple maroon objects.
        iii. White (0) if unreachable by the BFS within the ROI (unlikely if maroon objects exist).
    c.  White (0) input pixels *outside* the ROI remain white (0).
    d.  Any other input pixel color (not 0 or 9) becomes white (0) in the output.
