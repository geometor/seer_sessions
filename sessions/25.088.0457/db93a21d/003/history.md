"""
Identifies distinct maroon (9) rectangular objects in the input grid. 
Calculates the shortest distance from each non-maroon pixel to the nearest maroon object(s), considering 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals).
Colors originally white (0) pixels based on this proximity:
- If a white pixel is closest to exactly one maroon object, it becomes green (3).
- If a white pixel is equidistant from multiple maroon objects, it becomes blue (1).
Maroon pixels remain unchanged. White pixels unreachable from any maroon object remain white.

## General Assessment

The previous code attempt failed on all training examples, indicating a fundamental flaw in the implemented logic or its translation into code. The core idea was to color white pixels based on their proximity to distinct maroon objects (green for closest to one, blue for equidistant to multiple), effectively creating a Voronoi diagram. However, the generated outputs differ significantly from the expected ones, often coloring pixels incorrectly or failing to leave distant white pixels untouched.

The strategy for resolution involves:
1.  **Re-evaluating the distance calculation and propagation**: The previous BFS started from neighbors of maroon pixels. A potentially more robust approach is a multi-source BFS starting *from* all maroon pixels simultaneously.
2.  **Confirming the distance metric**: While 8-directional (Chebyshev) distance seemed plausible and was used, we should verify if 4-directional (Manhattan) might fit the patterns better, although visual inspection suggests 8-directional is likely correct.
3.  **Refining the Object Identification**: Ensure maroon objects are correctly identified as contiguous blocks (current 4-directional seems okay).
4.  **Careful Implementation**: Re-implement the BFS logic meticulously, paying close attention to initialization, distance updates, source propagation (especially for equidistant paths), and the final coloring step based on source counts.

## Metrics Gathering

*   **Color Palette:** The transformed output failed to produce any White (0) pixels, incorrectly coloring all originally white pixels. The expected output correctly preserves some white pixels.
*   **White Pixels:** The most glaring error is that *all* 153 pixels that should have remained white (0) were incorrectly colored green (3) or blue (1) by the transformation function. This suggests the distance calculation or the BFS termination condition is wrong, causing it to "reach" and color every background pixel.
*   **Green/Blue Pixels:** While some green and blue pixels were placed correctly, the vast majority were incorrect (179 wrongly green, 21 wrongly blue). Many pixels that should have been blue ended up green (e.g., pixel (12,15)), and vice-versa, or pixels that should have been white became colored.
*   **Specific Pixels:** The top-left corner (0,0), far from any maroon object, should be white (0) but became green (3). Pixel (9,1) should be white (0) but became blue (1). Pixel (12,15) should be blue (1) but became green (3). This points to errors in both distance calculation (affecting which object(s) are deemed closest) and potentially the BFS propagation extent.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The previous BFS implementation incorrectly expands to fill the entire grid and miscalculates the closest source(s) for many pixels. The logic needs fundamental revision, likely starting with a multi-source BFS originating *from* the maroon pixels and using 8-directional distance.

task_name: e433a3f3
description: Color white background pixels based on proximity to distinct maroon rectangular objects.
priors:
    - Objectness: Input contains distinct maroon (9) rectangular objects on a white (0) background. These objects persist unchanged in the output.
    - Geometry & Topology: The transformation depends on the spatial relationship (proximity) between background pixels and the maroon objects. Adjacency (8-directional/Chebyshev) seems relevant for defining proximity.
    - Colors:
        - Input: White (0), Maroon (9)
        - Output: White (0), Blue (1), Green (3), Maroon (9)

observations:
    - input_grid: Contains a white (0) background and one or more distinct, non-overlapping, rectangular objects of maroon (9) color.
    - output_grid:
        - Maroon (9) pixels from the input remain unchanged.
        - White (0) pixels from the input are transformed based on proximity to the maroon objects.
        - Some white (0) pixels remain white (0) if they are sufficiently "far" from any maroon object.
        - White (0) pixels closest to exactly one maroon object become green (3).
        - White (0) pixels equidistant from two or more maroon objects become blue (1).
    - distance_metric: The boundaries between colored regions (green/blue) suggest that distance is measured using 8-directional (Chebyshev) adjacency. A pixel (x, y) is distance 1 from a maroon object if any of its 8 neighbors is part of that object.
    - algorithm_intuition: The process resembles creating a Voronoi diagram where the maroon objects are the sites. Green regions are the Voronoi cells for single objects, and blue regions are the boundaries equidistant from multiple objects.

derived_facts:
    - Transformation acts only on white (0) pixels.
    - Transformation preserves maroon (9) pixels.
    - Coloring (green/blue) depends on the count of the *nearest* distinct maroon objects.
    - A multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all maroon pixels simultaneously seems appropriate.
    - The BFS should calculate the shortest distance (in 8-directional steps) from each white pixel to any maroon pixel.
    - The BFS must also track the set of source object IDs corresponding to the shortest paths found so far for each pixel.

potential_challenges:
    - Correctly implementing the multi-source BFS, especially handling distance updates and source set merging for equidistant paths.
    - Ensuring the BFS correctly terminates and doesn't color pixels that should remain white (those potentially infinitely far if the grid were unbounded, or simply not reached if the grid is finite but large). Need to handle `distance == infinity`.
    - Accurately identifying the distinct maroon objects and assigning unique IDs.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects**: Find all distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid using 4-directional adjacency. Assign a unique ID to each distinct maroon object.
2.  **Initialize Distance Calculation**: Create helper grids:
    *   `distance_grid`: Same dimensions as input, initialized to infinity for all cells.
    *   `source_grid`: Same dimensions, each cell initialized with an empty set to store the IDs of the nearest object(s).
    *   `output_grid`: Initialize as a copy of the input grid.
3.  **Prepare Multi-Source BFS**: Create a queue for the Breadth-First Search. For every pixel `(r, c)` that is part of a maroon object with ID `obj_id`:
    *   Set `distance_grid[r, c] = 0`.
    *   Add `obj_id` to `source_grid[r, c]`.
    *   Add the coordinate `(r, c)` to the BFS queue.
4.  **Execute Multi-Source BFS**: While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`. Let `d = distance_grid[r, c]` and `sources = source_grid[r, c]`.
    *   For each of the 8 neighbors `(nr, nc)` of `(r, c)` (including diagonals):
        *   If `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries:
            *   Calculate the potential new distance: `new_dist = d + 1`.
            *   Compare `new_dist` with `distance_grid[nr, nc]`:
                *   If `new_dist < distance_grid[nr, nc]`:
                    *   This is a shorter path found.
                    *   Update `distance_grid[nr, nc] = new_dist`.
                    *   Replace `source_grid[nr, nc]` with a copy of `sources`.
                    *   Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
                *   If `new_dist == distance_grid[nr, nc]`:
                    *   This is an alternative path of the same shortest distance.
                    *   Update `source_grid[nr, nc]` by adding all object IDs from `sources` (set union).
                    *   Do *not* re-enqueue `(nr, nc)` if it has already been processed at this distance level (standard BFS optimization often handles this implicitly by visiting states).
5.  **Color Output Grid**: Iterate through every pixel `(r, c)` of the grid:
    *   If the original pixel `input_grid[r, c]` was white (0) AND `distance_grid[r, c]` is finite (meaning it was reached by the BFS):
        *   Let `num_sources = len(source_grid[r, c])`.
        *   If `num_sources == 1`: Set `output_grid[r, c] = 3` (Green).
        *   If `num_sources > 1`: Set `output_grid[r, c] = 1` (Blue).
    *   Otherwise (if the pixel was originally maroon (9) or was white but never reached by the BFS), keep the color from the `output_grid` (which was initialized as a copy of the input).
6.  **Return**: Return the final `output_grid`.
