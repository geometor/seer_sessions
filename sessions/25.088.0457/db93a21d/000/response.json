The shapes can be of different sizes and positions.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The maroon shapes from the input persist in the output. New colors, green (3) and blue (1), are introduced.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves modifying the white space around and between the maroon shapes.\n4.  **Green Pixels (3):** Appear to form paths or regions associated with individual maroon shapes. They form an immediate 1-pixel border (including diagonals) around each maroon shape. They also fill areas that are closest to only one maroon shape.\n5.  **Blue Pixels (1):** Appear in areas that are somehow \"between\" or equidistant from multiple maroon shapes.\n6.  **Process:** The core process seems to be identifying the maroon shapes, creating borders or zones around them, and then filling the remaining space based on proximity or connectivity to these initial shapes/zones. Pixels equidistant from multiple shapes become blue, while pixels closer to only one shape become green.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Assign a unique ID to each object.\n3.  Create helper grids: `distance` (initialized to infinity for white pixels, -1 for maroon pixels) and `sources` (initialized as an empty set for each pixel).\n4.  Initialize a queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n5.  Perform an initial scan of the grid:\n    a.  For each white pixel (0) `(r, c)`:\n        i.  Check its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).\n        ii. Collect the unique IDs of all neighboring maroon objects.\n        iii. If there are neighboring maroon objects:\n            1.  Set `distance[r][c] = 1`.\n            2.  Add the collected maroon object IDs to `sources[r][c]`.\n            3.  Add `(r, c)` to the BFS queue.\n6.  Perform a BFS expansion starting from the pixels added in step 5:\n    a.  While the queue is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a pixel `(r, c)`. Let `d = distance[r][c]`.\n        ii. For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` (8 directions) of `(r, c)`:\n            1.  If `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds:\n                a.  If `distance[nr][nc]` is infinity (unvisited white pixel not adjacent to maroon):\n                    *   Set `distance[nr][nc] = d + 1`.\n                    *   Set `sources[nr][nc] = sources[r][c]`.\n                    *   Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.\n                b.  Else if `distance[nr][nc] == d + 1` (reached at the same expansion step via another path):\n                    *   Update `sources[nr][nc]` by taking the union with `sources[r][c]`.\n7.  Finalize the output grid colors based on the `sources` information:\n    a.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)`:\n        i.  If `distance[r][c]` is finite and greater than or equal to 1 (meaning it was an originally white pixel reached by the expansion):\n            1.  If the number of unique object IDs in `sources[r][c]` is 1, set `output[r][c]` to green (3).\n            2.  If the number of unique object IDs in `sources[r][c]` is greater than 1, set `output[r][c]` to blue (1).\n        ii. Maroon pixels remain maroon.\n        iii. White pixels unreachable by the expansion remain white (0).\n8.  Return the finalized output grid."
