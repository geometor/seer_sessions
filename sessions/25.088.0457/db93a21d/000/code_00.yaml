task_description: Modifies the background pixels based on their proximity to multiple maroon rectangular objects.
elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input/output
    background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    role: primary
    description: Rectangular blocks of maroon pixels (9).
    count: variable (1 or more per input)
    properties:
      - color: maroon (9)
      - shape: rectangle
      - size: variable
      - position: variable
  - type: pixel_color
    role: modification
    color: green (3)
    description: Used to border maroon objects and fill areas closest to a single maroon object.
  - type: pixel_color
    role: modification
    color: blue (1)
    description: Used to fill areas equidistant from multiple maroon objects.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: maroon objects in the input grid.
  - action: preserve
    target: original maroon objects in the output grid.
  - action: calculate_proximity
    description: Determine the relationship (closest source) of each white pixel to the initial maroon objects. This calculation considers adjacency, including diagonals.
  - action: color_pixels
    source: white pixels
    target: output grid pixels
    rules:
      - condition: White pixel is adjacent (including diagonally) to exactly one source maroon object.
        result: Color the pixel green (3).
      - condition: White pixel is adjacent (including diagonally) to multiple source maroon objects.
        result: Color the pixel blue (1).
      - condition: White pixel is not adjacent to any maroon object, but is reachable via a path of pixels where all pixels on the path are closer to one specific maroon object than any other.
        result: Color the pixel green (3).
      - condition: White pixel is not adjacent to any maroon object, but lies on a boundary or region where it is equidistant from two or more maroon objects when considering paths through previously white space.
        result: Color the pixel blue (1).
relationships:
  - type: proximity
    from: white pixels
    to: maroon objects
    influence: Determines the output color (green or blue) of the originally white pixels. Pixels equidistant from multiple maroon objects become blue; otherwise, they become green if they are influenced by any object. Diagonal adjacency matters.
