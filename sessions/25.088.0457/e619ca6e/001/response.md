"""
Identifies initial green (3) rectangular objects in the input grid.
Iteratively places copies of these objects diagonally downwards.
A copy of an object with top-left (r, c) and width w is potentially placed at:
1. (r + 2, c - w)
2. (r + 2, c + w)
Placement only occurs if the new object fits entirely within the grid boundaries
and the top-left position hasn't been used for a placed object before.
The process continues from newly placed objects until no more valid placements can be made.
