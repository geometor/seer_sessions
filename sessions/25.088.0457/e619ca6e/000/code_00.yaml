elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - size: variable (consistent between input and output for each example)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - shape: rectangle
      - contiguity: contiguous block of pixels
      - quantity: one or more in the input
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: green rectangular objects
    origin: input grid
  - action: copy
    source: identified green objects
    destination: output grid
  - action: place
    target: copied objects
    rules:
      - relative_position:
          - offset_rows: +2
          - offset_cols: -width (of the object)
      - relative_position:
          - offset_rows: +2
          - offset_cols: +width (of the object)
    constraints:
      - must fit entirely within grid boundaries
    iteration: apply placement rules recursively/iteratively to newly placed copies
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: original green object
    to: generated copies (share shape, color, width, height)
  - type: spatial
    between: an object and its direct descendants
    details: fixed diagonal offsets (down 2, left/right by width)
