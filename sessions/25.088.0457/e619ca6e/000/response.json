            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The grids vary in size across examples but maintain their dimensions from input to output. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain one or more rectangular objects composed entirely of green (3) pixels. These objects can have different dimensions (height and width).\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid always contains the original green objects from the input. Additionally, multiple copies of these original objects appear in the output grid.\n4.  **Copy Placement:** The copies are generated based on the original objects. The pattern seems to involve placing new copies diagonally downwards from existing ones. Specifically, from an object's top-left corner at (row, col) with width `w`, new copies appear to be attempted at (row + 2, col - w) and (row + 2, col + w).\n5.  **Iteration/Recursion:** This copy generation process seems to repeat for the newly placed copies as well, branching outwards and downwards.\n6.  **Boundaries:** The generation stops when placing a copy would extend beyond the grid boundaries.\n7.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and color of the copied objects are identical to the original object they derive from.\n8.  **Overlap:** If generated copies overlap, the green color simply overwrites the background or other green pixels; there's no color mixing or special interaction beyond overwriting.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct, contiguous green rectangular objects present in the input grid.\n3.  For each distinct initial green object:\n    a.  Determine its dimensions (height `h`, width `w`) and its initial top-left position (row `r`, column `c`).\n    b.  Create a list or queue of positions to process, initially containing only the starting position `(r, c)`.\n    c.  Create a set to keep track of the top-left positions where copies of this specific object shape have already been placed or processed to avoid redundant generation. Add `(r, c)` to this set.\n    d.  While the list/queue of positions to process is not empty:\n        i.  Dequeue a position `(current_r, current_c)`.\n        ii. Calculate two potential next top-left positions:\n            - `pos1 = (current_r + 2, current_c - w)`\n            - `pos2 = (current_r + 2, current_c + w)`\n        iii. For `pos1`:\n            - Check if `pos1` is within the grid boundaries ( `pos1.row >= 0` and `pos1.col >= 0`).\n            - Check if the entire object placed at `pos1` fits within the grid ( `pos1.row + h <= grid_height` and `pos1.col + w <= grid_width`).\n            - Check if `pos1` is already in the set of processed positions for this object shape.\n            - If all checks pass (within bounds, fits completely, and not already processed):\n                - Add `pos1` to the set of processed positions.\n                - Add `pos1` to the list/queue for further processing.\n                - Draw a copy of the original object onto the output grid starting at `pos1`.\n        iv. For `pos2`:\n            - Perform the same boundary, fit, and processed checks as for `pos1`.\n            - If all checks pass:\n                - Add `pos2` to the set of processed positions.\n                - Add `pos2` to the list/queue for further processing.\n                - Draw a copy of the original object onto the output grid starting at `pos2`.\n4.  Return the modified output grid containing the original objects and all generated copies."
