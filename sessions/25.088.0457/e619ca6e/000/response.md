Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The grids vary in size across examples but maintain their dimensions from input to output. The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain one or more rectangular objects composed entirely of green (3) pixels. These objects can have different dimensions (height and width).
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid always contains the original green objects from the input. Additionally, multiple copies of these original objects appear in the output grid.
4.  **Copy Placement:** The copies are generated based on the original objects. The pattern seems to involve placing new copies diagonally downwards from existing ones. Specifically, from an object's top-left corner at (row, col) with width `w`, new copies appear to be attempted at (row + 2, col - w) and (row + 2, col + w).
5.  **Iteration/Recursion:** This copy generation process seems to repeat for the newly placed copies as well, branching outwards and downwards.
6.  **Boundaries:** The generation stops when placing a copy would extend beyond the grid boundaries.
7.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and color of the copied objects are identical to the original object they derive from.
8.  **Overlap:** If generated copies overlap, the green color simply overwrites the background or other green pixels; there's no color mixing or special interaction beyond overwriting.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - size: variable (consistent between input and output for each example)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - shape: rectangle
      - contiguity: contiguous block of pixels
      - quantity: one or more in the input
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: green rectangular objects
    origin: input grid
  - action: copy
    source: identified green objects
    destination: output grid
  - action: place
    target: copied objects
    rules:
      - relative_position:
          - offset_rows: +2
          - offset_cols: -width (of the object)
      - relative_position:
          - offset_rows: +2
          - offset_cols: +width (of the object)
    constraints:
      - must fit entirely within grid boundaries
    iteration: apply placement rules recursively/iteratively to newly placed copies
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: original green object
    to: generated copies (share shape, color, width, height)
  - type: spatial
    between: an object and its direct descendants
    details: fixed diagonal offsets (down 2, left/right by width)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous green rectangular objects present in the input grid.
3.  For each distinct initial green object:
    a.  Determine its dimensions (height `h`, width `w`) and its initial top-left position (row `r`, column `c`).
    b.  Create a list or queue of positions to process, initially containing only the starting position `(r, c)`.
    c.  Create a set to keep track of the top-left positions where copies of this specific object shape have already been placed or processed to avoid redundant generation. Add `(r, c)` to this set.
    d.  While the list/queue of positions to process is not empty:
        i.  Dequeue a position `(current_r, current_c)`.
        ii. Calculate two potential next top-left positions:
            - `pos1 = (current_r + 2, current_c - w)`
            - `pos2 = (current_r + 2, current_c + w)`
        iii. For `pos1`:
            - Check if `pos1` is within the grid boundaries ( `pos1.row >= 0` and `pos1.col >= 0`).
            - Check if the entire object placed at `pos1` fits within the grid ( `pos1.row + h <= grid_height` and `pos1.col + w <= grid_width`).
            - Check if `pos1` is already in the set of processed positions for this object shape.
            - If all checks pass (within bounds, fits completely, and not already processed):
                - Add `pos1` to the set of processed positions.
                - Add `pos1` to the list/queue for further processing.
                - Draw a copy of the original object onto the output grid starting at `pos1`.
        iv. For `pos2`:
            - Perform the same boundary, fit, and processed checks as for `pos1`.
            - If all checks pass:
                - Add `pos2` to the set of processed positions.
                - Add `pos2` to the list/queue for further processing.
                - Draw a copy of the original object onto the output grid starting at `pos2`.
4.  Return the modified output grid containing the original objects and all generated copies.
