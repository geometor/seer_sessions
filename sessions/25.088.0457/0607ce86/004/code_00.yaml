Task: Repair noisy repeating patterns and remove background noise.
Input: Grid containing multiple instances of a repeating pattern (block), where some pixels within the pattern instances are replaced by noise pixels (green=3). Additional noise pixels may exist outside the patterns. Background is white (0).
Output: Grid containing only the repaired instances of the repeating pattern, placed at their original locations. All other pixels (background and external noise) are set to background (white=0).

Objects:
  - Pattern Block: A rectangular subgrid of a specific size (e.g., 5x5 in Ex1, 5x7 in Ex2, 5x5 in Ex3) that repeats in the input.
  - Pattern Instance: An occurrence of the Pattern Block in the input grid.
  - Noise Pixel: A pixel with the value green (3). Noise can occur inside pattern instances (corruption) or outside (background noise).
  - Background Pixel: A pixel with the value white (0).
  - Canonical Pattern: A "clean" version of the Pattern Block derived from observing multiple instances.

Properties:
  - Pattern Block Size: The height and width of the repeating pattern. This size is consistent across all instances within a single task example.
  - Pattern Instance Location: The top-left (row, column) coordinate of each instance in the grid.
  - Canonical Pattern Content: The specific color value for each cell within the canonical pattern. Derived by finding the most frequent non-noise, non-background color at each position across all instances. If only noise/background are present, noise is chosen. If only background, background is chosen.

Actions:
  - Identify Pattern Instances: Locate all instances of the repeating Pattern Block in the input grid. This involves finding connected components of non-background pixels and identifying the dominant bounding box size.
  - Derive Canonical Pattern: Analyze all identified instances to determine the Canonical Pattern based on pixel frequency (excluding noise unless it's the only option).
  - Repair Instances: For each identified Pattern Instance from the input:
    - Compare each pixel to the corresponding pixel in the Canonical Pattern.
    - If the input pixel is noise (green=3) AND the canonical pixel is NOT noise (green=3), replace the input pixel with the canonical pixel.
    - Otherwise, keep the original input pixel.
  - Reconstruct Output: Create a new grid filled with the background color. Place the repaired Pattern Instances onto this grid at their original locations. Discard any pixels from the input that were not part of an identified Pattern Instance.

Example 1 Specifics:
  - Pattern Block Size: 5x5
  - Number of Instances: 9 (visually seems like 9 main blocks, the code's count of 12 for expected output might be wrong or splitting touching blocks?) Let's re-evaluate: visually it's a 3x3 arrangement of 5x5 blocks with 1 row/col of background between them. 9 blocks confirmed.
  - Noise Color: Green (3)
  - Background Color: White (0)

Example 2 Specifics (Based on visual inspection of grids):
  - Pattern Block Size: 5x7
  - Number of Instances: 6 (2 rows, 3 columns arrangement)
  - Noise Color: Green (3)
  - Background Color: White (0)

Example 3 Specifics (Based on visual inspection of grids):
  - Pattern Block Size: 5x5
  - Number of Instances: 9 (3x3 arrangement)
  - Noise Color: Green (3)
  - Background Color: White (0)
