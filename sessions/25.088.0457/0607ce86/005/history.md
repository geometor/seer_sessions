"""
Identifies repeating block patterns in an input grid, potentially obscured by 
noise pixels (green=3). It first identifies "core structures" by looking for 
connected components of non-background (white=0) and non-noise (green=3) pixels. 
It determines the most frequent bounding box size among these core structures. 
Then, it extracts full block instances (including any noise pixels within them) 
from the original grid at the locations corresponding to the common-sized core 
structures. A "canonical" pattern for this block size is derived by finding the 
most frequent non-noise color at each position across all instances. If only noise 
is present at a position, noise becomes the canonical color. Finally, it constructs 
an output grid containing only these block instances, placed at their original 
locations. Within each placed block, pixels that were noise (green=3) in the input 
are replaced by the corresponding canonical pixel, but only if the canonical pixel 
itself is not noise (green=3). All pixels outside the placed blocks are set to 
background (white=0).

*   **General Assessment:** The previous code attempted to identify repeating blocks, determine a canonical pattern by ignoring noise (green pixels), and then reconstruct the output by replacing noise within those blocks with the canonical version. The results clearly show this approach failed significantly on all training examples. The transformed outputs contain far fewer colored pixels than expected, indicating that either the block identification, the canonical pattern derivation, or the reconstruction logic is fundamentally flawed for this task. The core issue seems to be an overly aggressive filtering or misinterpretation of the role of the noise pixels (green=3). The expected outputs suggest that the noise pixels *within* the patterns should be repaired, while noise pixels *outside* any pattern should be removed (set to background/white=0). The structure and location of the patterns themselves are preserved.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  Re-evaluate the block identification process. Instead of excluding noise initially, find connected components of *all* non-background pixels.
    2.  Determine the most common bounding box size for these components.
    3.  Extract *all* pixels within these bounding boxes from the original input grid for components matching the common size.
    4.  Refine the canonical pattern derivation: For each position within the common block size, find the most frequent non-noise color across all extracted instances. If only noise (green=3) is present at a position across instances (or noise and background), the canonical pixel might need special handling (potentially staying noise or becoming background, needs analysis). Let's stick with the previous logic for now: most frequent non-noise, non-background; else if noise exists, use noise; else use background.
    5.  Reconstruct the output: Create a background grid. Iterate through the locations of the identified common-sized blocks. For each block instance from the *input*: if a pixel is noise (green=3), replace it with the corresponding canonical pixel *only if the canonical pixel is not noise*. Place this potentially repaired block onto the output grid. This ensures structure preservation and noise repair *within* patterns, while implicitly removing external noise.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**

    Let's analyze Example 1 Input vs. Expected Output vs. Transformed Output.

# Analyze block locations and content mismatch (visual inspection + previous run data)
# The transformed output clearly missed many blocks present in the expected output.
# It also seems to have incorrectly 'repaired' some pixels within the blocks it did place.
# For instance, row 4, col 5 should be 3 (green) in the expected output but is 1 (blue) in transformed.
# The block starting around row 8, col 8 in transformed output is shifted compared to expected (starts row 8, col 1).
# The block starting around row 14, col 14 in transformed is also shifted compared to expected (starts row 14, col 1).
# The previous code seems to have identified blocks based on 'core' structures (non-noise) which led to incorrect locations and potentially incorrect canonical patterns.
# The dominant block size in the input *including* noise appears to be (5, 5). The expected output consists entirely of (5, 5) blocks.

*   **Facts YAML:**


```yaml
Task: Repair noisy repeating patterns and remove background noise.
Input: Grid containing multiple instances of a repeating pattern (block), where some pixels within the pattern instances are replaced by noise pixels (green=3). Additional noise pixels may exist outside the patterns. Background is white (0).
Output: Grid containing only the repaired instances of the repeating pattern, placed at their original locations. All other pixels (background and external noise) are set to background (white=0).

Objects:
  - Pattern Block: A rectangular subgrid of a specific size (e.g., 5x5 in Ex1, 5x7 in Ex2, 5x5 in Ex3) that repeats in the input.
  - Pattern Instance: An occurrence of the Pattern Block in the input grid.
  - Noise Pixel: A pixel with the value green (3). Noise can occur inside pattern instances (corruption) or outside (background noise).
  - Background Pixel: A pixel with the value white (0).
  - Canonical Pattern: A "clean" version of the Pattern Block derived from observing multiple instances.

Properties:
  - Pattern Block Size: The height and width of the repeating pattern. This size is consistent across all instances within a single task example.
  - Pattern Instance Location: The top-left (row, column) coordinate of each instance in the grid.
  - Canonical Pattern Content: The specific color value for each cell within the canonical pattern. Derived by finding the most frequent non-noise, non-background color at each position across all instances. If only noise/background are present, noise is chosen. If only background, background is chosen.

Actions:
  - Identify Pattern Instances: Locate all instances of the repeating Pattern Block in the input grid. This involves finding connected components of non-background pixels and identifying the dominant bounding box size.
  - Derive Canonical Pattern: Analyze all identified instances to determine the Canonical Pattern based on pixel frequency (excluding noise unless it's the only option).
  - Repair Instances: For each identified Pattern Instance from the input:
    - Compare each pixel to the corresponding pixel in the Canonical Pattern.
    - If the input pixel is noise (green=3) AND the canonical pixel is NOT noise (green=3), replace the input pixel with the canonical pixel.
    - Otherwise, keep the original input pixel.
  - Reconstruct Output: Create a new grid filled with the background color. Place the repaired Pattern Instances onto this grid at their original locations. Discard any pixels from the input that were not part of an identified Pattern Instance.

Example 1 Specifics:
  - Pattern Block Size: 5x5
  - Number of Instances: 9 (visually seems like 9 main blocks, the code's count of 12 for expected output might be wrong or splitting touching blocks?) Let's re-evaluate: visually it's a 3x3 arrangement of 5x5 blocks with 1 row/col of background between them. 9 blocks confirmed.
  - Noise Color: Green (3)
  - Background Color: White (0)

Example 2 Specifics (Based on visual inspection of grids):
  - Pattern Block Size: 5x7
  - Number of Instances: 6 (2 rows, 3 columns arrangement)
  - Noise Color: Green (3)
  - Background Color: White (0)

Example 3 Specifics (Based on visual inspection of grids):
  - Pattern Block Size: 5x5
  - Number of Instances: 9 (3x3 arrangement)
  - Noise Color: Green (3)
  - Background Color: White (0)
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Potential Pattern Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all connected components of non-background (non-white) pixels. Treat noise pixels (green=3) as part of potential components during this step.
2.  **Determine Dominant Block Size:** Calculate the bounding box size (height, width) for each identified component. Find the most frequently occurring bounding box size; this is the `Dominant Size`.
3.  **Extract Valid Instances:** Identify all component locations whose bounding box matches the `Dominant Size`. For each such location, extract the corresponding rectangular subgrid (instance) of `Dominant Size` from the *original input grid*. Store these instances and their top-left locations.
4.  **Derive Canonical Pattern:** Create an empty pattern grid of the `Dominant Size`. For each position (row `r`, column `c`) within this size:
    a.  Collect the colors found at `(r, c)` from all extracted `Valid Instances`.
    b.  Count the frequency of each color, excluding the background color (white=0) and the noise color (green=3).
    c.  If there are any non-background, non-noise colors, set the canonical pixel at `(r, c)` to the most frequent one.
    d.  If there are no non-background, non-noise colors, check if the noise color (green=3) was present at `(r, c)` in any instance. If yes, set the canonical pixel to noise (green=3).
    e.  Otherwise (only background color was present), set the canonical pixel to the background color (white=0).
5.  **Reconstruct Output Grid:**
    a.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white=0).
    b.  Iterate through the stored `Valid Instances` and their `locations`.
    c.  For each instance and its location `(start_row, start_col)`:
        i.  Create a `Repaired Instance` by copying the `Valid Instance`.
        ii. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` within the `Repaired Instance`.
        iii. Get the original pixel value `original_pixel = Valid Instance[r, c]`.
        iv. Get the corresponding canonical pixel value `canonical_pixel = Canonical Pattern[r, c]`.
        v.  If `original_pixel` is the noise color (green=3) AND `canonical_pixel` is NOT the noise color (green=3), update the `Repaired Instance` at `(r, c)` to `canonical_pixel`.
        vi. Place the potentially modified `Repaired Instance` onto the output grid starting at `(start_row, start_col)`.
6.  **Return:** Return the reconstructed output grid.
