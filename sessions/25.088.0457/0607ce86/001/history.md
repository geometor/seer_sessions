**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct rectangular blocks composed of various colors. These blocks appear to be instances of a repeating pattern specific to each task example. The blocks are separated by white (0) pixels, acting as a background or delimiter.
2.  **Noise Element:** The color green (3) consistently appears as a "noise" element. It shows up in two ways:
    *   As scattered individual pixels outside the main block structures.
    *   As pixels *within* the block structures, seemingly deviating from the otherwise consistent pattern of the block.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the block structures from the input but appear "cleaned" or "repaired". The scattered green pixels are removed (replaced with white). The green pixels that were deviations *within* the blocks are replaced by other colors, restoring a consistent pattern across all instances of the block in the output.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to identify the canonical (ideal or intended) pattern of the repeating blocks, locate all instances of these blocks in the input, correct any internal deviations caused by the noise color (green), and filter out everything else (background and scattered noise). The canonical pattern itself might contain green pixels, which are preserved; only the *deviating* green pixels are corrected.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: object_repair_and_filtering
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: separator
  - type: noise_pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: deviation or scatter
  - type: canonical_block
    description: A specific rectangular pattern of non-white colors that repeats within the input grid, separated by background. Its size and pattern are consistent within a task but vary between tasks.
    properties:
      - size (height x width)
      - internal_pattern (specific color arrangement)
  - type: input_block_instance
    description: A rectangular region in the input grid matching the location and approximate pattern of a canonical_block, potentially containing noise_pixel deviations.
  - type: output_block_instance
    description: A rectangular region in the output grid perfectly matching the canonical_block pattern.
actions:
  - action: identify_canonical_pattern
    description: Determine the size and internal color pattern of the repeating blocks, ignoring noise deviations. This pattern can be inferred by observing the consistent structure in the output blocks or by finding the most frequent non-noise color at each position across input block instances.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - noise_color (green)
    outputs:
      - canonical_block (pattern and dimensions)
  - action: locate_block_instances
    description: Find all top-left coordinates where input_block_instances occur in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - canonical_block (dimensions)
    outputs:
      - list_of_coordinates
  - action: repair_block
    description: For a given input_block_instance, replace any internal noise_pixels (green) that deviate from the canonical_pattern with the color specified by the canonical_pattern at that position. Preserve original pixels if they are not the deviating noise color.
    inputs:
      - input_block_instance
      - canonical_pattern
      - noise_color (green)
    outputs:
      - repaired_block (matching canonical dimensions)
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid filled with the background color, then place each repaired_block onto this grid at its original coordinates.
    inputs:
      - grid_dimensions
      - background_color (white)
      - list_of_coordinates
      - list_of_repaired_blocks
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationship: The output grid is formed by identifying, repairing (by replacing deviating green pixels with the canonical color), and assembling only the canonical block structures found in the input grid, discarding all other elements.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input and output examples to identify the repeating rectangular block pattern (the "canonical block") present in the output grid. Note its dimensions (Height x Width) and the specific color pattern within it. Also, confirm that green (3) is the "noise" color, appearing as deviations or scattered pixels in the input.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all its pixels to white (0).
3.  Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid where a block of size Height x Width could start.
4.  At each coordinate (r, c), examine the corresponding Height x Width region in the *output* example grid. If this region is *not* entirely white (0), it signifies the location of a canonical block instance.
5.  For each such identified location (r, c):
    a.  Extract the Height x Width subgrid from the *input* grid starting at (r, c). Let this be `input_subgrid`.
    b.  Extract the Height x Width subgrid from the *output* example grid starting at (r, c). This represents the `canonical_pattern` for this block.
    c.  Create a new `repaired_subgrid` of size Height x Width.
    d.  Iterate through each cell (`i`, `j`) within the Height x Width dimensions (from `0` to `Height-1` and `0` to `Width-1`):
        i.  Get the pixel value from the input: `input_pixel = input_subgrid[i][j]`.
        ii. Get the corresponding pixel value from the canonical pattern: `canonical_pixel = canonical_pattern[i][j]`.
        iii. If `input_pixel` is green (3) AND `input_pixel` is different from `canonical_pixel`, set `repaired_subgrid[i][j] = canonical_pixel`.
        iv. Otherwise (if `input_pixel` is not green, or if it is green but matches the `canonical_pixel`), set `repaired_subgrid[i][j] = input_pixel`.
    e.  Copy the `repaired_subgrid` onto the main output grid starting at position (r, c).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
