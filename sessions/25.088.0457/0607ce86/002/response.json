            "text": "Okay, the analysis confirms Hypothesis 1. The `label` function, when applied to all non-background pixels (`grid != background_color`), identifies many small, disconnected components (often single green pixels) and sometimes merges intended blocks with nearby noise. This leads to the `most_common_size` being calculated as `(1, 1)` in all three examples.\n\nThe code then proceeds to find the \"canonical pattern\" for a 1x1 block (which is just the most common non-noise single pixel color among those 1x1 blocks). It then iterates through the identified 1x1 block locations and tries to place a \"repaired\" 1x1 block (which might just be the original pixel or the canonical pixel) onto the output grid. This explains why the transformed outputs are mostly empty with just a few scattered pixels remaining - it only kept the pixels identified as 1x1 objects.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Block Identification:** The core issue is identifying the *intended* repeating blocks, ignoring the scattered noise *during* the identification phase. We should not label all non-background pixels. Instead, we should identify connected components based on colors *other* than the noise color (green=3) and background (white=0). Once potential block candidates are identified this way, we can then consider their full bounding box in the original grid (including any noise pixels within that box) for analysis.\n2.  **Canonical Pattern:** The logic for deriving the canonical pattern seems mostly okay, but it should be applied only to blocks of the most common size *identified correctly*. The rule is: for each position (r, c) within the block shape, find the most frequent *non-noise* color across all instances at that position. Use this as the canonical color. If only noise (green=3) is present at a position across all instances, the canonical color for that position should probably be green=3.\n3.  **Repair/Reconstruction:** Create an empty output grid. Identify the locations of the valid blocks (most common size, identified as per step 1). For each such location, extract the corresponding block from the *input* grid. Compare each pixel of this input block instance to the canonical pattern. If an input pixel is noise (green=3) AND the corresponding canonical pixel is *different*, replace the input pixel with the canonical pixel. Otherwise, keep the input pixel. Place this potentially repaired block onto the output grid at the correct location. All pixels outside these placed blocks should remain background (white=0).\n\nLet's refine the canonical pattern rule:\nFor a position (r, c):\n- Get all pixel values at (r, c) from valid block instances.\n- Count occurrences of each color.\n- Filter out noise color (3) counts.\n- If there are non-noise colors, the canonical color is the most frequent non-noise color.\n- If there are *only* noise colors (3), the canonical color is 3.\n- If there are *only* background colors (0) - which shouldn't happen with the proposed block identification - the canonical color is 0. (This case needs careful handling depending on identification method).\n- If there are noise and background colors, but no other colors, the canonical color is 3 (most frequent if only noise exists). Needs confirmation, but seems plausible. Let's stick to \"most frequent non-noise, else noise if present, else background\".\n\nRevised Repair Rule:\nFor each valid block instance at `(R, C)` in the input:\n- For each pixel `(r, c)` within the block (relative coordinates):\n    - `input_pixel = input_grid[R+r, C+c]`\n    - `canonical_pixel = canonical_pattern[r, c]`\n    - `output_pixel = input_pixel` # Default to keeping original\n    - `if input_pixel == noise_color (3) and canonical_pixel != noise_color (3):` # Only repair noise if canonical isn't noise\n        `output_pixel = canonical_pixel`\n    - `output_grid[R+r, C+c] = output_pixel`\n\nThis seems slightly different from the original code's repair (`if input_pixel == noise_color and input_pixel != canonical_pixel:`). The key difference is whether we replace noise (3) with canonical if the canonical itself *is* 3. My revised rule says NO (if canonical is 3, keep the input 3). The original code says YES (if input is 3 and canonical is 3, `input_pixel != canonical_pixel` is false, so it also keeps the input 3). So the logic is effectively the same in that specific case. Let's refine the wording: Replace an input pixel *if and only if* it is the noise color (3) and the canonical color for that position is *not* the noise color (3).\n\n---\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because its object identification method (`scipy.ndimage.label` on all non-background pixels) was thrown off by scattered \"noise\" pixels (green=3). This led to incorrectly identifying the primary repeating objects as small 1x1 blocks, resulting in an output that discarded almost all information. The core task involves identifying larger, repeating structural units (blocks) amidst noise, determining the ideal \"prototype\" or \"canonical\" form of this block by looking across all instances, and then reconstructing the output grid using these blocks, correcting only the noise pixels within them according to the canonical form. Pixels not part of these canonical blocks (including scattered noise) should be removed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Isolate Core Structures:** Modify the object detection to focus on connected components of non-noise, non-background colors. This should better identify the repeating blocks.\n2.  **Determine Common Block:** Find the bounding box size that occurs most frequently among these core structures.\n3.  **Extract Instances:** Identify all locations where blocks matching this common size appear. Extract the full subgrids (including noise pixels) from the *original input grid* at these locations.\n4.  **Derive Canonical Pattern:** For the common block size, determine the canonical color for each position `(r, c)` by finding the most frequent non-noise color at that position across all extracted instances. If only noise (green=3) is present at `(r, c)` across all instances, the canonical color is green=3.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a background-filled output grid. Iterate through the locations of the common-sized blocks. For each block instance from the input:\n    *   Create a temporary block copy.\n    *   For each pixel `(r, c)` within the block: If the input pixel is noise (green=3) and the canonical pixel at `(r, c)` is *not* noise (green=3), replace the pixel in the temporary block with the canonical pixel.\n    *   Place the (potentially modified) temporary block onto the output grid at its original location.\n6.  Discard all other input pixels (those not part of a successfully identified and placed block).\n\n---\n**Metrics Gathering (Conceptual - using Example 1):**\n\n*   **Input:** 21x22 grid. Colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 8 (azure). Contains ~9 instances of a 6x6 block structure, plus scattered green pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** 21x22 grid. Colors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8. Contains the 9 blocks, positioned as in the input. Green pixels *within* the blocks that were considered noise are replaced by the consensus non-noise color for that position. Green pixels *outside* the blocks are removed (become white=0). Some green pixels *within* blocks might remain if green was the consensus color for that position (though unlikely in this specific task).\n*   **Previous Transformed Output:** 21x22 grid. Colors: 0, 1, 3. Almost entirely white(0). A few blue(1) and green(3) pixels remain, corresponding to locations identified as 1x1 objects.\n*   **Discrepancy:** The transformation incorrectly identified 1x1 objects instead of 6x6 blocks, leading to the removal of almost all relevant pixels.\n\n---\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Return the final output grid.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to identify repeating block patterns, determine a canonical form, and repair noise (green=3 pixels) within instances of these blocks. However, the results show that the code fails significantly on all examples. The transformed outputs are mostly empty (background color 0), indicating a fundamental issue in identifying the relevant repeating blocks.\n\nThe core problem lies in the initial object detection step (`scipy.ndimage.label(grid != background_color)`), which treats all non-background pixels equally. This includes scattered noise pixels (green=3), which either form small, independent objects or connect/alter the boundaries of the intended larger blocks. Consequently, the `find_objects` function generates bounding boxes for these noise pixels or incorrectly sized/shaped blocks, leading to `(1, 1)` being incorrectly identified as the most common block size in all provided examples. The subsequent logic, focused on 1x1 blocks, naturally fails to reconstruct the intended output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Block Identification:** Modify the object detection to specifically ignore the noise color (green=3) during the initial connected components analysis. Focus on finding connected components of *non-noise, non-background* colors first.\n2.  **Correct Bounding Box Definition:** Once core structures (without noise) are identified, determine their bounding boxes. Use the most frequent bounding box size to define the target block dimensions.\n3.  **Extract Full Instances:** Go back to the *original input grid* and extract the full rectangular subgrids corresponding to the locations and dimensions of the most frequent block size found in step 2. These extracted instances *will* contain the original noise pixels within their bounds.\n4.  **Refine Canonical Pattern Derivation:** Apply the canonical pattern logic (finding the most frequent non-noise color per position) only to the correctly extracted instances of the most common block size. Handle the case where only noise exists at a position.\n5.  **Implement Correct Repair Logic:** Reconstruct the output grid by placing potentially repaired versions of the identified block instances. Repair a pixel within an instance if and only if it is the noise color (3) *and* the corresponding canonical pixel is *not* the noise color (3). Ensure all other pixels outside these blocks are set to the background color (0).\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nUsing the tool execution from the thought process:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 21x22\n    *   Expected Output Size: 21x22\n    *   Code Identified Objects: 17\n    *   Code Identified Sizes & Counts: `Counter({(1, 1): 9, (6, 6): 1, (6, 12): 1, (14, 12): 1, (5, 11): 1, (2, 2): 1, (5, 5): 1, (1, 2): 1, (2, 1): 1})`\n    *   Code Most Common Size: `(1, 1)` (Incorrect - should be 6x6)\n    *   Number of 1x1 blocks found: 9\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 23x22\n    *   Expected Output Size: 23x22\n    *   Code Identified Objects: 17\n    *   Code Identified Sizes & Counts: `Counter({(1, 1): 11, (6, 6): 2, (7, 7): 1, (5, 7): 1, (6, 8): 1, (6, 7): 1})`\n    *   Code Most Common Size: `(1, 1)` (Incorrect - should be 6x6 based on visual inspection of expected output)\n    *   Number of 1x1 blocks found: 11\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 22x22\n    *   Expected Output Size: 22x22\n    *   Code Identified Objects: 24\n    *   Code Identified Sizes & Counts: `Counter({(1, 1): 12, (4, 5): 3, (2, 1): 2, (4, 4): 2, (5, 5): 2, (4, 6): 1, (5, 4): 1, (1, 2): 1})`\n    *   Code Most Common Size: `(1, 1)` (Incorrect - should be 4x5 based on visual inspection of expected output)\n    *   Number of 1x1 blocks found: 12\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The `label(grid != background_color)` approach consistently fails to identify the primary repeating structures due to interference from noise pixels, leading to `(1, 1)` being chosen as the most common size.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
