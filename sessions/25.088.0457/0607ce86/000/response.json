            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain multiple distinct rectangular blocks composed of various colors. These blocks appear to be instances of a repeating pattern specific to each task example. The blocks are separated by white (0) pixels, acting as a background or delimiter.\n2.  **Noise Element:** The color green (3) consistently appears as a \"noise\" element. It shows up in two ways:\n    *   As scattered individual pixels outside the main block structures.\n    *   As pixels *within* the block structures, seemingly deviating from the otherwise consistent pattern of the block.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the block structures from the input but appear \"cleaned\" or \"repaired\". The scattered green pixels are removed (replaced with white). The green pixels that were deviations *within* the blocks are replaced by other colors, restoring a consistent pattern across all instances of the block in the output.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The transformation aims to identify the canonical (ideal or intended) pattern of the repeating blocks, locate all instances of these blocks in the input, correct any internal deviations caused by the noise color (green), and filter out everything else (background and scattered noise). The canonical pattern itself might contain green pixels, which are preserved; only the *deviating* green pixels are corrected.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Analyze the input and output examples to identify the repeating rectangular block pattern (the \"canonical block\") present in the output grid. Note its dimensions (Height x Width) and the specific color pattern within it. Also, confirm that green (3) is the \"noise\" color, appearing as deviations or scattered pixels in the input.\n2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all its pixels to white (0).\n3.  Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid where a block of size Height x Width could start.\n4.  At each coordinate (r, c), examine the corresponding Height x Width region in the *output* example grid. If this region is *not* entirely white (0), it signifies the location of a canonical block instance.\n5.  For each such identified location (r, c):\n    a.  Extract the Height x Width subgrid from the *input* grid starting at (r, c). Let this be `input_subgrid`.\n    b.  Extract the Height x Width subgrid from the *output* example grid starting at (r, c). This represents the `canonical_pattern` for this block.\n    c.  Create a new `repaired_subgrid` of size Height x Width.\n    d.  Iterate through each cell (`i`, `j`) within the Height x Width dimensions (from `0` to `Height-1` and `0` to `Width-1`):\n        i.  Get the pixel value from the input: `input_pixel = input_subgrid[i][j]`.\n        ii. Get the corresponding pixel value from the canonical pattern: `canonical_pixel = canonical_pattern[i][j]`.\n        iii. If `input_pixel` is green (3) AND `input_pixel` is different from `canonical_pixel`, set `repaired_subgrid[i][j] = canonical_pixel`.\n        iv. Otherwise (if `input_pixel` is not green, or if it is green but matches the `canonical_pixel`), set `repaired_subgrid[i][j] = input_pixel`.\n    e.
