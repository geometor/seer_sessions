task_type: object_repair_and_filtering
components:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    role: separator
  - type: noise_pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: deviation or scatter
  - type: canonical_block
    description: A specific rectangular pattern of non-white colors that repeats within the input grid, separated by background. Its size and pattern are consistent within a task but vary between tasks.
    properties:
      - size (height x width)
      - internal_pattern (specific color arrangement)
  - type: input_block_instance
    description: A rectangular region in the input grid matching the location and approximate pattern of a canonical_block, potentially containing noise_pixel deviations.
  - type: output_block_instance
    description: A rectangular region in the output grid perfectly matching the canonical_block pattern.
actions:
  - action: identify_canonical_pattern
    description: Determine the size and internal color pattern of the repeating blocks, ignoring noise deviations. This pattern can be inferred by observing the consistent structure in the output blocks or by finding the most frequent non-noise color at each position across input block instances.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - noise_color (green)
    outputs:
      - canonical_block (pattern and dimensions)
  - action: locate_block_instances
    description: Find all top-left coordinates where input_block_instances occur in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - canonical_block (dimensions)
    outputs:
      - list_of_coordinates
  - action: repair_block
    description: For a given input_block_instance, replace any internal noise_pixels (green) that deviate from the canonical_pattern with the color specified by the canonical_pattern at that position. Preserve original pixels if they are not the deviating noise color.
    inputs:
      - input_block_instance
      - canonical_pattern
      - noise_color (green)
    outputs:
      - repaired_block (matching canonical dimensions)
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid filled with the background color, then place each repaired_block onto this grid at its original coordinates.
    inputs:
      - grid_dimensions
      - background_color (white)
      - list_of_coordinates
      - list_of_repaired_blocks
    outputs:
      - output_grid
relationship: The output grid is formed by identifying, repairing (by replacing deviating green pixels with the canonical color), and assembling only the canonical block structures found in the input grid, discarding all other elements.
