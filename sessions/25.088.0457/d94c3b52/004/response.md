Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying blue and azure objects, comparing their shapes, and checking for adjacency between blue objects and *any* azure pixel. The transformation logic was hypothesized as:
1.  Find all blue and azure objects and their shapes.
2.  For each blue object:
    *   If its shape matches any azure object's shape:
        *   If the blue object is adjacent to *any* azure pixel, change its color to azure (8).
        *   If the blue object is *not* adjacent to any azure pixel, change its color to orange (7).
    *   If its shape does not match any azure object's shape, keep it blue (1).

However, the results show this logic is incorrect. In all examples, the transformed output differs significantly from the expected output. Blue objects that should have turned azure (8) were turned orange (7) or vice versa, and some that should have remained blue (1) were changed incorrectly.

The core issue seems to be the conditions under which a blue object changes color and *which* color it changes to. The simple shape match and adjacency-to-any-azure-pixel rules are insufficient. We need to reconsider the relationship between a specific blue object and the azure objects, potentially focusing on the *specific* azure object it matches in shape, or perhaps a different definition of proximity or interaction.

**Strategy**

1.  **Re-analyze the examples meticulously:** Focus on individual blue objects in the input and track their transformation in the expected output.
2.  **Identify the correct trigger:** Determine precisely what characteristic (shape match, proximity, specific adjacency, etc.) causes a blue object to change color.
3.  **Identify the color determination rule:** Determine why a triggered blue object becomes azure (8) vs. orange (7). This might depend on its relationship to the *matching* azure object, not just any azure pixel.
4.  **Use code execution:** Verify object shapes, adjacencies, and counts to ensure accuracy.

**Gather Metrics**

Let's use code execution to get accurate counts and object details for each example. We'll use the `find_objects` function from the previous attempt.
