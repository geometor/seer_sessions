The output grids are identical to the input grids, except for the addition of orange pixels (7).\n\nThe transformation involves identifying pairs of azure squares that are aligned either horizontally (sharing the same two rows) or vertically (sharing the same two columns). The rectangular area lying strictly *between* such aligned pairs is then filled with orange pixels. The red squares do not participate in this interaction and remain unchanged. The filling occurs regardless of the distance between the aligned azure squares, as long as they share the same rows or columns.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
