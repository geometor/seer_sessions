"""
Identify all 2x2 azure (8) squares in the input grid.
For every pair of these squares, check if they are horizontally or vertically aligned.
If horizontally aligned (sharing the same two rows), iterate through the columns strictly between them. For each column, if the two cells in that column and the shared rows are both white (0), fill them with orange (7). Stop filling for this pair if a non-white cell is encountered.
If vertically aligned (sharing the same two columns), iterate through the rows strictly between them. For each row, if the two cells in that row and the shared columns are both white (0), fill them with orange (7). Stop filling for this pair if a non-white cell is encountered.
The original azure squares and any other pre-existing non-white colored squares remain unchanged unless explicitly overwritten by the orange filling rule described above.
