Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis was that the transformation involves filling enclosed white (0) regions, bounded by azure (8), with a fill color found elsewhere in the grid. The BFS approach aimed to identify white pixels connected to the border and fill the ones that were not connected.

The results show this logic failed significantly on all examples. The number of pixels off is large, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding or a flawed implementation of the enclosure detection.

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code filled the top-left and bottom-left enclosed white boxes, which should have remained white. It failed to fill the central "channel" area, which *should* have been filled despite being connected to the border via a path of white pixels. It correctly filled the top-right and bottom-right boxes (which contained initial fill color pixels).
*   **Example 2 & 3 Failures:** Similar patterns emerge. Enclosed white areas *without* initial fill color pixels were incorrectly filled by the code but left white in the expected output. Areas *with* initial fill color were correctly filled. Crucially, "channel" areas connected to the border were *not* filled by the code but *were* filled in the expected output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate "Enclosed":** The concept of "enclosed" might not mean "cannot reach the border via white pixels". It might relate to the context of the fill color.
2.  **Role of Initial Fill Color:** The presence of the fill color within an azure-bounded region seems crucial for deciding *if* that region gets filled.
3.  **The "Channel" Problem:** The most confusing part is filling regions demonstrably connected to the outer border (like the channels). This suggests the fill process might spread *from* the initial fill color pixels, potentially ignoring the "external connection" status for *some* pixels under specific conditions (e.g., being between filled regions or becoming surrounded).
4.  **Metrics:** Gather precise data on which pixels should be filled vs. which were identified as "enclosed" by the previous BFS method. This will clarify whether the definition of enclosure or the subsequent filling logic is the issue.

**2. Metrics Gathering**

Let's implement the BFS reachability check and analyze the pixel counts for each example.
