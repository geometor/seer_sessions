            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain the same between input and output.\n2.  **Dominant Colors:** In all examples, Azure (8) and White (0) are the dominant colors in the input. Azure seems to form outlines or structures. White fills the background and also some areas *within* the Azure structures.\n3.  **Unique Color:** Each input grid contains a third color besides White (0) and Azure (8): Magenta (6) in train_1, Yellow (4) in train_2, and Green (3) in train_3.\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary change is that certain White (0) areas in the input are filled with the unique third color (Magenta, Yellow, or Green) in the output.\n5.  **Location of Change:** The White (0) areas that get filled are those completely enclosed or surrounded by the Azure (8) pixels. White areas that are part of the background (touching the grid edges or not fully enclosed by Azure) remain unchanged.\n6.  **Role of Colors:**\n    *   White (0): Represents empty space, some of which is fillable.\n    *   Azure (8): Acts as a boundary or container wall.\n    *   Other Color (Magenta/Yellow/Green): Acts as the \"paint\" or \"fill\" color. Its presence in the input determines what color the enclosed white areas become.\n7.  **Consistency:** The Azure (8) structures and the initial pixels of the fill color remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid. The transformation is purely additive, filling specific white areas.\n\n**Facts (YAML Block):**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find the unique fill color, which is the color present that is neither White (0) nor Azure (8).\n4.  Identify all contiguous regions of White (0) pixels.\n5.  For each identified White (0) region:\n    a.  Determine if the region is fully enclosed. A region is enclosed if every pixel orthogonally adjacent to the region (up, down, left, or right) is an Azure (8) pixel, or if the adjacent pixel is part of the same White (0) region. Equivalently, no pixel in the region can reach the grid's outer border by moving only through White (0) pixels.\n    b.  If a White (0) region is determined to be fully enclosed by Azure (8) pixels, change the color of all pixels within that specific region to the previously identified fill color in the copied grid.\n6.  Leave all other pixels (the Azure (8) boundaries, the original fill color pixels, and any unenclosed White (0) pixels) unchanged.\n7.  The final modified grid is the output."
