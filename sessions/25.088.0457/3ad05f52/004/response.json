            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial code implements a basic flood fill algorithm starting from the identified 'fill color' pixels and expanding into adjacent 'background' (white) pixels. The results indicate that the fill operation is not correctly constrained. In all examples, the transformed output shows the fill color spreading beyond the intended areas, often filling the entire outer background region or crossing implied boundaries. The core issue seems to be that the fill process doesn't distinguish between white pixels *inside* the azure-bounded regions (which should be filled if connected to the seed color) and white pixels *outside* these regions or in separate, unconnected compartments (which should remain white). The fill needs to be contained within the specific regions demarcated by the azure boundaries *and* connected to the initial fill color patches.\n\n*   **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    1.  Identify the boundary (azure, 8), background (white, 0), and fill colors as before.\n    2.  Identify the \"external\" background region: Perform a flood fill (BFS or DFS) starting from all white pixels located on the absolute border of the grid. Mark all reachable white pixels from these starting points as 'external' or 'unfillable'.\n    3.  Perform the main flood fill: Start a BFS from the initial fill-color pixels ('seeds').\n    4.  During the main BFS, only fill adjacent white pixels if they are *not* marked as 'external'/'unfillable' and have not already been visited/filled in this step. The fill should naturally stop at azure boundaries because they are not the background color.\n    5.  This two-stage process ensures that the fill operation respects both the explicit azure boundaries and the implicit boundary between the enclosed areas and the outer grid background.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    Let's analyze the color counts for Example 1 to illustrate the issue.\n    Fill Color: Magenta (6)\n    Boundary Color: Azure (8)\n    Background Color: White (0)\n"
