Identify the boundary color (Azure, 8), the background color (White, 0), and the fill color (the single color present in the input grid that is neither White nor Azure).\n2. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n3. Find all pixels in the input grid that initially have the fill color. These locations act as \"seeds\" for the fill operation.\n4. Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) and add all seed locations to it.\n5. Initialize a 'visited' set or boolean array to keep track of pixels added to the queue or processed, initially containing the seed locations. Mark the seed locations as the fill color in the output grid (they already are, but this ensures consistency).\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue a pixel location (r, c).\n    b. Check its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    c. For each neighbor (nr, nc):\n        i. Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.\n        ii. Check if the neighbor's color in the *input* grid is the background color (White, 0).\n        iii. Check if the neighbor has *not* been visited yet.\n        iv. If all conditions are met:\n            - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n            - Change the neighbor's color in the *output* grid to the fill color.\n            - Enqueue the neighbor's location (nr, nc).\n7. Return the modified output grid.\n\nThis process effectively performs a flood fill starting from all initial fill color pixels, spreading only to adjacent white pixels and stopping at azure boundaries (because the check in 6.c.ii fails for azure pixels) or other non-white pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills white regions adjacent to existing fill-color pixels within azure boundaries.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # --- Identify boundary, background, and fill colors ---\n    boundary_color = 8 # Azure\n    background_color = 0 # White\n    \n    # Find the unique fill color (not 0 or 8)\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    fill_color = -1 # Initialize with an invalid color\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        if color != background_color and color != boundary_color:\n            fill_color = color\n            break\n    \n    # If no specific fill color is found besides white and azure, \n    # there might be nothing to fill, return the original grid.\n    # (Examples show a fill color is always present when changes occur).\n    if fill_color == -1:\n        # Check if any white pixels exist at all.
