Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all White (0) pixels located on the absolute border (edges) of the grid.\n    b. Mark all reachable White (0) pixels during this BFS as 'external'.\n4.  **Identify and Process Internal Regions:**\n    a. Initialize a 'visited' tracker (e.g., a boolean grid) to keep track of pixels already processed or part of the boundary/external region. Mark all Azure (8) pixels and all identified 'external' White (0) pixels as initially visited.\n    b. Iterate through every pixel (r, c) of the grid.\n    c. If the pixel (r, c) has *not* been visited:\n        i.  Start a new BFS/region discovery from this pixel. This signifies the beginning of a distinct internal region.\n        ii. Initialize an empty list `current_region_pixels` to store the coordinates of all pixels belonging to this region.\n        iii. Initialize `region_fill_color` to `None`. This variable will store the non-White, non-Azure color found within the region, if any.\n        iv. Add the starting pixel (r, c) to the BFS queue, mark it as visited, and add it to `current_region_pixels`. Check its color and update `region_fill_color` if it's a potential fill color.\n        v.  While the BFS queue for this region is not empty:\n            *   Dequeue a pixel `(curr_r, curr_c)`.\n            *   Explore its orthogonal neighbors `(nr, nc)`.\n            *   For each valid neighbor (within bounds, not boundary color 8, and not visited):\n                *   Mark the neighbor as visited.\n                *   Enqueue the neighbor.\n                *   Add the neighbor's coordinates `(nr, nc)` to `current_region_pixels`.\n                *   Check the neighbor's color in the *input* grid. If it's neither White (0) nor Azure (8), set `region_fill_color` to this color. (It's assumed only one such color exists per region).\n        vi. After the BFS for the region is complete: If `region_fill_color` is not `None`:\n            *   Iterate through all pixels `(pr, pc)` recorded in `current_region_pixels`.\n            *   If the pixel at `(pr, pc)` in the *original input grid* was White (0), change the color of the corresponding pixel in the `output_grid` to `region_fill_color`.\n5.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills internal white regions based on the presence of a non-background, non-boundary color within that region.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # --- Define colors ---\n    boundary_color = 8 # Azure\n    background_color = 0 # White\n\n    # --- 1.
