Transformation Rule:

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid, which will become the output grid.
2.  **Identify Colors:** Determine the boundary color (Azure, 8), the background color (White, 0), and the fill color (the unique color present that is neither White nor Azure).
3.  **Identify External White Pixels:**
    a. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all White (0) pixels located on the absolute border (edges) of the grid.
    b. Mark all reachable White (0) pixels during this BFS as 'external'. These are the white pixels connected to the outside of any Azure (8) boundaries.
4.  **Identify Fill Seeds:** Find all pixels in the input grid that initially have the fill color.
5.  **Perform Internal Flood Fill:**
    a. Perform a second BFS starting from the identified 'fill seed' pixels.
    b. During this BFS, explore adjacent pixels.
    c. If an adjacent pixel is White (0) in the input grid, has *not* been visited by *this* fill BFS, AND was *not* marked as 'external' in step 3:
        i. Change its color to the fill color in the output grid.
        ii. Mark it as visited for the fill BFS.
        iii. Add it to the fill BFS queue.
    d. This fill process stops at Azure (8) boundaries (as they are not White 0) and at the boundary between internal and external white pixels.
6.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the core concept of a flood fill constrained by boundaries (Azure, 8) and limited to "internal" regions (not connected to the outer White, 0 background). However, it failed because it assumed the fill should only originate *directly* from the initial pixels of the fill color (Magenta 6, Yellow 4, Green 3).

The results show that the fill operation should apply to *all* White pixels within a contained region if *any* part of that region contains the fill color. The fill isn't just spreading *from* the initial color seeds but rather uses the presence of a seed color within a bounded area as a trigger to color *all* background (White) pixels within that *same* bounded area.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify External Space:** Keep the initial BFS to identify all White (0) pixels connected to the grid border. These are "external".
2.  **Identify Internal Regions:** Find all connected components (regions) consisting of pixels that are *not* boundary (Azure 8) and *not* external White (0). Use a second BFS or similar component labeling algorithm for this.
3.  **Analyze and Fill Regions:** For each identified internal region:
    *   Check if it contains any non-White (0) pixels.
    *   If yes, identify this non-White color as the `region_fill_color`.
    *   Change *all* White (0) pixels within this specific region to the `region_fill_color`.
    *   If an internal region contains only White (0) pixels (besides being bounded by Azure 8), it remains unchanged.

**2. Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze the color counts for Example 1 to illustrate the discrepancy.

*   **Input (Example 1):** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6)
*   **Expected Output (Example 1):** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6)
*   **Transformed Output (Example 1):** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6)

Example 1 Counts:
Input:          {np.int64(0): np.int64(446), np.int64(6): np.int64(18), np.int64(8): np.int64(108)}
Expected Output: {np.int64(0): np.int64(353), np.int64(6): np.int64(111), np.int64(8): np.int64(108)}
Transformed Output: {np.int64(0): np.int64(446), np.int64(6): np.int64(18), np.int64(8): np.int64(108)}

Difference (Expected - Transformed):
White (0) pixels: -93
Magenta (6) pixels: 93

```
**Interpretation of Metrics (Example 1):**

*   The `Input` grid has 446 White (0), 108 Azure (8), and 18 Magenta (6) pixels.
*   The `Expected Output` should have 353 White (0), 108 Azure (8), and 111 Magenta (6) pixels. This means 446 - 353 = 93 White pixels should be converted to Magenta. The total Magenta pixels become 18 (original) + 93 (filled) = 111.
*   The `Transformed Output` (from the previous code) has *exactly the same counts* as the `Input`. It failed to convert *any* White pixels to Magenta.
*   The difference calculation confirms this: the transformed output has 93 *more* White pixels and 93 *fewer* Magenta pixels than expected.

This pattern holds for Examples 2 and 3 as well – the previous code did not perform the required fill transformation correctly because its fill logic was too limited.

**3. Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Flood fill internal regions based on the presence of a non-background, non-boundary color.

grid_properties:
  height: variable (1-30)
  width: variable (1-30)
  colors: 0-9 integer values

color_roles:
  - color_value: 0
    color_name: White
    role: Background, fillable area
  - color_value: 8
    color_name: Azure
    role: Impassable boundary
  - color_value: variable (e.g., 6 Magenta, 4 Yellow, 3 Green)
    color_name: variable
    role: Fill Color Seed, determines the color to fill with
  - color_value: other (any color not 0 or 8 or the seed color)
    color_name: other
    role: Not observed in these examples, but potentially part of internal regions (treated like fill seeds?) - Assume only one non-0, non-8 color per grid for now.

objects:
  - name: Grid
    type: 2D array of pixels
  - name: Boundary Wall
    type: Contiguous regions of Azure (8) pixels. Can be closed loops or run to the edge.
  - name: External Region
    type: Contiguous region of White (0) pixels connected to the grid border.
  - name: Internal Region
    type: Contiguous region of non-Azure (8) pixels completely enclosed by Boundary Walls and/or the grid border, and not part of the External Region. Can contain White (0) pixels and potentially one other color (the Fill Color Seed).

actions:
  - name: Identify External White Pixels
    input: Input Grid
    output: Set of coordinates for external White (0) pixels
    description: Perform a BFS/flood fill starting from all White (0) pixels on the grid edges.
  - name: Identify Internal Regions
    input: Input Grid, Set of external White pixels
    output: List of Sets of coordinates, where each set represents one internal region.
    description: Find connected components of pixels that are NOT Azure (8) and NOT in the external set. Use BFS/DFS or a labeling algorithm.
  - name: Determine Region Fill Color
    input: An Internal Region (set of coordinates), Input Grid
    output: Fill color (integer) or None
    description: Check pixels within the region. If any pixel has a color other than White (0) (and is not Azure 8), return that color. Assume only one such color exists per region. If only White (0) exists, return None.
  - name: Fill Region
    input: An Internal Region (set of coordinates), Fill Color, Output Grid
    output: Modified Output Grid
    description: Iterate through all coordinates in the region. If the pixel at a coordinate in the Output Grid is White (0), change it to the Fill Color.

transformation_goal: To fill all White (0) pixels within each distinct internal region, using the color of the non-White (0), non-Azure (8) pixel found within that same region as the fill color. If an internal region contains only White (0), it remains unchanged.
```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Identify Boundary and Background:** Define the boundary color as Azure (8) and the background color as White (0).
3.  **Identify External White Region:**
    a. Start a search (e.g., BFS) from all White (0) pixels located on the absolute border (edges) of the grid.
    b. Mark all reachable White (0) pixels during this search as 'external'. Keep track of these visited external coordinates.
4.  **Identify and Process Internal Regions:**
    a. Initialize a 'visited' grid or set to keep track of pixels already assigned to an internal region or processed. Mark all Azure (8) pixels and all 'external' White (0) pixels as visited initially.
    b. Iterate through every pixel (row `r`, column `c`) of the grid.
    c. If the pixel `(r, c)` has *not* been visited:
        i. This pixel is the start of a new potential internal region.
        ii. Initialize an empty list `current_region_pixels` to store coordinates of this region.
        iii. Initialize a variable `region_fill_color` to `None`.
        iv. Start a search (e.g., BFS) from `(r, c)`:
            *   Add `(r, c)` to the search queue and mark it as visited.
            *   Add `(r, c)` to `current_region_pixels`.
            *   If the color of `grid[r, c]` is not White (0) (and not Azure 8, which is already excluded), set `region_fill_color` to `grid[r, c]`.
            *   While the search queue is not empty:
                *   Dequeue a pixel `(curr_r, curr_c)`.
                *   Explore its neighbors `(nr, nc)`.
                *   If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds, is *not* Azure (8), and has *not* been visited:
                    *   Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited.
                    *   Add `(nr, nc)` to the search queue.
                    *   Add `(nr, nc)` to `current_region_pixels`.
                    *   If the color `grid[nr, nc]` is not White (0), set `region_fill_color` to `grid[nr, nc]` (overwriting if necessary, assuming only one fill color per region).
        v. After the search completes for this region: If `region_fill_color` is not `None` (meaning a non-White, non-Azure color was found within the region):
            *   Iterate through all coordinates `(pr, pc)` in `current_region_pixels`.
            *   If the original `input_grid[pr, pc]` was White (0), set the `output_grid[pr, pc]` to `region_fill_color`.
5.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
