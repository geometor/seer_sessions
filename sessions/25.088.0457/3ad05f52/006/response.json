            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n**1. General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concept of a flood fill constrained by boundaries (Azure, 8) and limited to \"internal\" regions (not connected to the outer White, 0 background). However, it failed because it assumed the fill should only originate *directly* from the initial pixels of the fill color (Magenta 6, Yellow 4, Green 3).\n\nThe results show that the fill operation should apply to *all* White pixels within a contained region if *any* part of that region contains the fill color. The fill isn't just spreading *from* the initial color seeds but rather uses the presence of a seed color within a bounded area as a trigger to color *all* background (White) pixels within that *same* bounded area.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify External Space:** Keep the initial BFS to identify all White (0) pixels connected to the grid border. These are \"external\".\n2.  **Identify Internal Regions:** Find all connected components (regions) consisting of pixels that are *not* boundary (Azure 8) and *not* external White (0). Use a second BFS or similar component labeling algorithm for this.\n3.  **Analyze and Fill Regions:** For each identified internal region:\n    *   Check if it contains any non-White (0) pixels.\n    *   If yes, identify this non-White color as the `region_fill_color`.\n    *   Change *all* White (0) pixels within this specific region to the `region_fill_color`.\n    *   If an internal region contains only White (0) pixels (besides being bounded by Azure 8), it remains unchanged.\n\n**2. Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's analyze the color counts for Example 1 to illustrate the discrepancy.\n\n*   **Input (Example 1):** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6)\n*   **Expected Output (Example 1):** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6)\n*   **Transformed Output (Example 1):** White (0), Azure (8), Magenta (6)\n\n"
