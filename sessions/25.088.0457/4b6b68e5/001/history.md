*   **Perception:** The input grids contain multiple distinct objects, primarily defined by contiguous areas of a single non-white color forming potential boundaries. Inside these boundaries, there are often white pixels (0) mixed with pixels of various other colors. The transformation involves identifying closed boundaries and filling the area enclosed by them. The fill color is determined by the content originally inside the boundary. Shapes that do not form a closed boundary are left unchanged. The background white pixels and pixels outside any shape boundary remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Objects:
      - name: Grid
        properties:
          - 2D array of pixels
          - pixels have colors (0-9)
      - name: Shape
        properties:
          - contiguous area of a single non-white color (BoundaryColor)
          - can be closed or open
      - name: Boundary
        properties:
          - pixels belonging to a Shape
      - name: InteriorRegion
        properties:
          - pixels enclosed by a closed Shape's Boundary
          - not part of the Boundary itself
          - not reachable from the grid edge by white pixels without crossing the Boundary
      - name: InteriorPixel
        properties:
          - a pixel within an InteriorRegion
          - color (can be white or any other color except the BoundaryColor initially)
      - name: MarkerPixel
        properties:
          - non-white, non-BoundaryColor pixel within an InteriorRegion
    Relationships:
      - A Shape encloses an InteriorRegion if it is closed.
      - An InteriorRegion contains InteriorPixels.
      - InteriorPixels can include MarkerPixels and white pixels.
    Actions:
      - Identify: Find all Shapes (contiguous non-white areas).
      - Classify: Determine if a Shape is closed (encloses an InteriorRegion).
      - Analyze: For each closed Shape, examine its InteriorRegion.
      - Count: Count the frequency of each MarkerPixel color within the InteriorRegion.
      - DetermineFill: Identify the most frequent MarkerPixel color (FillColor).
      - Fill: Change the color of all InteriorPixels (both original white and MarkerPixels) within the closed Shape's InteriorRegion to the determined FillColor.
      - Preserve: Keep Boundary pixels, pixels outside any closed shape, and pixels inside open shapes unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify all distinct contiguous shapes formed by single non-white colors in the input grid. These are potential boundaries.
    3.  For each identified shape:
        a.  Determine if the shape forms a closed boundary, enclosing an interior region. An interior region consists of pixels not belonging to the boundary itself and not connected to the main background (white pixels touching the grid edges) without crossing the boundary.
        b.  If the shape is closed:
            i.  Identify all pixels within the enclosed interior region.
            ii. Collect all non-white pixels within this interior region that are *not* the boundary color.
            iii. If no such non-white interior pixels exist, proceed to the next shape.
            iv. Otherwise, count the frequency of each color among these collected pixels.
            v.  Determine the `FillColor` which is the color with the highest frequency. (If there's a tie in frequency, the rule isn't explicitly defined by examples, but assume a default like picking the lowest color index or the first encountered.)
            vi. Iterate through all pixels identified in step 3.b.i (the entire interior region) and change their color in the output grid to the `FillColor`.
        c.  If the shape is not closed, make no changes related to this shape in the output grid.
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
