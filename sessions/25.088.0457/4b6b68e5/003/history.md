"""
Identifies closed shapes formed by a single non-white color (boundary color).
For each closed shape, it finds the region enclosed within it (interior region).
It then identifies all non-white pixels within the interior region that are *not* the boundary color (marker pixels).
If marker pixels exist, it determines the most frequent color among them. If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the highest numerical value is chosen.
Finally, it fills the entire interior region (including original white pixels and marker pixels) with this determined fill color.
Pixels belonging to the boundary, pixels outside any closed shape, and pixels inside shapes that are not closed remain unchanged.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly implemented the core logic described initially: finding closed shapes, identifying internal markers, determining the most frequent marker color (with tie-breaking), and filling the interior. However, it failed on Examples 1 and 2.

The key insight from analyzing the failures is the handling of pixels *not* involved in the fill process. The expected outputs show that pixels belonging to shapes that are *not* closed (i.e., touch the grid boundary or don't fully enclose a region) and stray pixels (pixels not part of any contiguous shape boundary) are removed (set to white/0) *unless* they are part of the boundary of a *closed* shape or the filled interior of such a shape.

The previous code failed because it only modified the interior of closed shapes, leaving all other pixels (including boundaries of closed shapes, unclosed shapes, and stray pixels) unchanged from the input.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to explicitly state that only the boundaries of closed shapes and their filled interiors (if applicable) are preserved in the output, while all other pixels become white (0).

## Metrics and Analysis

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Contains a closed Red(2) shape, a closed Yellow(4) shape, an unclosed Magenta(6) shape, and several stray Green(3) and Azure(8) pixels.
*   **Red(2) Shape:** Encloses 2 Green(3) and 1 Azure(8) markers. Most frequent: Green(3).
*   **Yellow(4) Shape:** Encloses 4 Azure(8) and 1 Green(3) markers. Most frequent: Azure(8).
*   **Magenta(6) Shape:** Touches the grid edge, therefore unclosed. Contains Green(3) pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** Red(2) boundary preserved, interior filled with Green(3). Yellow(4) boundary preserved, interior filled with Azure(8). All other pixels (Magenta shape, stray pixels, original white pixels outside filled regions) are White(0).
*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Correctly filled Red and Yellow shapes but incorrectly preserved the Magenta shape and stray pixels.
*   **Error:** Pixels belonging to the unclosed Magenta shape and stray pixels were not set to White(0).

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Contains a closed Red(2) shape, a closed Blue(1) shape, an unclosed Green(3) shape, and one stray Azure(8) pixel.
*   **Red(2) Shape:** Encloses 3 Azure(8) and 1 Gray(5) markers. Most frequent: Azure(8).
*   **Blue(1) Shape:** Encloses 3 Gray(5) and 1 Azure(8) markers. Most frequent: Gray(5).
*   **Green(3) Shape:** Touches the grid edge, therefore unclosed.
*   **Expected Output:** Red(2) boundary preserved, interior filled with Azure(8). Blue(1) boundary preserved, interior filled with Gray(5). All other pixels (Green shape, stray pixel, original white pixels outside filled regions) are White(0).
*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Correctly filled Red and Blue shapes and correctly handled the unclosed Green shape (left it as is), but incorrectly preserved the stray Azure(8) pixel.
*   **Error:** The stray Azure(8) pixel was not set to White(0).

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Contains one large closed Green(3) shape.
*   **Green(3) Shape:** Encloses 3 Magenta(6), 2 Red(2), and 2 Azure(8) markers. Most frequent: Magenta(6).
*   **Expected Output:** Green(3) boundary preserved, interior filled with Magenta(6). All other pixels (original white pixels outside the filled region) are White(0).
*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Matched the expected output.
*   **Analysis:** This example worked because there were no unclosed shapes or stray pixels to handle incorrectly. The logic for closed shapes was sufficient.

      - For each closed_shape:
        - Copy its boundary pixels (using boundary_color) from input to output_grid.
        - If a fill_color was determined for this shape:
          - Fill its corresponding interior_region_pixels in output_grid with the fill_color.
      - All pixels not explicitly assigned remain white (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid to be the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous shapes formed by pixels of the same non-white color in the input grid.
3.  For each identified shape:
    a.  Determine if the shape is "closed". A shape is considered closed if it completely encloses one or more pixels, meaning those pixels cannot be reached from the outer boundary of the grid without crossing the shape itself.
    b.  If the shape is closed:
        i.  Identify all pixels forming the boundary of this shape. Copy these pixels (with their original color) to the corresponding locations in the output grid.
        ii. Identify the interior region(s) enclosed by this shape.
        iii. Examine the pixels within the interior region(s) in the *input* grid. Collect all non-white pixels whose color is *different* from the boundary color; these are the "marker" pixels.
        iv. If any marker pixels were found:
            1.  Count the occurrences of each marker color.
            2.  Determine the most frequent marker color. If there is a tie in frequency, choose the color with the highest numerical value among the tied colors. This is the "fill color".
            3.  Fill all pixels within the identified interior region(s) in the *output* grid with this determined fill color. (This includes pixels that were originally white or marker pixels in the input).
4.  Pixels belonging to shapes that were determined to be *not* closed are *not* copied to the output grid.
5.  Pixels that were not part of a closed shape's boundary and not part of an interior region that got filled remain as the background color (white, 0) in the output grid.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
