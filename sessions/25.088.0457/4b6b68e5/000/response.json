Inside these boundaries, there are often white pixels (0) mixed with pixels of various other colors. The transformation involves identifying closed boundaries and filling the area enclosed by them. The fill color is determined by the content originally inside the boundary. Shapes that do not form a closed boundary are left unchanged. The background white pixels and pixels outside any shape boundary remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
