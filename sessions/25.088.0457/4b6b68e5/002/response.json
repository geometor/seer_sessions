            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly implemented the core logic described initially: finding closed shapes, identifying internal markers, determining the most frequent marker color (with tie-breaking), and filling the interior. However, it failed on Examples 1 and 2.\n\nThe key insight from analyzing the failures is the handling of pixels *not* involved in the fill process. The expected outputs show that pixels belonging to shapes that are *not* closed (i.e., touch the grid boundary or don't fully enclose a region) and stray pixels (pixels not part of any contiguous shape boundary) are removed (set to white/0) *unless* they are part of the boundary of a *closed* shape or the filled interior of such a shape.\n\nThe previous code failed because it only modified the interior of closed shapes, leaving all other pixels (including boundaries of closed shapes, unclosed shapes, and stray pixels) unchanged from the input.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule to explicitly state that only the boundaries of closed shapes and their filled interiors (if applicable) are preserved in the output, while all other pixels become white (0).\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains a closed Red(2) shape, a closed Yellow(4) shape, an unclosed Magenta(6) shape, and several stray Green(3) and Azure(8) pixels.\n*   **Red(2) Shape:** Encloses 2 Green(3) and 1 Azure(8) markers. Most frequent: Green(3).\n*   **Yellow(4) Shape:** Encloses 4 Azure(8) and 1 Green(3) markers. Most frequent: Azure(8).\n*   **Magenta(6) Shape:** Touches the grid edge, therefore unclosed. Contains Green(3) pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** Red(2) boundary preserved, interior filled with Green(3). Yellow(4) boundary preserved, interior filled with Azure(8). All other pixels (Magenta shape, stray pixels, original white pixels outside filled regions) are White(0).\n*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Correctly filled Red and Yellow shapes but incorrectly preserved the Magenta shape and stray pixels.\n*   **Error:** Pixels belonging to the unclosed Magenta shape and stray pixels were not set to White(0).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains a closed Red(2) shape, a closed Blue(1) shape, an unclosed Green(3) shape, and one stray Azure(8) pixel.\n*   **Red(2) Shape:** Encloses 3 Azure(8) and 1 Gray(5) markers. Most frequent: Azure(8).\n*   **Blue(1) Shape:** Encloses 3 Gray(5) and 1 Azure(8) markers. Most frequent: Gray(5).\n*   **Green(3) Shape:** Touches the grid edge, therefore unclosed.\n*   **Expected Output:** Red(2) boundary preserved, interior filled with Azure(8). Blue(1) boundary preserved, interior filled with Gray(5). All other pixels (Green shape, stray pixel, original white pixels outside filled regions) are White(0).\n*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Correctly filled Red and Blue shapes and correctly handled the unclosed Green shape (left it as is), but incorrectly preserved the stray Azure(8) pixel.\n*   **Error:** The stray Azure(8) pixel was not set to White(0).\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains one large closed Green(3) shape.\n*   **Green(3) Shape:** Encloses 3 Magenta(6), 2 Red(2), and 2 Azure(8) markers. Most frequent: Magenta(6).\n*   **Expected Output:** Green(3) boundary preserved, interior filled with Magenta(6). All other pixels (original white pixels outside the filled region) are White(0).\n*   **Previous Transformed Output:** Matched the expected output.\n*   **Analysis:** This example worked because there were no unclosed shapes or stray pixels to handle incorrectly. The logic for closed shapes was sufficient.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
