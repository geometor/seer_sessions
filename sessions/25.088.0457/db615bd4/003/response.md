Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify the background color (most frequent) and pattern color (second most frequent) in the input grid.
2.  Find all 'marker pixels' whose colors are neither the background nor the pattern color.
3.  Group the locations of these marker pixels by their color.
4.  For each group of marker pixels of the same color:
    a.  Determine the bounding box (minimum/maximum row and column) enclosing all markers in that group.
    b.  Iterate through all cells within this bounding box.
    c.  If a cell within the bounding box originally contained the background color, change its color in the output grid to the marker color of the current group.
    d.  Cells originally containing the pattern color or other marker colors within the bounding box remain unchanged.
5.  The output grid is the initial grid modified by these conditional bounding box fills.
