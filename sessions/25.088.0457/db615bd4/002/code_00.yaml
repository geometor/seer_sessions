task_description: Fill rectangular regions defined by marker pixels, preserving a background pattern.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid. Not directly modified unless within a fill region.
  - name: pattern_color
    description: The second most frequent color in the input grid, often alternating with the background color. Not directly modified unless within a fill region.
  - name: marker_pixel
    description: Any pixel whose color is neither the background_color nor the pattern_color.
  - name: marker_group
    description: A collection of all marker_pixels having the same color.
  - name: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle (defined by min/max row and column) enclosing all marker_pixels within a single marker_group.

transformation:
  - step: Identify the background_color and pattern_color (e.g., based on frequency).
  - step: Identify all marker_pixels and group them by color into marker_groups.
  - step: Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
  - step: For each marker_group:
      - action: Determine the bounding_box for the group.
      - action: Iterate through all grid cells (r, c) within this bounding_box.
      - condition: Check if the color of the cell (r, c) in the *original* input grid is the background_color.
      - consequence: If the condition is true, set the color of the cell (r, c) in the *output* grid to the color of the current marker_group.
      - condition: If the color of the cell (r, c) in the original input grid is *not* the background_color (i.e., it's the pattern_color or another marker_color), its color in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid copy.
  - output: The final modified output grid.
