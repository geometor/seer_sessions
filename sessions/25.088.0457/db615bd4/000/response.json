            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids have a distinct structure. They seem composed of rows/columns that are either entirely one color (let's call this the `BACKGROUND_COLOR`) or alternate between the `BACKGROUND_COLOR` and a second color (let's call this the `PATTERN_COLOR`). In example 1, BG is azure `8`, PATTERN is blue `1`. In example 2, BG is yellow `4`, PATTERN is red `2`. In example 3, BG is azure `8`, PATTERN is red `2`.\n2.  **Marker Pixels:** Scattered within the grid are pixels of colors different from both `BACKGROUND_COLOR` and `PATTERN_COLOR`. These appear in pairs. Let's call these `MARKER_PIXELS` and their color `MARKER_COLOR`.\n3.  **Marker Pairs:** These `MARKER_PIXELS` always seem to come in pairs of the same `MARKER_COLOR`. Each pair is aligned either perfectly horizontally (same row, different columns) or perfectly vertically (same column, different rows).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves drawing lines between these pairs of `MARKER_PIXELS`.\n5.  **Filling Logic:** The line drawn between a pair of `MARKER_PIXELS` of color `C` uses that same color `C`. However, the line only \"paints over\" pixels that were originally the `BACKGROUND_COLOR`. Pixels that were the `PATTERN_COLOR` or other `MARKER_COLORS` along the path between the pair remain unchanged.\n6.  **Overlap:** Multiple lines can be drawn, potentially overlapping. The examples suggest the operations are cumulative on the initial state, potentially overwriting previous fills if they target the same background pixel. The order doesn't seem critical as they only modify background pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
