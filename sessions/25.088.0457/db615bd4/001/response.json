Identify the background color (typically the color at grid corners like (0,0)) and the pattern color (the color that alternates with the background color in checkerboard-like rows/columns).\n2.  Find all pixels in the input grid whose color is neither the background nor the pattern color. These are marker pixels.\n3.  Group the locations of these marker pixels by their color. Each color group should correspond to a pair of marker pixels.\n4.  For each pair of marker pixels with the same color:\n    a.  Determine if the pair is aligned horizontally (same row) or vertically (same column).\n    b.  Draw a line of the marker color between the two marker pixels.\n    c.  This line only colors over pixels that *originally* had the background color. Pixels with the pattern color or other marker colors along the line's path remain unchanged.\n5.
