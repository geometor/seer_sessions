task_description: Fill rectangular areas defined by markers, preserving existing non-background pixels.

definitions:
  background_color: The color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  marker_pixel: Any pixel in the input grid whose color is not the background_color.
  marker_group: A set of all marker_pixels sharing the same color.
  bounding_box: The smallest rectangle (defined by minimum/maximum row and column) that encloses all marker_pixels within a specific marker_group.

processing_steps:
  - step: 1. Identify Background Color
    description: Find the most frequent color in the input grid.
  - step: 2. Identify and Group Markers
    description: Find all non-background pixels (markers) and group their locations by color.
  - step: 3. Initialize Output Grid
    description: Create a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 4. Process Each Marker Group
    description: For each unique marker color found:
    actions:
      - action: Calculate Bounding Box
        description: Determine the min/max row and column for all markers of the current color.
      - action: Conditional Fill within Bounding Box
        description: Iterate through each cell (r, c) within the calculated bounding box.
        condition: Check the color of the cell (r, c) in the *original* input grid.
        effect: If the original cell color was the background_color, update the cell (r, c) in the *output* grid to the current marker color. Otherwise, leave the output cell unchanged (preserving its value copied from the input).
  - step: 5. Final Output
    description: Return the modified output grid.

constraints:
  - Fill operation only affects pixels that were originally the background color.
  - Pixels that were originally marker pixels (of any color) are never overwritten by the fill operation of another color group.
  - The relative positions of original marker pixels remain unchanged.
