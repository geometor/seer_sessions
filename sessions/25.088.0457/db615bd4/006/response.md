The metrics confirm the background and marker colors assumed previously. The core issue remains the filling logic. The previous code filled the entire bounding box unconditionally, changing *all* pixels within it. The correct logic should only change pixels that were *originally* the background color.

**Refined Strategy:**

1.  Identify the background color (most frequent).
2.  Find all non-background pixels ("markers").
3.  Group the locations of these markers by their color.
4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
5.  For each distinct marker color:
    a.  Determine the bounding box (min/max row/col) encompassing all markers *of that specific color*.
    b.  Iterate through all cells within this bounding box.
    c.  For each cell (r, c) inside the bounding box: Check the color of the cell at (r, c) in the **original input grid**.
    d.  If the original color at (r, c) was the background color, change the color of the cell at (r, c) in the **output grid** to the current marker color.
    e.  If the original color was *not* the background color (i.e., it was another marker color or part of the initial pattern), leave the cell in the **output grid** unchanged.
6.  Return the modified output grid.

This refined strategy directly addresses the observed error: overwriting non-background pixels within the bounding box. The conditional check ensures only background pixels are filled.## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because its transformation rule was too simplistic. It correctly identified the background color, marker pixels, and their bounding boxes based on color. However, it then proceeded to fill the *entire* bounding box for each marker color with that color, overwriting any pixels already present (including other markers or original background patterns within the box).

The expected outputs clearly show that the filling process is *conditional*. For each marker color group:
1.  A bounding box is determined by the markers of that color.
2.  Within this bounding box, *only* the pixels that were originally the background color are changed to the marker color.
3.  Pixels within the bounding box that were *not* the background color in the input remain unchanged in the output.

The strategy is to modify the code to implement this conditional filling logic. The core steps of identifying background, markers, grouping markers, and calculating bounding boxes remain valid. The change needs to happen *inside* the loop that iterates through the bounding box cells. Instead of unconditionally setting the output pixel to the marker color, it must first check the corresponding pixel in the *original input grid*. If that pixel was the background color, it's updated in the output grid; otherwise, it's left as it was (copied from the input).

## Metrics Analysis

Based on the provided examples and the `tool_code` output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 25x25
    *   Background Color: 8 (Azure)
    *   Marker Colors: 1 (Blue), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 4 (Yellow)
    *   Output Discrepancy: The code incorrectly filled the bounding boxes, overwriting blue markers with yellow, red, and green fills, and also filling areas within the bounding boxes that should have remained azure based on the original pattern. 379 pixels were incorrect.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 25x25
    *   Background Color: 4 (Yellow)
    *   Marker Colors: 1 (Blue), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 8 (Azure), 9 (Maroon)
    *   Output Discrepancy: Similar to Example 1, the code filled entire bounding boxes, overwriting red markers and original yellow patterns within the blue, azure, maroon, and green bounding boxes. 380 pixels were incorrect.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 25x25
    *   Background Color: 8 (Azure)
    *   Marker Colors: 1 (Blue), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 4 (Yellow), 9 (Maroon)
    *   Output Discrepancy: Again, the code filled entire bounding boxes, incorrectly overwriting red markers and original azure patterns within the green, yellow, blue, and maroon bounding boxes. 387 pixels were incorrect.

**Common Factors:**
*   All grids are 25x25.
*   The background color is correctly identified as the most frequent color.
*   The concept of "marker pixels" (non-background colors) is valid.
*   The grouping of markers by color and finding their bounding box is correct.
*   The crucial error is the *unconditional* filling of the bounding box instead of a *conditional* fill based on the original pixel's color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels that are *not* the background color; these are the "marker pixels".
3.  Group the locations (row, column) of these marker pixels according to their color.
4.  Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.
5.  For each unique marker color identified in step 3:
    a.  Find the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column that enclose all marker pixels *of this specific color*. This defines the bounding box for this color group.
    b.  Iterate through every grid cell (row `r`, column `c`) within this bounding box (inclusive).
    c.  For each cell (r, c) inside the bounding box, look at the color of the corresponding cell (r, c) in the **original input grid**.
    d.  If the color in the **original input grid** at (r, c) is the background color, then change the color of the cell (r, c) in the **output grid** to the current marker color being processed.
    e.  If the color in the **original input grid** at (r, c) is *not* the background color, make no change to the cell (r, c) in the **output grid** (it retains the value it had from the initial copy of the input).
6.  After processing all marker color groups, return the final output grid.
