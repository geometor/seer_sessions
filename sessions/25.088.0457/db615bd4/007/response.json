Identify the background color, which is the most frequent color in the input grid.\n2.  Find all 'marker pixels'. These are any pixels whose color is *not* the background color.\n3.  Group the locations (row, column) of these marker pixels by their color.\n4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n5.  For each distinct marker color found in step 3:\n    a.  Get the list of locations for all markers of this color.\n    b.  Determine the bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) that encloses all these marker locations.\n    c.  Iterate through every cell (r, c) within this bounding box (inclusive).\n    d.  Check the color of the cell at (r, c) in the *original input grid*.\n    e.  If the original color at (r, c) was the background color, change the color of the cell at (r, c) in the *output grid* to the current marker color.\n    f.  If the original color was *not* the background color (i.e., it was another marker color or part of the initial pattern), leave the cell in the output grid unchanged (it retains its original color from the input copy).\n6.
