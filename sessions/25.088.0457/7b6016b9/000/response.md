*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying enclosed areas within a grid. The input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and one other color forming shapes or lines (blue=1, azure=8, yellow=4). These shapes act as boundaries. The goal is to color the white pixels based on whether they are inside or outside these boundaries. White pixels outside the boundaries are colored green (3), and white pixels inside the boundaries are colored red (2). The boundary pixels themselves remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      description: "Color filling based on enclosure by non-white pixels."
      input_features:
        - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
        - background_color: white (0)
        - boundary_color: A single non-white color (1, 8, or 4 in examples) forms shapes.
      output_features:
        - grid: 2D array with the same dimensions as the input.
        - boundary_pixels: Retain their original color.
        - outside_pixels: White pixels connected to the grid border are changed to green (3).
        - inside_pixels: White pixels not connected to the grid border (enclosed) are changed to red (2).
    transformation:
      steps:
        - Identify boundary pixels (non-white).
        - Identify outside white pixels using connectivity to the border.
        - Identify inside white pixels (those not connected to the border).
        - Recolor pixels based on classification (outside -> green, inside -> red).
      key_operations:
        - Connected components analysis or flood fill.
        - Pixel classification (boundary, inside, outside).
        - Conditional pixel recoloring.
    examples_analysis:
      - train_1: Blue (1) lines enclose areas. Outside 0 -> 3, Inside 0 -> 2.
      - train_2: Azure (8) shapes enclose areas. Outside 0 -> 3, Inside 0 -> 2.
      - train_3: Yellow (4) shapes enclose areas. Outside 0 -> 3, Inside 0 -> 2.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    2.  Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are located on the border (top, bottom, left, or right edge).
    3.  Starting from these border white pixels, perform a flood fill (or Breadth-First Search/Depth-First Search) to find all reachable white (0) pixels. Only move between white pixels (horizontally or vertically adjacent).
    4.  Change the color of all these reachable white pixels (including the starting border ones) in the output grid to green (3). These are the "outside" pixels.
    5.  Iterate through all pixels in the output grid.
    6.  If a pixel is still white (0), it means it was not reachable from the border and is therefore "inside" an enclosed area. Change its color to red (2).
    7.  Leave all non-white pixels from the input grid unchanged in the output grid.
    8.  Return the modified output grid.
