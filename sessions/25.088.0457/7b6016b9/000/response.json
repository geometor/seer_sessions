The input grid contains a background color (white, 0) and one other color forming shapes or lines (blue=1, azure=8, yellow=4). These shapes act as boundaries. The goal is to color the white pixels based on whether they are inside or outside these boundaries. White pixels outside the boundaries are colored green (3), and white pixels inside the boundaries are colored red (2). The boundary pixels themselves remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
