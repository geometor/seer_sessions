"""
Identifies plus shapes (+) made of green pixels (3) with a non-white center pixel.
For each such identified shape, it fills the entire row and column, which intersect
at the center pixel, with the color of that center pixel.
After all identified shapes have caused their respective row/column fills,
all pixels from the original input grid that were not white (0) are copied back
onto the modified grid in their original positions, effectively overlaying the
filled lines.

  Finds all target plus shapes in the grid.

  A target plus shape has a non-white center pixel, and all four
