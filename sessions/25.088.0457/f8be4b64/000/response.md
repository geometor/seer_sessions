Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The input grids contain scattered "plus" shapes made of green pixels (3). Some of these plus shapes have a central pixel of a different, non-white color (e.g., gray, magenta, yellow, red, azure). Other green plus shapes might have a white (0) center, and there can be other isolated pixels or shapes.

The output grids retain the original dimensions. The key transformation involves identifying the plus shapes with non-white centers. For each such shape found, the entire row and the entire column intersecting at that non-white center pixel are filled with the color of that center pixel. Crucially, after these rows and columns are filled, all the original non-white pixels from the input grid seem to be redrawn onto the output grid in their original positions, effectively overlaying the filled lines. Plus shapes with white centers do not trigger any row/column filling and appear unchanged in the output (unless overwritten by a fill operation from another shape).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Identify plus shapes with non-white centers and fill the corresponding row and column with the center's color, then overlay all original non-white pixels.

definitions:
  - object: PlusShape
    description: A shape composed of a central pixel and its four cardinal neighbors.
    properties:
      - center_pixel_location: [row, column]
      - center_pixel_color: integer (0-9)
      - arm_pixel_color: green (3)
      - configuration: Center pixel at (r, c), arm pixels at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1).
  - object: TargetPlusShape
    inherits: PlusShape
    condition: center_pixel_color is not white (0) AND all four arm pixels are green (3).

actions:
  - action: FindTargetPlusShapes
    description: Scan the input grid to locate all instances of TargetPlusShapes.
    input: input_grid
    output: List of [center_row, center_col, center_color] for each TargetPlusShape found.
  - action: FillRowAndColumn
    description: For a given TargetPlusShape, fill the entire row and column corresponding to its center location with its center color.
    input: grid_to_modify, center_row, center_col, center_color
    output: modified_grid
  - action: OverlayOriginalNonWhitePixels
    description: Copy all non-white pixels from the original input grid onto the target grid.
    input: target_grid, source_grid (original input)
    output: modified_target_grid

transformation_flow:
  - step: Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
  - step: Identify all TargetPlusShapes in the input_grid.
  - step: For each identified TargetPlusShape:
      - Get its center_row, center_col, and center_color.
      - Fill row `center_row` of the output_grid with `center_color`.
      - Fill column `center_col` of the output_grid with `center_color`.
  - step: Iterate through the original input_grid. If a pixel at (r, c) is not white (0), set the pixel at (r, c) in the output_grid to that color.

examples_summary:
  - example: train_1
    input_features: Contains 3 TargetPlusShapes (centers: gray, magenta, yellow) and one green cross with a white center.
    output_features: Rows/Columns corresponding to gray, magenta, yellow centers are filled with those colors. Original shapes are overlaid. Green cross with white center is preserved but does not trigger filling.
  - example: train_2
    input_features: Contains 3 TargetPlusShapes (centers: gray, magenta, azure).
    output_features: Rows/Columns corresponding to gray, magenta, azure centers are filled with those colors. Original shapes are overlaid.
  - example: train_3
    input_features: Contains 1 TargetPlusShape (center: red) and one green cross with a white center.
    output_features: Row/Column corresponding to the red center is filled red. Original shapes are overlaid. Green cross with white center is preserved.
  - example: train_4
    input_features: Contains 3 TargetPlusShapes (centers: red, magenta, azure) and one green cross with a white center.
    output_features: Rows/Columns corresponding to red, magenta, azure centers are filled with those colors. Original shapes are overlaid. Green cross with white center is preserved.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all "target plus shapes". A target plus shape is defined as a non-white pixel whose four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all green (color 3). Ignore any plus shapes where the center pixel is white (color 0).
3.  For each target plus shape found:
    a.  Identify the row index (`r`), column index (`c`), and color (`C`) of its center pixel.
    b.  Fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with color `C`.
    c.  Fill the entire column `c` of the output grid with color `C`. (If multiple shapes fill the same row/column, the last one processed will determine the final color, though the examples don't show conflicting fills).
4.  After processing all target plus shapes and filling the corresponding rows/columns, iterate through every pixel of the *original input grid*.
5.  If a pixel in the original input grid at location (row, col) has a non-white color, update the pixel at the same location (row, col) in the output grid with that original non-white color. This ensures all original non-white patterns are preserved and appear "on top" of the filled lines.
6.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
