task_description: Identify plus shapes with non-white centers and fill the corresponding row and column with the center's color, then overlay all original non-white pixels.

definitions:
  - object: PlusShape
    description: A shape composed of a central pixel and its four cardinal neighbors.
    properties:
      - center_pixel_location: [row, column]
      - center_pixel_color: integer (0-9)
      - arm_pixel_color: green (3)
      - configuration: Center pixel at (r, c), arm pixels at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1).
  - object: TargetPlusShape
    inherits: PlusShape
    condition: center_pixel_color is not white (0) AND all four arm pixels are green (3).

actions:
  - action: FindTargetPlusShapes
    description: Scan the input grid to locate all instances of TargetPlusShapes.
    input: input_grid
    output: List of [center_row, center_col, center_color] for each TargetPlusShape found.
  - action: FillRowAndColumn
    description: For a given TargetPlusShape, fill the entire row and column corresponding to its center location with its center color.
    input: grid_to_modify, center_row, center_col, center_color
    output: modified_grid
  - action: OverlayOriginalNonWhitePixels
    description: Copy all non-white pixels from the original input grid onto the target grid.
    input: target_grid, source_grid (original input)
    output: modified_target_grid

transformation_flow:
  - step: Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
  - step: Identify all TargetPlusShapes in the input_grid.
  - step: For each identified TargetPlusShape:
      - Get its center_row, center_col, and center_color.
      - Fill row `center_row` of the output_grid with `center_color`.
      - Fill column `center_col` of the output_grid with `center_color`.
  - step: Iterate through the original input_grid. If a pixel at (r, c) is not white (0), set the pixel at (r, c) in the output_grid to that color.

examples_summary:
  - example: train_1
    input_features: Contains 3 TargetPlusShapes (centers: gray, magenta, yellow) and one green cross with a white center.
    output_features: Rows/Columns corresponding to gray, magenta, yellow centers are filled with those colors. Original shapes are overlaid. Green cross with white center is preserved but does not trigger filling.
  - example: train_2
    input_features: Contains 3 TargetPlusShapes (centers: gray, magenta, azure).
    output_features: Rows/Columns corresponding to gray, magenta, azure centers are filled with those colors. Original shapes are overlaid.
  - example: train_3
    input_features: Contains 1 TargetPlusShape (center: red) and one green cross with a white center.
    output_features: Row/Column corresponding to the red center is filled red. Original shapes are overlaid. Green cross with white center is preserved.
  - example: train_4
    input_features: Contains 3 TargetPlusShapes (centers: red, magenta, azure) and one green cross with a white center.
    output_features: Rows/Columns corresponding to red, magenta, azure centers are filled with those colors. Original shapes are overlaid. Green cross with white center is preserved.
