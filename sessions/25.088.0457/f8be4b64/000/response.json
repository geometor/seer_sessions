            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe input grids contain scattered \"plus\" shapes made of green pixels (3). Some of these plus shapes have a central pixel of a different, non-white color (e.g., gray, magenta, yellow, red, azure). Other green plus shapes might have a white (0) center, and there can be other isolated pixels or shapes.\n\nThe output grids retain the original dimensions. The key transformation involves identifying the plus shapes with non-white centers. For each such shape found, the entire row and the entire column intersecting at that non-white center pixel are filled with the color of that center pixel. Crucially, after these rows and columns are filled, all the original non-white pixels from the input grid seem to be redrawn onto the output grid in their original positions, effectively overlaying the filled lines. Plus shapes with white centers do not trigger any row/column filling and appear unchanged in the output (unless overwritten by a fill operation from another shape).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

A target plus shape is defined as a non-white pixel whose four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are all green (color 3). Ignore any plus shapes where the center pixel is white (color 0).\n3.  For each target plus shape found:\n    a.  Identify the row index (`r`), column index (`c`), and color (`C`) of its center pixel.\n    b.  Fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with color `C`.\n    c.  Fill the entire column `c` of the output grid with color `C`. (If multiple shapes fill the same row/column, the last one processed will determine the final color, though the examples don't show conflicting fills).\n4.  After processing all target plus shapes and filling the corresponding rows/columns, iterate through every pixel of the *original input grid*.\n5.  If a pixel in the original input grid at location (row, col) has a non-white color, update the pixel at the same location (row, col) in the output grid with that original non-white color. This ensures all original non-white patterns are preserved and appear \"on top\" of the filled lines.\n6.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
