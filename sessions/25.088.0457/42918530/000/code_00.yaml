elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors. Contains background and distinct objects.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Separates the main objects. Remains unchanged.
  - type: object
    shape: square
    size: 5x5
    components:
      - type: border
        thickness: 1 pixel
        color: non-white (1-9)
        description: Forms the outer frame of the 5x5 square.
      - type: inner_area
        shape: square
        size: 3x3
        location: center of the 5x5 square
        content:
          - type: pattern
            description: Can be either all white (0) pixels or contain a mix of white (0) and the border color pixels.
properties:
  - property: color_grouping
    description: Squares can be grouped based on their shared border color.
  - property: pattern_state
    description: The inner_area can be in one of two states - 'empty' (all white) or 'patterned' (contains non-white pixels).
actions:
  - action: identify_squares
    description: Locate all 5x5 squares based on their non-white borders.
  - action: group_by_color
    description: Group the identified squares by their border color.
  - action: find_source_pattern
    description: Within each color group, identify if there exists at least one square with a 'patterned' inner_area. If yes, designate its inner 3x3 pattern as the 'source pattern' for that color. Assume only one unique source pattern exists per color across all examples shown (or the first one found is sufficient).
  - action: find_target_squares
    description: Within each color group, identify all squares with an 'empty' inner_area. These are the 'target squares'.
  - action: copy_pattern
    description: If a 'source pattern' and 'target squares' exist for a color group, copy the 'source pattern' into the inner_area of all 'target squares' in that group.
relationships:
  - relationship: pattern_propagation
    description: An existing inner pattern within a color group propagates to other squares of the same color that lack a pattern (have an 'empty' inner_area).
    condition: Must have at least one 'patterned' source and at least one 'empty' target square within the same color group.
