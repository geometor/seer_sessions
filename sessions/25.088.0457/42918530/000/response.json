            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are relatively large and structured. They contain multiple distinct shapes separated by white (0) background pixels.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects appear to be 5x5 squares. Each square has a solid border of a specific color (not white) and an inner 3x3 area.\n3.  **Object Properties:**\n    *   Each 5x5 square is defined by its border color.\n    *   The inner 3x3 area can either be entirely white (0) or contain a pattern made of the same color as the border.\n4.  **Relationships:** Multiple squares can share the same border color. Their positions relative to each other vary across examples.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve modifying the inner 3x3 area of *some* of the 5x5 squares. Specifically, squares with an all-white inner area appear to adopt the inner pattern from another square of the *same* border color, provided such a patterned square exists.\n6.  **Consistency:** The outer 5x5 border of each square remains unchanged between input and output. Squares that already have an inner pattern also seem to remain unchanged. The white background separating the squares is also unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
