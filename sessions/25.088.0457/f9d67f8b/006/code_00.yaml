task_description: |
  Transforms gray pixels based on their adjacency to maroon pixels using a reflection principle. The output grid is initially a copy of the input grid. The transformation modifies the color of specific gray pixels.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Varying height and width (up to 30x30).
  - colors: Uses standard ARC colors (0-9). Key colors are gray (5) and maroon (9).
objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9
      - position: (row, column) coordinate
  - type: Focal Pixel
    description: A pixel with gray color (5).
    properties:
      - color: 5 (Gray)
  - type: Mirror Pixel
    description: A pixel with maroon color (9).
    properties:
      - color: 9 (Maroon)
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (8-way connectivity).
    applies_to:
      - Focal Pixel (Gray)
      - Mirror Pixel (Maroon)
  - type: Reflection
    description: A geometric operation where a point P is reflected across a point M to a point P'. P' = M + (M - P) = 2*M - P.
    parameters:
      - point_to_reflect: Position of the Focal Pixel (Gray) (r_g, c_g)
      - reflection_point: Position of an adjacent Mirror Pixel (Maroon) (r_m, c_m)
      - result_point: Reflected position (r_refl, c_refl) = (2*r_m - r_g, 2*c_m - c_g)
      - source_color: The color in the *input* grid at the result_point, if it's within grid bounds.
transformation_rule:
  - action: Identify
    target: All gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid.
  - action: For each gray pixel
    condition: Check its 8 neighbors.
    sub_action: Find all adjacent maroon pixels (color 9).
    sub_action: For each adjacent maroon pixel, calculate the reflection of the gray pixel's position across the maroon pixel's position.
    sub_action: Determine if the reflected position is within the grid boundaries. Collect all *valid* reflected positions.
  - action: Modify Output Grid
    condition: If *exactly one* valid reflected position was found for a gray pixel among all its adjacent maroon neighbors.
    effect: Change the color of the gray pixel in the output grid to the color found at the valid reflected position in the *input* grid.
    condition_else: If zero or more than one valid reflected positions were found.
    effect_else: The gray pixel retains its original gray color (5) in the output grid.
  - action: Preserve
    target: All non-gray pixels, and gray pixels not meeting the modification criteria.
    effect: Their color in the output grid is the same as in the input grid.
