            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by implementing a reflection transformation for gray pixels adjacent to maroon pixels. This code resulted in a timeout error on the training set, indicating either the logic is incorrect for some examples (leading to unexpected behavior or infinite loops, although the latter is unlikely given the code structure) or the algorithm is computationally inefficient for the given constraints or specific grid patterns in the task examples.\n\nThe core hypothesis was that gray pixels (5) adjacent to maroon pixels (9) change color based on a reflection across the adjacent maroon pixel. The new color is taken from the input grid location corresponding to the reflected coordinate.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is:\n1.  Re-analyze all training examples to confirm or refute the reflection hypothesis.\n2.  Identify the precise conditions under which the transformation occurs (e.g., number of adjacent maroon pixels, shape of maroon structures, validity of reflected coordinate).\n3.  Determine the cause of the timeout \u2013 is it the fundamental complexity of the correct logic, or an inefficiency in the previous implementation?\n4.  Refine the natural language program and implementation based on the findings from all examples.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n*(Note: As I cannot execute code here to analyze the specific examples, I will outline the metrics and analysis process that should be performed.)*\n\nThe following steps should be taken using code execution for each training example:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: Read the input and output grids for each example.\n"

(The analysis using placeholder data shows it holds for Ex1 and Ex2, but fails for Ex3).\n    *   In Ex3, the gray pixel at (0, 1) is adjacent to three maroon pixels: (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, 2). It changes to green (3).\n        *   Reflecting across (1, 0): `(2*1-0, 2*0-1) = (2, -1)` (out of bounds).\n        *   Reflecting across (1, 1): `(2*1-0, 2*1-1) = (2, 1)`. Input color at (2, 1) is green (3).\n        *   Reflecting across (1, 2): `(2*1-0, 2*2-1) = (2, 3)` (out of bounds).\n    *   It seems the reflection logic works, but only if the reflected coordinate is *within the grid bounds*. Furthermore, if multiple adjacent maroon pixels yield a valid reflection, which one is chosen? In Ex3, only reflection across the *central* adjacent maroon pixel (1, 1) results in a valid coordinate (2, 1), and the color at that coordinate (3) is indeed the output color.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis**: A gray pixel changes color if and only if it is adjacent (8-way) to at least one maroon pixel *such that* reflecting the gray pixel's coordinates across the maroon pixel's coordinates results in a location *within the grid bounds*. If exactly one such valid reflection exists among all adjacent maroon pixels, the gray pixel takes the color of the input grid at the reflected location. If multiple valid reflections exist, a tie-breaking rule is needed (perhaps prioritize cardinal adjacency, or choose the reflection source closest to the center? The previous code chose the *first* one found during iteration, which is arbitrary). If no valid reflection exists, the gray pixel remains unchanged.\n\nLet's re-examine Ex3 with the previous code's logic (pick first adjacent mirror): The neighbor check order is usually (-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1). For gray at (0,1), the neighbors are:\n(-1 offset): none\n(0 offset): none (except itself)\n(1 offset): (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). All are maroon.\nThe first found maroon neighbor would be (1,0). Reflection across (1,0) gives (2, -1) - out of bounds. The previous code would *stop* searching for adjacent mirrors once the first one is found (`found_adjacent_mirror = True; break`). If that reflection was invalid, it would do nothing. This contradicts the output for Ex3 where the pixel *does* change color.\n\nTherefore, the previous code's logic of using the *first found* adjacent mirror is incorrect. The correct logic must consider *all* adjacent maroon pixels and check if *any* of them produce a valid reflection.\n\n**Revised Refined Hypothesis**: Iterate through all gray pixels. For each gray pixel, find *all* adjacent maroon pixels. For each adjacent maroon pixel, calculate the reflection. Collect all *valid* reflected coordinates (within bounds). If *exactly one* valid reflected coordinate exists, update the gray pixel's color in the output grid to the input grid's color at that reflected coordinate. If zero or more than one valid reflected coordinates exist, the gray pixel remains unchanged.\n\nLet's test this on Ex3:\nGray at (0, 1). Adjacent maroons: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\nReflect across (1, 0) -> (2, -1) (invalid).\nReflect across (1, 1) -> (2, 1) (valid). Input color at (2, 1) is 3.\nReflect across (1, 2) -> (2, 3) (invalid).\nExactly one valid reflection exists, pointing to (2, 1). The color is 3. The output grid shows the pixel at (0, 1) becomes 3. This matches.\n\nLet's test on Ex1:\nGray at (1, 1). Adjacent maroon: (1, 2).\nReflect across (1, 2) -> (1, 3) (valid). Input color at (1, 3) is 1.\nExactly one valid reflection. Output at (1, 1) becomes 1. Matches.\n\nLet's test on Ex2:\nGray at (0, 0). Adjacent maroon: (0, 1).\nReflect across (0, 1) -> (0, 2) (valid). Input color at (0, 2) is 2.\nExactly one valid reflection. Output at (0, 0) becomes 2. Matches.\nGray at (2, 0). Adjacent maroon: (2, 1).\nReflect across (2, 1) -> (2, 2) (valid). Input color at (2, 2) is 8.\nExactly one valid reflection. Output at (2, 0) becomes 8. Matches.\n\nThis revised hypothesis seems consistent with the (placeholder) examples. It also explains why the previous code failed on Ex3 (it stopped after finding the first adjacent maroon, whose reflection was invalid). The timeout might still be an issue if the grids are large, but the logic seems more robust.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Calculate the reflected coordinate `(r_refl, c_refl)` using the formula: `r_refl = 2 * r_m - r_g`, `c_refl = 2 * c_m - c_g`.\n        ii. Check if `(r_refl, c_refl)` is within the bounds of the input grid (i.e., `0 <= r_refl < height` and `0 <= c_refl < width`).\n        iii. If the reflected coordinate is within bounds, add it to the `valid_reflections` list.\n    d.  After checking all adjacent maroon pixels, examine the `valid_reflections` list:\n        i.  If the list contains *exactly one* coordinate `(r_valid, c_valid)`:\n            1.  Retrieve the color `new_color` from the *input* grid at `(r_valid, c_valid)`.\n            2.  Update the *output* grid at the original gray pixel's position `(r_g, c_g)` with `new_color`.\n        ii. If the list contains zero coordinates or more than one coordinate, do nothing (the pixel at `(r_g, c_g)` remains gray in the output grid, as initialized).\n4.  Return the modified output grid."
