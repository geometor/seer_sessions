"""
Identifies all maroon (9) pixels as potential mirror surfaces.
Finds all gray (5) pixels that are adjacent (8-way connectivity) to any maroon pixel.
For each such gray pixel, it finds the first adjacent maroon pixel encountered during a neighbor check.
It calculates the reflection of the gray pixel's position across this specific adjacent maroon pixel's position.
If the reflected position is within the grid bounds, the gray pixel's color in the output grid is updated to be the color of the pixel at the reflected position in the *input* grid.
All other pixels in the output grid retain their original color from the input grid.
