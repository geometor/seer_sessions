## General Assessment

The previous code attempt implemented a reflection transformation based on observations from a single example. It assumed that gray pixels adjacent to the *largest* contiguous maroon component are reflected across their nearest point on that component. The code failed with a **timeout error** on the training set.

This indicates several possibilities:
1.  **Incorrect Logic**: The "largest maroon component as mirror" hypothesis might be wrong. The actual mirror could be defined differently (e.g., all maroon pixels, specific maroon shapes, a different color). The reflection rule itself might be different.
2.  **Incomplete Logic**: The rule might be correct but needs refinement for edge cases (e.g., gray pixels adjacent to multiple mirror points, multiple maroon components of the same size) which weren't handled correctly or efficiently.
3.  **Inefficiency**: The algorithm, while logically sound for small cases, might be computationally too expensive (e.g., due to large grids, numerous gray pixels, or the specific implementation of component finding/iteration) for the time limits imposed, especially on more complex training examples.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-analyze all training examples**: Carefully examine each input-output pair to confirm or refute the reflection hypothesis.
2.  **Identify the "Mirror"**: Determine precisely what constitutes the mirror object(s). Is it always maroon? Is it always the largest component? Does shape matter?
3.  **Identify Reflected Pixels**: Determine which pixels are subject to reflection. Is it always gray pixels? Is adjacency (and the type, e.g., 8-way) the correct criterion?
4.  **Define Reflection Rule**: Clarify the exact reflection mechanism. If a pixel is adjacent to multiple mirror points, which one is used for reflection? Does the simple `refl = 2*mirror - gray` formula always hold?
5.  **Optimize**: If the logic seems correct but slow, look for implementation optimizations.

## Documented Facts (YAML)

Based on the initial analysis and the need for further verification across all examples:


```yaml
task_description: Reflect pixels across a mirror object.

input_features:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Contains pixels of various colors (0-9).
      - May contain one or more contiguous components of maroon (9) pixels.
      - May contain gray (5) pixels.

output_features:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - Same dimensions as the input grid.
      - Most pixels retain their color from the input grid.
      - Some pixels, typically those that were gray (5) in the input, change color.

objects:
  - name: mirror
    identified_by: Contiguous component(s) of maroon (9) pixels.
    properties:
      - location: Coordinates of pixels in the component.
      - size: Number of pixels in the component.
    uncertainty: Initial hypothesis assumed the *single largest* component is the mirror. This needs verification across all examples. The mirror might be defined differently (e.g., all maroon pixels, specific shapes).
  - name: reflected_pixel
    identified_by: Pixels that change color from input to output.
    properties:
      - initial_color: Typically gray (5) (needs verification).
      - final_color: Color copied from another location in the *input* grid.
      - location: Coordinates (r, c).
      - relationship_to_mirror: Typically adjacent (8-way connectivity assumed, needs verification) to a pixel belonging to the 'mirror' object.

actions:
  - name: identify_mirror
    actor: system
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: mirror object(s)
    description: Find the relevant maroon structure(s) that act as the mirror surface. (Precise definition TBD).
  - name: identify_candidates
    actor: system
    inputs: input_grid, mirror object(s)
    outputs: set of candidate pixel coordinates
    description: Find pixels (hypothesized to be gray) that are adjacent to the identified mirror object(s). (Adjacency type TBD).
  - name: reflect
    actor: system
    inputs: candidate pixel coordinate (r_gray, c_gray), adjacent mirror pixel coordinate (r_mirror, c_mirror), input_grid
    outputs: new color for the candidate pixel
    description:
      1. Calculate the reflected coordinate: `r_refl = 2 * r_mirror - r_gray`, `c_refl = 2 * c_mirror - c_gray`.
      2. Check if (r_refl, c_refl) is within grid bounds.
      3. If within bounds, the new color is `input_grid[r_refl, c_refl]`.
      4. If out of bounds, the pixel retains its original color (or another default behavior TBD).
    uncertainty: Needs verification if this point reflection formula is always correct. Needs clarification on which adjacent mirror pixel to use if multiple exist.
  - name: update_grid
    actor: system
    inputs: input_grid, candidate pixels, reflection results
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid and updating the color of reflected candidate pixels.

constraints_and_issues:
  - Timeout Error: Previous implementation exceeded time limits, suggesting inefficiency or complexity issues, possibly related to large grids or numerous candidates/components.
  - Ambiguity: Rule for selecting the mirror pixel for reflection when multiple are adjacent is unclear.
  - Definition Accuracy: Precise definitions of 'mirror' and 'candidate pixels' require confirmation across all examples.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Potential Mirror Pixels**: Locate all maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Mirror Object(s)**: Determine which maroon pixels constitute the actual mirror(s). (Hypothesis: It might be the largest contiguous component of maroon pixels using 8-way connectivity. *Self-correction*: This needs verification. If there are multiple components of the same largest size, or if the mirror isn't always the largest, this step needs adjustment based on patterns across all examples. Consider if *all* maroon pixels collectively act as the mirror surface).
3.  **Identify Candidate Pixels**: Find all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Filter Candidates**: Select only those gray pixels that are adjacent (using 8-way connectivity) to at least one pixel belonging to the identified mirror object(s).
5.  **Perform Reflection for Each Candidate**: For each selected candidate gray pixel at `(r_gray, c_gray)`:
    a.  Find *one* adjacent mirror pixel `(r_mirror, c_mirror)`. (*Self-correction*: The rule for choosing *which* adjacent mirror pixel if multiple exist needs to be determined from the examples. The previous code used the first one found, which might be arbitrary or incorrect. A consistent rule, like choosing the one with the minimum row/col index, or averaging positions, or checking all, might be needed).
    b.  Calculate the reflection source coordinates: `r_refl = 2 * r_mirror - r_gray`, `c_refl = 2 * c_mirror - c_gray`.
    c.  Check if the reflected coordinates `(r_refl, c_refl)` are within the bounds of the grid.
    d.  If the coordinates are within bounds, determine the color to assign to the output pixel at `(r_gray, c_gray)` by looking up the color in the *input* grid at `(r_refl, c_refl)`.
    e.  If the coordinates are out of bounds, the pixel at `(r_gray, c_gray)` retains its original gray color in the output grid.
6.  **Construct Output Grid**: Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Then, update the color of each successfully reflected candidate pixel according to the results from step 5. Pixels that were not candidates or whose reflection pointed out of bounds remain unchanged from the input.
