White (0) is not present. Maroon (9) and Gray (5) seem particularly important.\n3.  **Key Object:** In each input grid, there's a prominent, relatively large, contiguous block of maroon (9) pixels, roughly centered but varying in exact position and shape (rectangular).\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between input and output grids occur exclusively in the pixels immediately surrounding this central maroon block.\n5.  **Affected Pixels:** Only gray (5) pixels adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the maroon block are modified.\n6.  **Nature of Change:** The affected gray pixels change their color. The new color seems determined by reflecting the position of the gray pixel across the boundary of the maroon block and copying the color found at that reflected position in the input grid.\n7.  **The \"Mirror\":** The maroon block acts like a mirror. Gray pixels next to it take on the color of the pixel \"seen\" in the reflection.\n8.  **Stability:** The maroon block itself and all pixels *not* adjacent to it remain unchanged. Pixels adjacent to the maroon block but *not* colored gray also remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
