"""
Transforms gray pixels (5) based on their adjacency to maroon pixels (9) using a reflection principle. 
A gray pixel changes color if and only if there is exactly one adjacent maroon pixel (8-way connectivity) such that reflecting the gray pixel's position across the maroon pixel's position results in a coordinate within the grid bounds. 
If this condition is met, the gray pixel takes the color of the input grid at the reflected location. 
Otherwise, the gray pixel retains its original color. All other pixels remain unchanged.
