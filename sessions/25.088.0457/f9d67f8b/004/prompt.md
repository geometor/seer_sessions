"""
Identify the largest contiguous block of maroon (9) pixels (the 'mirror') using 8-way connectivity.
Find all gray (5) pixels that are adjacent (8-way) to this mirror block.
For each such gray pixel, find one adjacent mirror pixel.
Calculate the reflection of the gray pixel's position across this adjacent mirror pixel's position.
If the reflected position is within the grid bounds, update the gray pixel's color in the output grid to be the color of the pixel at the reflected position in the *input* grid.
All other pixels in the output grid retain their original color from the input grid.
