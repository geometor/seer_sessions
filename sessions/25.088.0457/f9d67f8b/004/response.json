            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempt implemented a reflection transformation based on observations from a single example. It assumed that gray pixels adjacent to the *largest* contiguous maroon component are reflected across their nearest point on that component. The code failed with a **timeout error** on the training set.\n\nThis indicates several possibilities:\n1.  **Incorrect Logic**: The \"largest maroon component as mirror\" hypothesis might be wrong. The actual mirror could be defined differently (e.g., all maroon pixels, specific maroon shapes, a different color). The reflection rule itself might be different.\n2.  **Incomplete Logic**: The rule might be correct but needs refinement for edge cases (e.g., gray pixels adjacent to multiple mirror points, multiple maroon components of the same size) which weren't handled correctly or efficiently.\n3.  **Inefficiency**: The algorithm, while logically sound for small cases, might be computationally too expensive (e.g., due to large grids, numerous gray pixels, or the specific implementation of component finding/iteration) for the time limits imposed, especially on more complex training examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Re-analyze all training examples**: Carefully examine each input-output pair to confirm or refute the reflection hypothesis.\n2.  **Identify the \"Mirror\"**: Determine precisely what constitutes the mirror object(s). Is it always maroon? Is it always the largest component? Does shape matter?\n3.  **Identify Reflected Pixels**: Determine which pixels are subject to reflection. Is it always gray pixels? Is adjacency (and the type, e.g., 8-way) the correct criterion?\n4.  **Define Reflection Rule**: Clarify the exact reflection mechanism. If a pixel is adjacent to multiple mirror points, which one is used for reflection? Does the simple `refl = 2*mirror - gray` formula always hold?\n5.  **Optimize**: If the logic seems correct but slow, look for implementation optimizations.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nTo refine the understanding, we need to systematically analyze *all* training examples. The following metrics should be gathered for each `(input, output)` pair:\n\n"

(Hypothesis: It might be the largest contiguous component of maroon pixels using 8-way connectivity. *Self-correction*: This needs verification. If there are multiple components of the same largest size, or if the mirror isn't always the largest, this step needs adjustment based on patterns across all examples. Consider if *all* maroon pixels collectively act as the mirror surface).\n3.  **Identify Candidate Pixels**: Find all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Filter Candidates**: Select only those gray pixels that are adjacent (using 8-way connectivity) to at least one pixel belonging to the identified mirror object(s).\n5.  **Perform Reflection for Each Candidate**: For each selected candidate gray pixel at `(r_gray, c_gray)`:\n    a.  Find *one* adjacent mirror pixel `(r_mirror, c_mirror)`. (*Self-correction*: The rule for choosing *which* adjacent mirror pixel if multiple exist needs to be determined from the examples. The previous code used the first one found, which might be arbitrary or incorrect. A consistent rule, like choosing the one with the minimum row/col index, or averaging positions, or checking all, might be needed).\n    b.  Calculate the reflection source coordinates: `r_refl = 2 * r_mirror - r_gray`, `c_refl = 2 * c_mirror - c_gray`.\n    c.  Check if the reflected coordinates `(r_refl, c_refl)` are within the bounds of the grid.\n    d.  If the coordinates are within bounds, determine the color to assign to the output pixel at `(r_gray, c_gray)` by looking up the color in the *input* grid at `(r_refl, c_refl)`.\n    e.  If the coordinates are out of bounds, the pixel at `(r_gray, c_gray)` retains its original gray color in the output grid.\n6.  **Construct Output Grid**: Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid. Then, update the color of each successfully reflected candidate pixel according to the results from step 5. Pixels that were not candidates or whose reflection pointed out of bounds remain unchanged from the input."
