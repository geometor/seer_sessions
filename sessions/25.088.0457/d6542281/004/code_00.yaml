facts:
  background_color:
    description: The most frequent color in the input grid. It is ignored during object detection.
    value: Determined dynamically for each input grid. Usually white (0).
  objects:
    description: Contiguous regions of non-background pixels connected using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).
    properties:
      - size: Number of pixels in the object.
      - colors: Set of unique colors present in the object.
      - pixels: List of coordinates and colors for each pixel in the object.
      - bounding_box: Coordinates defining the smallest rectangle enclosing the object.
  templates:
    description: Objects with a size greater than 1 pixel.
    role: Serve as patterns to be copied.
  potential_triggers:
    description: Objects with a size exactly equal to 1 pixel.
    role: Candidates for initiating a template copy.
  actual_triggers:
    description: Potential triggers that are isolated.
    definition_of_isolation: A single pixel is isolated if none of its 8 neighbors (adjacent and diagonal) are non-background pixels.
    role: Initiate the copying of a specific template.
  anchor_point:
    description: A specific pixel within a selected template used for alignment.
    definition: The top-most, then left-most pixel within the template that matches the color of the actual_trigger.
  actions:
    - action: identify_objects
      description: Find all templates and potential_triggers in the input grid relative to the background_color.
    - action: filter_triggers
      description: Identify actual_triggers by checking the isolation condition for each potential_trigger.
    - action: select_template
      description: For each actual_trigger, find all templates containing the trigger's color. Select the template with the largest size (pixel count). Ties are broken implicitly by the order objects were found.
    - action: determine_anchor
      description: Find the anchor_point within the selected_template based on the actual_trigger's color.
    - action: calculate_offset
      description: Determine the row and column offset needed to align the template's anchor_point with the actual_trigger's location in the grid.
    - action: copy_template
      description: Create the output grid by copying the input grid initially. Then, for each actual_trigger, overlay the selected_template onto the output grid using the calculated_offset. Overlapping copies are allowed, with later copies overwriting earlier ones.
