            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided Python code attempts to solve the ARC task by identifying single-pixel \"triggers\" and multi-pixel \"templates\". It copies the largest template containing the trigger's color onto the output grid, aligning a specific point (top-left pixel of trigger's color) in the template with the trigger's location.\n\nThe code successfully solves Example 2 but fails on Examples 1 and 3.\n- **Example 1 Failure**: The code's output is missing one copied template and has misplaced another compared to the expected output. The original code copied the blue/yellow shape triggered by yellow (10, 14), but failed to copy the green/azure/maroon shape triggered by azure (4, 13). It also incorrectly treated the azure pixel at (13,7) (part of the green shape) as a trigger, leading to an incorrect (though ultimately overwritten or out-of-bounds) copy operation.\n- **Example 3 Failure**: The code's output is missing multiple copied templates. It incorrectly identified the green pixel at (4,3) as a trigger, which is actually part of the main template shape. It failed to identify the truly isolated blue pixels as triggers.\n\nThe core issue seems to be the definition of a \"trigger\". The code defines it as *any* single-pixel object. The analysis suggests triggers must be *isolated* single pixels (not adjacent, even diagonally, to any other non-background pixel). The rest of the logic (finding the largest template containing the trigger's color, using the top-left pixel of that color as the anchor, and copying) appears correct based on the examples when applied with the corrected trigger definition.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  Modify the object identification process to distinguish between multi-pixel objects (templates) and single-pixel objects.\n2.  For single-pixel objects, add a check to determine if they are \"isolated\" (no non-background neighbours in an 8-connected sense). Only isolated single pixels qualify as \"triggers\".\n3.  Apply the existing logic for template selection (largest containing trigger color) and copying (using the top-left anchor of the trigger color) for each identified trigger.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
