"""
This program simulates the movement of particles on a grid and marks their paths.

The input grid contains initial positions of two types of particles:
- Azure (8): Moves diagonally down-right (+1 row, +1 column) per step.
- Green (3): Moves diagonally down-left (+1 row, -1 column) per step.

The simulation proceeds in discrete steps. In each step:
1.  All particles attempt to move according to their current velocity.
2.  If a particle's intended move would take it outside the grid boundaries, it "bounces":
    - Its velocity component perpendicular to the boundary it hit is reversed for the *next* step.
    - Its landing position for the *current* step is adjusted to be on the boundary cell it collided with.
3.  The simulation records the landing position of each particle after potential bounces.
4.  An output grid, initially all background color (0), is updated based on these landings:
    - If an azure particle and a green particle land on the exact same cell in the same step, that cell in the output grid becomes Magenta (6).
    - If only azure particle(s) land on a cell, it becomes Azure (8).
    - If only green particle(s) land on a cell, it becomes Green (3).
    - This overwrites any color previously present in that cell of the output grid from earlier steps.
5.  Each particle's position is updated to its landing spot, and its velocity is updated (potentially having been reversed by a bounce) for the next step.

The simulation runs for a number of steps equal to the maximum of the grid's height or width.
The final state of the output grid, showing the traced paths and collision points, is returned.
