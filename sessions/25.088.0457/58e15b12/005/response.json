In each step:\n1.  All particles attempt to move according to their current velocity.\n2.  If a particle's intended move would take it outside the grid boundaries, it \"bounces\":\n    - Its velocity component perpendicular to the boundary it hit is reversed for the *next* step.\n    - Its landing position for the *current* step is adjusted to be on the boundary cell it collided with.\n3.  The simulation records the landing position of each particle after potential bounces.\n4.  An output grid, initially all background color (0), is updated based on these landings:\n    - If an azure particle and a green particle land on the exact same cell in the same step, that cell in the output grid becomes Magenta (6).\n    - If only azure particle(s) land on a cell, it becomes Azure (8).\n    - If only green particle(s) land on a cell, it becomes Green (3).\n    - This overwrites any color previously present in that cell of the output grid from earlier steps.\n5.  Each particle's position is updated to its landing spot, and its velocity is updated (potentially having been reversed by a bounce) for the next step.\n\nThe simulation runs for a number of steps equal to the maximum of the grid's height or width.\nThe final state of the output grid, showing the traced paths and collision points, is returned.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates particle movement and path tracing on a grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.ndarray): The input grid containing initial particle positions.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The output grid showing the traced paths and collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get grid dimensions\n    H, W = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions with background color 0\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Identify initial particles and their velocities\n    particles = []\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            color = input_grid[r, c]\n            if color == 8:  # Azure\n                # Initial position (r, c), color 8, velocity (+1, +1)\n                particles.append({'r': r, 'c': c, 'color': 8, 'dr': 1, 'dc': 1})\n            elif color == 3: # Green\n                # Initial position (r, c), color 3, velocity (+1, -1)\n                particles.append({'r': r, 'c': c, 'color': 3, 'dr': 1, 'dc': -1})\n\n    # Determine the number of simulation steps\n    # Using max(H, W) as a heuristic for sufficient steps to cover the grid.\n    num_steps = max(H, W)\n\n    # Run the simulation loop for the determined number of steps\n    for step in range(num_steps):\n        # Dictionary to track landings in the current step: {(r, c): set_of_colors}\n        landings_this_step = {}\n        # List to store the state (position, velocity) of each particle for the next step\n        next_particle_states = []\n\n        # --- Calculate Movement, Handle Bounces, and Record Landings for each particle ---\n        for i, p in enumerate(particles):\n            # Calculate potential next position based on current position and velocity\n            potential_r = p['r'] + p['dr']\n            potential_c = p['c'] + p['dc']\n\n            # Initialize the actual landing position for this step and the velocity for the next step\n            landed_r = potential_r\n            landed_c = potential_c\n            next_dr = p['dr']\n            next_dc = p['dc']\n\n            # --- Check for and handle boundary collisions (bounces) ---\n            # Vertical bounce check\n            if landed_r < 0:\n                landed_r = 0    # Land on the top boundary (row 0)\n                next_dr = 1   # Reverse vertical velocity for the next step\n            elif landed_r >= H:\n                landed_r = H -
