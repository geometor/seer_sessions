Initialization:\n        - Creates an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with background color (0).\n        - Identifies initial positions of azure (8) and green (3) particles from the input grid.\n        - Assigns initial velocities: azure moves down-right (+1, +1), green moves down-left (+1, -1).\n        - Stores particle information (position, color, velocity).\n    2. Simulation Loop:\n        - Runs for a number of steps equal to the maximum of the grid's height or width.\n        - In each step:\n            - Calculates the next position for each particle based on its current position and velocity.\n            - Handles boundary collisions (bounces): If a particle hits an edge, its velocity component perpendicular to that edge is reversed. The particle's position is adjusted to be on the boundary for that step.\n            - Records the landing position and color of each particle for the current step.\n            - Updates the output grid based on the landings in the current step:\n                - A priority system determines the color of a cell if multiple particles land on it or if it was previously colored: Magenta (6) > Azure (8) > Green (3) > Background (0).\n                - If both an azure and a green particle land on the same cell *in the same step*, the cell is marked Magenta (6) in the output grid (overriding any previous color).\n                - Otherwise, if one or more azure particles land on a cell, it's marked Azure (8), but only if its current color priority is lower than Azure (i.e., Green or Background).\n                - Otherwise, if one or more green particles land on a cell, it's marked Green (3), but only if its current color priority is lower than Green (i.e., Background).\n            - Updates each particle's position and velocity for the next step.\n    3.
