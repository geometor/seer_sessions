task_description: Simulate particle movement with bouncing, trails, and collisions on a grid.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - dimensions: variable (height x width)
objects:
  - type: particle
    color: azure (8)
    attributes:
      - position: (row, column)
      - velocity: (dr, dc)
    initial_state:
      - position: locations of color 8 in the input grid
      - velocity: (dr=1, dc=1)
    behavior:
      - move: update position by adding velocity each step
      - bounce: reverse velocity component perpendicular to edge upon hitting grid boundary
      - leaves_trail: yes
  - type: particle
    color: green (3)
    attributes:
      - position: (row, column)
      - velocity: (dr, dc)
    initial_state:
      - position: locations of color 3 in the input grid
      - velocity: (dr=1, dc=-1)
    behavior:
      - move: update position by adding velocity each step
      - bounce: reverse velocity component perpendicular to edge upon hitting grid boundary
      - leaves_trail: yes
simulation:
  - type: discrete_time
  - duration: steps = max(grid_height, grid_width)
  - output_grid: initialized as background color, updated each step
interactions_and_drawing:
  - rule: cell update per step
    conditions: particles landing on cell (r, c) at current step
    priority:
      1: azure (8) and green (3) land -> cell becomes magenta (6)
      2: azure (8) lands (and no green unless only other azure) -> cell becomes azure (8)
      3: green (3) lands (and no azure) -> cell becomes green (3)
    effect: updates the output_grid[r, c] based on the highest priority condition met by landing particles.
