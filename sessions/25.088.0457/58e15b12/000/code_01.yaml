task_description: Simulating bouncing particle trails with collisions.
grid_properties:
  size: Variable (height and width between 1x1 and 30x30).
  background_color: white (0).
objects:
  - type: particle
    color: azure (8)
    initial_state: Defined by input grid locations.
    behavior:
      - action: move
        direction: down-right (dr=+1, dc=+1) per step.
      - action: bounce
        trigger: hitting grid edge.
        effect: reverse velocity component perpendicular to the edge.
  - type: particle
    color: green (3)
    initial_state: Defined by input grid locations.
    behavior:
      - action: move
        direction: down-left (dr=+1, dc=-1) per step.
      - action: bounce
        trigger: hitting grid edge.
        effect: reverse velocity component perpendicular to the edge.
interactions:
  - type: collision
    participants:
      - azure (8) particle
      - green (3) particle
    trigger: both particles landing on the same cell (r, c) in the same step.
    effect: the cell (r, c) in the output grid is set to magenta (6) for that step.
  - type: overlap (non-collision or same-color collision)
    participants: one or more particles landing on the same cell (r, c) in the same step.
    trigger: particles landing on the same cell, excluding the azure+green collision case.
    effect: the cell (r, c) in the output grid is set based on priority (azure > green) for that step.
simulation_parameters:
  duration: number of steps equal to max(grid_height, grid_width).
  output_grid: Starts as all white (0), accumulates colored pixels from particle trails and collisions at each step.
drawing_rule:
  - At each step, for every cell (r, c):
    - Identify all particles landing at (r, c).
    - If both azure and green particles land there: set output_grid[r, c] = 6 (magenta).
    - Else if any azure particles land there: set output_grid[r, c] = 8 (azure).
    - Else if any green particles land there: set output_grid[r, c] = 3 (green).
    - (This implies overwriting previous colors in the output grid at each step based on current landings).
