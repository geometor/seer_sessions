"""
Simulates the movement of azure (8) and green (3) particles on a grid.
The input grid defines the starting positions. Azure particles move down-right (+1,+1) 
and green particles move down-left (+1,-1). Particles bounce off grid edges, 
reversing the velocity component perpendicular to the edge. They leave trails 
of their color. If an azure and a green particle land on the same cell in the 
same step, the cell becomes magenta (6). Otherwise, if multiple particles land 
on the same cell, azure (8) takes priority over green (3). The simulation runs 
for max(height, width) steps. The output grid accumulates the trails and 
collision points.
