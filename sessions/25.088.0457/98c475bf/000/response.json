            "text": "**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 20x20 grid.\n2.  **Border:** Each input grid has a single-pixel-thick border of a consistent color (Maroon, Orange, Gray, Red). This border is preserved in the output.\n3.  **Background:** The background color is consistently White (0).\n4.  **Anchor Pixels:** Each input grid contains exactly two identical, non-border, non-background pixels situated symmetrically on the same row, specifically at column 1 and column 18 (relative to 0-based indexing). The color and row of these 'anchor' pixels are crucial.\n    *   Train_1: Orange (7) at row 9.\n    *   Train_2: Magenta (6) at row 13.\n    *   Train_3: Red (2) at row 15.\n    *   Train_4: Blue (1) at row 3.\n5.  **Pattern Object:** Each input grid also contains one larger, contiguous 'pattern object' of a single color, distinct from the border, background, and anchor pixel colors. This object is always removed in the output. Its shape, color, and position vary between examples.\n6.  **Output Object:** The output grid contains only the border and a new 'H-like' object.\n    *   The *color* of the output object matches the color of the input anchor pixels.\n    *   The *shape* of the output object is uniquely determined by the anchor pixel color. There are four specific H-like shapes associated with the four observed anchor colors (Orange, Magenta, Red, Blue).\n    *   The *vertical position* of the output object is determined by the row of the input anchor pixels; the anchor row becomes the vertical center row of the output H-like shape.\n    *   The *horizontal position* of the output object is fixed and also appears to be determined solely by the anchor pixel color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
