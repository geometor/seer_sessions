task_context:
  grid_size: [20, 20]
  background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - role: border
    description: A single-pixel thick frame around the grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (9, 7, 5, 2), consistent within an example pair.
      persistence: Preserved from input to output.
  - role: anchor_pixels
    description: A pair of identical pixels, horizontally symmetrical on the same row.
    properties:
      count: 2
      color: C (Varies: 7, 6, 2, 1), consistent within the pair.
      row: R (Varies: 9, 13, 15, 3).
      columns: [1, 18] (0-based index).
      persistence: Removed in output (implicitly define output object).
      relationship: Determine the color, shape, vertical position, and horizontal position of the output_object.
  - role: pattern_object
    description: A larger contiguous shape, distinct from border and anchors.
    properties:
      color: P (Varies: 6, 1, 7, 3), different from border and anchor colors.
      shape: Varies (H-like, etc.).
      location: Varies (quadrants).
      persistence: Removed in output.
      relationship: Its presence signals the transformation, but its specific features (color, shape, location) do not directly map to output features, other than potentially being irrelevant noise or a trigger.
  - role: output_object
    description: An 'H-like' shape generated in the output.
    properties:
      color: C (same as input anchor_pixels color).
      shape: Determined by color C (4 specific H-variants).
      vertical_position: Centered on row R (from input anchor_pixels row).
      horizontal_position: Fixed column start, determined by color C.
      persistence: Only exists in the output.
transformation:
  actions:
    - Identify border color B.
    - Identify anchor pixels (color C, row R).
    - Identify and mentally discard the pattern_object.
    - Select output shape based on C.
    - Determine output column based on C.
    - Construct output grid with border B.
    - Draw the selected shape with color C at the calculated row/column position.
