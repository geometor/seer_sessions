**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 20x20 grid.
2.  **Border:** Each input grid has a single-pixel-thick border of a consistent color (Maroon, Orange, Gray, Red). This border is preserved in the output.
3.  **Background:** The background color is consistently White (0).
4.  **Anchor Pixels:** Each input grid contains exactly two identical, non-border, non-background pixels situated symmetrically on the same row, specifically at column 1 and column 18 (relative to 0-based indexing). The color and row of these 'anchor' pixels are crucial.
    *   Train_1: Orange (7) at row 9.
    *   Train_2: Magenta (6) at row 13.
    *   Train_3: Red (2) at row 15.
    *   Train_4: Blue (1) at row 3.
5.  **Pattern Object:** Each input grid also contains one larger, contiguous 'pattern object' of a single color, distinct from the border, background, and anchor pixel colors. This object is always removed in the output. Its shape, color, and position vary between examples.
6.  **Output Object:** The output grid contains only the border and a new 'H-like' object.
    *   The *color* of the output object matches the color of the input anchor pixels.
    *   The *shape* of the output object is uniquely determined by the anchor pixel color. There are four specific H-like shapes associated with the four observed anchor colors (Orange, Magenta, Red, Blue).
    *   The *vertical position* of the output object is determined by the row of the input anchor pixels; the anchor row becomes the vertical center row of the output H-like shape.
    *   The *horizontal position* of the output object is fixed and also appears to be determined solely by the anchor pixel color.

objects:
  - role: border
    description: A single-pixel thick frame around the grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (9, 7, 5, 2), consistent within an example pair.
      persistence: Preserved from input to output.
  - role: anchor_pixels
    description: A pair of identical pixels, horizontally symmetrical on the same row.
    properties:
      count: 2
      color: C (Varies: 7, 6, 2, 1), consistent within the pair.
      row: R (Varies: 9, 13, 15, 3).
      columns: [1, 18] (0-based index).
      persistence: Removed in output (implicitly define output object).
      relationship: Determine the color, shape, vertical position, and horizontal position of the output_object.
  - role: pattern_object
    description: A larger contiguous shape, distinct from border and anchors.
    properties:
      color: P (Varies: 6, 1, 7, 3), different from border and anchor colors.
      shape: Varies (H-like, etc.).
      location: Varies (quadrants).
      persistence: Removed in output.
      relationship: Its presence signals the transformation, but its specific features (color, shape, location) do not directly map to output features, other than potentially being irrelevant noise or a trigger.
  - role: output_object
    description: An 'H-like' shape generated in the output.
    properties:
      color: C (same as input anchor_pixels color).
      shape: Determined by color C (4 specific H-variants).
      vertical_position: Centered on row R (from input anchor_pixels row).
      horizontal_position: Fixed column start, determined by color C.
      persistence: Only exists in the output.

  actions:
    - Identify border color B.
    - Identify anchor pixels (color C, row R).
    - Identify and mentally discard the pattern_object.
    - Select output shape based on C.
    - Determine output column based on C.
    - Construct output grid with border B.
    - Draw the selected shape with color C at the calculated row/column position.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the color (B) of the single-pixel border frame in the input grid.
2.  Identify the pair of identical, non-border, non-background pixels located at columns 1 and 18 on the same row (R). Record their color (C) and row (R).
3.  Identify the remaining, larger contiguous object ('pattern object') and ignore it.
4.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Draw the border onto the output grid using color B.
6.  Select the specific H-like output shape pattern, its height (H), its center row offset (CRO), and its starting column (Col) based *only* on the anchor pixel color (C):
    *   If C is Orange (7): Use the 5x3 H shape (filled middle bar), H=5, CRO=2, Col=13.
    *   If C is Magenta (6): Use the 6x3 H shape (filled top, middle, bottom bars), H=6, CRO=2, Col=2.
    *   If C is Red (2): Use the 5x3 H shape (sparse middle bar), H=5, CRO=2, Col=6.
    *   If C is Blue (1): Use the
