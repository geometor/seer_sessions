**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it incorrectly identified the features in the input grid that determine the output grid's transformation. Specifically:
1.  It seemed to use arbitrary shapes present in the input (like the magenta H in example 1 or the orange H in example 3) to determine the *type* of H-shape to draw in the output, rather than using the "anchor pixels".
2.  It incorrectly used the *border* color to draw the output H-shape instead of the *anchor pixel* color.
3.  The placement logic, while attempting vertical centering, was likely flawed due to using the wrong reference points or offsets.

The strategy for resolving these errors is to correctly identify the crucial input elements: the border color and the pair of "anchor" pixels located at fixed columns (1 and 18). The color and row of these anchor pixels, along with the border color, are the sole determinants of the output grid. The other shapes in the input are distractors and should be ignored.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze the key properties for each example:
