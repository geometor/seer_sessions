task_description: Extracts colors from solid, monochromatic rectangles in the input grid and arranges them into a new grid based on a specific sorting and reshaping rule.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers 0-9
    description: Represents the input and output structures. 0 is background (white).
  - name: object
    type: solid monochromatic rectangle
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color (1-9) that perfectly fills its rectangular bounding box.
    properties:
      - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels forming the rectangle.
      - top_left_coordinate: The (row, column) index of the top-most, left-most pixel of the rectangle.

input_processing:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Find all unique 'object' instances (solid monochromatic rectangles) within the input grid. Disregard the background (color 0).
  - action: sort_objects
    description: Sort the identified objects based on their 'top_left_coordinate', primarily by row index (ascending) and secondarily by column index (ascending).
  - action: extract_colors
    description: Create an ordered list of the 'color' property from the sorted objects.

output_generation:
  - action: determine_dimensions
    description: >
      Calculate the dimensions (R, C) for the output grid based on the total number
      of identified objects (N). Find integer factors R and C such that R * C = N.
      Choose the pair (R, C) that minimizes the absolute difference |R - C|. If there
      is a tie (e.g., for N=12, |3-4|=1 and |4-3|=1), choose the pair with the smaller
      number of rows (R).
    variables:
      - N: count of identified objects
      - R: number of rows in the output grid
      - C: number of columns in the output grid
    constraints:
      - R * C == N
      - minimize |R - C|
      - minimize R (for ties in difference)
  - action: reshape_colors
    description: Arrange the extracted list of colors into the R x C output grid in row-major order (filling rows from left to right, then moving to the next row).
    variables:
      - sorted_colors: The ordered list of colors from 'extract_colors'.
      - R: Output rows from 'determine_dimensions'.
      - C: Output columns from 'determine_dimensions'.
