"""
Identifies all solid, monochromatic, non-white rectangles within the input grid.
Sorts these rectangles based on their top-left corner coordinates (first by row, then by column).
Extracts the colors of the sorted rectangles.
Determines the dimensions (R, C) for the output grid such that R * C equals the total number of rectangles (N), 
the absolute difference |R - C| is minimized, and R is minimized in case of ties.
Arranges the extracted colors into the R x C output grid in row-major order.
