Within this noise, there are distinct, solid rectangular blocks, each composed of a single non-white color. The output grids are much smaller and seem to summarize information about these rectangular blocks found in the input.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  The core elements of interest in the input are solid, monochromatic rectangles. Colors like green, blue, maroon, magenta, yellow, azure, red, and orange form these rectangles in the examples.\n2.  Other non-white pixels exist in the input but do not form solid rectangles (e.g., isolated pixels, L-shapes, or other irregular groups). These seem to be ignored.\n3.  The output grid's values correspond directly to the colors of the identified rectangular blocks in the input.\n4.  The order of colors in the output grid follows the reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of the top-left corners of the corresponding rectangles in the input grid.\n5.  The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the total number of valid rectangular blocks found (N). The dimensions (R, C) are chosen such that R * C = N, and the grid is as close to square as possible (minimizing |R - C|). If multiple factor pairs result in the same minimal difference, the pair with the smaller number of rows (R) is chosen.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Create a boolean grid of the same size as the input to keep track of visited pixels, initialized to `False`.\n3.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid by row, then by column.\n4.  If the current cell's color is not white (0) and the cell has not been visited:\n    a.  Record the color of the current cell.\n    b.  Perform a search (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Flood Fill) starting from the current cell to find all connected cells of the same color. Mark all found cells as visited.\n    c.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices (bounding box) of the found connected component.\n    d.  Calculate the expected number of pixels in a solid rectangle defined by this bounding box: `(max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)`.\n    e.  Compare the actual number of pixels found in the connected component with the expected number for a solid rectangle.\n    f.  If the numbers match (meaning the component forms a solid rectangle), store the rectangle's color and its top-left corner coordinates (min_row, min_col) in the list of identified rectangles.\n5.  Sort the list of identified rectangles based first on the row coordinate and then on the column coordinate of their top-left corner.\n6.  Create a new list containing only the colors of the rectangles in the sorted order.\n7.  Let N be the total number of identified rectangles (the length of the sorted list).\n8.  Find all pairs of factors (r, c) such that `r * c = N`.\n9.  Select the factor pair (R, C) that minimizes the absolute difference `|R - C|`. If there's a tie (multiple pairs have the same minimum difference), select the pair with the smallest value for R.\n10. Create a new output grid with R rows and C columns.\n11. Fill the output grid row by row, left to right, using the colors from the sorted list created in step 6.\n12. Return the populated output grid."
