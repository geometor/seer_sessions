Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: 30x30
    - Contains pixels with values 0-9 (colors).
    - Primarily white (0) background.
  Objects:
    - Type: Solid Rectangles
      Properties:
        - Composed of a single, non-white color.
        - Contiguous block of pixels.
        - All pixels within their bounding box belong to the rectangle.
        - Have a color.
        - Have a location (defined by top-left corner).
        - Have dimensions (height, width).
    - Type: Noise Pixels
      Properties:
        - Non-white pixels.
        - Do not form solid rectangles (isolated or irregular shapes).
        - Are ignored in the transformation.

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Size: Variable (e.g., 2x3, 3x3). Determined by the number of input rectangles.
    - Contains pixels representing the colors of the input rectangles.
  Relationship to Input:
    - Each cell's value is the color of one input rectangle.
    - The order of colors corresponds to the reading order (top-left corner) of the input rectangles.
    - The dimensions (R, C) are derived from the total count (N) of input rectangles, minimizing |R - C| and then R.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify solid, monochromatic, non-white rectangles in the input.
  Action: Sort identified rectangles by their top-left corner (row, then column).
  Action: Extract the colors of the sorted rectangles into a list.
  Action: Determine the output grid dimensions (R, C) based on the rectangle count N.
  Action: Populate the R x C output grid with the extracted colors in order.
