Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify all L-shapes:** Scan the input grid for any L-shapes. An L-shape consists of exactly three pixels of the same non-white color (colors 1 through 9) that occupy three out of four cells in any 2x2 square. Record the color and the set of coordinates for each L-shape found.
2.  **Determine the Fill Color:** Examine the identified L-shapes. Find the L-shape(s) whose color is *not* azure (color 8). The color of this non-azure L-shape is the "Fill Color". (Based on the examples, there appears to be only one such non-azure color present per grid). If no non-azure L-shapes are found, return the original grid.
3.  **Collect all L-shape Pixel Coordinates:** Create a single set containing the coordinates of all pixels that are part of *any* identified L-shape (both azure and non-azure). These pixels will be preserved.
4.  **Calculate the Global Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by *any* non-white pixel (colors 1 through 9) in the input grid. This defines the rectangular region for the filling operation. If no non-white pixels exist, return the original grid.
5.  **Generate the Output Grid:**
    a.  Start with a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Iterate through every cell (row `r`, column `c`) within the Global Bounding Box (from `min_row` to `max_row`, and `min_col` to `max_col`, inclusive).
    c.  For each cell `(r, c)`, check if its coordinates are present in the set of collected L-shape pixel coordinates.
    d.  If the coordinates `(r, c)` are *not* in the L-shape coordinates set, change the color of this cell in the output grid to the determined Fill Color.
    e.  If the coordinates `(r, c)` *are* in the L-shape coordinates set, leave the cell's color unchanged (it keeps its original L-shape color).
    f.  All cells outside the Global Bounding Box remain unchanged from the input grid.
6.  Return the modified grid.

**Analysis of Metrics and Observations:**

1.  **L-Shape Detection:** The `find_l_shapes` function seems to work correctly, identifying multiple L-shapes of different colors, including multiple azure (8) L-shapes and one non-azure L-shape in each example (Blue=1, Orange=7, Green=3 for examples 1, 2, 3 respectively). This confirms the non-azure L-shape color is the intended "fill color". My previous implementation had a bug where it didn't handle multiple L-shapes correctly in the detection logic (fixed in the tool code above by checking for duplicates).
2.  **Pixel Preservation:** The `tool_code` output confirms that *all* original non-white pixels (both L-shape pixels and single pixels/other shapes) are present in the expected output grids. The previous code's assumption of only preserving L-shape pixels was wrong.
3.  **Fill Area:** The "Global Bounding Box" approach is incorrect. The filled areas in the expected outputs are complex and do not simply fill the entire rectangle defined by the outermost non-white pixels.
    *   In Example 1, the blue (1) fill seems constrained, roughly between columns 10 and 17, and rows 4 and 21, but it doesn't fill *everything* white in that box. It respects the existing non-white pixels.
    *   In Example 2, the orange (7) fill is similarly complex, bounded roughly by rows 0-22 and columns 9-15, again respecting existing pixels.
    *   In Example 3, the green (3) fill area is also irregular, respecting existing pixels.
4.  **Fill Logic:** The fill doesn't simply replace white pixels. It seems to "flood fill" from somewhere, stopping when it hits *any* non-white pixel (from the original input). Where does the flood fill start?
    *   Hypothesis 1: Flood fill starts from the pixels *of the non-azure L-shape*.
    *   Hypothesis 2: Flood fill starts from the *bounding box* of the non-azure L-shape. (The code output shows these boxes are small, so this is unlikely).
    *   Hypothesis 3: Flood fill occurs within the bounding box of *all* L-shapes combined?
    *   Hypothesis 4: Flood fill occurs within the global bounding box, but only affects white pixels that are somehow "connected" to the non-azure L-shape.
5.  **Revisiting Example 1:**
    *   Fill color: Blue (1).
    *   Non-azure L-shape: Blue (1) at {(4, 10), (4, 11), (5, 10)}.
    *   Azure L-shapes: {(4, 15), (4, 16), (5, 16)}, {(10, 10), (11, 10), (11, 11)}, {(10, 16), (11, 15), (11, 16)}.
    *   Other pixels preserved: Many.
    *   Fill Area: Roughly rows 4-21, cols 10-17. Notice the bounding box for *all* L-shapes combined: Rows 4-11, Cols 10-16. This looks closer.
    *   Consider the grid area defined by the min/max rows and cols of *all L-shape pixels* (rows 4-11, cols 10-16). If we take this area, preserve all original non-white pixels within it, and flood-fill the remaining white pixels with the fill color (blue=1), would that work? Let's test this idea.

**Revised Strategy:**

1.  Find all L-shapes (azure and non-azure).
2.  Identify the non-azure L-shape color as the fill color. If none, return input.
3.  Collect the coordinates of *all* pixels belonging to *any* L-shape.
4.  Determine the bounding box that encloses *only the pixels of all identified L-shapes*. If no L-shapes, return input.
5.  Create the output grid:
    *   Start with a copy of the input.
    *   Iterate through the cells *within the L-shape bounding box*.
    *   If the cell's color in the *original input* was white (0), change it to the fill color.
    *   Leave all other cells (non-white inside the box, and everything outside the box) as they were in the input.

This seems much more plausible and consistent with the visual results, especially the preservation of all original non-white pixels and the more constrained fill area.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed:
1.  Only L-shape pixels should be preserved.
2.  The fill area was the global bounding box of *all* non-white pixels.

The analysis revealed:
1.  *All* original non-white pixels must be preserved.
2.  The fill color is determined by the single non-azure L-shape present in each grid.
3.  The fill operation seems confined to a bounding box defined by the extent of *all* L-shapes (both azure and non-azure).
4.  Within this L-shape bounding box, only pixels that were originally white (0) are changed to the fill color.

The strategy is to refine the definition of the fill area and the preservation rule:
1.  Correctly identify all L-shapes and the fill color (non-azure L-shape color).
2.  Determine the bounding box enclosing only the pixels belonging to these L-shapes.
3.  Apply the fill color only to the originally white pixels within this specific bounding box, leaving all other pixels (inside and outside the box) unchanged from the input.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Fill specific regions of a grid based on L-shapes, preserving original non-white pixels.

definitions:
  - object: L-shape
    description: Exactly three pixels of the same non-white color occupying 3 cells of a 2x2 square.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels (1-9).
      - coordinates: A set of 3 (row, col) tuples defining the shape's location.
      - type: Can be 'azure' (color 8) or 'non-azure' (colors 1-7, 9).

input_features:
  - L-shapes: Multiple L-shapes of various colors can exist.
  - fill_color_source: Exactly one non-azure L-shape exists per grid, its color determines the fill color.
  - azure_L-shapes: One or more azure (color 8) L-shapes exist.
  - other_pixels: Pixels not part of any L-shape can exist with non-white colors.

derived_features:
  - fill_color: The color of the single non-azure L-shape.
  - all_L_shape_pixels: The set of coordinates covered by *any* L-shape (azure or non-azure).
  - L_shape_bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels from `all_L_shape_pixels`.

transformations:
  - action: identify_L-shapes
    input: input_grid
    output: list of L-shapes (color, coordinates).
  - action: determine_fill_color
    input: list of L-shapes
    output: fill_color (integer).
  - action: determine_L_shape_bounding_box
    input: list of L-shapes
    output: bounding_box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - action: generate_output
    input: input_grid, fill_color, L_shape_bounding_box
    process:
      1. Copy input_grid to output_grid.
      2. Iterate through each cell (r, c) within the L_shape_bounding_box.
      3. If input_grid[r, c] is white (0):
         Set output_grid[r, c] = fill_color.
      4. Otherwise (if input_grid[r, c] is non-white):
         Keep output_grid[r, c] unchanged from input_grid[r, c].
      5. Cells outside the L_shape_bounding_box remain unchanged.
    output: output_grid

edge_cases:
  - If no L-shapes are found, return the input grid unchanged.
  - If no non-azure L-shape is found (only azure or no L-shapes), return the input grid unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify L-Shapes:** Scan the input grid to find all "L-shapes". An L-shape consists of exactly three pixels of the same non-white color (1-9) occupying three out of the four cells in any 2x2 square. Record the color and the set of three coordinate pairs for each distinct L-shape found.
2.  **Determine Fill Color:** Examine the identified L-shapes. Find the *single* L-shape whose color is *not* azure (color 8). The color of this L-shape is the "Fill Color". If no L-shapes are found, or if only azure L-shapes are found, return the original input grid unchanged.
3.  **Define Fill Region:** Collect the coordinates of all pixels belonging to *any* identified L-shape (both the non-azure one and all azure ones). Calculate the minimum bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) that encloses all these collected L-shape coordinates. This is the "L-shape Bounding Box".
4.  **Generate Output Grid:**
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid. This will be the output grid.
    b.  Iterate through every cell (row `r`, column `c`) located *within* the L-shape Bounding Box (inclusive).
    c.  For each cell `(r, c)` inside the box, check its color in the *original input grid*.
    d.  If the original color of cell `(r, c)` was white (0), change the color of this cell in the output grid to the determined Fill Color.
    e.  If the original color of cell `(r, c)` was *not* white (i.e., it was 1-9, whether part of an L-shape or not), leave its color unchanged in the output grid (it retains its original color).
    f.  All cells *outside* the L-shape Bounding Box remain unchanged from the input grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
