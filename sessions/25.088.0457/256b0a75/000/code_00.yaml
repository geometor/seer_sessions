elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background: predominantly white (0)
      - foreground: contains scattered pixels and specific objects
  - type: object
    identifier: L-shape
    properties:
      - composition: 3 pixels of the same color
      - geometry: occupies 3 cells of a 2x2 square
      - roles:
          - marker: defines a bounding box
          - color_source: determines fill color (if not azure)
      - subtypes:
          - azure_L_shape: color is azure (8)
          - non_azure_L_shape: color is not azure (8)

actions:
  - action: find_objects
    target: L-shape
    criteria: geometry and pixel count (3)
  - action: group_objects
    source: L-shapes
    criteria: color (azure vs. non-azure)
  - action: determine_fill_color
    source: non_azure_L_shape(s)
    result: single color value (color of the non-azure L-shape)
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    source: all L-shapes (azure and non-azure)
    result: rectangular region coordinates (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col)
  - action: fill_region
    target: area within the bounding_box
    color: fill_color
    condition: only fill pixels that were NOT part of any identified L-shape in the input

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The bounding box is defined by the spatial extent (min/max coordinates) of all L-shapes combined.
  - type: conditional_coloring
    description: The fill color for the bounding box is derived from the color of the non-azure L-shape(s).
  - type: preservation
    description: Pixels belonging to any L-shape are preserved; they are not overwritten by the fill color, even if inside the bounding box. Pixels outside the bounding box are also preserved.
