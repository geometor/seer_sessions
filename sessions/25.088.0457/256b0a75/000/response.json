These are objects composed of exactly three pixels of the same color, arranged such that they occupy three of the four cells in a 2x2 square.\n2.  **Shape Roles**: There seem to be two types of L-shapes based on color: azure (color 8) and non-azure (colors 1, 7, 3 in the examples). Both types contribute to defining the area to be modified.\n3.  **Bounding Box**: A rectangular area is determined by finding the minimum bounding box that encompasses *all* identified L-shapes (both azure and non-azure).\n4.  **Fill Color**: The color used to fill the rectangle is determined by the color of the non-azure L-shape(s). The examples suggest there will be exactly one color for non-azure L-shapes.\n5.  **Transformation**: The output grid is created by taking the input grid and modifying the region within the calculated bounding box. Pixels inside the bounding box are changed to the fill color, *unless* they were part of one of the originally identified L-shapes. Pixels belonging to the L-shapes, and all pixels outside the bounding box, retain their original colors from the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Assume there is exactly one such color among all non-azure L-shapes found. This color is the `fill_color`.\n4.  **Collect** the coordinates of all pixels belonging to *any* identified L-shape (both azure and non-azure).\n5.  **Calculate** the minimum bounding box that encloses all collected L-shape pixel coordinates.

For each cell (`r`, `c`) inside the bounding box, check if its coordinates are present in the collection of L-shape pixel coordinates identified in step 4.\n9.  If the cell (`r`, `c`) is *within* the bounding box but its coordinates are *not* in the L-shape pixel collection, **change** the color of this cell in the output grid to the `fill_color` determined in step 3.\n10. **Output** the modified grid."
