task_description: Fill a rectangular region based on L-shapes and global pixel bounds.

definitions:
  - object: L-shape
    description: A group of exactly 3 pixels of the same non-white color occupying 3 cells of a 2x2 square.
    properties:
      - color: (Integer 1-9, excluding 8 for 'fill_color' determination)
      - coordinates: (Set of 3 (row, col) tuples)
      - type: (azure (8) or non-azure)
  - object: Azure L-shape
    description: An L-shape with color 8 (azure).
  - object: Non-Azure L-shape
    description: An L-shape with a color other than 0 (white) or 8 (azure).
    notes: Assumed to be only one color type present per grid among these.
  - object: Fill Color
    description: The color used to fill the target region.
    derivation: Determined by the color of the Non-Azure L-shape(s).
  - object: Global Bounding Box
    description: The smallest rectangle enclosing all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - min_row: (Integer)
      - max_row: (Integer)
      - min_col: (Integer)
      - max_col: (Integer)
  - object: Target Fill Region
    description: All cells within the Global Bounding Box.
  - object: Preserved Pixels
    description: Pixels within the Target Fill Region that retain their original color.
    derivation: These are the pixels belonging to *any* L-shape (azure or non-azure).

actions:
  - action: Identify L-shapes
    inputs: [Input Grid]
    outputs: [List of L-shapes (color, coordinates)]
  - action: Determine Fill Color
    inputs: [List of L-shapes]
    outputs: [Fill Color]
    logic: Find the color of the first Non-Azure L-shape.
  - action: Calculate Global Bounding Box
    inputs: [Input Grid]
    outputs: [Global Bounding Box (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)]
    logic: Find min/max row/col of all non-white pixels.
  - action: Generate Output Grid
    inputs: [Input Grid, List of L-shapes, Fill Color, Global Bounding Box]
    outputs: [Output Grid]
    logic:
      1. Copy Input Grid to Output Grid.
      2. Identify all pixel coordinates belonging to any L-shape (Preserved Pixels).
      3. Iterate through each cell (r, c) within the Global Bounding Box.
      4. If (r, c) is NOT in the set of Preserved Pixels, set Output Grid[r, c] = Fill Color.
      5. Cells outside the Global Bounding Box remain unchanged from the input.
