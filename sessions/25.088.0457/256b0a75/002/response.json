            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies and refine the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the concept of L-shapes and the idea of using a non-azure L-shape color for filling. However, the results show that the filled area in the expected outputs is significantly larger and differently defined than the bounding box of just the L-shapes. The code failed because it incorrectly determined the region to be filled.\n\nThe expected outputs suggest a rectangular fill bounded not by the L-shapes alone, but by the extent of *all* non-white pixels in the input grid. The fill color is determined by the non-azure L-shape, and the L-shapes themselves (both azure and non-azure) are preserved (i.e., not overwritten by the fill color) within this larger bounding box. All other pixels *within* this bounding box, whether originally white or a different color, are changed to the fill color. Pixels *outside* this bounding box remain unchanged.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify L-shape detection:** Ensure the `find_l_shapes` function correctly identifies all L-shapes (3 pixels of the same non-white color in a 2x2 square).\n2.  **Identify Fill Color:** Find the color of the non-azure L-shape(s). Assume there is only one such color across the examples.\n3.  **Determine Global Bounding Box:** Find the minimum bounding box that encloses *all* non-white pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Apply Fill:** Create the output grid by copying the input. Iterate through every cell within the global bounding box. If the cell's coordinates do not belong to any identified L-shape (azure or non-azure), set its color to the fill color. Otherwise, keep the L-shape's original color. Cells outside the bounding box remain untouched.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"

An L-shape consists of exactly three pixels of the same non-white color (colors 1 through 9) that occupy three out of four cells in any 2x2 square. Record the color and the set of coordinates for each L-shape found.\n2.  **Determine the Fill Color:** Examine the identified L-shapes. Find the L-shape(s) whose color is *not* azure (color 8). The color of this non-azure L-shape is the \"Fill Color\". (Based on the examples, there appears to be only one such non-azure color present per grid). If no non-azure L-shapes are found, this rule may not apply (though this case is not present in the examples).\n3.  **Collect all L-shape Pixel Coordinates:** Create a single set containing the coordinates of all pixels that are part of *any* identified L-shape (both azure and non-azure). These pixels will be preserved.\n4.  **Calculate the Global Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by *any* non-white pixel (colors 1 through 9) in the input grid. This defines the rectangular region for the filling operation.\n5.  **Generate the Output Grid:**\n    a.  Start with a copy of the input grid.\n    b.  Iterate through every cell (row `r`, column `c`) within the Global Bounding Box (from `min_row` to `max_row`, and `min_col` to `max_col`, inclusive).\n    c.  For each cell `(r, c)`, check if its coordinates are present in the set of collected L-shape pixel coordinates.\n    d.  If the coordinates `(r, c)` are *not* in the L-shape coordinates set, change the color of this cell in the output grid to the determined Fill Color.\n    e.  If the coordinates `(r, c)` *are* in the L-shape coordinates set, leave the cell's color unchanged (it keeps its original L-shape color).\n    f.  All cells outside the Global Bounding Box remain unchanged from the input grid.\n6.  Return the modified grid."
