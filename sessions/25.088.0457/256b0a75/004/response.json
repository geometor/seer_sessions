            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics and Observations:**\n\n1.  **L-Shape Detection:** The `find_l_shapes` function seems to work correctly, identifying multiple L-shapes of different colors, including multiple azure (8) L-shapes and one non-azure L-shape in each example (Blue=1, Orange=7, Green=3 for examples 1, 2, 3 respectively). This confirms the non-azure L-shape color is the intended \"fill color\". My previous implementation had a bug where it didn't handle multiple L-shapes correctly in the detection logic (fixed in the tool code above by checking for duplicates).\n2.  **Pixel Preservation:** The `tool_code` output confirms that *all* original non-white pixels (both L-shape pixels and single pixels/other shapes) are present in the expected output grids. The previous code's assumption of only preserving L-shape pixels was wrong.\n3.  **Fill Area:** The \"Global Bounding Box\" approach is incorrect. The filled areas in the expected outputs are complex and do not simply fill the entire rectangle defined by the outermost non-white pixels.\n    *   In Example 1, the blue (1) fill seems constrained, roughly between columns 10 and 17, and rows 4 and 21, but it doesn't fill *everything* white in that box. It respects the existing non-white pixels.\n    *   In Example 2, the orange (7) fill is similarly complex, bounded roughly by rows 0-22 and columns 9-15, again respecting existing pixels.\n    *   In Example 3, the green (3) fill area is also irregular, respecting existing pixels.\n4.  **Fill Logic:** The fill doesn't simply replace white pixels. It seems to \"flood fill\" from somewhere, stopping when it hits *any* non-white pixel (from the original input). Where does the flood fill start?\n    *   Hypothesis 1: Flood fill starts from the pixels *of the non-azure L-shape*.\n    *   Hypothesis 2: Flood fill starts from the *bounding box* of the non-azure L-shape. (The code output shows these boxes are small, so this is unlikely).\n    *   Hypothesis 3: Flood fill occurs within the bounding box of *all* L-shapes combined?\n    *   Hypothesis 4: Flood fill occurs within the global bounding box, but only affects white pixels that are somehow \"connected\" to the non-azure L-shape.\n5.  **Revisiting Example 1:**\n    *   Fill color: Blue (1).\n    *   Non-azure L-shape: Blue (1) at {(4, 10), (4, 11), (5, 10)}.\n    *   Azure L-shapes: {(4, 15), (4, 16), (5, 16)}, {(10, 10), (11, 10), (11, 11)}, {(10, 16), (11, 15), (11, 16)}.\n    *   Other pixels preserved: Many.\n    *   Fill Area: Roughly rows 4-21, cols 10-17. Notice the bounding box for *all* L-shapes combined: Rows 4-11, Cols 10-16. This looks closer.\n    *   Consider the grid area defined by the min/max rows and cols of *all L-shape pixels* (rows 4-11, cols 10-16). If we take this area, preserve all original non-white pixels within it, and flood-fill the remaining white pixels with the fill color (blue=1), would that work? Let's test this idea.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  Find all L-shapes (azure and non-azure).\n2.  Identify the non-azure L-shape color as the fill color. If none, return input.\n3.  Collect the coordinates of *all* pixels belonging to *any* L-shape.\n4.  Determine the bounding box that encloses *only the pixels of all identified L-shapes*. If no L-shapes, return input.\n5.  Create the output grid:\n    *   Start with a copy of the input.\n    *   Iterate through the cells *within the L-shape bounding box*.\n    *   If the cell's color in the *original input* was white (0), change it to the fill color.\n    *   Leave all other cells (non-white inside the box, and everything outside the box) as they were in the input.\n\nThis seems much more plausible and consistent with the visual results, especially the preservation of all original non-white pixels and the more constrained fill area.\n\n---\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed:\n1.  Only L-shape pixels should be preserved.\n2.  The fill area was the global bounding box of *all* non-white pixels.\n\nThe analysis revealed:\n1.  *All* original non-white pixels must be preserved.\n2.  The fill color is determined by the single non-azure L-shape present in each grid.\n3.  The fill operation seems confined to a bounding box defined by the extent of *all* L-shapes (both azure and non-azure).\n4.  Within this L-shape bounding box, only pixels that were originally white (0) are changed to the fill color.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the definition of the fill area and the preservation rule:\n1.  Correctly identify all L-shapes and the fill color (non-azure L-shape color).\n2.  Determine the bounding box enclosing only the pixels belonging to these L-shapes.\n3.  Apply the fill color only to the originally white pixels within this specific bounding box, leaving all other pixels (inside and outside the box) unchanged from the input.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"

An L-shape consists of exactly three pixels of the same non-white color (1-9) occupying three out of the four cells in any 2x2 square. Record the color and the set of three coordinate pairs for each distinct L-shape found.\n2.  **Determine Fill Color:** Examine the identified L-shapes. Find the *single* L-shape whose color is *not* azure (color 8). The color of this L-shape is the \"Fill Color\". If no L-shapes are found, or if only azure L-shapes are found, return the original input grid unchanged.\n3.  **Define Fill Region:** Collect the coordinates of all pixels belonging to *any* identified L-shape (both the non-azure one and all azure ones). Calculate the minimum bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column) that encloses all these collected L-shape coordinates. This is the \"L-shape Bounding Box\".\n4.  **Generate Output Grid:**\n    a.  Create a copy of the input grid. This will be the output grid.\n    b.  Iterate through every cell (row `r`, column `c`) located *within* the L-shape Bounding Box (inclusive).\n    c.  For each cell `(r, c)` inside the box, check its color in the *original input grid*.\n    d.  If the original color of cell `(r, c)` was white (0), change the color of this cell in the output grid to the determined Fill Color.\n    e.  If the original color of cell `(r, c)` was *not* white (i.e., it was 1-9, whether part of an L-shape or not), leave its color unchanged in the output grid (it retains its original color).\n    f.  All cells *outside* the L-shape Bounding Box remain unchanged from the input grid.\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
