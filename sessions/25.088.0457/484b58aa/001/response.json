Determining the dimensions (height and width) of the smallest repeating unit (tile) of the background pattern by analyzing the non-white pixels.\n2. Creating an output grid initially identical to the input grid.\n3. Iterating through each pixel of the input grid.\n4. If a pixel is white (0), calculate its position within the pattern tile using the modulo operator with the pattern dimensions.\n5. Find the correct color for this pattern position by looking at a corresponding non-white pixel in the input grid that falls on the same relative position within its pattern tile.\n6. Replace the white pixel in the output grid with the determined pattern color.\n7. Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pattern_dimensions(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest repeating pattern dimensions (height, width) in the grid,\n    ignoring white (0) pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Iterate through possible pattern heights\n    for h in range(1, height + 1):\n        # Iterate through possible pattern widths\n        for w in range(1, width + 1):\n            is_pattern = True\n            # Check if this (h, w) defines a valid pattern\n            for r in range(height):\n                for c in range(width):\n                    color = grid[r, c]\n                    # Ignore white pixels for pattern definition\n                    if color == 0:\n                        continue\n\n                    # Check vertical repetition\n                    if r + h < height:\n                        neighbor_color = grid[r + h, c]\n                        if neighbor_color != 0 and color != neighbor_color:\n                            is_pattern = False\n                            break\n                    \n                    # Check horizontal repetition\n                    if c + w < width:\n                        neighbor_color = grid[r, c + w]\n                        if neighbor_color != 0 and color != neighbor_color:\n                            is_pattern = False\n                            break\n                if not is_pattern:\n                    break\n            \n            # If a consistent pattern is found for this (h, w), return dimensions\n            if is_pattern:\n                 # Add an extra check: ensure at least one repetition was actually verified\n                 # to avoid trivial 1x1 patterns if the grid is monochrome (excluding 0s)\n                 # or patterns matching grid size if no repetition occurs.\n                 verified_repetition = False\n                 for r in range(height):\n                     for c in range(width):\n                         if grid[r,c] == 0: continue\n                         if r + h < height and grid[r+h,c]!=0 and grid[r,c] == grid[r+h,c]:\n                             verified_repetition = True\n                             break\n                         if c + w < width and grid[r,c+w]!=0 and grid[r,c] == grid[r,c+w]:\n                             verified_repetition = True\n                             break\n                     if verified_repetition: break\n                 \n                 # Only return if a non-trivial pattern repetition was found or if it's the full grid size\n                 if verified_repetition or (h == height and w == width):\n                     return h, w\n\n    # Should not happen with ARC task constraints, but return full size as fallback\n    return height, width \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fills white (0) pixels in the input grid based on the surrounding repeating pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
