This color seems mostly preserved in the output, except in specific locations.\n3.  **Seed Pixels:** In both examples, the first row contains a few pixels that are *not* the background color. Let's call these \"seed pixels\".\n4.  **Vertical Lines:** The primary transformation appears to involve drawing vertical lines downwards from each seed pixel. The color of the line corresponds to the color of the seed pixel.\n5.  **Interaction/Overwriting:** These vertical lines interact with the existing pixels in the input grid column below the seed. The rules for this interaction seem consistent:\n    *   If the line encounters a background pixel, the output pixel takes the line's color.\n    *   If the line encounters a pixel of the *same* color as the line itself (the seed color), the output pixel changes to the background color.\n    *   If the line encounters a pixel of a *different* non-background color, the output pixel takes the line's color (overwriting the original color).\n6.  **Seed Row Preservation:** The seed pixels themselves (in the first row) seem to retain their original color in the output grid. The transformation rules apply only to the rows *below* the first row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
