elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9. Size is 30x30 in all examples.
  - element: background
    description: The most dominant color, often forming a border or filling empty space.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Blue(1) or Azure(8) in examples).
  - element: main_region
    description: Large, contiguous areas mostly filled with a single 'main_color'. Transformations primarily occur here.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Blue(2), Blue(1), Green(3) in examples).
      - shape: Generally rectangular or composed of rectangles.
  - element: marker_pixel
    description: Isolated pixels of a 'marker_color' located *inside* main_regions. Define rows/columns for transformation. Also present in the noise_shape.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Yellow(4), Green(3) in examples).
      - count: One or more per main_region.
      - location: Defines a row and a column index.
  - element: noise_shape
    description: A small, distinct, multi-colored object separate from the main_regions. It contains the marker_color and the target_color. It is removed in the output.
    properties:
      - colors: Contains multiple colors, including marker_color and target_color.
      - structure: Often symmetrical (like a cross) or simple clusters.
      - location: Separate from main_regions.
  - element: target_color
    description: The color used to overwrite the 'main_color' pixels in the rows/columns indicated by 'marker_pixels'. This color is found adjacent to the 'marker_color' within the 'noise_shape'.
    properties:
      - color: Varies (Green(3), Red(2), Gray(5) in examples).

relationships:
  - relationship: determines
    subject: marker_pixel
    object: transformation_locus
    details: The row and column of a marker_pixel within a main_region define where the main_color is changed to the target_color.
  - relationship: contains
    subject: main_region
    object: marker_pixel
  - relationship: contains
    subject: noise_shape
    object: [marker_color, target_color]
    details: The noise shape includes pixels of both the marker color and the target color.
  - relationship: derives
    subject: noise_shape
    object: target_color
    details: The target_color is the color orthogonally adjacent to the marker_color pixel(s) within the noise_shape.
  - relationship: removes
    subject: transformation
    object: noise_shape
    details: The noise_shape pixels are replaced by the background_color in the output.
  - relationship: transforms
    subject: transformation
    object: main_region
    details: Pixels of main_color within the rows/columns specified by marker_pixels are changed to target_color.

actions:
  - action: identify_elements
    description: Distinguish background, main_regions, marker_pixels, and noise_shapes based on color, contiguity, and location.
  - action: determine_colors
    description: Identify the specific background_color, main_color, marker_color, and target_color for the given input grid, using the noise_shape to link marker and target colors.
  - action: apply_transformation
    description: Modify a copy of the input grid. Change main_color pixels to target_color in the rows/columns specified by marker_pixels within main_regions.
  - action: remove_noise
    description: Replace all pixels belonging to the identified noise_shape(s) with the background_color.
  - action: preserve_markers
    description: Ensure that the original marker_pixels within the main_regions retain their marker_color in the final output. (This should happen naturally if the transformation logic only targets main_color pixels).
