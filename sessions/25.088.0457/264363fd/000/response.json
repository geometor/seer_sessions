            "text": "Okay, let's break down these examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each example consists of a large grid (30x30) with a predominant background color (Blue(1) in train\\_1, Azure(8) in train\\_2 and train\\_3).\n2.  **Main Regions:** Within the background, there are large, often rectangular, regions filled mostly with a single \"main\" color (Blue(2) in train\\_1, Blue(1) in train\\_2, Green(3) in train\\_3). Note that in train\\_2, the \"main\" color is the same as the background color used in train\\_1, but distinct from its *own* background, Azure(8).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Inside these main regions, there are isolated single pixels of a different \"marker\" color (Yellow(4) in train\\_1, Green(3) in train\\_2, Yellow(4) in train\\_3).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation happens within the main regions. The rows and columns corresponding to the marker pixels are \"painted\" over with a new \"target\" color (Green(3) in train\\_1, Red(2) in train\\_2, Gray(5) in train\\_3). Pixels that were originally the main color in these rows/columns are changed to the target color. The marker pixels themselves retain their original color.\n5.  **Noise Shapes:** Each input grid also contains a small, distinct, multi-colored \"noise\" shape somewhere else on the grid, separate from the main regions. These shapes involve several colors, crucially including the *marker* color and the *target* color for that specific example.\n    *   Train 1: Green(3)/Yellow(4) cross shape. Marker=Yellow(4), Target=Green(3).\n    *   Train 2: Red(2)/Green(3) shape. Marker=Green(3), Target=Red(2).\n    *   Train 3: Gray(5)/Magenta(6)/Yellow(4) cross shape. Marker=Yellow(4), Target=Gray(5).\n6.  **Noise Shape Removal:** In the output grid, these noise shapes are completely removed and replaced by the background color.\n7.  **Color Relationship:** The target color used for painting the rows/columns appears to be derived from the noise shape. Specifically, it seems to be the color that is orthogonally adjacent to the marker color within that noise shape.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
