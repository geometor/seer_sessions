Transformation Rule (Hypothesized - Requires Validation with Examples):

1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color, typically the most frequent color or color 0, possibly confirmed by checking grid borders.
2.  **Find Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of non-background colors using orthogonal connectivity.
3.  **Categorize Objects (Tentative):** If multiple objects exist, heuristically separate them. Assume the largest object is the 'main canvas'. Assume smaller objects are potential 'key' or 'reference' patterns. This distinction needs validation.
4.  **Identify Key Pattern (Tentative):** Search within the 'key' objects for a simple, predefined pattern. A common pattern in ARC is adjacency. Look for two different non-background colors orthogonally adjacent to each other within the same key object. Record these two colors (e.g., `color1`, `color2`) and the ID of the key object containing this pattern. Use the first valid pattern found. This pattern identification needs validation.
5.  **Identify Transformation Parameters (Tentative):**
    *   Assume the `main canvas` object has a dominant color (`main_color`).
    *   Based on the key pattern (`color1`, `color2`), assume one color acts as a 'marker' (`marker_color = color1`) and the other as the 'target' (`target_color = color2`). This assignment might need swapping or refinement based on examples.
    *   Check if the `marker_color` exists anywhere within the `main canvas` object.
6.  **Apply Transformation - Paint Rows/Columns (Tentative):**
    *   If the `marker_color` is found within the `main canvas`:
        *   Find all locations (r, c) of the `marker_color` within the `main canvas` object.
        *   Collect the set of unique row indices (`marker_rows`) and column indices (`marker_cols`) from these locations.
        *   Iterate through the output grid. For any pixel (r, c) whose original color was the `main_color`, if its row `r` is in `marker_rows` OR its column `c` is in `marker_cols`, change its color to the `target_color`. This painting logic needs validation.
7.  **Clean Up (Tentative):** Remove the 'key' object that contained the identified pattern by replacing its pixels in the output grid with the background color. This cleanup step needs validation.
8.  **Return:** Return the modified grid. If no key pattern or main object is found matching the criteria, return a copy of the input grid.

**Note:** This program is based on hypotheses derived from previous attempts and common ARC patterns. The categorization of objects, the specific key pattern, the roles of colors from the key, the painting logic, and the cleanup step are all tentative and require validation against the specific task examples. The previous version timed out, suggesting the logic (especially around detailed marker finding and object interactions) might be overly complex or incorrect. This version simplifies some steps but retains the overall structure.

Train Set Error: Timeout: Code execution exceeded 10 seconds
**General Assessment**

The previous code execution resulted in a timeout. This indicates that the algorithm was likely too complex, potentially involving inefficient loops (e.g., nested iterations over pixels, complex object identification, or pattern searching) or getting stuck in an unexpected condition. The hypothesis involving identifying separate 'key' and 'main' objects, searching for adjacency patterns within 'key' objects, and then applying row/column-based painting to the 'main' object seems overly elaborate and computationally expensive.

The strategy moving forward is to simplify the approach significantly. We need to re-examine the input-output pairs to find a more direct and efficient transformation rule. The timeout suggests the core logic might be simpler than previously assumed. We should look for direct relationships between input patterns and output changes, possibly focusing on local interactions or properties of objects rather than complex inter-object signaling.

**Analysis of Metrics and Examples:**

*   **Objects:** In all training examples, there appears to be only one contiguous non-background object (using color 0 as background). This object is composed of gray (5) pixels forming a border/frame and blue (1) pixels inside. The previous code's distinction between 'key' and 'main' objects seems unnecessary for this task.
*   **Colors:** The colors involved are background (white, 0), frame (gray, 5), and inner content (blue, 1). No other colors are introduced.
*   **Dimensions:** The grid dimensions change between examples.
*   **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids visually (based on the provided JSON data):
    *   Example 0: A single blue pixel at (5, 5) seems to 'project' or 'copy' itself one step downwards to (6, 5), changing the pixel at (6, 5) from gray to blue. The top row of the gray frame also appears to be duplicated one row higher.
    *   Example 1: A 3x5 rectangle of blue pixels inside the gray frame seems to expand downwards by one row. The top row of the gray frame is duplicated one row higher.
    *   Example 2: A 1x7 row of blue pixels inside the gray frame seems to expand downwards by one row. The top row of the gray frame is duplicated one row higher.

The consistent pattern appears to be:
1.  Identify the single non-background object.
2.  Find the row(s) containing the inner color (blue, 1).
3.  Duplicate the lowest row containing the inner color (blue, 1) into the row immediately below it.
4.  Find the topmost row of the outer frame color (gray, 5).
5.  Duplicate this topmost frame row into the row immediately above it.

This is a much simpler hypothesis than the previous one and seems computationally feasible.

    role: Forms the inner part of the single object. Its bottommost row is duplicated downwards.

general_transformation:
  - Detect the background color (white, 0).
  - Identify the single composite object consisting of frame (gray, 5) and inner (blue, 1) colors.
  - Find the minimum row index (`min_r_frame`) containing the frame color (gray, 5).
  - Find the maximum row index (`max_r_inner`) containing the inner color (blue, 1).
  - Create the output grid by copying the input.
  - Copy the contents of row `max_r_inner` from the input grid to row `max_r_inner + 1` in the output grid.
  - Copy the contents of row `min_r_frame` from the input grid to row `min_r_frame - 1` in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the frame color (gray, 5) and the inner color (blue, 1). Assume white (0) is the background.
3.  Find the lowest row index (`max_r_inner`) in the input grid that contains at least one pixel of the inner color (blue, 1).
4.  Find the highest row index (`min_r_frame`) in the input grid that contains at least one pixel of the frame color (gray, 5).
5.  If both `max_r_inner` and `min_r_frame` are found:
    a.  Iterate through each column `c` of the grid.
    b.  Copy the pixel value from `input_grid[max_r_inner, c]` to `output_grid[max_r_inner + 1, c]`.
    c.  Copy the pixel value from `input_grid[min_r_frame, c]` to `output_grid[min_r_frame - 1, c]`.
6.  Return the modified output grid.
