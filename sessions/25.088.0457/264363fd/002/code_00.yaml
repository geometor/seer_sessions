task_description: Modifies a main object based on internal markers and an external reference pattern.

definitions:
  - background_color: The most frequent color, typically bordering the grid. (e.g., white)
  - object: A contiguous group of non-background pixels (orthogonal adjacency).
  - main_region: A large object, predominantly composed of a single color ('main_color').
  - noise_shape: A small object, potentially multi-colored, separate from any main_region. Also called 'reference_pattern'.
  - marker_pixel: A pixel within a main_region whose color ('marker_color') differs from the main_region's dominant color ('main_color'). Must be orthognally surrounded only by 'main_color' or other 'marker_color' pixels belonging to the same main_region.
  - marker_color: The color of marker_pixels found inside main_regions. This color must *also* appear in a noise_shape.
  - target_color: The color found orthogonally adjacent to the marker_color within the noise_shape.
  - main_color: The dominant color of the main_region(s) that contain marker_pixels.

input_elements:
  - grid: The input 2D array.
  - main_regions: Identified large objects.
  - marker_pixels: Identified pixels within main_regions. (Location and Color)
  - noise_shapes: Identified small objects used as reference.

actions:
  - identify: Determine background_color, main_regions, noise_shapes, marker_pixels, marker_color, target_color, and main_color.
  - locate: Find all coordinates (r, c) of marker_pixels within main_regions.
  - collect: Gather the unique row indices and column indices from the located marker_pixels.
  - paint: In the output grid (initially a copy of input), change the color of pixels that meet two conditions:
      1. Their original color in the input grid was 'main_color'.
      2. Their row index is in the collected marker rows OR their column index is in the collected marker columns.
      The new color for these pixels is the 'target_color'.
  - remove: Find the noise_shape that contained the marker_color/target_color adjacency used for reference. Replace all pixels belonging to this noise_shape with the background_color in the output grid.

output_elements:
  - grid: The transformed 2D array, with painted rows/columns in main_regions and the reference noise_shape removed.
