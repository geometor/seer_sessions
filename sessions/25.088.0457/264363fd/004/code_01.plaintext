# Program Description (Tentative - Requires Example Analysis)

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-background colors in the input grid. Determine the background color (likely the most frequent color or color '0').
2.  **Analyze Object Roles (Hypothesized - Needs Verification):** Attempt to categorize objects. Some objects might serve as 'main canvases' for changes, while others might act as 'keys' or 'references' defining the transformation rule. The distinction based purely on size (as in the previous code) might be incorrect or insufficient. Re-evaluate how to differentiate object roles based on visual patterns across all examples.
3.  **Identify Transformation Trigger/Rule (Hypothesized - Needs Verification):** Search for a specific pattern or relationship, potentially involving color adjacency within one of the 'key' objects, or a specific feature (like a uniquely colored pixel) within a 'main canvas' object. The previous 'marker-inside-main + reference-in-noise' model needs validation or replacement.
4.  **Determine Colors:** Identify the relevant colors based on the trigger pattern: a 'source' color to be changed, a 'target' color to change to, and potentially 'marker' or 'indicator' colors involved in the trigger.
5.  **Define Target Area (Hypothesized - Needs Verification):** Determine which pixels in the input grid are affected by the transformation. The previous 'rows and columns corresponding to marker locations' needs validation. It could be specific pixels, entire rows/columns, subgrids, or the entire object.
6.  **Apply Transformation:** Create the output grid by modifying the input grid: change the 'source' color to the 'target' color within the 'target area'.
7.  **Clean Up (Hypothesized - Needs Verification):** Determine if any 'key' or 'reference' objects should be removed or altered in the final output grid. The previous code removed the reference shape; this needs validation.

**Note:** The previous implementation timed out, suggesting the assumed logic (especially regarding marker identification, object categorization, and reference finding) is either too slow or incorrect for at least one example. Analysis of all examples is required to refine this program. The core task likely involves identifying a rule encoded in one part of the grid (e.g., a small shape) and applying it to another part (e.g., a larger shape), possibly involving color replacement based on positional cues or adjacencies.
