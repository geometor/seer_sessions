Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the background color (most frequent color, often bordering the grid).
2. Find all distinct contiguous objects (orthogonally connected) that are not the background color.
3. Differentiate objects into:
    a. 'Main Regions': Large objects, predominantly composed of a single 'main_color'.
    b. 'Noise Shapes' / 'Reference Patterns': Small, potentially multi-colored objects, separate from main regions.
4. Identify potential 'marker_pixels' within main regions: These are pixels whose color ('marker_color') differs from the main region's dominant color ('main_color') and are orthogonally surrounded only by the main_color or other identical marker_pixels within that same region.
5. Identify the definitive 'marker_color' and 'target_color' by examining the noise shapes: Find a noise shape where a potential 'marker_color' (found in step 4) is orthogonally adjacent to another non-background color ('target_color'). Both adjacent pixels must belong to the same noise shape object.
6. Identify the 'main_color': This is the dominant color of the main region(s) where the definitive marker_color pixels were found.
7. Locate all confirmed 'marker_pixels' (r, c) within the main regions matching the definitive marker_color.
8. Collect the unique row indices and column indices from these marker pixel locations.
9. Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
10. Apply 'painting': Iterate through the grid. For any pixel (r, c) where the input color is the 'main_color', if its row 'r' is in the collected marker rows OR its column 'c' is in the collected marker columns, change the color of that pixel in the output grid to the 'target_color'.
11. Identify the noise shape object used as the reference in step 5.
12. Remove the reference noise shape: Replace all pixels belonging to this noise shape in the output grid with the background color.
13. Return the modified output grid.
