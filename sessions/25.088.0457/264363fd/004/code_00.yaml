task_description: Transform input grid to output grid based on color patterns and object relationships.
observations:
  - background_color: Assumed to be the most frequent color, often bordering the grid.
  - objects: Contiguous areas of non-background colors (orthogonal connectivity).
  - object_types:
      - main_regions: Large objects, assumed to have a dominant color. The previous code heuristically identified these based on size relative to others.
      - noise_shapes: Small objects, potentially multi-colored, acting as references or keys.
  - potential_markers: Pixels within a main_region whose color differs from the main_region's dominant color and are orthogonally surrounded only by the dominant color or identical marker pixels within that region.
  - reference_pattern: A noise_shape containing an instance of a potential_marker color orthogonally adjacent to a different non-background color (target_color).
  - action_paint: If a valid reference_pattern is found:
      - Identify the marker_color, target_color, and the main_color of the region where the marker was found.
      - Identify all locations of the marker_color within main_regions associated with that main_color.
      - Collect the unique row indices and column indices from these marker locations.
      - Change pixels in the output grid from main_color to target_color if their row OR column matches one of the collected indices.
  - action_remove: Remove the noise_shape that served as the reference_pattern by replacing its pixels with the background_color.
potential_issues:
  - efficiency: The process of finding objects, then potential markers within them, then searching noise shapes for adjacencies might be computationally expensive, leading to timeouts on complex inputs.
  - ambiguity:
      - The heuristic for distinguishing main_regions from noise_shapes (size threshold) might be unreliable.
      - Multiple potential markers or multiple valid reference patterns could exist. The previous code had simple handling for this (e.g., using the last found).
      - The definition of "isolated marker" (fully surrounded) might be too strict or incorrect.
  - incorrect_logic: The entire model (marker-in-main, reference-in-noise, row/column paint) might not accurately represent the true transformation for all examples. The timeout could stem from applying this complex, potentially flawed logic.
