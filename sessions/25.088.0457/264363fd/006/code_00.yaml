description: Duplicate the lowest row containing the inner color downwards and the topmost row of the frame upwards.

examples:
  - id: 0
    input_grid_size: [10, 12]
    output_grid_size: [10, 12]
    input_colors: [white, blue, gray] # 0, 1, 5
    output_colors: [white, blue, gray] # 0, 1, 5
    objects:
      - type: single_composite_object
        colors: [gray, blue] # Frame and inner content
        input_pixels:
          gray: 8
          blue: 1
        output_pixels:
          gray: 10 # Increases by 2 (top row copied)
          blue: 2  # Increases by 1 (bottom blue row copied)
        actions:
          - Duplicate lowest blue row downwards by 1 position.
          - Duplicate topmost gray row upwards by 1 position.
  - id: 1
    input_grid_size: [12, 14]
    output_grid_size: [12, 14]
    input_colors: [white, blue, gray] # 0, 1, 5
    output_colors: [white, blue, gray] # 0, 1, 5
    objects:
      - type: single_composite_object
        colors: [gray, blue]
        input_pixels:
          gray: 20
          blue: 15
        output_pixels:
          gray: 22 # Increases by 2 (top row copied)
          blue: 20 # Increases by 5 (bottom blue row copied)
        actions:
          - Duplicate lowest blue row downwards by 1 position.
          - Duplicate topmost gray row upwards by 1 position.
  - id: 2
    input_grid_size: [11, 20]
    output_grid_size: [11, 20]
    input_colors: [white, blue, gray] # 0, 1, 5
    output_colors: [white, blue, gray] # 0, 1, 5
    objects:
      - type: single_composite_object
        colors: [gray, blue]
        input_pixels:
          gray: 18
          blue: 6
        output_pixels:
          gray: 20 # Increases by 2 (top row copied)
          blue: 12 # Increases by 6 (bottom blue row copied)
        actions:
          - Duplicate lowest blue row downwards by 1 position.
          - Duplicate topmost gray row upwards by 1 position.

identified_colors:
  - name: background
    value: 0 # white
    role: Background, ignored during object identification.
  - name: frame
    value: 5 # gray
    role: Forms the outer part of the single object. Its topmost row is duplicated upwards.
  - name: inner
    value: 1 # blue
    role: Forms the inner part of the single object. Its bottommost row is duplicated downwards.

general_transformation:
  - Detect the background color (white, 0).
  - Identify the single composite object consisting of frame (gray, 5) and inner (blue, 1) colors.
  - Find the minimum row index (`min_r_frame`) containing the frame color (gray, 5).
  - Find the maximum row index (`max_r_inner`) containing the inner color (blue, 1).
  - Create the output grid by copying the input.
  - Copy the contents of row `max_r_inner` from the input grid to row `max_r_inner + 1` in the output grid.
  - Copy the contents of row `min_r_frame` from the input grid to row `min_r_frame - 1` in the output grid.
