            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input grid features a regular background pattern consisting of horizontal and vertical lines of a single color (blue in example 1, azure in 2, yellow in 3), creating a grid of 2x2 cells separated by these lines. The background color within these 2x2 cells is white (0). The lines appear every third row and column (rows 2, 5, 8... and columns 2, 5, 8...).\n2.  **Objects:** Within some of the 2x2 white cells, there are solid 2x2 blocks of various other colors (red, yellow, maroon, azure, blue, green). These are the primary objects of interest.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves propagating the color of these 2x2 blocks horizontally to the right.\n4.  **Propagation Rule:** For each row of 2x2 cells (defined by the horizontal grid lines), the propagation starts from a colored 2x2 block and continues rightward, filling any subsequent white 2x2 cells in that same row with the same color.\n5.  **Stopping Condition:** This rightward propagation stops when it encounters another pre-existing colored 2x2 block in the same row or reaches the right edge of the grid. The color of the grid lines themselves does not change and does not seem to affect the propagation logic, other than defining the cell boundaries.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Note the background color (white, 0) and the grid line color (which is consistent but task-dependent).\n2.  Identify all the 2x2 cells within the grid. These cells have their top-left corners at coordinates (3*i, 3*j) where i and j are non-negative integers such that 3*i+1 < grid_height and 3*j+1 < grid_width.\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through each row of 2x2 cells (indexed by `i`).\n5.  For each row `i`, maintain a variable `current_fill_color`, initialized to white (0).\n6.  Iterate through the columns of 2x2 cells (indexed by `j`) from left to right within row `i`.\n7.  For each cell at row `i`, column `j` (corresponding to the 2x2 area starting at grid coordinates `(3*i, 3*j)`):\n    a.  Examine the color of the 2x2 block in the *input* grid at this location. Check if it's entirely white (0) or if it contains a non-white color. Since objects are solid 2x2 blocks, checking the top-left pixel `(3*i, 3*j)` is sufficient to determine the block's color. Let this color be `cell_color`.\n    b.  If `cell_color` is *not* white (0), update `current_fill_color` to `cell_color`.\n    c.  If `cell_color` *is* white (0) and `current_fill_color` is *not* white (0), then fill the corresponding 2x2 area in the *output* grid (from `(3*i, 3*j)` to `(3*i+1, 3*j+1)`) with `current_fill_color`.\n8.  After iterating through all rows and columns of cells, the output grid contains the final transformed pattern."
