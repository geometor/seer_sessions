Grid:
  - type: Background Structure
    properties:
      - Regular grid pattern
      - Formed by horizontal and vertical lines recurring every 3rd row/column
      - Line color is consistent within a single example (blue, azure, or yellow) but varies between examples
      - Creates distinct 2x2 cells separated by lines
      - Cell background color is white (0)
  - type: Objects
    properties:
      - 2x2 solid blocks of a single non-background color
      - Located within the 2x2 cells defined by the grid lines
      - Can be of various colors (red, yellow, maroon, azure, blue, green)

Transformation:
  - type: Action
    description: Color Propagation
    properties:
      - Direction: Horizontal, from left to right
      - Scope: Operates within rows of 2x2 cells (rows defined by horizontal grid lines)
      - Trigger: Initiated by a non-white 2x2 object block
      - Target: Fills subsequent white 2x2 cells in the same row
      - Termination: Stops upon encountering another non-white 2x2 object block or the grid's right boundary
  - type: Invariance
    description: Grid structure and original non-white blocks remain unchanged in position and color. The grid line color is also unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Objects exist within the 2x2 cells defined by the grid lines. Propagation occurs between adjacent 2x2 cells in the same row.
  - Conditional: Propagation into a white cell depends on the color of the most recent non-white cell encountered to its left in the same row.
