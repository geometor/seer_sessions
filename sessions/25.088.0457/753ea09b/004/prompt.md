Transformation Rule: Conditional Flood Fill based on Color Counts and Adjacency

1.  **Analyze Input Colors:**
    *   Count the occurrences of each color in the input grid.
    *   If there are fewer than 3 distinct colors, return the input grid unchanged.
    *   Identify the `background_color` as the color with the highest frequency.
    *   Identify the two remaining non-background colors.
    *   Among these two non-background colors, identify the `fill_color` as the one with the lower frequency (minimum count). Use the lower color value as a tie-breaker if counts are equal.
    *   Identify the `barrier_color` as the remaining non-background color.

2.  **Check Fill Condition:**
    *   Determine if any pixel with the identified `fill_color` is initially located cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel with the `background_color`.

3.  **Perform Transformation:**
    *   **If** the `fill_color` is *not* adjacent to the `background_color`: Return a copy of the original input grid.
    *   **If** the `fill_color` *is* adjacent to the `background_color`:
        *   Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
        *   Perform a flood fill operation using Breadth-First Search (BFS):
            *   Initialize a queue and add the coordinates of all pixels that originally had the `fill_color`.
            *   Initialize a `visited` set containing the coordinates of all pixels that originally had the `fill_color`.
            *   While the queue is not empty:
                *   Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
                *   For each of its 4 cardinal neighbors `(nr, nc)`:
                    *   Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
                    *   Check if the neighbor's color in the *original input grid* is the `background_color`.
                    *   Check if the neighbor's coordinate `(nr, nc)` has *not* been visited yet.
                    *   If all these conditions are met:
                        *   Change the neighbor's color in the `output_grid` to `fill_color`.
                        *   Add the neighbor's coordinate `(nr, nc)` to the `visited` set.
                        *   Enqueue the neighbor's coordinate `(nr, nc)`.
        *   Return the `output_grid` after the flood fill is complete.
