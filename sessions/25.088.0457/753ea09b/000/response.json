The output grid retains the orange pixels and some magenta pixels in their original positions. However, many magenta pixels adjacent to the initial gray pixels have been changed to gray. This gray color appears to have spread outwards from the original gray pixels, filling connected regions of magenta pixels. The spread seems to be blocked by orange pixels and the grid boundaries. It resembles a flood fill operation where gray fills magenta regions bounded by orange.\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

The transformation consists of the fill color spreading from its initial positions into connected areas of the background color. This spread is contained by the barrier color pixels, existing fill color pixels, and the grid's edges.\n*   **Generalized YAML Facts:**\n    "
