Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples.

**Train_1 Analysis**

*   **Perception:** The input grid is predominantly magenta (6), with scattered gray (5) and orange (7) pixels. The output grid retains the orange pixels and some magenta pixels in their original positions. However, many magenta pixels adjacent to the initial gray pixels have been changed to gray. This gray color appears to have spread outwards from the original gray pixels, filling connected regions of magenta pixels. The spread seems to be blocked by orange pixels and the grid boundaries. It resembles a flood fill operation where gray fills magenta regions bounded by orange.
*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: flood_fill
    grid_size: 30x30
    colors_present:
      - magenta (6)
      - gray (5)
      - orange (7)
    key_colors:
      background_color: magenta (6) # The color being filled
      fill_color: gray (5)         # The color that spreads
      barrier_color: orange (7)    # The color that blocks the spread
    objects:
      - type: background
        color: magenta (6)
        description: Large contiguous areas making up most of the grid.
      - type: fill_source
        color: gray (5)
        description: Scattered individual pixels or small clusters acting as starting points for the fill.
      - type: barrier
        color: orange (7)
        description: Scattered individual pixels or small clusters that block the fill spread.
    action:
      type: propagation/fill
      source_color: gray (5)
      target_color: magenta (6)
      result_color: gray (5)
      constraints: Fill stops at barrier_color (orange, 7), existing fill_color (gray, 5), and grid boundaries.
      connectivity: adjacent (horizontal/vertical)
    transformation:
      description: Regions of magenta connected to gray pixels are filled with gray until blocked by orange pixels or grid edges.
      input_pixels_preserved:
        - gray (5)
        - orange (7)
      input_pixels_potentially_changed:
        - magenta (6) -> gray (5)
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the three main colors present: the background color (most frequent, magenta 6), the fill color (gray 5), and the barrier color (orange 7).
    2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    3.  Create a list of starting coordinates for all pixels with the fill color (gray 5) in the input grid.
    4.  Perform a flood fill starting from these initial coordinates:
        *   Use a queue to manage coordinates to visit, initially populated with the starting coordinates.
        *   Maintain a set of visited coordinates, also initialized with the starting coordinates.
        *   While the queue is not empty:
            *   Get the current coordinate (row, col) from the queue.
            *   Examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
            *   For each neighbor:
                *   If the neighbor is within the grid bounds, has the background color (magenta 6) in the input grid, and has not been visited:
                    *   Change the neighbor's color in the output grid to the fill color (gray 5).
                    *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
                    *   Add the neighbor's coordinates to the queue.
    5.  Return the final output grid.

**Train_2 Analysis**

*   **Perception:** Similar to the first example, this input grid is mostly green (3), with scattered yellow (4) and white (0) pixels. In the output, the white pixels remain, but the yellow color has spread into adjacent green areas, seemingly blocked by the white pixels and grid boundaries.
*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: flood_fill
    grid_size: 30x30
    colors_present:

      - yellow (4)
      - white (0)
    key_colors:
      background_color: green (3)  # The color being filled
      fill_color: yellow (4)     # The color that spreads
      barrier_color: white (0)     # The color that blocks the spread

    action:
      type: propagation/fill
      source_color: yellow (4)
      target_color: green (3)
      result_color: yellow (4)
      constraints: Fill stops at barrier_color (white, 0), existing fill_color (yellow, 4), and grid boundaries.
      connectivity: adjacent (horizontal/vertical)
    transformation:
      description: Regions of green connected to yellow pixels are filled with yellow until blocked by white pixels or grid edges.
      input_pixels_preserved:
        - yellow (4)
        - white (0)
      input_pixels_potentially_changed:
        - green (3) -> yellow (4)
    ```

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the three main colors present: the background color (green 3), the fill color (yellow 4), and the barrier color (white 0).
    2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    3.  Create a list of starting coordinates for all pixels with the fill color (yellow 4) in the input grid.
    4.  Perform a flood fill starting from these initial coordinates:
        *   Use a queue to manage coordinates to visit, initially populated with the starting coordinates.
        *   Maintain a set of visited coordinates, also initialized with the starting coordinates.
        *   While the queue is not empty:
            *   Get the current coordinate (row, col) from the queue.
            *   Examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right).
            *   For each neighbor:
                *   If the neighbor is within the grid bounds, has the background color (green 3) in the input grid, and has not been visited:
                    *   Change the neighbor's color in the output grid to the fill color (yellow 4).
                    *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
                    *   Add the neighbor's coordinates to the queue.
    5.  Return the final output grid.

**Train_3 Analysis**

*   **Perception:** The pattern continues. The input grid is primarily azure (8), with scattered maroon (9) and green (3) pixels. The output shows the maroon color spreading into connected azure regions, blocked by green pixels and grid boundaries.
*   **YAML Facts:**

      input_pixels_potentially_changed:

    ```

    1.  Identify the three main colors present: the background color (azure 8), the fill color (maroon 9), and the barrier color (green 3).
    2.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.

                    *   Change the neighbor's color in the output grid to the fill color (maroon 9).
                    *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
                    *   Add the neighbor's coordinates to the queue.
    5.  Return the final output grid.

**General Task Description**

*   **Perception:** The task involves identifying three significant colors in a grid: a background color (typically the most frequent), a fill color, and a barrier color. The transformation consists of the fill color spreading from its initial positions into connected areas of the background color. This spread is contained by the barrier color pixels, existing fill color pixels, and the grid's edges.
*   **Generalized YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: flood_fill_with_barriers
    grid_properties:
      size: variable (up to 30x30)
      colors: 3 significant colors per example
    color_roles:
      - background_color: Most frequent color, target of the fill.
      - fill_color: Less frequent color, spreads into the background.
      - barrier_color: Less frequent color, blocks the spread of the fill color.
    action:
      type: propagation/fill
      source_color: fill_color
      target_color: background_color
      result_color: fill_color
      constraints: Fill stops at barrier_color, existing fill_color, and grid boundaries.
      connectivity: adjacent (horizontal/vertical only)
    transformation:
      description: Apply a flood fill algorithm starting from all initial fill_color pixels. The fill propagates into adjacent background_color pixels and changes them to fill_color. Propagation halts upon encountering barrier_color pixels, already filled pixels (fill_color), or grid boundaries. All original barrier_color and fill_color pixels are preserved in the output. Background pixels unreachable by the fill remain unchanged.
    ```

*   **General Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the `background_color` (most frequent), `fill_color`, and `barrier_color` by analyzing the pixel counts and distribution in the input grid. (Note: A robust method might be needed if >3 colors exist or if counts are close. Comparing input/output counts can help identify the fill color as the one whose count increases).
    2.  Create the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
    3.  Identify all coordinates `(r, c)` where `input_grid[r][c]` equals the `fill_color`.
    4.  Initialize a queue with these starting coordinates.
    5.  Initialize a set `visited` containing these starting coordinates.
    6.  While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a coordinate `(row, col)`.
        *   For each neighbor `(nr, nc)` in the four cardinal directions:
            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
            *   Check if `input_grid[nr][nc]` equals the `background_color`.
            *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is not in `visited`.
            *   If all checks pass:
                *   Set `output_grid[nr][nc]` to `fill_color`.
                *   Add `(nr, nc)` to `visited`.
                *   Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
    7.  Return the `output_grid`.
