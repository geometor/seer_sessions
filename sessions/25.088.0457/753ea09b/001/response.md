Transformation Rule: Flood Fill with Barriers

1. Identify three key colors in the input grid:
   - `background_color`: The most frequent color in the grid.
   - `fill_color`: One of the less frequent colors. It will spread.
   - `barrier_color`: The remaining less frequent color. It blocks the spread.
   * Determination: After identifying the `background_color`, iterate through pixels of the two remaining colors. If a pixel of color C1 is found adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a `background_color` pixel, then C1 is designated as the `fill_color`, and the other remaining color is the `barrier_color`.

2. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.

3. Perform a flood fill operation starting from all initial `fill_color` pixels:
   - Use a queue to manage pixels to visit.
   - Use a set to track visited pixels to avoid redundant processing and infinite loops.
   - The fill propagates from a `fill_color` pixel to adjacent (horizontal/vertical) `background_color` pixels.
   - When a `background_color` pixel is filled, its color in the output grid changes to `fill_color`, and it's added to the queue and marked as visited.
   - The fill stops at:
     - Grid boundaries.
     - Pixels that are already `fill_color`.
     - Pixels that are `barrier_color`.
     - Pixels that have already been visited during the current fill process.

4. Return the modified output grid.
