task_description: Overwrite the input grid based on specific color rules, preserving only the locations of yellow pixels.
grid_properties:
  - input_output_size_relationship: Identical dimensions.
  - background_color_input: Predominantly white (0).
  - background_color_output: Determined by a unique color in the input.

color_rules:
  - target_color_for_preservation: yellow (4)
  - ignored_colors_for_output_pattern: white (0), gray (5)
  - background_determining_color: The single color present in the input grid that is NOT white (0), yellow (4), or gray (5).
    - example_1: orange (7)
    - example_2: green (3)
    - example_3: azure (8)

transformation_steps:
  - identify_background_color: Scan the input grid to find the unique color that isn't white (0), yellow (4), or gray (5).
  - initialize_output_grid: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - fill_background: Fill the entire output grid with the identified background color.
  - preserve_yellow_pixels: Iterate through the input grid. For every pixel that is yellow (4), overwrite the corresponding pixel in the output grid with yellow (4).

element_persistence:
  - yellow_pixels: Locations are preserved, color remains yellow (4).
  - other_pixels: Locations are overwritten by the new background color, unless the original pixel was yellow (4).
