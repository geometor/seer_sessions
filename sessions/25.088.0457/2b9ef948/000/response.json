They contain distinct objects or patterns composed of yellow (4), gray (5), and one other unique color (orange (7) in train\\_1, green (3) in train\\_2, azure (8) in train\\_3).\n3.  **Output Composition:** The output grids are filled almost entirely with a single color, which corresponds to the unique non-white, non-yellow, non-gray color found in the respective input grid. Embedded within this background color are yellow (4) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves identifying two key elements from the input:\n    *   The unique color that is *not* white (0), yellow (4), or gray (5). This color becomes the background fill for the output grid.\n    *   The exact locations of all yellow (4) pixels. These locations are preserved in the output grid, maintaining their yellow color, while all other original pixel colors (white, gray, and the unique background color itself) are replaced by the new background color.\n5.  **Object Irrelevance:** The specific shapes or arrangements of the gray (5) objects, or the non-yellow pixels within the yellow objects, do not seem to directly influence the final pattern, other than the unique color determining the output background. Only the presence and location of yellow pixels and the identity of the unique color matter.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
