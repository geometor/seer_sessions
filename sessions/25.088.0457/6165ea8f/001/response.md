"""
Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
Sort these unique colors numerically. Let the sorted colors be C and the number of unique colors be N.
The output grid size is (3*N + 2) x (3*N + 2).
Initialize the output grid with white (0).
The output grid displays an N x N matrix of 2x2 colored squares, separated by 1-pixel white borders, with a 3-pixel white padding on the top and left.
The top row (i=0) and leftmost column (j=0) of this matrix act as headers, displaying the sorted colors C.
- The j-th square in the top row (i=0) has the color C[j].
- The i-th square in the leftmost column (j=0) has the color C[i].
The inner squares (i > 0 and j > 0) are filled based on a comparison between the header colors for that row (C[i]) and column (C[j]).
- If C[i] is the same as C[j], the square is gray (5).
- If C[i] is different from C[j]:
    - If C[i] and C[j] have the same parity (both even or both odd), the square is red (2).
    - If C[i] and C[j] have different parity (one even, one odd), the square is gray (5).
Each position (i, j) in the N x N matrix corresponds to a 2x2 square in the output grid starting at pixel coordinates (3 + i*3, 3 + j*3).
