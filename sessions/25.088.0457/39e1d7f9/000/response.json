These lines act as dividers, creating a grid of cells or \"rooms\".\n2.  **Background:** The background color within these rooms is consistently white ('0').\n3.  **Payload Objects:** Within some rooms, there are rectangular blocks of solid colors. These are the \"payload\" objects. In each example, there are exactly two distinct payload colors besides the divider and background colors.\n    *   train_1: Yellow ('4') and Magenta ('6'). Divider: Green ('3').\n    *   train_2: Green ('3') and Magenta ('6'). Divider: Azure ('8').\n    *   train_3: Red ('2') and Yellow ('4'). Divider: Azure ('8').\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves swapping the colors of the payload objects. All pixels that have the first payload color in the input grid are changed to the second payload color in the output grid. Conversely, all pixels that have the second payload color in the input are changed to the first payload color in the output.\n5.  **Static Elements:** The divider lines and the white background pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:\n    a.  If the pixel's color is `payload_color_1`, set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to `payload_color_2`.\n    b.  If the pixel's color is `payload_color_2`, set the corresponding pixel in the new grid to `payload_color_1`.\n    c.
