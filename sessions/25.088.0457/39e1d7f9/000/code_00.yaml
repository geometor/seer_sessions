Grid:
  Structure: Delimited by lines of a single color (divider_color).
  Background: White (0).
Divider:
  Property: Forms horizontal and vertical lines.
  Role: Separates the grid into sections/rooms.
  Persistence: Remains unchanged in the output.
Payload_Colors:
  Quantity: Exactly two distinct colors per task, excluding white (0) and the divider_color.
  Identification:
    - Task 1: Yellow (4), Magenta (6)
    - Task 2: Green (3), Magenta (6)
    - Task 3: Red (2), Yellow (4)
  Role: Occupy specific pixel locations within the grid structure.
Transformation:
  Action: Swap pixel colors.
  Scope: Applies only to pixels matching one of the two payload_colors.
  Rule: All pixels of payload_color_1 become payload_color_2, and all pixels of payload_color_2 become payload_color_1.
  Invariance: Pixels matching the divider_color or the background_color (white 0) are not modified.
