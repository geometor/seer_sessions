Two objects appear simpler (squares or pixels in the examples) and act as \"endpoints\" or \"targets\". The third object is often more complex or multi-colored and seems to serve as a \"key\" or \"distractor\".\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves drawing a filled shape between the two \"target\" objects.\n5.  **Fill Area:** The filled area corresponds to the smallest bounding box enclosing both target objects.\n6.  **Fill Condition:** Only the background pixels *within* this bounding box are changed. The original target objects remain untouched within the bounding box.\n7.  **Fill Color:** The color used for filling is derived from the \"key\" object. Specifically, it's the color present in the key object but *not* present in either of the two target objects.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

For each pixel inside the bounding box, check its color in the *input* grid. If the color is the background color (identified in step 1), change the color of that pixel in the *output* grid to the 'fill color' (determined in step 4).\n9.
