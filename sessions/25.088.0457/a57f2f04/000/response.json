            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Background:** All examples use a consistent background color, azure (8).\n2.  **Regions:** The input grids contain one or more distinct rectangular areas separated by the background color. These areas are composed of white (0) pixels and pixels of one other specific color (the 'pattern color').\n3.  **Pattern Color:** Each distinct non-background region uses a single unique color besides white. Examples show blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).\n4.  **Pattern Definition:** Within each region, there's a smaller sub-pattern defined by the arrangement of the pattern color pixels and potentially some white pixels. This sub-pattern seems to be located within the bounding box of the pattern color pixels.\n5.  **Target Area:** The white pixels within a region act as a canvas or target area to be filled. The extent of this area is defined by the bounding box of all non-background pixels within that region.\n6.  **Transformation Action:** The core action is a 'tiling' or 'filling' process. The defined sub-pattern is repeatedly applied (tiled) across the white pixels within the region's target area. Pixels that already have the pattern color in the input remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
