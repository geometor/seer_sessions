```python

"""
This transformation identifies a single non-white 'template' object in the input grid. 
It then tiles this object across a new grid, which has the same width as the input but is one row taller.

The tiling follows these rules:

1.  **Output Grid Initialization:**
    *   Create an output grid with dimensions (input_height + 1, input_width).
    *   Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0).

2.  **Template Identification:**
    *   Find the first contiguous non-white object in the *input* grid. Determine its top-left corner (r0, c0), height (h), width (w), color (template_color), and the relative coordinates of its pixels (pattern).

3.  **Horizontal Tiling (First Row on Output Grid):**
    *   Place the original template object at its original location (r0, c0) on the *output* grid using its original color (template_color).
    *   Generate copies horizontally to the right, starting from column `c0 + horizontal_gap`.
    *   The horizontal gap between the start columns of adjacent objects is fixed (e.g., 4 columns).
    *   The color of the copies follows a repeating pattern: [original_color, original_color, magenta (6)].
    *   Tiling continues as long as the starting column (`current_c`) of the next potential copy is less than the output grid's width. Objects may be partially placed if they extend beyond the right edge.

4.  **Vertical Tiling (Subsequent Rows on Output Grid):**
    *   Replicate patterns downwards, starting from row `r0 + vertical_gap`.
    *   The vertical gap between the start rows of adjacent patterns is fixed and equal to the template object's height plus one row (`h + 1`).
    *   Crucially, only the *magenta* colored objects from the first row's pattern are copied into the subsequent rows. The original colored objects are *not* replicated vertically.
    *   The vertically replicated objects retain the magenta color.
    *   Tiling continues as long as the starting row (`current_r`) of the next potential row of copies is less than the output grid's height. Objects may be partially placed if they extend beyond the bottom edge.

The final output grid contains the tiled pattern.

Match: False
Pixels Off: None
Size Correct: False
Color Palette Correct: True
Color Count Correct: False
Score: None
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous code correctly identified the core logic: finding a template object, tiling it horizontally with a specific color pattern, and then replicating only the magenta instances vertically. However, it failed because it incorrectly calculated the output grid size, making it one row taller than the input/expected output.

The strategy is straightforward:
1.  Correct the output grid dimensions to match the input grid dimensions.
2.  Verify the object identification, tiling gaps, and color sequence logic using metrics from both examples.
3.  Update the Natural Language Program to reflect the correct output size and confirm the tiling rules.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's gather precise metrics for both examples.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  description: "The task involves tiling a single template object found in the input grid onto an output grid of the same dimensions."
  background_color: 0 # white

input_grid:
  properties:
    - Contains a single contiguous non-background object (the 'template').
    - Background is white (0).
  examples:
    - id: 1
      shape: [23, 28]
      template_object:
        color: 7 # orange
        shape_description: "Approximate '8' shape"
        location: [5, 3] # top-left corner (r0, c0)
        height: 3
        width: 3
    - id: 2
      shape: [23, 28]
      template_object:
        color: 7 # orange
        shape_description: "Approximate 'H' shape"
        location: [4, 5] # top-left corner (r0, c0)
        height: 5
        width: 3

output_grid:
  properties:
    - Has the exact same dimensions (height, width) as the input grid.
    - Contains a tiled pattern derived from the input template object.
    - Background is white (0).

transformation:
  actions:
    - Identify the single non-white contiguous object in the input grid (template). Record its shape (relative pixel coordinates), color, height (h), width (w), and top-left position (r0, c0).
    - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    - Perform horizontal tiling starting from the template's original position (r0, c0) on the output grid.
      - Place the first instance using the template's original color.
      - Place subsequent copies to the right.
      - The horizontal gap between the start columns (c0) of adjacent copies is fixed at 4.
      - The color of the copies cycles through a sequence: [original_color, original_color, magenta (6)].
      - Continue tiling horizontally as long as the starting column of the next copy is within the grid width. Objects extending beyond the right edge are clipped.
    - Perform vertical tiling based on the objects placed in the initial row (at r0).
      - Start placing the first row of vertical copies at row `r0 + h + 1`.
      - The vertical gap between the start rows of subsequent replicated rows is `h + 1`.
      - Only replicate the objects from the initial row that were colored magenta (6).
      - The vertically replicated objects retain the magenta color.
      - Continue tiling vertically as long as the starting row of the next set of copies is within the grid height. Objects extending beyond the bottom edge are clipped.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization**: Create a new output grid with the exact same height and width as the input grid, filling it with the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Template Identification**: Find the single contiguous block of non-white pixels in the *input* grid. Determine its top-left corner coordinates (`r0`, `c0`), height (`h`), width (`w`), color (`template_color`), and the relative coordinates of its pixels (`pattern`).
3.  **Horizontal Tiling (First Row)**:
    *   Place the identified `pattern` onto the *output* grid starting at position (`r0`, `c0`) using the `template_color`.
    *   Initialize a horizontal copy counter to 1 and the next horizontal starting column (`current_c`) to `c0 + 4`.
    *   While `current_c` is less than the grid width:
        *   Determine the color for the current copy using the sequence [`template_color`, `template_color`, magenta (6)], based on the copy counter (modulo 3).
        *   Place the `pattern` onto the output grid starting at (`r0`, `current_c`) using the determined color, clipping if it goes beyond the grid boundaries.
        *   Store the starting column (`current_c`) and color of this placed copy if its color is magenta.
        *   Increment the copy counter.
        *   Update `current_c` by adding 4.
4.  **Vertical Tiling (Subsequent Rows)**:
    *   Initialize the next vertical starting row (`current_r`) to `r0 + h + 1`.
    *   While `current_r` is less than the grid height:
        *   For each stored magenta object location from the first row (identified by its starting column `magenta_c`):
            *   Place the `pattern` onto the output grid starting at (`current_r`, `magenta_c`) using the magenta color (6), clipping if it goes beyond the grid boundaries.
        *   Update `current_r` by adding `h + 1`.
5.  **Final Output**: The resulting output grid contains the complete tiled pattern.
