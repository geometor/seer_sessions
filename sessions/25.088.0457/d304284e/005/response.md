"""
This transformation identifies a single non-white 'template' object in the input grid. 
It then tiles this object across the output grid, which has the *same dimensions* as the input grid.

The tiling follows these rules:

1.  **Output Grid Initialization**:
    *   Create an output grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
    *   Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0).

2.  **Template Identification**:
    *   Find the single contiguous non-white object in the *input* grid. Determine its top-left corner relative to the input grid (`r0`, `c0`), its height (`h`), width (`w`), color (`template_color`), and the relative coordinates of its constituent pixels (`pattern`).

3.  **Horizontal Tiling (First Row on Output Grid)**:
    *   Place the identified `pattern` onto the *output* grid starting at the template's original position (`r0`, `c0`) using its original `template_color`.
    *   Generate copies horizontally to the right, starting from column `c0 + 4`.
    *   The horizontal gap between the starting columns of adjacent objects is fixed at 4.
    *   The color of the copies follows a repeating pattern: [`template_color`, `template_color`, magenta (6)]. The first copy (at `c0+4`) uses the second color in the sequence, the next (at `c0+8`) uses the third, and so on.
    *   Store the starting column of each *magenta* object placed in this first row.
    *   Tiling continues as long as the starting column (`current_c`) of the next potential copy is less than the output grid's width. Objects are clipped if they extend beyond the right edge.

4.  **Vertical Tiling (Subsequent Rows on Output Grid)**:
    *   Replicate patterns downwards, starting from row `r0 + h + 1`.
    *   The vertical gap between the starting rows of adjacent pattern rows is fixed and equal to the template object's height plus one row (`h + 1`).
    *   Crucially, only the *magenta* colored objects from the first row's pattern are copied into the subsequent rows. The corresponding column positions are used.
    *   The vertically replicated objects retain the magenta color (6).
    *   Tiling continues as long as the starting row (`current_r`) of the next potential row of copies is less than the output grid's height. Objects are clipped if they extend beyond the bottom edge.

The final output grid contains the completed tiled pattern.
