task_context:
  description: "The task involves tiling a single template object found in the input grid onto an output grid of the same dimensions."
  background_color: 0 # white

input_grid:
  properties:
    - Contains a single contiguous non-background object (the 'template').
    - Background is white (0).
  examples:
    - id: 1
      shape: [23, 28]
      template_object:
        color: 7 # orange
        shape_description: "Approximate '8' shape"
        location: [5, 3] # top-left corner (r0, c0)
        height: 3
        width: 3
    - id: 2
      shape: [23, 28]
      template_object:
        color: 7 # orange
        shape_description: "Approximate 'H' shape"
        location: [4, 5] # top-left corner (r0, c0)
        height: 5
        width: 3

output_grid:
  properties:
    - Has the exact same dimensions (height, width) as the input grid.
    - Contains a tiled pattern derived from the input template object.
    - Background is white (0).

transformation:
  actions:
    - Identify the single non-white contiguous object in the input grid (template). Record its shape (relative pixel coordinates), color, height (h), width (w), and top-left position (r0, c0).
    - Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    - Perform horizontal tiling starting from the template's original position (r0, c0) on the output grid.
      - Place the first instance using the template's original color.
      - Place subsequent copies to the right.
      - The horizontal gap between the start columns (c0) of adjacent copies is fixed at 4.
      - The color of the copies cycles through a sequence: [original_color, original_color, magenta (6)].
      - Continue tiling horizontally as long as the starting column of the next copy is within the grid width. Objects extending beyond the right edge are clipped.
    - Perform vertical tiling based on the objects placed in the initial row (at r0).
      - Start placing the first row of vertical copies at row `r0 + h + 1`.
      - The vertical gap between the start rows of subsequent replicated rows is `h + 1`.
      - Only replicate the objects from the initial row that were colored magenta (6).
      - The vertically replicated objects retain the magenta color.
      - Continue tiling vertically as long as the starting row of the next set of copies is within the grid height. Objects extending beyond the bottom edge are clipped.
