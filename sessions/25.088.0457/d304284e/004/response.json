However, it failed because it incorrectly calculated the output grid size, making it one row taller than the input/expected output.\n\nThe strategy is straightforward:\n1.  Correct the output grid dimensions to match the input grid dimensions.\n2.  Verify the object identification, tiling gaps, and color sequence logic using metrics from both examples.\n3.  Update the Natural Language Program to reflect the correct output size and confirm the tiling rules.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's gather precise metrics for both examples.\n\n"

Determine its top-left corner coordinates (`r0`, `c0`), height (`h`), width (`w`), color (`template_color`), and the relative coordinates of its pixels (`pattern`).\n3.  **Horizontal Tiling (First Row)**:\n    *   Place the identified `pattern` onto the *output* grid starting at position (`r0`, `c0`) using the `template_color`.\n    *   Initialize a horizontal copy counter to 1 and the next horizontal starting column (`current_c`) to `c0 + 4`.\n    *   While `current_c` is less than the grid width:\n        *   Determine the color for the current copy using the sequence [`template_color`, `template_color`, magenta (6)], based on the copy counter (modulo 3).\n        *   Place the `pattern` onto the output grid starting at (`r0`, `current_c`) using the determined color, clipping if it goes beyond the grid boundaries.\n        *   Store the starting column (`current_c`) and color of this placed copy if its color is magenta.\n        *   Increment the copy counter.\n        *   Update `current_c` by adding 4.\n4.  **Vertical Tiling (Subsequent Rows)**:\n    *   Initialize the next vertical starting row (`current_r`) to `r0 + h + 1`.\n    *   While `current_r` is less than the grid height:\n        *   For each stored magenta object location from the first row (identified by its starting column `magenta_c`):\n            *   Place the `pattern` onto the output grid starting at (`current_r`, `magenta_c`) using the magenta color (6), clipping if it goes beyond the grid boundaries.\n        *   Update `current_r` by adding `h + 1`.\n5.  **Final Output**: The resulting output grid contains the complete tiled pattern."
