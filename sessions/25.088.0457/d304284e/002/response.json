            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the template object and the basic tiling pattern (horizontal repetition with changing colors, vertical repetition of specific columns). However, it failed due to two main issues:\n\n1.  **Output Grid Size:** The code assumed the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The examples show the output grid height is consistently one greater than the input grid height (`output_height = input_height + 1`), while the width remains the same (`output_width = input_width`).\n2.  **Loop Termination/Clipping:** The conditions for stopping the horizontal and vertical tiling loops were slightly incorrect. They should continue as long as the starting coordinate is within the respective output grid dimension, allowing objects to be placed even if they get partially clipped by the grid boundaries. The pixel placement function should handle the clipping.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the code to create an output grid of the correct size (`input_height + 1`, `input_width`).\n2.  Adjust the `while` loop conditions for both horizontal and vertical tiling to use the *output* grid dimensions (`output_width`, `output_height`) and check only the starting coordinate (`current_c < output_width`, `current_r < output_height`).\n3.  Ensure the `place_pattern` function correctly clips pixels that fall outside the output grid boundaries.\n4.  Re-initialize the output grid with the background color (white) before placing any objects.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"
