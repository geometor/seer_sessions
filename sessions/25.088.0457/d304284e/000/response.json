            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a single, contiguous object of a specific color (`orange`, value 7) against a `white` (value 0) background. The shape of the object varies between examples (`train_1` looks like a '0', `train_2` looks like an 'H').\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original object in its initial position. The key transformation is the replication of this object across the grid in a specific pattern.\n3.  **Replication Pattern:**\n    *   **Horizontal:** The object is tiled horizontally to the right. There's a consistent horizontal gap between the start of each copy (4 columns in both examples). The color follows a repeating sequence: the first two copies retain the original `orange` color, and the third copy changes to `magenta` (value 6). This `orange`, `orange`, `magenta` pattern repeats across the row. Tiling stops when the next copy would exceed the grid's width.\n    *   **Vertical:** The entire first row of generated objects (including the original) serves as a template for vertical tiling downwards. There's a consistent vertical gap between the start of each row. This gap appears to be the height of the object plus one row (`train_1`: height 3, gap 4; `train_2`: height 5, gap 6).\n    *   **Vertical Filtering:** Crucially, in the rows generated *below* the initial row, only the `magenta` objects are copied. The `orange` objects from the first row are *not* replicated in subsequent rows. Tiling stops when the next row would exceed the grid's height.\n4.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and internal structure of the object are preserved during copying and color change.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
