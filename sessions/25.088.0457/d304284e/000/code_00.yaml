task_type: pattern_generation_tiling
components:
  - role: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default color filling most of the grid.
  - role: template_object
    count: 1 (in input)
    color: orange (7) # Based on examples, could potentially be other colors.
    properties:
      - contiguous block of non-background color
      - shape varies between examples (e.g., '0', 'H')
      - defines the pattern unit
    actions:
      - locate in input grid
      - copy
      - change color (conditionally)
  - role: derived_object
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - same shape as template_object
    origin: Created by changing the color of a template_object copy during tiling.
relationships:
  - type: tiling
    direction: horizontal
    source: template_object
    parameters:
      - horizontal_gap: 4 columns (between starting columns of objects)
      - color_pattern: [orange, orange, magenta] repeating sequence (using example colors)
      - boundary: grid width
  - type: tiling
    direction: vertical
    source: first_row_pattern (generated by horizontal tiling)
    parameters:
      - vertical_gap: template_object_height + 1 row (between starting rows of objects)
      - filtering: only copy magenta objects in subsequent rows
      - boundary: grid height
