The colors observed in the examples are red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), green (3), and yellow (4).\n\nThe output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but with the addition of azure-colored pixels (color 8). These azure pixels appear exclusively in the white spaces *between* pairs of rectangles.\n\nSpecifically, azure pixels fill the rectangular area that connects two rectangles if and only if:\n1.  The two rectangles are of the **same color**.\n2.  The two rectangles are aligned either horizontally or vertically.\n3.  The space between their facing edges consists entirely of white pixels.\n4.  The filled area forms a solid azure rectangle connecting the two original rectangles along their facing edges.\n\nGaps between rectangles of different colors are not filled. Gaps between rectangles of the same color that are not directly facing each other (e.g., diagonally offset, or separated by other colors) are not filled. Single rectangles without a matching partner do not cause any filling.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid. For each rectangle, record its color and bounding box coordinates (top row, bottom row, left column, right column).\n3.  Iterate through all possible pairs of identified rectangles.\n4.  For each pair of rectangles (RectA, RectB):\n    a.  Check if RectA and RectB have the **same color**. If not, continue to the next pair.\n    b.  Check if RectA and RectB are **horizontally aligned and facing** each other:\n        i.   Verify that their row ranges overlap (i.e., `max(RectA.top, RectB.top) <= min(RectA.bottom, RectB.bottom)`).\n        ii.  Verify that they are separated horizontally (e.g., `RectA.right < RectB.left` or `RectB.right < RectA.left`). Assume `RectA` is to the left of `RectB` without loss of generality (`RectA.right < RectB.left`).\n        iii. Define the potential horizontal gap region: rows from `max(RectA.top, RectB.top)` to `min(RectA.bottom, RectB.bottom)`, columns from `RectA.right + 1` to `RectB.left - 1`.\n        iv. Check if all pixels within this potential gap region in the *input* grid are white (0).\n        v.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii, iv) are met, fill all pixels within this gap region in the *output* grid with azure (8).\n    c.  Check if RectA and RectB are **vertically aligned and facing** each other:\n        i.   Verify that their column ranges overlap (i.e., `max(RectA.left, RectB.left) <= min(RectA.right, RectB.right)`).\n        ii.  Verify that they are separated vertically (e.g., `RectA.bottom < RectB.top` or `RectB.bottom < RectA.top`). Assume `RectA` is above `RectB` without loss of generality (`RectA.bottom < RectB.top`).\n        iii. Define the potential vertical gap region: rows from `RectA.bottom + 1` to `RectB.top - 1`, columns from `max(RectA.left, RectB.left)` to `min(RectA.right, RectB.right)`.\n        iv. Check if all pixels within this potential gap region in the *input* grid are white (0).\n        v.  If all conditions (i, ii, iii, iv) are met, fill all pixels within this gap region in the *output* grid with azure (8).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
