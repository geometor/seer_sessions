Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves identifying specific structures within the input grid and modifying the surrounding areas based on those structures.

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a white (0) background with various shapes made of blue (1) pixels. These shapes can be closed loops (like rectangles or irregular closed figures) or open lines/curves.
2.  **Output Grid:** Modifies the input grid by adding two new colors: red (2) and green (3).
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The blue (1) pixel structures seem to act as boundaries or containers.
    *   Regions of white (0) pixels completely enclosed by a continuous loop of blue (1) pixels are filled with green (3).
    *   White (0) pixels that are adjacent (including diagonally) to the blue (1) pixels forming these closed loops, but are *outside* the enclosed region, are colored red (2).
    *   Blue (1) pixels themselves remain unchanged.
    *   White (0) pixels not enclosed and not adjacent to the exterior of a closed loop remain white (0).
    *   Blue (1) structures that do not form a closed loop enclosing white pixels do not trigger any changes (as seen in `train_2` and parts of `train_1` and `train_3`).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_modification
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: boundary
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - can form closed loops
      - can form open lines/shapes
  - type: fill
    color: green (3)
    relation: appears inside closed blue boundaries
  - type: outline
    color: red (2)
    relation: appears adjacent (including diagonal) to the exterior of closed blue boundaries

actions:
  - identify: closed loops formed by blue (1) pixels that enclose white (0) pixels.
  - fill: change the color of white (0) pixels inside the identified closed loops to green (3).
  - outline: change the color of white (0) pixels adjacent (including diagonal) to the exterior side of the blue (1) pixels forming the closed loops to red (2).

relationships:
  - enclosure: blue (1) pixels can enclose white (0) pixels.
  - adjacency: red (2) pixels are placed adjacent (8-connectivity) to the blue (1) pixels of closed loops, on the side opposite the green (3) fill.

conditions:
  - filling and outlining only occur for blue (1) structures that form closed loops enclosing white (0) pixels.
  - open blue (1) structures are ignored.
  - original blue (1) pixels are preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) made of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each blue region:
    a.  Determine if this region forms a closed loop that fully encloses one or more white (0) pixels. This can be checked by performing a flood fill starting from a white pixel known to be outside any potential loop (e.g., a corner pixel if it's white) and seeing which white pixels remain unvisited. These unvisited white pixels are enclosed.
    b.  If a blue region forms such a closed loop:
        i.  Identify all the white (0) pixels enclosed within this loop. Change their color to green (3) in the output grid.
        ii. Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) to any blue (1) pixel belonging to this specific closed loop.
        iii. For each such adjacent white pixel, check if it was *not* identified as being *inside* the loop in step (3.b.i). If it is adjacent and outside, change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
