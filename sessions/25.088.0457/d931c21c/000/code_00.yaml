task_type: object_modification
objects:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: boundary
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - can form closed loops
      - can form open lines/shapes
  - type: fill
    color: green (3)
    relation: appears inside closed blue boundaries
  - type: outline
    color: red (2)
    relation: appears adjacent (including diagonal) to the exterior of closed blue boundaries

actions:
  - identify: closed loops formed by blue (1) pixels that enclose white (0) pixels.
  - fill: change the color of white (0) pixels inside the identified closed loops to green (3).
  - outline: change the color of white (0) pixels adjacent (including diagonal) to the exterior side of the blue (1) pixels forming the closed loops to red (2).

relationships:
  - enclosure: blue (1) pixels can enclose white (0) pixels.
  - adjacency: red (2) pixels are placed adjacent (8-connectivity) to the blue (1) pixels of closed loops, on the side opposite the green (3) fill.

conditions:
  - filling and outlining only occur for blue (1) structures that form closed loops enclosing white (0) pixels.
  - open blue (1) structures are ignored.
  - original blue (1) pixels are preserved.
