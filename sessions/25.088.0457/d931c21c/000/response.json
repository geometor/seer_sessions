These shapes can be closed loops (like rectangles or irregular closed figures) or open lines/curves.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Modifies the input grid by adding two new colors: red (2) and green (3).\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The blue (1) pixel structures seem to act as boundaries or containers.\n    *   Regions of white (0) pixels completely enclosed by a continuous loop of blue (1) pixels are filled with green (3).\n    *   White (0) pixels that are adjacent (including diagonally) to the blue (1) pixels forming these closed loops, but are *outside* the enclosed region, are colored red (2).\n    *   Blue (1) pixels themselves remain unchanged.\n    *   White (0) pixels not enclosed and not adjacent to the exterior of a closed loop remain white (0).\n    *   Blue (1) structures that do not form a closed loop enclosing white pixels do not trigger any changes (as seen in `train_2` and parts of `train_1` and `train_3`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) made of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n3.  For each blue region:\n    a.  Determine if this region forms a closed loop that fully encloses one or more white (0) pixels. This can be checked by performing a flood fill starting from a white pixel known to be outside any potential loop (e.g., a corner pixel if it's white) and seeing which white pixels remain unvisited. These unvisited white pixels are enclosed.\n    b.  If a blue region forms such a closed loop:\n        i.  Identify all the white (0) pixels enclosed within this loop. Change their color to green (3) in the output grid.\n        ii. Identify all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (sharing a side or a corner) to any blue (1) pixel belonging to this specific closed loop.\n        iii. For each such adjacent white pixel, check if it was *not* identified as being *inside* the loop in step (3.b.i). If it is adjacent and outside, change its color to red (2) in the output grid.\n4.  Return the modified output grid."
