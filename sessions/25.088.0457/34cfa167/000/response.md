Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Background:** The most frequent color in the input grid seems to serve as the background color for the output grid (white/0 in Ex1, yellow/4 in Ex2).
2.  **Anchor Objects:** In both examples, the input contains exactly two identical objects (blue squares) which are neither the background color nor directly adjacent horizontally or vertically. These appear to act as anchors, defining the top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corners of a rectangular area in the output.
3.  **Replication of Anchors:** The output grid places four copies of the anchor object: at the original TL position, the original BR position, and two new positions corresponding to the top-right (TR) and bottom-left (BL) corners of the rectangle defined by TL and BR.
4.  **Pattern Objects:** Other objects in the input seem to define repeating patterns.
    *   Objects located horizontally adjacent (or near-adjacent) to the TL anchor define a horizontal pattern. In Ex1, a yellow pixel and a red pixel to the right of the TL blue square. In Ex2, a red rectangle and an azure rectangle to the right of the TL blue square.
    *   Objects located vertically adjacent (or near-adjacent) to the TL anchor define a vertical pattern. In Ex1, an azure rectangle and a red rectangle below the TL blue square. In Ex2, a green rectangle and an azure rectangle below the TL blue square.
5.  **Pattern Generation:**
    *   The horizontal pattern objects, interleaved with the background color, are tiled horizontally between the TL and TR anchors, and between the BL and BR anchors. The height of these tiled pattern elements matches the height of the anchor object, while their width matches their original width in the input.
    *   The vertical pattern objects, interleaved with the background color, are tiled vertically between the TL and BL anchors, and between the TR and BR anchors. The width of these tiled pattern elements matches the width of the anchor object, while their height matches their original height in the input.
6.  **Border Lines:** Single-pixel thick lines are drawn just outside the main rectangle formed by the anchors and tiled patterns.
    *   The top and bottom border lines use the color of the first object in the horizontal pattern sequence.
    *   The left and right border lines use the color of the first object in the vertical pattern sequence.
7.  **Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
