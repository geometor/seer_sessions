Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids are consistently 23x23. They contain a background of white (0) pixels and exactly three non-white pixels.
2.  **Non-White Pixels:** In each example, the three non-white pixels share the same color (red=2 in example 1, azure=8 in example 2, green=3 in example 3). These three pixels are located at different, seemingly arbitrary positions within the grid.
3.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are also 23x23. They retain the three original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, more pixels of the same color are added.
4.  **Transformation:** The added pixels form straight lines connecting the three original points (vertices). These lines create a closed triangular shape. The area *inside* this triangle, including the boundary lines, is filled entirely with the same color as the original vertices.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed at 23x23 for all examples.
  background_color: white (0)
  input_features:
    - object_type: Point (Pixel)
      count: 3
      color_constraint: All three points share the same non-white color.
      role: Define vertices of a triangle.
  output_features:
    - object_type: Filled Triangle
      color: Same as the input points.
      definition: Geometric shape formed by connecting the three input points and filling the enclosed area.
      properties: Includes the boundary lines and the interior region.
transformation:
  action: Identify Points
    - description: Find the coordinates and color of the three non-white pixels in the input.
  action: Draw Triangle Boundary
    - description: Calculate the pixels forming the straight lines connecting the three identified points pairwise.
    - parameters: Use the color identified from the input points.
  action: Fill Triangle Interior
    - description: Determine all pixels enclosed by the boundary lines drawn in the previous step.
    - parameters: Use the color identified from the input points. Fill includes the boundary pixels themselves.
  relationship: The output structure (filled triangle) is directly determined by the location and color of the three input points.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the coordinates (`(r1, c1)`, `(r2, c2)`, `(r3, c3)`) and the shared color (`C`) of the three non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Draw the three line segments connecting the vertices `(r1, c1)` to `(r2, c2)`, `(r2, c2)` to `(r3, c3)`, and `(r3, c3)` to `(r1, c1)` onto the output grid using color `C`. (Use a suitable line drawing algorithm like Bresenham's).
4.  Identify all pixels that lie within or on the boundary of the triangle formed by these three vertices.
5.  Set the color of all these identified interior and boundary pixels in the output grid to color `C`.
