task_context:
  grid_size: Fixed at 23x23 for all examples.
  background_color: white (0)
  input_features:
    - object_type: Point (Pixel)
      count: 3
      color_constraint: All three points share the same non-white color.
      role: Define vertices of a triangle.
  output_features:
    - object_type: Filled Triangle
      color: Same as the input points.
      definition: Geometric shape formed by connecting the three input points and filling the enclosed area.
      properties: Includes the boundary lines and the interior region.
transformation:
  action: Identify Points
    - description: Find the coordinates and color of the three non-white pixels in the input.
  action: Draw Triangle Boundary
    - description: Calculate the pixels forming the straight lines connecting the three identified points pairwise.
    - parameters: Use the color identified from the input points.
  action: Fill Triangle Interior
    - description: Determine all pixels enclosed by the boundary lines drawn in the previous step.
    - parameters: Use the color identified from the input points. Fill includes the boundary pixels themselves.
  relationship: The output structure (filled triangle) is directly determined by the location and color of the three input points.
