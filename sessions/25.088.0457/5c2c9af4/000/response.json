They contain a background of white (0) pixels and exactly three non-white pixels.\n2.  **Non-White Pixels:** In each example, the three non-white pixels share the same color (red=2 in example 1, azure=8 in example 2, green=3 in example 3). These three pixels are located at different, seemingly arbitrary positions within the grid.\n3.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are also 23x23. They retain the three original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, more pixels of the same color are added.\n4.  **Transformation:** The added pixels form straight lines connecting the three original points (vertices). These lines create a closed triangular shape. The area *inside* this triangle, including the boundary lines, is filled entirely with the same color as the original vertices.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  Draw the three line segments connecting the vertices `(r1, c1)` to `(r2, c2)`, `(r2, c2)` to `(r3, c3)`, and `(r3, c3)` to `(r1, c1)` onto the output grid using color `C`.
