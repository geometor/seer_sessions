Okay, let's analyze the provided `train_1` example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids are 30x30.
2.  **Colors:** The input grid contains a variety of colors, notably large patches of Magenta (6) and Azure (8), along with scattered pixels of Blue (1), Red (2), and Green (3).
3.  **Objects:** We can perceive distinct regions or "objects" based on contiguous blocks of the same color. The most prominent are large rectangular blocks of Magenta and Azure.
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output, most pixels remain unchanged. However, two specific rectangular areas have been altered:
    *   A rectangle originally filled with Magenta (6) from coordinates (row=2, col=5) to (row=6, col=13) is now filled with Yellow (4).
    *   A rectangle originally filled with Azure (8) from coordinates (row=16, col=13) to (row=21, col=20) is now filled with Yellow (4).
5.  **Pattern:** The transformation targets solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks. The selection criteria for which blocks get transformed seems related to the block's color and size (area). In `train_1`, the largest Magenta block and the largest Azure block were changed. Looking at `train_2`, the largest blocks for Azure (8), Red (2), Green (3), and Blue (1) were changed. This suggests a rule involving finding the largest rectangle for *each* color and applying a change if it meets certain criteria. A consistent criterion appears to be the area of the rectangle. In `train_1`, the areas are 5x9=45 (Magenta) and 6x8=48 (Azure). In `train_2`, the areas are 6x6=36 (Azure), 6x7=42 (Red), 5x5=25 (Green), and 6x7=42 (Blue). It seems rectangles with an area of 25 or greater are targeted.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: object_property_modification
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
object_definition:
  - type: solid_rectangle
    description: A rectangular block of contiguous cells sharing the same color `C`, where `C` is not 0.
object_properties:
  - object: solid_rectangle
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color `C` of the cells within the rectangle.
      - location: Coordinates (top_row, left_col) of the top-left cell.
      - dimensions: height and width of the rectangle.
      - area: Product of height and width.
identification_process:
  - step: find_colors
    description: Identify all unique colors `C` present in the input grid (excluding 0).
  - step: find_largest_rectangle_per_color
    description: For each identified color `C`, find the solid_rectangle composed of `C` that has the maximum area. Record the rectangle's bounds and its area.
selection_criteria:
  - condition: area_threshold
    property: area (of the largest solid_rectangle for a given color)
    operator: greater than or equal to (>=)
    value: 25
action:
  - name: recolor
    target: pixels within the selected largest solid_rectangles (those meeting the area_threshold)
    new_color: 4 (yellow)
    unchanged: all other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Find all distinct colors present in the input grid, ignoring the background color 0 (white).
3.  For each distinct color `C` found:
    a. Locate all contiguous, solid rectangular blocks composed entirely of color `C` within the input grid.
    b. Identify the rectangle among these that possesses the largest area (calculated as height Ã— width). Let this be the "largest rectangle" for color `C`. Note its location and dimensions.
    c. Calculate the area of this largest rectangle for color `C`.
    d. If the calculated area is 25 or greater:
        i.  Modify the output grid by changing the color of all pixels within the bounds of this largest rectangle to color 4 (yellow).
4.  Output the modified grid.
