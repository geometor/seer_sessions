task_type: object_property_modification
grid_properties:
  size_preservation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
object_definition:
  - type: solid_rectangle
    description: A rectangular block of contiguous cells sharing the same color `C`, where `C` is not 0.
object_properties:
  - object: solid_rectangle
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color `C` of the cells within the rectangle.
      - location: Coordinates (top_row, left_col) of the top-left cell.
      - dimensions: height and width of the rectangle.
      - area: Product of height and width.
identification_process:
  - step: find_colors
    description: Identify all unique colors `C` present in the input grid (excluding 0).
  - step: find_largest_rectangle_per_color
    description: For each identified color `C`, find the solid_rectangle composed of `C` that has the maximum area. Record the rectangle's bounds and its area.
selection_criteria:
  - condition: area_threshold
    property: area (of the largest solid_rectangle for a given color)
    operator: greater than or equal to (>=)
    value: 25
action:
  - name: recolor
    target: pixels within the selected largest solid_rectangles (those meeting the area_threshold)
    new_color: 4 (yellow)
    unchanged: all other pixels retain their original color from the input grid.
