            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided `train_1` example pair.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids are 30x30.\n2.  **Colors:** The input grid contains a variety of colors, notably large patches of Magenta (6) and Azure (8), along with scattered pixels of Blue (1), Red (2), and Green (3).\n3.  **Objects:** We can perceive distinct regions or \"objects\" based on contiguous blocks of the same color. The most prominent are large rectangular blocks of Magenta and Azure.\n4.  **Transformation:** Comparing the input and output, most pixels remain unchanged. However, two specific rectangular areas have been altered:\n    *   A rectangle originally filled with Magenta (6) from coordinates (row=2, col=5) to (row=6, col=13) is now filled with Yellow (4).\n    *   A rectangle originally filled with Azure (8) from coordinates (row=16, col=13) to (row=21, col=20) is now filled with Yellow (4).\n5.  **Pattern:** The transformation targets solid, monochromatic rectangular blocks. The selection criteria for which blocks get transformed seems related to the block's color and size (area). In `train_1`, the largest Magenta block and the largest Azure block were changed. Looking at `train_2`, the largest blocks for Azure (8), Red (2), Green (3), and Blue (1) were changed. This suggests a rule involving finding the largest rectangle for *each* color and applying a change if it meets certain criteria. A consistent criterion appears to be the area of the rectangle. In `train_1`, the areas are 5x9=45 (Magenta) and 6x8=48 (Azure). In `train_2`, the areas are 6x6=36 (Azure), 6x7=42 (Red), 5x5=25 (Green), and 6x7=42 (Blue). It seems rectangles with an area of 25 or greater are targeted.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
