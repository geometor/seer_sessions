"""
Identify the largest solid monochromatic rectangle for each color (excluding white/0).
If the area of the largest rectangle for a given color is 25 or greater, 
change the color of all pixels within that rectangle to yellow (4).
Otherwise, leave the pixels unchanged.
Perform this check and potential modification for every non-white color present
in the input grid.
