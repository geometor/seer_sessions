## General Assessment

The provided Python code attempts to solve the task by identifying non-white objects, determining if they are "perfect hollow rectangles," checking the contents and area of their interiors, and then applying transformations (fill, remove, or keep).

The code fails on all three training examples.
- **Example 1:** Incorrectly fills the gray object (which has internal pixels) and fails to remove the orange object (small area). The transformed output shown in the prompt seems inconsistent with the described code logic for the gray object, but matches for the orange one. However, the expected output matches the logic: fill large hollow, remove small hollow, keep complex shape.
- **Example 2:** Incorrectly fills the magenta object (which has internal pixels). The expected output shows it should be unchanged. The yellow (large hollow) and gray (small hollow) objects are transformed correctly according to the expected output.
- **Example 3:** The code's transformed output correctly fills/removes/keeps objects based on the rules (hollow, area>=10 -> fill; hollow, area<10 -> remove; complex -> keep), *except* that the *expected output* shows the large hollow orange object being *removed* instead of filled, which contradicts the pattern in other examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Classification:** Clearly define criteria for:
    *   A "perfect hollow rectangle": An object whose pixels exactly match the perimeter of its bounding box, with no object pixels strictly inside the bounding box.
    *   The state of the bounding box interior: Does it contain *only* white pixels, or does it contain other colors (including the object's own color)?
2.  **Refine Transformation Rules:** Based on the classification and interior properties:
    *   Rule A: If an object is a perfect hollow rectangle and its interior contains only white pixels:
        *   If the interior area (number of pixels strictly inside the bounding box) is 10 or greater, fill the interior white pixels with the object's color.
        *   If the interior area is less than 10, remove the object (change its pixels to white).
    *   Rule B: If an object is *not* a perfect hollow rectangle OR its interior contains non-white pixels, leave the object unchanged.
3.  **Address Discrepancy:** Assume the pattern observed across Ex1, Ex2, and most of Ex3 (fill large hollow, remove small hollow, keep complex) is the correct general rule. The removal of the large hollow Orange(7) in Ex3's expected output seems anomalous compared to the filling of large hollow Green(3), Red(2), Yellow(4) in Ex1, Yellow(4) in Ex2, and Red(2), Blue(1) in Ex3. Proceed with the general rule, acknowledging this single inconsistency in the provided examples.
4.  **Implement and Verify:** Re-implement the logic carefully based on these refined rules and verify against the *expected outputs*, noting the Ex3 Orange(7) case.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the properties of each object in the examples relative to the refined rules.
