Store these as a mapping `M` where `M[color_col0] = color_col1`. Keep track of the output color (`last_out`) from the very last pair found.\n2. Locate all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0), *not* red (2), and *not* part of the mapping pairs identified in step 1. These are the \"target pixels\".\n3. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n4. For each target pixel identified in step 2, determine its input color `C_in` and update its color in the output grid according to the following rules:\n    a. If the input color `C_in` is blue (1):\n        i. Find the normally mapped output color `NormalTarget = M[1]`.\n        ii. Check if this `NormalTarget` color also appears as an input color (a key) in the mapping `M`.\n        iii. If `NormalTarget` is also an input key in `M`, change the target pixel's color to `last_out` (the output color from the last mapping pair found in step 1).\n        iv. Otherwise (if `NormalTarget` is not an input key in `M`), change the target pixel's color to `NormalTarget`.\n    b. If the input color `C_in` is *not* blue (1), change the target pixel's color to its corresponding mapped value `M[C_in]`.\n5.
