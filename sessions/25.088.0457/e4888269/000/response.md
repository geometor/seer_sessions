**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are of the same size (10x20).
2.  **Background:** The background color is predominantly white (0).
3.  **Static Elements:**
    *   A vertical red line (color 2) exists in column 9 in all examples and remains unchanged.
    *   The white background pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
4.  **Mapping Block:** The top-left corner (columns 0 and 1) contains pairs of non-white, non-red colors, arranged vertically. The number of pairs can vary (3 or 4 pairs in the examples). This block defines a color mapping rule and remains unchanged in the output.
5.  **Target Pixels:** There are specific pixels scattered outside the mapping block and the red line that change color from input to output. These pixels have colors other than white (0) or red (2). In the examples, the locations of these target pixels are consistent: (2, 14), (6, 11), and (7, 18). Their initial colors are magenta (6), green (3), and blue (1) respectively in all examples.
6.  **Transformation:** The color of the target pixels changes based on the mapping defined by the mapping block, with a specific exception for the blue (1) pixel under certain conditions.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  Size: Fixed (10x20)
  Background: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Line
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Vertical, fixed column (column 9)
    Transformation: Static (unchanged)
  - Type: MappingBlock
    Location: Top-left corner (columns 0 and 1)
    Content: Vertical pairs of non-white, non-red colors
    Role: Defines color transformation rules
    Transformation: Static (unchanged)
  - Type: TargetPixels
    Location: Specific fixed coordinates outside MappingBlock and RedLine ((2, 14), (6, 11), (7, 18) in examples)
    InitialColor: Variable non-white, non-red colors (6, 3, 1 in examples)
    Role: Undergo color transformation
    Transformation: Color changes based on MappingBlock rules
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Action: Define Mapping
    Source: MappingBlock
    Rule: Create a dictionary Map where Map[color_in_col0] = color_in_col1 for each row in the block. Note the last pair defined (last_in, last_out).
  - Action: Transform Target Pixels
    Input: TargetPixels, Map, last_out
    Rule:
      For each TargetPixel with color C_in:
        If C_in is NOT Blue(1):
          OutputColor = Map[C_in]
        If C_in IS Blue(1):
          NormalTarget = Map[1]
          If NormalTarget exists as a key in Map:
            OutputColor = last_out (output value from the last pair in MappingBlock)
          Else:
            OutputColor = NormalTarget
    Output: Modified grid with updated TargetPixel colors
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the color mapping pairs defined in the first two columns (column 0 and column 1) of the input grid, reading row by row. Store these as a mapping `M` where `M[color_col0] = color_col1`. Keep track of the output color (`last_out`) from the very last pair found.
2.  Locate all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0), *not* red (2), and *not* part of the mapping pairs identified in step 1. These are the "target pixels".
3.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
4.  For each target pixel identified in step 2, determine its input color `C_in` and update its color in the output grid according to the following rules:
    a.  If the input color `C_in` is blue (1):
        i.  Find the normally mapped output color `NormalTarget = M[1]`.
        ii. Check if this `NormalTarget` color also appears as an input color (a key) in the mapping `M`.
        iii. If `NormalTarget` is also an input key in `M`, change the target pixel's color to `last_out` (the output color from the last mapping pair found in step 1).
        iv. Otherwise (if `NormalTarget` is not an input key in `M`), change the target pixel's color to `NormalTarget`.
    b.  If the input color `C_in` is *not* blue (1), change the target pixel's color to its corresponding mapped value `M[C_in]`.
5.  All other pixels (white background, red line, mapping block pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid.
