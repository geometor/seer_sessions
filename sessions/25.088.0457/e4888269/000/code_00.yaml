Grid:
  Size: Fixed (10x20)
  Background: White (0)
Objects:
  - Type: Line
    Color: Red (2)
    Location: Vertical, fixed column (column 9)
    Transformation: Static (unchanged)
  - Type: MappingBlock
    Location: Top-left corner (columns 0 and 1)
    Content: Vertical pairs of non-white, non-red colors
    Role: Defines color transformation rules
    Transformation: Static (unchanged)
  - Type: TargetPixels
    Location: Specific fixed coordinates outside MappingBlock and RedLine ((2, 14), (6, 11), (7, 18) in examples)
    InitialColor: Variable non-white, non-red colors (6, 3, 1 in examples)
    Role: Undergo color transformation
    Transformation: Color changes based on MappingBlock rules
Relationships_and_Actions:
  - Action: Define Mapping
    Source: MappingBlock
    Rule: Create a dictionary Map where Map[color_in_col0] = color_in_col1 for each row in the block. Note the last pair defined (last_in, last_out).
  - Action: Transform Target Pixels
    Input: TargetPixels, Map, last_out
    Rule:
      For each TargetPixel with color C_in:
        If C_in is NOT Blue(1):
          OutputColor = Map[C_in]
        If C_in IS Blue(1):
          NormalTarget = Map[1]
          If NormalTarget exists as a key in Map:
            OutputColor = last_out (output value from the last pair in MappingBlock)
          Else:
            OutputColor = NormalTarget
    Output: Modified grid with updated TargetPixel colors
