Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical objects
        positions:
          - (1,1) and (2,1) # row, col
          - (3,4) and (4,4) # row, col
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical objects
        positions:
          - (1,1) and (2,1)
          - (3,4) and (4,4)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: Single-cell objects
        positions:
          - (1,2)
          - (4,3)
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest of the grid
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). Each object is a 2x1 vertical line. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white), which serves as the background.

2.  **Detect Changes:** Compare the output grid to the input grid. Notice that two new single-cell objects of color 1 (blue) have appeared.

3. **Determine Insertion Rule:** Let's define the positions based on a coordinate system where (row, col) starts from (0,0) at the top left.

    *   The first blue cell appears immediately to the right of the top cell of the *first* azure object: Input position(1,1) -> Output position(1,2).
    *   The second blue cell appears immediately to the left of the bottom cell of the *second* azure object: Input position(4,4) -> Output Position(4,3)

4. **Summary:** The transformation rule involves inserting a blue cell (color 1) to the right of the top cell of the leftmost azure object, and another one immediately to the left of the bottom cell of the rightmost azure object. The azure objects and the background remain unchanged.

**In more concise form:**
The rule inserts blue cells (color 1) based on the position and shape of existing azure objects, specifically: 
1. One blue cell is added to the right of the top cell of the leftmost Azure object.
2. One blue cell is added to the left of the bottom cell of the rightmost Azure object.
