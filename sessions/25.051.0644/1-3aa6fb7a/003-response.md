Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
task: 003-example_2
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (top-right)
      position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (middle-left)
      position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (bottom-right)
      position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (top-right)
      position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (middle-left)
      position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (bottom-right)
      position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (0,5) -> (1,4)  # Corrected position
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (2,2) -> (3,3) # Corrected position
     - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (5,4) -> (6,3) # Corrected position
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the rest
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule is identical to the previous example:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Copy all azure objects to the output grid without any changes in position or shape.

3.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:** For each azure object, add a blue (color 1) pixel. The blue pixel's location is immediately to the right of the top-left-most pixel of the azure object.

4.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** The rest of the output grid remains filled with white (color 0).

**Natural Language Program**
```
input:  a grid of pixels with colors from 0 to 9.
output: a grid of pixels with colors from 0 to 9.

program:
  for each azure (8) object in input:
    copy object to the output
    let P be the top-left corner of the bounding box that contains the object
    paint in blue the pixel at P.right
  paint in white all other pixels
```

The Python code developed for the first example should work correctly for this example as well, as the underlying transformation rule is the same.
