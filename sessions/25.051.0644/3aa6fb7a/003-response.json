            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example.\n\n**Observations and Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 003-example_2\ninput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (top-right)\n      position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (middle-left)\n      position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (bottom-right)\n      position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: background\n      position: fills the rest\noutput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (top-right)\n      position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (middle-left)\n      position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (bottom-right)\n      position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      shape: single cell\n      position: (0,5) -> (1,4)  # Corrected position\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      shape: single cell\n      position: (2,2) -> (3,3) # Corrected position\n     - color: 1 (blue)\n      shape: single cell\n      position: (5,4) -> (6,3) # Corrected position\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      shape: background\n      position: fills the rest\n```\n\n**Determining the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe transformation rule is identical to the previous example:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Copy all azure objects to the output grid without any changes in position or shape.\n\n3.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:** For each azure object, add a blue (color 1) pixel. The blue pixel's location is immediately to the right of the top-left-most pixel of the azure object.\n\n4.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** The rest of the output grid remains filled with white (color 0).\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\ninput:  a grid of pixels with colors from 0 to 9.\noutput: a grid of pixels with colors from 0 to 9.\n\nprogram:\n  for each azure (8) object in input:\n    copy object to the output\n    let P be the top-left corner of the bounding box that contains the object\n    paint in blue the pixel at P.right\n  paint in white all other pixels\n```\n\nThe Python code developed for the first example should work correctly for this example as well, as the underlying transformation rule is the same.\n"
