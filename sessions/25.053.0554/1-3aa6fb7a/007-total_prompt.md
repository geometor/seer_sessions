Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the process:

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are 7x7."
  - object_identification: "There are two distinct objects in the input grid, both composed of azure (8) pixels."
  - object_1: "One object is a vertical line of two azure pixels on the left side."
  - object_2: "Another object is a mirrored L shape of three azure pixels, on the right side."
  - change_detection: "One pixel in each object has changed to blue (1) in the output grid."
  - position_analysis_obj1: "In the vertical line, the second azure pixel from top changes to blue."
  - position_analysis_obj2: "In the L shape, the second azure pixel from the top right to bottom left changes to blue."
  - overall_transformation: "One azure pixel changes to blue in each object, and this specific position is the main transformation."

```


**Natural Language Description**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct objects, both made of azure pixels. One is a vertical line segment of length two, and the other is an L-shaped object consisting of three pixels.

2.  **Locate Changed Pixel within Each Object:** For both identified objects identify the pixel second from top to bottom (for vertical) or top-right to bottom left (for L shape).

3.  **Change Color:** The color of the second pixel in the direction described gets changed from azure to blue, with no other changes.

In essence, the transformation rule involves changing one particular azure pixel of each separate object to blue, the selected pixel is the second from the top on the vertical line segment and in the 'L', the second pixel going from top-right to bottom-left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- You may use code execution to examine the details of the task
- Document facts in a YAML block 
- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.  - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.

remember - your response here will be included in the history of the next
prompt as we move through the process. Be sure to include excellent information
for you future self to solve the task.
