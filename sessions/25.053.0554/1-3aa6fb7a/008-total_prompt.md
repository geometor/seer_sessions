Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the process:

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are 7x7."
  - object_identification: "There are two distinct objects in the input grid, both composed of azure (8) pixels."
  - object_1: "One object is a vertical line of two azure pixels on the left side."
  - object_2: "Another object is a mirrored L shape of three azure pixels, on the right side."
  - change_detection: "One pixel in each object has changed to blue (1) in the output grid."
  - position_analysis_obj1: "In the vertical line, the second azure pixel from top changes to blue."
  - position_analysis_obj2: "In the L shape, the second azure pixel from the top right to bottom left changes to blue."
  - overall_transformation: "One azure pixel changes to blue in each object, and this specific position is the main transformation."

```


**Natural Language Description**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct objects, both made of azure pixels. One is a vertical line segment of length two, and the other is an L-shaped object consisting of three pixels.

2.  **Locate Changed Pixel within Each Object:** For both identified objects identify the pixel second from top to bottom (for vertical) or top-right to bottom left (for L shape).

3.  **Change Color:** The color of the second pixel in the direction described gets changed from azure to blue, with no other changes.

In essence, the transformation rule involves changing one particular azure pixel of each separate object to blue, the selected pixel is the second from the top on the vertical line segment and in the 'L', the second pixel going from top-right to bottom-left.

        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:

Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to discern the transformation rule, similar to the previous example.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are 7x7."
  - object_identification: "There are three distinct objects in the input grid, all composed of azure (8) pixels."
  - object_1: "One object is an L shape of three azure pixels, on the top-right side."
  - object_2: "Another object is an L shape of three azure pixels in the center-left."
  - object_3: "A final object is a reversed L shape of three azure pixels, in the bottom-center"
  - change_detection: "One pixel in each of the three L shaped object has changed to blue (1) in the output grid."
  - position_analysis_obj1: "In the first L shape, the second azure pixel from top right to bottom left has changed."
  - position_analysis_obj2: "In the second object, a vertical L shape, the second pixel from top to bottom changes to blue."
  - position_analysis_obj3: "For the third object, a horizontal mirrored L shape. The second element from right to left and top to bottom changes to blue."
  - overall_transformation: "One azure pixel changes to blue in each object, and this specific position is the main transformation. The rule for locating this position changes slightly based on object orientation, but is always the 'second' pixel in a meaningful sequence."
```


**Natural Language Description**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct objects, all made of azure pixels. All of them are variations of a three-pixel L shape.

2.  **Locate Changed Pixel within Each Object:**
    *   For the standard L shape in the top-right, consider the pixels from top-right to bottom-left.  The second pixel in this sequence changes.
    *   For the up-side-down-L in the middle-left, consider the pixels in sequence from top to bottom. The second pixel in this sequence changes.
    *    For the mirrored L in the bottom center, consider the direction from right to left, the second pixel in that sequence changes.

3.  **Change Color:**  Change the color of the identified pixel in each object from azure (8) to blue (1).

The core transformation rule is consistent: one specific azure pixel in each *L-shaped* object is changed to blue. The selection of *which* azure pixel is based on a consistent 'second pixel' rule, but the direction considered for 'second' depends on the orientation of the L shape itself.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
