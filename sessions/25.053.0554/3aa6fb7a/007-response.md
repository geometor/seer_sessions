Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to discern the transformation rule, similar to the previous example.

**YAML Block: Facts**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are 7x7."
  - object_identification: "There are three distinct objects in the input grid, all composed of azure (8) pixels."
  - object_1: "One object is an L shape of three azure pixels, on the top-right side."
  - object_2: "Another object is an L shape of three azure pixels in the center-left."
  - object_3: "A final object is a reversed L shape of three azure pixels, in the bottom-center"
  - change_detection: "One pixel in each of the three L shaped object has changed to blue (1) in the output grid."
  - position_analysis_obj1: "In the first L shape, the second azure pixel from top right to bottom left has changed."
  - position_analysis_obj2: "In the second object, a vertical L shape, the second pixel from top to bottom changes to blue."
  - position_analysis_obj3: "For the third object, a horizontal mirrored L shape. The second element from right to left and top to bottom changes to blue."
  - overall_transformation: "One azure pixel changes to blue in each object, and this specific position is the main transformation. The rule for locating this position changes slightly based on object orientation, but is always the 'second' pixel in a meaningful sequence."
```



**Natural Language Description**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct objects, all made of azure pixels. All of them are variations of a three-pixel L shape.

2.  **Locate Changed Pixel within Each Object:**
    *   For the standard L shape in the top-right, consider the pixels from top-right to bottom-left.  The second pixel in this sequence changes.
    *   For the up-side-down-L in the middle-left, consider the pixels in sequence from top to bottom. The second pixel in this sequence changes.
    *    For the mirrored L in the bottom center, consider the direction from right to left, the second pixel in that sequence changes.

3.  **Change Color:**  Change the color of the identified pixel in each object from azure (8) to blue (1).

The core transformation rule is consistent: one specific azure pixel in each *L-shaped* object is changed to blue. The selection of *which* azure pixel is based on a consistent 'second pixel' rule, but the direction considered for 'second' depends on the orientation of the L shape itself.
