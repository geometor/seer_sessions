One is a vertical line segment of length two, and the other is an L-shaped object consisting of three pixels.\n\n2.  **Locate Changed Pixel within Each Object:** For both identified objects identify the pixel second from top to bottom (for vertical) or top-right to bottom left (for L shape).\n\n3.  **Change Color:** The color of the second pixel in the direction described gets changed from azure to blue, with no other changes.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule involves changing one particular azure pixel of each separate object to blue, the selected pixel is the second from the top on the vertical line segment and in the 'L', the second pixel going from top-right to bottom-left.\n"
