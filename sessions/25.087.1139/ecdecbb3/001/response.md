Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all locations (r, c) in the input grid containing a red (2) pixel. These are the source points.
3.  Identify all locations (tr, tc) in the input grid containing an azure (8) pixel. These are the potential target points.
4.  For each red source point (r, c):
    a.  Find the closest azure (8) pixel (target_r, target_c) that lies directly horizontally or vertically from the source point (r, c). Closeness is measured by Manhattan distance along that axis. If there's a tie (e.g., equally close azure pixels up and down), the examples don't explicitly state a tie-breaker, but the provided examples seem to have unambiguous nearest cardinal neighbors. We will search in the order: right, left, down, up, and take the first closest one found.
    b.  Determine the cardinal direction (up, down, left, or right) from the source point (r, c) to the found target point (target_r, target_c).
    c.  Draw a line of red (2) pixels in the output grid starting from the source point (r, c) and moving one step at a time in the determined direction. The line stops *one pixel before* reaching the target point (target_r, target_c). This line overwrites any existing pixels.
    d.  At the target point's location (target_r, target_c), draw a 3x3 square pattern:
        i.  The center pixel (target_r, target_c) becomes red (2).
        ii. The 8 surrounding pixels (if they are within the grid boundaries) become azure (8). This pattern overwrites existing pixels in the 3x3 area.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
