            "text": "Okay, the code execution for metric gathering mostly worked but failed on the YAML import. I can still use the printed output.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe analysis of the failed examples (1 and 3) confirms the hypothesis: the original code incorrectly handles situations where a red pixel has multiple equidistant nearest azure neighbors in cardinal directions.\n\n*   In Example 1, the red pixel at (4, 8) has its nearest cardinal azure neighbor to the left at (4, 3) (distance 5) and another neighbor to the right at (4, 14) (distance 6). The code correctly identifies the left one as the *sole* nearest *cardinal* neighbor and acts only on it. However, the *expected* output shows actions related to *both* the left neighbor (4, 3) and the right neighbor (4, 14). This implies the definition of \"nearest\" needs adjustment or there's another rule. Re-examining Example 1: The distance to the left azure pixel at (4, 3) is 5. The distance to the right azure pixel at (4, 14) is 6. My previous hypothesis about equidistant neighbors was incorrect for Example 1. Why does the right side get processed? Let's re-check the analysis code... Ah, my analysis code was searching *only* for the *absolute* minimum distance across all directions. Let's re-think Example 1. The code searches Right (no target), Left (target at (4,3), dist 5, `min_dist=5`), Down (no target), Up (no target). It only acts on the left target. The expected output acts on *both* (4,3) and (4,14). This suggests the rule isn't just \"nearest overall cardinal\", but perhaps \"nearest in *each* cardinal direction\"? Let's test this revised hypothesis.\n    *   Example 1, Red (4,8): Nearest Left: (4,3) dist 5. Nearest Right: (4,14) dist 6. Nearest Up: None. Nearest Down: None. The expected output draws lines and patterns for *both* (4,3) and (4,14). This indicates the rule is likely: **Find the nearest azure pixel in *each* cardinal direction (if one exists) and perform the actions for *all* of them.**\n*   In Example 3, the red pixel at (10, 4) has equidistant nearest neighbors *up* at (7, 4) (distance 3) and *down* at (13, 4) (distance 3). The code currently only processes one of them (the one found last, which was (7,4) in the 'up' check, overwriting the 'down' result). The expected output clearly shows lines drawn and patterns placed for *both* targets. This aligns with the revised hypothesis: act on the nearest neighbor found in *each* cardinal direction independently.\n\n**Metrics / Facts:**\n\n(Based on the `code_output`, adjusted for the revised understanding)\n\n"

Identify all locations `(r, c)` in the input grid containing a red (2) pixel. These are the source points.\n3.  Identify all locations in the input grid containing an azure (8) pixel. Store these potential target points for efficient lookup (e.g., in a set).\n4.  For *each* red source point `(r, c)`:\n    a.  Search in *each* of the four cardinal directions (e.g., right, left, down, up) independently from `(r, c)`.\n    b.  For a given direction, find the *first* azure (8) pixel encountered, let its location be `(target_r, target_c)`. If no azure pixel is found in that direction, do nothing for this direction.\n    c.  If an azure target `(target_r, target_c)` was found for the current direction:\n        i.  Determine the unit direction vector `(dr, dc)` from the source `(r, c)` towards the target `(target_r, target_c)`.\n        ii. Calculate the distance (number of steps) between the source and target along that axis.\n        iii. Draw a line of red (2) pixels in the output grid starting from the source point `(r, c)` and moving one step at a time in the direction `(dr, dc)`. The line stops *one pixel before* reaching the target point `(target_r, target_c)`. This line overwrites any existing pixels.\n        iv. At the target point's location `(target_r, target_c)`, draw a 3x3 square pattern in the output grid:\n            1.  The center pixel `(target_r, target_c)` becomes red (2).\n            2.  The 8 surrounding pixels (if they are within the grid boundaries) become azure (8). This pattern overwrites existing pixels in the 3x3 area.\n5.  Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code successfully implemented parts of the transformation rule, specifically identifying red source pixels, finding *a* nearest cardinal azure target, drawing a line towards it, and placing a 3x3 pattern. However, it failed on examples where a red pixel should interact with the nearest azure pixel in *multiple* cardinal directions, not just the single closest one overall or the last one found among equals.\n\nThe key errors identified in Examples 1 and 3 stem from this misunderstanding:\n1.  **Example 1 Failure:** The code found the nearest cardinal target (left, distance 5) and ignored the nearest target in the other direction (right, distance 6). The expected output shows actions based on *both* the nearest left *and* the nearest right targets.\n2.  **Example 3 Failure:** For the second red pixel, the code found two equidistant targets (up and down, distance 3). It correctly identified the minimum distance but only acted upon the last one found during its search (the 'up' target), ignoring the 'down' target. The expected output requires actions for *both* equidistant targets.\n\nThe strategy for resolving these errors is to modify the logic to iterate through each cardinal direction *independently* for every red pixel. For each direction where an azure pixel is found, the code must find the *closest* one *in that specific direction* and perform the line-drawing and pattern-placement actions based on that target, regardless of whether closer targets exist in other directions.\n\n**Metrics and Findings:**\n"
