Identify all locations `(r, c)` in the input grid containing a red (2) pixel. These are the source points.\n3.  Identify all locations in the input grid containing an azure (8) pixel. Store these potential target points for efficient lookup (e.g., in a set).\n4.  For *each* red source point `(r, c)`:\n    a.  **Independently** search in *each* of the four cardinal directions (right, left, down, up) starting from `(r, c)`.\n    b.  For a given direction, find the location `(target_r, target_c)` of the *first* azure (8) pixel encountered along that path.\n    c.  If an azure target `(target_r, target_c)` is found for that specific direction:\n        i.  Calculate the distance (number of steps) from `(r, c)` to `(target_r, target_c)`.\n        ii. Determine the unit direction vector `(dr, dc)` from the source `(r, c)` towards the target `(target_r, target_c)`.\n        iii. Draw a line of red (2) pixels in the output grid starting *at* the source point `(r, c)` and moving `distance - 1` steps in the direction `(dr, dc)`. Each pixel on this path (including the start, excluding the target) overwrites the existing pixel with red (2).\n        iv. At the target point's location `(target_r, target_c)`, draw a 3x3 square pattern in the output grid:\n            1.  The center pixel `(target_r, target_c)` becomes red (2).\n            2.  The 8 surrounding pixels (within grid bounds) become azure (8). This pattern overwrites existing pixels in the 3x3 area centered on the target.\n    d. Repeat steps 4b and 4c for all four cardinal directions for the current red source point `(r,c)`.\n5.  Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_pixels(grid_np, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all coordinates (row, col) of pixels with a specific color.\"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid_np == color)\n    # Convert numpy array rows to tuples for easier handling\n    return [tuple(coord) for coord in coords]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.
