Color_Mapping:
  White: 0
  Red: 2
  Azure: 8

Input_Objects:
  - Type: Pixel
    Color: Red (2)
    Property: Isolated (surrounded by White)
    Role: Source_Point
  - Type: Structure (Line or potentially other shapes)
    Color: Azure (8)
    Role: Target_Structure

Output_Changes:
  - Type: Line
    Color: Red (2)
    Origin: Original Red (2) pixel location
    Destination: Location adjacent to the nearest Azure (8) pixel in a cardinal direction
    Action: Drawn between origin and destination
  - Type: Square_Pattern
    Size: 3x3
    Center_Location: Nearest Azure (8) pixel location (target)
    Center_Color: Red (2)
    Border_Color: Azure (8)
    Action: Overwrites the grid area centered on the target location

Relationships:
  - Proximity: Each Red (2) pixel is associated with the single Azure (8) pixel closest to it along a straight horizontal or vertical line.
  - Transformation_Trigger: The presence of isolated Red (2) pixels triggers the line drawing and square pattern creation.

General_Observation:
  - The transformation connects each source Red pixel to the nearest Azure structure element via a Red line and marks the connection point on the Azure structure with a specific 3x3 pattern (Azure border, Red center).
