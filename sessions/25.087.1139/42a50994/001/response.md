Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. 
For each non-white pixel, check its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). 
If none of the neighbors have the same color as the pixel itself, change that pixel to white (0) in the output grid.
Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.
The output grid retains only those non-white pixels that are adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one other pixel of the same color.
