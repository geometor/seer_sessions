"""
Identifies contiguous objects of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
Determines the background color (blue (1) or gray (8)) immediately surrounding each red object.
Moves each red object horizontally to an edge of the grid based on its background color:
- If the background is gray (8), the object moves to the left edge (column 0), aligning its leftmost pixel with column 0.
- If the background is blue (1), the object moves to the right edge (last column), aligning its rightmost pixel with the last column index.
The object's shape, size, and vertical position (row indices) are preserved during the move.
The original background layout (blue and gray areas) is maintained, except where objects are moved from or to.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code successfully transforms Examples 1, 3, and 4, but fails on Example 2. The core logic implemented identifies red objects (color 2), determines their immediate background color (blue=1 or gray=8), and moves them horizontally. If the background is gray (8), the object moves to the absolute left edge (column 0). If the background is blue (1), the object moves to the absolute right edge (last column).

The failure in Example 2 reveals a flaw in this absolute edge movement assumption. In Example 2, the grid is divided into distinct blue and gray background regions. The expected output shows that red objects move to the respective edge *within their background region*, not the absolute grid edge.

*   Objects in the gray region move to the leftmost column *of that gray region*.
*   Objects in the blue region move to the rightmost column *of that blue region*.

The strategy to resolve this is to refine the transformation logic:
1.  Identify red objects.
2.  For each object, determine its local background color (blue or gray).
3.  Determine the horizontal boundaries (minimum and maximum column indices) of the contiguous background region associated with that object.
4.  Calculate the target position:
    *   If the background is gray, the target is the minimum column index of the gray background region. Align the object's minimum column with this target.
    *   If the background is blue, the target is the maximum column index of the blue background region. Align the object's maximum column with this target.
5.  Move the object, preserving its shape and vertical position, filling the original location with the background color.

## Metrics and Analysis

| Example | Input Size  | Output Size (Expected) | Output Size (Actual) | Match | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- | :---- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 12x11       | 12x11                  | 12x11                | True  | 0          | Objects correctly moved to absolute grid edges (left for gray bg, right for blue bg). This worked because background regions extended to the edges.                                        |
| 2       | 11x13       | 11x13                  | 11x13                | False | 40         | Failure. Code moved objects to absolute grid edges (0 and 12). Expected output moves objects to the *boundary of their respective background color regions* (col 7 for gray, col 6 for blue). |
| 3       | 12x14       | 12x14                  | 12x14                | True  | 0          | Similar to Example 1, background regions extend to grid edges, so the absolute movement logic worked correctly.                                                                              |
| 4       | 15x15       | 15x15                  | 15x15                | True  | 0          | Similar to Example 1, background regions extend to grid edges.                                                                                                                                |

**Key Observation from Example 2 Failure:** The movement target is relative to the background region's extent, not the grid's absolute extent.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Move red objects horizontally based on their background color.
grid_properties:
  colors_present: [blue(1), red(2), gray(8)] # Potentially others if background is different, but examples only show 1 and 8.
  background_colors: [blue(1), gray(8)]
  object_color: red(2)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    color: red(2)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (rectangles, L-shapes observed)
      - size: variable
      - count: multiple per grid possible
      - location: can be anywhere within a background region
relationships:
  - object_background: Each red object is situated within a contiguous region of a single background color (either blue(1) or gray(8)). The relevant background is determined by the pixels immediately adjacent to the object.
actions:
  - identify: Locate all distinct red(2) objects.
  - analyze_context: For each red object:
      - Determine the color of the immediately surrounding background region (blue(1) or gray(8)).
      - Determine the horizontal boundaries (minimum column `min_bg_c`, maximum column `max_bg_c`) of this contiguous background region.
  - transform: Move each red object horizontally, keeping its shape and vertical position constant.
      - rule_gray_background: If the background is gray(8), move the object so its leftmost pixel aligns with the minimum column index (`min_bg_c`) of the gray background region.
      - rule_blue_background: If the background is blue(1), move the object so its rightmost pixel aligns with the maximum column index (`max_bg_c`) of the blue background region.
  - update_grid:
      - Erase the object from its original location.
      - Fill the vacated pixels with the determined background color.
      - Draw the object in its new calculated position.
      - Preserve all other parts of the grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
3.  For each identified red object:
    a.  Determine the color of the background pixels immediately adjacent to the object. This background color will be either blue (1) or gray (8).
    b.  Identify the contiguous region of this background color that contains or immediately surrounds the red object. Determine the minimum column index (`min_bg_c`) and maximum column index (`max_bg_c`) spanned by this specific background region.
    c.  Find the minimum column index (`min_obj_c`) and maximum column index (`max_obj_c`) occupied by the red object itself.
    d.  Calculate the target horizontal position based on the background color:
        i.  If the background color is gray (8), calculate the horizontal shift needed to move the object so that its `min_obj_c` aligns with `min_bg_c`. The shift is `min_bg_c - min_obj_c`.
        ii. If the background color is blue (1), calculate the horizontal shift needed to move the object so that its `max_obj_c` aligns with `max_bg_c`. The shift is `max_bg_c - max_obj_c`.
    e.  Modify the output grid:
        i.  Iterate over the pixels of the original red object. For each pixel at `(r, c)`, change its color in the output grid to the determined background color (effectively erasing it).
        ii. Iterate over the pixels of the original red object again. For each pixel at `(r, c)`, calculate its new column `new_c = c + shift`. Change the color of the pixel at `(r, new_c)` in the output grid to red (2) (drawing it in the new location).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
