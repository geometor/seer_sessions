task_description: Move red objects horizontally based on their background color.
grid_properties:
  colors_present: [blue(1), red(2), gray(8)] # Potentially others if background is different, but examples only show 1 and 8.
  background_colors: [blue(1), gray(8)]
  object_color: red(2)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixels
    color: red(2)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (rectangles, L-shapes observed)
      - size: variable
      - count: multiple per grid possible
      - location: can be anywhere within a background region
relationships:
  - object_background: Each red object is situated within a contiguous region of a single background color (either blue(1) or gray(8)). The relevant background is determined by the pixels immediately adjacent to the object.
actions:
  - identify: Locate all distinct red(2) objects.
  - analyze_context: For each red object:
      - Determine the color of the immediately surrounding background region (blue(1) or gray(8)).
      - Determine the horizontal boundaries (minimum column `min_bg_c`, maximum column `max_bg_c`) of this contiguous background region.
  - transform: Move each red object horizontally, keeping its shape and vertical position constant.
      - rule_gray_background: If the background is gray(8), move the object so its leftmost pixel aligns with the minimum column index (`min_bg_c`) of the gray background region.
      - rule_blue_background: If the background is blue(1), move the object so its rightmost pixel aligns with the maximum column index (`max_bg_c`) of the blue background region.
  - update_grid:
      - Erase the object from its original location.
      - Fill the vacated pixels with the determined background color.
      - Draw the object in its new calculated position.
      - Preserve all other parts of the grid.
