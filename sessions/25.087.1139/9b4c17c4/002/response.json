            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code successfully transforms Examples 1, 3, and 4, but fails on Example 2. The core logic implemented identifies red objects (color 2), determines their immediate background color (blue=1 or gray=8), and moves them horizontally. If the background is gray (8), the object moves to the absolute left edge (column 0). If the background is blue (1), the object moves to the absolute right edge (last column).\n\nThe failure in Example 2 reveals a flaw in this absolute edge movement assumption. In Example 2, the grid is divided into distinct blue and gray background regions. The expected output shows that red objects move to the respective edge *within their background region*, not the absolute grid edge.\n\n*   Objects in the gray region move to the leftmost column *of that gray region*.\n*   Objects in the blue region move to the rightmost column *of that blue region*.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to refine the transformation logic:\n1.  Identify red objects.\n2.  For each object, determine its local background color (blue or gray).\n3.  Determine the horizontal boundaries (minimum and maximum column indices) of the contiguous background region associated with that object.\n4.  Calculate the target position:\n    *   If the background is gray, the target is the minimum column index of the gray background region. Align the object's minimum column with this target.\n    *   If the background is blue, the target is the maximum column index of the blue background region. Align the object's maximum column with this target.\n5.  Move the object, preserving its shape and vertical position, filling the original location with the background color.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n| Example | Input Size  | Output Size (Expected) | Output Size (Actual) | Match | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| :------ | :---------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- | :---- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 12x11       | 12x11                  | 12x11                | True  | 0          | Objects correctly moved to absolute grid edges (left for gray bg, right for blue bg). This worked because background regions extended to the edges.                                        |\n| 2       | 11x13       | 11x13                  | 11x13                | False | 40         | Failure. Code moved objects to absolute grid edges (0 and 12). Expected output moves objects to the *boundary of their respective background color regions* (col 7 for gray, col 6 for blue). |\n| 3       | 12x14       | 12x14                  | 12x14                | True  | 0          | Similar to Example 1, background regions extend to grid edges, so the absolute movement logic worked correctly.                                                                              |\n| 4       | 15x15       | 15x15                  | 15x15                | True  | 0          | Similar to Example 1, background regions extend to grid edges.                                                                                                                                |\n\n**Key Observation from Example 2 Failure:** The movement target is relative to the background region's extent, not the grid's absolute extent.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
