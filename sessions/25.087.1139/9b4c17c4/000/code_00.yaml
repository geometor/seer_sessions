task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 12x11, 11x13, 12x14, 15x15 in examples)
  background_colors: [blue (1), gray (8)]
  object_color: red (2)
  partitioning: Grid is partitioned into distinct regions based on background color (blue or gray). Partitions can be horizontal or vertical splits.

objects:
  - type: cluster
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (rectangles of various sizes observed)
      - location: resides entirely within either a blue or gray background region.

relationships:
  - object_background: Each red object is associated with the background color (blue or gray) of the region it occupies.

actions:
  - identify: Locate all red objects.
  - determine_background: For each red object, find the color of the background it sits on.
  - move_object: Relocate each red object horizontally based on its background color.
    - condition: If the background is gray (8), move the object to the left edge of the grid.
    - condition: If the background is blue (1), move the object to the right edge of the grid.
  - maintain_properties: Preserve the object's shape, size, and vertical position during the move.

output_grid:
  - composition: Reconstruct the grid using the original background colors and the new positions of the red objects.
