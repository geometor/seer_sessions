These regions can divide the grid horizontally or vertically.\n*   **Objects:** The key objects are contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels. These objects vary in shape and size (e.g., 2x2 squares, 2x3 rectangles, single pixels).\n*   **Background Interaction:** Each red object exists entirely within one of the background color regions (either blue or gray).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the red objects horizontally. The direction of movement depends on the background color the object is situated on. Objects retain their original shape, size, and vertical position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Move the entire object horizontally so its leftmost column aligns with column 0 of the grid. Maintain its original vertical row position(s) and shape.\n    *   If the background color is blue (1), calculate the object's rightmost column index. Move the entire object horizontally so its rightmost column aligns with the last column index (grid width - 1) of the grid. Maintain its original vertical row position(s) and shape.\n    *   Draw the moved object onto the output grid, overwriting the background pixels at the new location.\n4.  **Return Output:** The final output grid contains the original backgrounds with all red objects repositioned according to the rules."
