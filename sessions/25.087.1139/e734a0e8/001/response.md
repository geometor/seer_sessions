Transformation Rule:

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the delimiter color (white, 0) and the primary background color (most frequent color other than the delimiter).
2.  Determine the cell structure: Find the dimensions (height and width) of the cells delineated by the delimiter lines.
3.  Scan each cell:
    a. Identify the unique "pattern shape" located within a single cell. This shape is defined by pixels with colors other than the background or delimiter color. Record the pattern shape itself (relative to the cell's top-left) and the location of this "source cell".
    b. Identify all "target cells" - those containing *only* the background color.
4.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  For each identified target cell:
    a. Iterate through the relative coordinates and colors of the pattern shape.
    b. If a pixel in the pattern shape is *not* the background color, overwrite the corresponding pixel in the target cell (in the output grid) with the pattern shape's pixel color.
6.  Return the modified output grid. The source cell, delimiter lines, and any cells not identified as target cells remain unchanged.
