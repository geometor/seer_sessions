Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**1. General Assessment**

The initial code successfully identified the grid structure (delimiter `0`, background color `7` in both examples), cell dimensions, and located the "source cell" containing the unique pattern (`maroon` shape in Ex1, `red` bar in Ex2).

However, the transformation failed because the definition of "target cells" and the copying mechanism were incorrect based on the provided examples:

*   **Target Cell Identification:** The previous code assumed target cells contained *only* the background color. The examples show that target cells can initially contain other pixels (like `black`, color `0`, which is also the delimiter color but appears *within* cells here) which are ultimately overwritten. The correct identification seems to be: target cells are all cells *except* the source cell.
*   **Copying Mechanism:** The previous code attempted to copy only the non-background pixels of the pattern onto the target cells. The expected outputs suggest a different mechanism: the *entire content* of the source cell should be copied into the target cells.
*   **Source Cell Handling:** There's a discrepancy between the two examples in the final state of the *original* source cell location.
    *   In Example 1, the output shows the pattern in *all* cells, including the original location of the source pattern.
    *   In Example 2, the output shows the pattern copied to all *other* cells, but the original source cell remains unchanged.

Given the ambiguity in source cell handling, let's re-examine the simplest consistent rule: **Find the source pattern cell. Copy its entire content into all *other* cell locations.** This rule perfectly explains Example 2. For Example 1, it *almost* explains it - the only difference is that the expected output *also* has the pattern in the original source location. This might be an anomaly or imply a slightly different rule if multiple source patterns were possible (which isn't the case here). Let's proceed with the rule that matches Example 2 and is the simplest modification: "Copy source to all *other* cells". If this fails on the test case, we may need to reconsider the handling of the source cell itself.

**2. Metrics**
