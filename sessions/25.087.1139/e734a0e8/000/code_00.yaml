elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - segmented by white (0) lines into smaller cells
      - primary background color is orange (7)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - subgrid within the main grid
      - defined by white (0) delimiters
      - size is consistent within a given grid (e.g., 5x5 or 3x3)
  - object: pattern_shape
    properties:
      - composed of a single color different from white (0) and orange (7)
      - exists in exactly one cell in the input grid
      - can be any shape (e.g., cluster of maroon '9's, red '2' line)
relationships:
  - white (0) lines define the boundaries of cells.
  - pattern_shape is located within one source cell.
  - target cells are those containing only the background orange (7).
actions:
  - identify: grid structure (cell size, delimiter lines)
  - identify: the unique pattern_shape and its source cell
  - identify: target cells (containing only background color)
  - copy: the pattern_shape from the source cell
  - paste: the copied pattern_shape into each target cell, replacing the background color pixels at corresponding positions.
  - preserve: original source cell, grid lines, and any cells not identified as targets.
