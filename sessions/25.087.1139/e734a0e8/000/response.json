The white grid lines remain unchanged. Any cells that contained miscellaneous pixels different from the main pattern (like the scattered orange pixels in example 1, which were actually just the background color) are also treated as target cells for the pattern replication if they don't constitute a distinct *shape* of a different color. However, re-examining Example 1, the cells with only orange (7) *are* the ones getting filled. The cells with stray non-orange colors (none in these examples, but hypothetically) would likely be left alone. The critical factor seems to be identifying the *single* cell containing a non-background shape.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Analyze the input grid to determine the repeating structure: identify the color used for grid lines (white 0) and deduce the size of the cells they delineate.\n2.  Scan each delineated cell to find its contents, ignoring the background color (orange 7).\n3.  Identify the single cell that contains a shape composed of colors other than the background (orange 7) or grid lines (white 0). This is the \"source cell\", and the shape within it is the \"pattern shape\".\n4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n5.  Iterate through all cells in the grid again.\n6.  For each cell, check if it contains *only* the background color (orange 7).\n7.  If a cell contains only the background color, overlay the \"pattern shape\" (copied from the source cell) onto this cell in the output grid. The pixels of the pattern shape should replace the corresponding background pixels within that cell's boundaries.\n8.  Leave the source cell, the grid lines, and any cells that did not contain *only* the background color unchanged from the input grid.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
