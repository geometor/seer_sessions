Okay, let's analyze the previous results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the core components: non-white pixels, the red pixel's location, and the bounding box. It also understood the general structure of the output: a frame and a cross. However, it failed because the order of drawing operations led to incorrect overwriting, particularly at the frame's boundaries and corners where the frame and cross intersect. The frame lines were drawn over the corners defined by perpendicular frame lines, and the cross was drawn over parts of the frame.

The expected output shows a clear layering:
1.  A gray cross centered on the original red pixel's coordinates, spanning the bounding box.
2.  A colored frame along the bounding box edges.
3.  The frame colors take precedence over the gray cross where they intersect.
4.  At the corners of the frame, the top/bottom frame colors take precedence over the left/right frame colors.
5.  The original red pixel is placed at its original coordinates, taking precedence over both the frame and the cross at the intersection point.

**Strategy**

The strategy is to revise the drawing logic to respect this layering and precedence:
1.  Calculate all necessary parameters: non-white pixels, red pixel coordinates, bounding box, and boundary colors.
2.  Initialize the output grid.
3.  Draw the gray cross first.
4.  Draw the frame lines, ensuring they overwrite the cross but not each other's corners incorrectly. This means drawing horizontal lines first (potentially excluding corners) then vertical lines (potentially excluding corners), and finally filling the corners with the correct priority color (top/bottom).
5.  Place the red pixel last.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's gather the key metrics for each example to confirm our understanding.
