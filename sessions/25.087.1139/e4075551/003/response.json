Identify all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid, noting their \n   colors and coordinates.\n2. Find the specific coordinates (row, column) of the red (color 2) pixel.\n3. Determine the bounding box encompassing all non-white pixels by finding the \n   minimum and maximum row and column indices.\n4. Determine the colors for the four boundaries of the bounding box based on the \n   colors of the pixels lying exactly on these minimum/maximum row/column indices. \n   It's assumed there is exactly one non-white pixel on each of these four boundary lines.\n   - Top boundary color: Color of the pixel at the minimum row.\n   - Bottom boundary color: Color of the pixel at the maximum row.\n   - Left boundary color: Color of the pixel at the minimum column.\n   - Right boundary color: Color of the pixel at the maximum column.\n5. Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled \n   with white (color 0).\n6. Draw a gray (color 5) cross within the bounding box area. The horizontal line \n   aligns with the red pixel's row, and the vertical line aligns with the red \n   pixel's column. Both lines span the full width/height of the bounding box.\n7. Draw the rectangular frame (bounding box) onto the output grid using the \n   determined boundary colors. The frame overwrites the gray cross where they \n   intersect. The horizontal frame lines (top/bottom) take precedence over the \n   vertical frame lines (left/right) at the corners.\n8. Place the red (color 2) pixel at its original coordinates within the output \n   grid, overwriting any gray cross or frame color at that specific intersection point.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_white_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds all non-white pixels and their coordinates and colors.\"\"\"\n    pixels = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                pixels.append(((r, c), grid[r, c]))\n    return pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the framed cross transformation to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=np.int8)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize output grid with white (0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid_np)\n\n    # 1.
