"""
Transforms an input grid containing sparse non-white pixels into an output grid 
featuring a framed cross structure centered around the red pixel.

The transformation follows these steps:
1. Identify all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in the input grid, noting their 
   colors and coordinates.
2. Find the specific coordinates (row, column) of the red (color 2) pixel.
3. Determine the bounding box encompassing all non-white pixels by finding the 
   minimum and maximum row and column indices.
4. Determine the colors for the four boundaries of the bounding box based on the 
   colors of the pixels lying exactly on these minimum/maximum row/column indices. 
   It's assumed there is exactly one non-white pixel on each of these four boundary lines.
   - Top boundary color: Color of the pixel at the minimum row.
   - Bottom boundary color: Color of the pixel at the maximum row.
   - Left boundary color: Color of the pixel at the minimum column.
   - Right boundary color: Color of the pixel at the maximum column.
5. Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled 
   with white (color 0).
6. Draw a gray (color 5) cross within the bounding box area. The horizontal line 
   aligns with the red pixel's row, and the vertical line aligns with the red 
   pixel's column. Both lines span the full width/height of the bounding box.
7. Draw the rectangular frame (bounding box) onto the output grid using the 
   determined boundary colors. The frame overwrites the gray cross where they 
   intersect. The horizontal frame lines (top/bottom) take precedence over the 
   vertical frame lines (left/right) at the corners.
8. Place the red (color 2) pixel at its original coordinates within the output 
   grid, overwriting any gray cross or frame color at that specific intersection point.
