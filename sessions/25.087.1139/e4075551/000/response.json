One of these pixels is always red (color 2).\n    *   The output grids feature a rectangular frame structure with internal lines forming a cross.\n    *   The colors and positions of the input pixels determine the size, position, and coloration of the output structure.\n    *   The rectangle's boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) are defined by the outermost input pixels in each respective direction. The color of each boundary corresponds to the color of the pixel that defines that boundary extremum.\n    *   A cross shape, colored gray (color 5), is drawn within the rectangle. The intersection of the cross aligns with the original position of the red (color 2) input pixel.\n    *   The red (color 2) pixel is placed at the intersection of the gray cross, overwriting the gray pixel at that location.\n    *   Other input pixels (those not defining boundaries and not the red pixel) do not directly appear in the output structure, but their positions contribute to determining the bounding box.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
