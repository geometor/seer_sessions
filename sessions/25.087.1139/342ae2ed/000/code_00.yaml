task_name: diagonal_path_to_nearest_neighbor
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  value_range: 0-9 (colors)
  background_color: Determined dynamically (most frequent color, typically 7=Orange)
objects:
  definition: Contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color, excluding the background color.
  properties:
    - color: The pixel value (0-9, excluding background).
    - pixels: List of (row, col) coordinates composing the object.
    - size: Number of pixels.
    - location: Defined by pixel coordinates.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    name: proximity
    definition: Euclidean distance between the closest pixels of any two objects.
  - type: identity
    name: color_difference
    definition: Objects are considered different if their color values differ.
actions:
  - name: find_dominant_background
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color_value
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid, background_color_value
    outputs: list_of_objects (each with color, pixels)
  - name: find_nearest_different_neighbor
    inputs: current_object, list_of_all_objects
    outputs: nearest_neighbor_object
    constraints: Neighbor must have a different color than the current object. Distance is Euclidean between closest points.
  - name: determine_diagonal_direction
    inputs: current_object, nearest_neighbor_object
    outputs: diagonal_vector (dx, dy) where dx, dy are -1 or 1.
  - name: trace_diagonal_path
    inputs: current_object, direction_vector, input_grid, background_color
    outputs: set_of_path_pixels
    logic: Starting from pixels adjacent to the current_object in the specified diagonal direction, extend the path one step at a time diagonally as long as the target pixel is within grid bounds and contains the background color. Collect all pixels visited by the path.
  - name: render_output
    inputs: input_grid, all_traced_paths (map of color to path_pixels)
    outputs: output_grid
    logic: Create a copy of the input grid. For each object's traced path, color the path pixels on the output grid with the object's color.
