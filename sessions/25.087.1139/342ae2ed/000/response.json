            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception of this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.\n2.  **Background Color:** There's a dominant background color in each example (Orange=7). In example 3, White=0 is also present but Orange=7 still appears to be the primary background against which actions occur.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct contiguous blocks (objects) of various colors different from the main background color. These objects appear in different locations in the input grids.\n4.  **Object Interaction:** The core transformation involves these non-background objects interacting based on proximity. Specifically, each object seems to \"project\" or \"trace\" a path towards its nearest neighboring object of a *different* color.\n5.  **Path Characteristics:**\n    *   The path is always diagonal.\n    *   The path is filled with the color of the object projecting the path.\n    *   The path stops just before it would touch *any* non-background pixel (either the target neighbor or another object). It only overwrites the background color.\n6.  **Original Objects:** The original colored objects remain in their initial positions in the output grid. The transformation adds the colored paths.\n7.  **No Overlap:** Paths do not seem to overwrite existing objects or other newly created paths; they stop short.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

For each object, record its color and the coordinates of its pixels.\n4.  **Process Each Object:** For every identified object (let's call it the 'source object'):\n    a.  **Find Target:** Calculate the distance (minimum Euclidean distance between any pixel of the source object and any pixel of another object) to all *other* objects that have a *different* color.
