The output grid starts as a copy of the input, and then these source patterns overwrite specific areas based on the markers found.\n\n*   **Source Patterns:** These are recurring motifs, often symmetric, containing a central colored pixel (not white) and associated structural pixels. Examples observed:\n    *   `4 8 4` horizontal (yellow-azure-yellow)\n    *   `1 3 1` vertical (blue-green-blue)\n    *   `8 6 8` plus shape (azure-magenta-azure central cross)\n    *   `8 2 8` horizontal (azure-red-azure)\n*   **Target Markers:** These indicate where the source patterns should be placed. Two types of markers are observed:\n    *   **Isolated Pixels:** A single pixel of color `C`, where `C` matches the central color of a source pattern (e.g., isolated green '3' targets the `1 3 1` pattern).\n    *   **Placeholder Patterns:** A pattern `X 0 X` (horizontal or vertical, with `X` pixels directly adjacent to the central white '0'), where `X` matches the structural/flanking color of a source pattern (e.g., `8 0 8` targets the pattern associated with azure '8', which could be `8 6 8` or `8 2 8` depending on what's defined elsewhere in the input).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves finding source patterns and target markers. For each target marker found, the corresponding source pattern is identified (based on matching central color `C` for isolated markers, or matching flanking color `X` for `X 0 X` markers) and then copied (stamped) onto the output grid, centered over the target marker's location. The original source patterns remain in their positions unless overwritten by another pattern being stamped.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify all distinct \"source patterns\" present in the input grid.

An isolated single pixel of color `C`, where `C` matches the central color of at least one identified source pattern.\n        b.
