The positions of green (3) pixels also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the introduction of azure (8) pixels in the output grid. These azure pixels replace existing white (0) or blue (1) pixels from the input grid.\n5.  **Role of Green Pixels:** Green (3) pixels appear to act as boundaries or barriers. They themselves are never changed.\n6.  **Filling Mechanism:** Azure (8) pixels fill connected regions. These regions are adjacent to green (3) pixels and seem to be \"contained\" or \"bordered\" by them. The fill propagates through white (0) and blue (1) pixels until it hits a green (3) boundary or the edge of the grid. The fill uses 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
