Grid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: Same for input and output pairs.
    - BackgroundColor: Primarily white (0).
Objects:
  - Type: Static Structures
    Color: blue (1)
    Property: Unchanged unless overwritten by fill.
  - Type: Boundary Markers
    Color: green (3)
    Property: Unchanged between input and output. Define regions for filling.
  - Type: Fill Regions
    InitialColor: white (0) or blue (1)
    FinalColor: azure (8)
    Property: Connected areas adjacent to green (3) pixels.
Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Green (3) pixels are adjacent (4-way) to the starting points of azure (8) fill regions.
  - Containment: Azure (8) fills propagate within regions bounded by green (3) pixels and/or grid edges.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all green (3) pixels in the input.
  - Seed: Identify all non-green pixels adjacent (4-way) to any green pixel. These are potential fill starting points.
  - FloodFill:
      From: Each unique seed pixel identified above.
      Color: azure (8)
      Propagation: 4-way adjacency.
      StopCondition: Encountering a green (3) pixel (from the input grid) or the grid boundary.
      Overwrite: Fill replaces original white (0) or blue (1) pixels.
      Constraint: Do not overwrite green (3) pixels.
