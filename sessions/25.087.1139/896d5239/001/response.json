Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.\n    2. Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color green (3). These are boundary pixels.\n    3. Find all unique pixel locations that are adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any green (3) boundary pixel, \n       and are themselves *not* green (3). These locations are the \"seed\" pixels for filling.\n    4. For each identified seed pixel:\n        a. If this seed pixel has already been colored azure (8) in the output grid (because it was part of a previous fill operation), skip it.\n        b. Start a flood fill operation from this seed pixel's location on the output grid.\n        c. Use the color azure (8) for filling.\n        d. The fill should spread to adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).\n        e. The fill continues to spread as long as it encounters pixels that were *not* green (3) in the original *input* grid and are within the grid boundaries.\n        f. Color all pixels visited by the flood fill (including the starting seed) with azure (8) in the output grid.\n    5.
