Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.\n    2. Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* green (3).\n    3. Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from all non-green pixels located on the border/edge of the grid. This fill represents the \"outside\" area.\n    4. The flood fill can only spread to adjacent (up, down, left, right) pixels that are also *not* green (3) in the original input grid. Keep track of all visited pixels during this \"outside\" fill.\n    5. After the \"outside\" fill is complete, iterate through all pixels in the grid.\n    6. Any pixel that was *not* green (3) in the original input grid AND was *not* visited by the \"outside\" fill is considered to be part of an \"enclosed\" region.\n    7. Change the color of all these identified \"enclosed\" pixels to azure (8) in the output grid.\n    8.
