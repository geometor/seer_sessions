Usually a small connected component.\n    *   **Red (2):** Represents a target object or destination. Also usually a small connected component.\n    *   **Azure (8):** Represents obstacles or barriers. These pixels seem to block movement or interaction.\n    *   Other colors might be present but don't seem directly involved in the core transformation logic identified so far (e.g., blue (1), yellow (4), etc., though none appear in these examples besides 0, 2, 3, 8).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white (0) pixels to green (3). The original green, red, and azure pixels remain unchanged in their positions and colors.\n4.  **Pattern:** The newly added green pixels form a path or connection between the initial green object(s) and the red object(s). This path seems to navigate around the azure (8) obstacles. Specifically, it looks like the *shortest path* consisting of white (0) cells connecting any part of the green object to any part of the red object is identified, and the cells comprising this path are colored green. The path uses 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right). If multiple shortest paths exist, all cells on all shortest paths seem to be colored green.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Also note the locations of all traversable path medium pixels (color white, 0).\n2.  **Find Shortest Path Distance:** Determine the length of the shortest path(s) between *any* green pixel and *any* red pixel.\n    *   This can be done using a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    *   Start the search simultaneously from all green pixels.\n    *   Explore adjacent (up, down, left, right) pixels.\n    *   Only consider moves onto white (0) pixels. Azure (8) pixels are walls and cannot be traversed. Other colored pixels (if any) also likely act as walls.\n    *   Keep track of the distance from the starting green pixels.\n    *   The search ends when the first red pixel is reached. The distance recorded at this point is the minimum shortest path distance. If no red pixel can be reached, stop and make no changes to the grid.\n3.  **Identify All Shortest Path Pixels:** Collect all white (0) pixels that lie on *any* path from a green pixel to a red pixel having exactly the minimum shortest path distance found in step 2.\n    *   One way to do this is to continue the BFS up to the minimum distance, recording the paths, or by performing a second search (e.g., BFS backwards from the reached red pixels) to identify all cells that contribute to a shortest path.\n4.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, change the color of all the white (0) pixels identified in step 3 to green (3). Leave all original green, red, azure, and any other pixels unchanged."
