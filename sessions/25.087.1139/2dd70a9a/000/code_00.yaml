task_elements:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - size: variable (up to 30x30)
  - name: source_object
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - shape: contiguous block of green pixels
      - role: starting point for the path
  - name: target_object
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: contiguous block of red pixels
      - role: ending point for the path
  - name: obstacles
    type: object/pixels
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: scattered or grouped pixels
      - role: block the path
  - name: path_medium
    type: pixels
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: traversable space for the path
relationships:
  - type: connection
    between: source_object, target_object
    constraints:
      - must traverse only path_medium (white) pixels
      - must avoid obstacles (azure) pixels
      - path must be the shortest possible (minimum number of steps/pixels)
      - uses 4-directional movement (up, down, left, right)
action:
  - name: find_shortest_paths
    input: grid, source_object pixels, target_object pixels, obstacle pixels
    output: set of all white pixels lying on any shortest path
  - name: color_path
    input: grid, set of path pixels
    output: new grid with path pixels changed to green (3)
transformation: The final output grid is generated by taking the input grid and changing the color of all white (0) pixels identified as being part of any shortest path between the source (green) and target (red) objects (avoiding azure obstacles) to green (3).
