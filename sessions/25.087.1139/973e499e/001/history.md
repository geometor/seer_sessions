Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Sizes:** The input grids are relatively small squares (3x3 or 5x5). The output grids are significantly larger squares, specifically N times the size of the input in both height and width, where N is the height/width of the input grid.
    *   Example 1: Input 3x3 -> Output 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3)
    *   Example 2: Input 3x3 -> Output 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3)
    *   Example 3: Input 5x5 -> Output 25x25 (5*5 x 5*5)
2.  **Tiling Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of multiple smaller grids (subgrids), arranged in a larger grid structure. The number of subgrids corresponds to the number of cells in the input grid (N*N subgrids). Each subgrid has the same dimensions as the original input grid (NxN).
3.  **Subgrid Content:** The content of each subgrid in the output is derived from the *entire* input grid, but it's filtered based on the color/value of the corresponding cell in the input grid.
4.  **Filtering Mechanism:** For an input cell at position `(r, c)` with value `V`, the corresponding subgrid in the output (located at the `r`-th row and `c`-th column of subgrids) contains a copy of the original input grid where only the pixels with value `V` are retained (using their original color `V`), and all other pixels are replaced with white (0).

**YAML Facts:**

constants:
  background_color: 0 # white
definitions:
  input_grid:
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      square: H == W
      size: S = H = W
  output_grid:
    type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      height: S * H
      width: S * W
transformations:
  - name: Create Output Grid
    input: input_grid dimensions (H, W), scale factor S=H
    output: empty output_grid of size (S*H) x (S*W)
  - name: Generate Subgrids and Tile
    scope: Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input_grid
    variables:
      input_cell_value: V = input_grid[r][c]
      output_subgrid_origin: (R_start, C_start) = (r * S, c * S)
    actions:
      - name: Filter Input Grid
        input: input_grid, input_cell_value (V)
        output: temporary_subgrid (S x S)
        logic: |
          Create temporary_subgrid of size S x S.
          For each cell (ir, ic) from 0 to S-1:
            If input_grid[ir][ic] == V:
              temporary_subgrid[ir][ic] = V
            Else:
              temporary_subgrid[ir][ic] = background_color (0)
      - name: Place Subgrid in Output
        input: output_grid, temporary_subgrid, output_subgrid_origin (R_start, C_start)
        action: |
          Copy the contents of temporary_subgrid into the output_grid,
          starting at position (R_start, C_start).
          output_grid[R_start + ir][C_start + ic] = temporary_subgrid[ir][ic]
          for ir from 0 to S-1, ic from 0 to S-1.
relationships:
  - Each cell (r, c) in the input grid determines the filter value (V) for one S x S subgrid in the output.
  - The position (r, c) of the input cell determines the position (r * S, c * S) of the top-left corner of the corresponding subgrid in the output.
  - The content of each output subgrid is a filtered representation of the entire input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the size `S` of the input grid (which is `S x S`).
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(S * S) x (S * S)`, initially empty or filled with a placeholder (like white).
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using row index `r` (from 0 to `S-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `S-1`).
4.  For the current input cell `(r, c)`, get its value `V`.
5.  Determine the top-left coordinates `(R_start, C_start)` for the corresponding subgrid in the output grid: `R_start = r * S`, `C_start = c * S`.
6.  Iterate through all cells of the *original input grid* again, using row index `ir` (from 0 to `S-1`) and column index `ic` (from 0 to `S-1`):
    a.  Get the value `Input_Value = InputGrid[ir][ic]`.
    b.  Compare `Input_Value` with the filter value `V` (from step 4).
    c.  If `Input_Value` is equal to `V`, set the pixel in the output grid at position `(R_start + ir, C_start + ic)` to `V`.
    d.  If `Input_Value` is not equal to `V`, set the pixel in the output grid at position `(R_start + ir, C_start + ic)` to white (0).
7.  After iterating through all input cells `(r, c)`, the output grid is complete. Return the output grid.
