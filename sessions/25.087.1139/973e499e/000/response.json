            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Sizes:** The input grids are relatively small squares (3x3 or 5x5). The output grids are significantly larger squares, specifically N times the size of the input in both height and width, where N is the height/width of the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input 3x3 -> Output 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3)\n    *   Example 2: Input 3x3 -> Output 9x9 (3*3 x 3*3)\n    *   Example 3: Input 5x5 -> Output 25x25 (5*5 x 5*5)\n2.  **Tiling Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of multiple smaller grids (subgrids), arranged in a larger grid structure. The number of subgrids corresponds to the number of cells in the input grid (N*N subgrids). Each subgrid has the same dimensions as the original input grid (NxN).\n3.  **Subgrid Content:** The content of each subgrid in the output is derived from the *entire* input grid, but it's filtered based on the color/value of the corresponding cell in the input grid.\n4.  **Filtering Mechanism:** For an input cell at position `(r, c)` with value `V`, the corresponding subgrid in the output (located at the `r`-th row and `c`-th column of subgrids) contains a copy of the original input grid where only the pixels with value `V` are retained (using their original color `V`), and all other pixels are replaced with white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
