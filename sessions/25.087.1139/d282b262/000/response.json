White (0) acts as the background.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form distinct, separate objects or shapes. These objects vary in size, shape, and color composition across the examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving these objects horizontally within the grid.\n4.  **Movement Rule:** Objects attempt to move as far right as possible.\n5.  **Constraints/Interactions:** The movement is constrained by the right grid boundary and by the presence of other objects. Objects do not move vertically. When two objects moving rightward would collide in the same row(s) upon reaching their final destination, the object that started further to the left stops just before colliding with the final position of the object that started further to the right. Objects that do not encounter the boundary or another object move until their rightmost edge aligns with the grid's right edge.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

It stops so its final right edge is one column to the left of the right object's final left edge.\n  - determine_final_shift: Calculate the actual shift for each object, considering boundary constraints and collision resolutions. The actual shift is the minimum of the potential shift and any collision-imposed limits.\n  - translate_objects: Move each object horizontally to the right by its determined final shift amount.\n  - render_output: Create the output grid with objects in their new positions.\n\nrelationships:\n  - spatial: Objects exist within the grid space. Their relative horizontal positions and row overlaps are critical.\n  - interaction: Objects interact during the transformation if their potential final positions conflict within the same row. The object initially further left yields precedence (stops earlier).\n  - input_output: The output grid contains the same objects as the input grid, but translated horizontally according to the movement and collision rules.\n```"

For each object, record the coordinates of its pixels and determine its bounding box (minimum/maximum row/column).\n2.  For each object, calculate its maximum potential horizontal shift distance required to move its rightmost edge to the right boundary of the grid (grid width - 1 - object's rightmost column index).\n3.  Initialize the actual shift for every object to its maximum potential shift.\n4.  Iteratively refine the actual shifts based on potential collisions:\n    a. Consider all pairs of objects (`ObjA`, `ObjB`) that occupy at least one common row.\n    b. For each such pair, calculate their potential final positions based on their current `actual_shift` values.\n    c. Check if their potential final bounding boxes would overlap horizontally in any shared row.\n    d. If they overlap, compare their initial horizontal positions (leftmost column index).\n    e. If `ObjA` started to the left of `ObjB` (`initial_left_col(ObjA) < initial_left_col(ObjB)`), then `ObjA` is potentially blocked by `ObjB`. Calculate the maximum shift `ObjA` can make without overlapping `ObjB`'s potential final position (its final right edge must be at `potential_final_left_col(ObjB) - 1`). Update `ObjA`'s `actual_shift` to be the minimum of its current `actual_shift` and this newly calculated maximum allowed shift.\n    f. Repeat steps 4a-4e until no more `actual_shift` values are changed in a full iteration, ensuring all collision constraints are resolved.\n5.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).\n6.  For each object from the input grid, copy its pixels to the new grid, adding its final `actual_shift` value to the column coordinate of each pixel.\n7.  The resulting grid is the output."
