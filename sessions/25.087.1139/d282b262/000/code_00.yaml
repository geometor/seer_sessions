task_description: "Shift non-background objects horizontally to the right until they hit the grid boundary or another object."

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 15x15 (consistent across examples)
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - definition: Contiguous block(s) of non-white pixels.
  - properties:
      - shape: Variable (e.g., 2x2, 3x3)
      - colors: Composed of one or more non-white colors.
      - position: Initial location within the grid.
  - quantity: Multiple objects per grid (2 to 5 in examples).

actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct non-white pixel groups.
  - calculate_potential_move: For each object, determine the maximum possible rightward shift to align its right edge with the grid's right boundary.
  - detect_collisions: Identify pairs of objects occupying the same row(s) whose potential final positions (after maximum shift) would overlap horizontally.
  - resolve_collisions:
      - For conflicting pairs in a row, identify the object whose initial position was further left (smaller starting column index).
      - The left object's movement is limited. It stops so its final right edge is one column to the left of the right object's final left edge.
  - determine_final_shift: Calculate the actual shift for each object, considering boundary constraints and collision resolutions. The actual shift is the minimum of the potential shift and any collision-imposed limits.
  - translate_objects: Move each object horizontally to the right by its determined final shift amount.
  - render_output: Create the output grid with objects in their new positions.

relationships:
  - spatial: Objects exist within the grid space. Their relative horizontal positions and row overlaps are critical.
  - interaction: Objects interact during the transformation if their potential final positions conflict within the same row. The object initially further left yields precedence (stops earlier).
  - input_output: The output grid contains the same objects as the input grid, but translated horizontally according to the movement and collision rules.
