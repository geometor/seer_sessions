"""
Identify the background color (most frequent).
Identify two other colors present: Color A forms exactly one contiguous object, and Color B forms multiple contiguous objects.
The transformation involves two steps:
1. Remove the object made of Color A by changing its pixels to the background color.
2. For each object made of Color B, calculate its geometric center (average row and column index). If the center coordinates are integers and correspond to a pixel within that specific object, change the color of that center pixel to Color A. Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
Contiguity is defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
