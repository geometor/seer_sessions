Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the background color (most frequent pixel value).
2. Identify two other distinct colors present in the grid: 
   - `color_A`: The color that forms exactly one contiguous object (using 4-way adjacency).
   - `color_B`: The color that forms more than one contiguous object.
3. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4. Iterate through each distinct object formed by `color_B`:
   a. Calculate the geometric center of the object (average row and column index).
   b. Check if both the average row and column indices are integers (or very close to integers).
   c. If they are integers, determine the integer coordinate `(center_r, center_c)`.
   d. Check if the pixel at `(center_r, center_c)` is part of the current `color_B` object being examined.
   e. If all conditions (integer center within the object) are met, change the color of the pixel at `(center_r, center_c)` in the output grid to `color_A`.
5. Compare the numerical values of `color_A` and `color_B`.
6. If `color_A` is numerically less than `color_B`:
   a. Find the single object originally formed by `color_A`.
   b. Change the color of all pixels belonging to this `color_A` object to the `background_color` in the output grid.
7. If `color_A` is not less than `color_B` (i.e., greater than or equal to), the original `color_A` object remains untouched in the output grid (unless its pixel was somehow part of a `color_B` object's center, which is definitionally impossible).
8. Return the modified output grid.
