Agent pixels not aligned or whose path is blocked or leads away from the object do not drip.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Find all contiguous objects (connected components) of non-background colors. Identify the largest one (by pixel count) as the Largest Contiguous Object (LCO). Determine the bounding box (minimum/maximum row/column) of the LCO.\n    3.  Identify all pixels (\"agent pixels\") whose color is neither the background color nor the color of the LCO.\n    4.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n    5.  For each agent pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) with color `agent_color`:\n        a.  **Check Vertical Alignment:** If the agent pixel's column `c` is within the LCO's column range (`min_col_LCO <= c <= max_col_LCO`):\n            i.  If the agent pixel is above the LCO (`r < min_row_LCO`): Check the path downwards from `(r + 1, c)` to `(min_row_LCO - 1, c)`. If all pixels in this path have the background color, change the color of these pixels in the output grid to `agent_color`.\n            ii. If the agent pixel is below the LCO (`r > max_row_LCO`): Check the path upwards from `(r - 1, c)` to `(max_row_LCO + 1, c)`.
