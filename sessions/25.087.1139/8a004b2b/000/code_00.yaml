elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - contains background pixels (white, 0)
      - contains distinct colored objects
      - always contains exactly four yellow pixels (4)
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - smaller dimensions than input
      - contains a subset of input objects
      - includes the four yellow pixels from the input
  - type: object
    identifier: yellow pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    count: 4
    role: marker
    properties:
      - define the corners of a rectangular region in the input grid
  - type: object
    identifier: colored region
    properties:
      - consists of contiguous non-white pixels
      - located within the input grid
actions:
  - name: find_markers
    input: input grid
    target: yellow pixels (4)
    output: coordinates of the four yellow pixels
  - name: determine_bounding_box
    input: coordinates of the four yellow pixels
    process: find the minimum and maximum row and column indices among the marker coordinates
    output: top-left (min_row, min_col) and bottom-right (max_row, max_col) coordinates of the bounding box
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input:
      - input grid
      - bounding box coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
    process: select all pixels from the input grid within the rows from min_row to max_row (inclusive) and columns from min_col to max_col (inclusive)
    output: output grid
relationships:
  - The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid.
  - The extent (boundaries) of the output grid is determined by the spatial extent of the four yellow pixels in the input grid.
  - Objects located inside the bounding box defined by the yellow pixels in the input are preserved in the output.
  - Objects located outside the bounding box are discarded.
