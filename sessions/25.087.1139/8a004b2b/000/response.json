These yellow pixels appear to act as markers or delimiters. Other colored objects (red, green, blue, azure, etc.) are scattered within the grid.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It contains a subset of the objects present in the input, including the yellow pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting a specific rectangular region from the input grid. The boundaries of this region appear to be defined by the positions of the four yellow pixels.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** The four yellow pixels define the corners of a bounding box. The top-left corner of the output corresponds to the top-left-most yellow pixel in the input, and the bottom-right corner corresponds to the bottom-right-most yellow pixel.\n6.  **Content Extraction:** All pixels within this bounding box in the input grid, including the yellow corner pixels themselves, are copied to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. Pixels outside this bounding box are discarded.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
