task_description: Extract the largest contiguous non-white region, crop to its bounding box, and replace any pixel within the box that is not the region's main color with red (2).

elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
  - type: grid
    role: output
  - type: color
    value: white (0)
    description: Background color, ignored in region finding.
  - type: color
    value: red (2)
    description: Replacement color for non-main pixels within the target region's bounding box.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: The single color making up the region.
      - area: The number of pixels in the region.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all pixels of the region.
  - type: object
    description: The largest contiguous non-white region.
    properties:
      - main_color: The color of this largest region.
      - source_bounding_box: The bounding box of this region in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: find_regions
    input: input grid
    output: list of contiguous non-white regions with their properties (color, area, bounding_box).
    criteria: Exclude white (0) pixels. Regions are defined by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  - action: select_largest_region
    input: list of regions
    output: the single region with the maximum area.
    assumption: There is a unique largest region.
  - action: crop_to_bounding_box
    input: input grid, bounding_box of the largest region
    output: subgrid corresponding to the bounding box area.
  - action: transform_colors
    input: subgrid (cropped area), main_color of the largest region
    output: final output grid
    rule: For each pixel in the subgrid, if its color equals main_color, keep it; otherwise, change it to red (2).

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the largest contiguous non-white region in the input grid.
  - The pixel values in the output grid depend on the corresponding pixel values within the bounding box in the input grid and the main_color of the largest region.
