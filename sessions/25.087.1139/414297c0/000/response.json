Some regions are large contiguous blocks of a single color, while others are smaller or scattered patterns. Within the larger regions, there can be pixels of different colors ('noise' pixels).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids. They appear to be focused extractions of a specific part of the input grid. The content of the output grid retains some structure from the input but undergoes a specific color transformation.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the most prominent region in the input, cropping the grid to that region's bounding box, and then applying a rule to the colors within that cropped area. Specifically, pixels matching the dominant color of the region are kept, while all other pixels within the bounding box are changed to red (2).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
