Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies and refine the transformation rule.

## General Assessment

The initial code assumed all Red (2) and Gray (5) pixels moved one step diagonally up-left (`-1, -1`), while Azure (8) and Maroon (9) pixels remained static. The results show this is incorrect. Comparing the generated outputs with the expected ones reveals:

1.  **Conditional Movement:** Not all Gray (5) pixels move. In examples 1 and 2, some Gray pixels remain in their original positions in the expected output, whereas the code moved them. In example 3, all Gray pixels *do* move. This suggests the movement of Gray pixels is conditional.
2.  **Movement Blocking:** In several cases (e.g., Example 1: Red at (8,12) moving towards static Azure at (7,11); Example 3: Gray at (12,12) moving towards static Azure at (11,11)), a moving pixel targets a location occupied by a static pixel in the input. In the expected output, the static pixel remains, and the moving pixel effectively disappears (or doesn't overwrite the static pixel).
3.  **Consistency:** Red (2) pixels appear to *always* attempt the `(-1, -1)` move. Static (8, 9) pixels appear to always *try* to stay, but can be overwritten by a *successful* move.

The core error in the previous logic was the assumption that all Gray pixels move unconditionally. The refined strategy is to determine *which* Gray pixels move, based likely on their proximity to Red pixels, and to handle the interaction where moving pixels target locations originally occupied by static pixels.

## Gather Metrics

Let's confirm the properties using code execution. We'll analyze Example 3 as it exhibits both moving and static behaviors linked to adjacency.
