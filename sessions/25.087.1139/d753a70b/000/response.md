*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating pixels on a grid based on their color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions and share the same background color (orange - 7). Several distinct patterns or collections of pixels exist, primarily using red (2), gray (5), azure (8), and in some examples, maroon (9). Observing the changes between input and output across the examples reveals that pixels of certain colors (red and gray) shift their position diagonally, while pixels of other colors (azure, maroon, and the orange background) remain stationary. Specifically, red and gray pixels move one step up and one step to the left. Pixels that would move off the top or left edge of the grid disappear. The original positions of the moved pixels are filled with the background color, unless overwritten by a stationary pixel or another moved pixel.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    background_color: 7 # orange
    grid_dimensions: consistent between input and output
    objects:
      - color: 2 # red
        behavior: dynamic
        action: move diagonally up-left by 1 unit (row-1, col-1)
        boundary_interaction: disappear if move goes out of bounds (row < 0 or col < 0)
      - color: 5 # gray
        behavior: dynamic
        action: move diagonally up-left by 1 unit (row-1, col-1)
        boundary_interaction: disappear if move goes out of bounds (row < 0 or col < 0)
      - color: 8 # azure
        behavior: static
        action: remain in the same position
      - color: 9 # maroon (seen in other examples)
        behavior: static
        action: remain in the same position
      - color: 7 # orange (background)
        behavior: static (unless overwritten by a moved pixel)
        action: remain in the same position / fill vacated spots
    interactions:
      - Moved pixels (red/gray) can overwrite the background color (orange) in their new location.
      - Moved pixels (red/gray) can potentially overwrite static pixels (azure/maroon) if their target destination coincides, although this specific interaction isn't explicitly shown in train_3 but is implied by the overwrite logic. Based on the examples, it seems more likely they just overwrite the background. Let's assume the moved pixels overwrite whatever is at the target location.
      - Static pixels maintain their position, potentially being overwritten by moved pixels landing on them.
    process_order: It seems necessary to first place static elements and then place the dynamic elements in their new positions. Alternatively, initialize with background, place static elements, then place moved elements.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (orange - 7).
    2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at position (row, column).
    3.  Identify the color of the input pixel.
    4.  If the input pixel's color is azure (8) or maroon (9), place this same color at the corresponding position (row, column) in the output grid.
    5.  After checking all pixels for static colors (step 2-4), iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid again at position (row, column).
    6.  Identify the color of the input pixel.
    7.  If the input pixel's color is red (2) or gray (5):
        a.  Calculate the target position: (target_row = row - 1, target_column = column - 1).
        b.  Check if the target position is within the bounds of the grid (target_row >= 0 and target_column >= 0).
        c.  If the target position is within bounds, place the input pixel's color (red or gray) at the target position (target_row, target_column) in the output grid, potentially overwriting any color previously placed there (background or static color).
    8.  The final state of the output grid represents the result of the transformation.
