            "text": "*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating pixels on a grid based on their color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions and share the same background color (orange - 7). Several distinct patterns or collections of pixels exist, primarily using red (2), gray (5), azure (8), and in some examples, maroon (9). Observing the changes between input and output across the examples reveals that pixels of certain colors (red and gray) shift their position diagonally, while pixels of other colors (azure, maroon, and the orange background) remain stationary. Specifically, red and gray pixels move one step up and one step to the left. Pixels that would move off the top or left edge of the grid disappear. The original positions of the moved pixels are filled with the background color, unless overwritten by a stationary pixel or another moved pixel.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Based on the examples, it seems more likely they just overwrite the background. Let's assume the moved pixels overwrite whatever is at the target location.\n      - Static pixels maintain their position, potentially being overwritten by moved pixels landing on them.\n    process_order: It seems necessary to first place static elements and then place the dynamic elements in their new positions. Alternatively, initialize with background, place static elements, then place moved elements.\n    ```"
