*   **Perception:** The input grid contains multiple distinct geometric shapes (objects), each composed of a single non-white color, scattered across a white background. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and contains only one of the objects from the input. The key transformation involves identifying and isolating a specific object based on a unique characteristic. Observing the examples, the object selected for the output consistently possesses internal "holes" â€“ white pixels completely surrounded by the object's colored pixels. Other objects in the input lack this feature.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify and extract the object containing internal holes from the input grid.

    elements:
      - element: input_grid
        description: A 2D grid containing multiple distinct colored objects on a white background.
        properties:
          - colors: Contains white (0) and several other colors (1-9).
          - objects: Multiple contiguous regions of non-white pixels.
      - element: objects
        description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same non-white color.
        properties:
          - color: The specific color index (1-9) of the object.
          - shape: The spatial arrangement of the pixels.
          - topology: Some objects may fully enclose one or more white pixels (holes).
      - element: output_grid
        description: A smaller 2D grid showing a single object extracted from the input grid.
        properties:
          - content: Contains the pixels corresponding to the selected object from the input.
          - size: Cropped to the minimal bounding box containing the selected object.
          - background: White (0).

    relationships:
      - relationship: selection
        description: The object present in the output grid is selected from the input grid based on a specific topological property.
        criterion: The selected object is the one that contains internal holes (enclosed white pixels). In all provided examples, only one such object exists in the input.
      - relationship: extraction
        description: The output grid is generated by extracting the selected object.
        process:
          - Identify the object with internal holes in the input grid.
          - Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing this object.
          - Create the output grid using the content within this bounding box from the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct, contiguous objects composed of non-white pixels.
    2.  For each identified object, examine its structure to determine if it contains any white pixels that are completely surrounded by the object's own pixels (i.e., check for internal holes).
    3.  Select the object that possesses internal holes. (Assume there will be exactly one such object per input grid based on the examples).
    4.  Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the selected object (its bounding box).
    5.  Create the output grid by copying the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the selected object.
