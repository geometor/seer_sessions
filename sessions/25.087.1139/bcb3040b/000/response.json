In each example, there are exactly two red pixels in the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Locus:** The changes between input and output grids occur *between* the two red marker pixels.\n5.  **Alignment:** The two red markers in each example are aligned either horizontally (example 1), vertically (example 3), or diagonally (example 2).\n6.  **Filling Rule:** The pixels located strictly between the two red markers along their alignment axis are changed based on their original color:\n    *   If the original pixel was white (0), it becomes red (2).\n    *   If the original pixel was blue (1), it becomes green (3).\n7.  **No Change Otherwise:** Pixels outside the line segment connecting the two red markers (inclusive of the markers themselves) remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
