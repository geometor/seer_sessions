Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Colors:** The input grids primarily contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Colors:** The output grids contain the same colors as the input, plus green (3).
3.  **Key Color - Red (2):** The red pixels appear to act as markers or boundary points. In each example, there are exactly two red pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Transformation Locus:** The changes between input and output grids occur *between* the two red marker pixels.
5.  **Alignment:** The two red markers in each example are aligned either horizontally (example 1), vertically (example 3), or diagonally (example 2).
6.  **Filling Rule:** The pixels located strictly between the two red markers along their alignment axis are changed based on their original color:
    *   If the original pixel was white (0), it becomes red (2).
    *   If the original pixel was blue (1), it becomes green (3).
7.  **No Change Otherwise:** Pixels outside the line segment connecting the two red markers (inclusive of the markers themselves) remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Fill the space between two aligned red markers based on original pixel color."
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0=white, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, ...)
      - location: (row, column) tuple
  - object: red_marker
    description: A pixel with color red (2). Acts as a boundary marker.
    count_constraint: Exactly two red markers must exist in the input for the transformation to occur.
relationships:
  - type: alignment
    description: The two red markers must lie on the same row, same column, or same main diagonal.
    properties:
      - axis: horizontal (same row), vertical (same column), diagonal (abs(row_diff) == abs(col_diff))
  - type: betweenness
    description: Pixels located on the line segment strictly between the two aligned red markers.

    rule: |
      If input color is white (0), output color is red (2).
      If input color is blue (1), output color is green (3).
      Otherwise, output color is the same as input color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate all pixels with the color red (2) in the input grid.
3.  Count the number of red pixels found.
4.  If the count is exactly two:
    a.  Determine the locations (row1, col1) and (row2, col2) of the two red pixels.
    b.  Check if the two red pixels are aligned:
        i.  **Horizontally:** If row1 equals row2.
        ii. **Vertically:** If col1 equals col2.
        iii.**Diagonally:** If the absolute difference between row1 and row2 equals the absolute difference between col1 and col2.
    c.  If the red pixels are aligned (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally):
        i.  Identify all pixel locations that lie strictly *between* the two red pixels along the determined alignment axis (row, column, or diagonal).
        ii. For each identified pixel location (r, c) between the markers:
            *   Examine the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *input* grid.
            *   If the input color is white (0), change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to red (2).
            *   If the input color is blue (1), change the color of the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to green (3).
            *   (Implicitly: if the input color is neither white nor blue, leave it unchanged in the output grid).
5.  If the count of red pixels is not exactly two, or if the two red pixels are not aligned, make no changes to the output grid (it remains identical to the input).
6.  Return the final output grid.
