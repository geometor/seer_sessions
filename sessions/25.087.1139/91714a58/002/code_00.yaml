task_description: Isolate the largest solid monochromatic rectangular object from the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)
  - background_color: black (0)
objects:
  - type: solid monochromatic rectangle
    definition: A rectangular area within the grid where all pixels have the same non-black color.
    properties:
      - color: the single non-black color of the pixels within the rectangle.
      - top_left_corner: (row, column) coordinates of the top-left pixel.
      - bottom_right_corner: (row, column) coordinates of the bottom-right pixel.
      - height: number of rows in the rectangle.
      - width: number of columns in the rectangle.
      - area: height * width.
identification_process:
  - step: Iterate through all possible rectangular subgrids within the input grid.
  - step: For each subgrid, check if it is monochromatic (all pixels have the same non-black color).
  - step: Keep track of all identified solid monochromatic rectangles.
selection_criterion:
  - rule: Select the solid monochromatic rectangle with the maximum area.
  - tie_breaking: (Not specified in examples, assume any largest suffices, e.g., the first one found or the one with the top-leftmost corner). The provided examples do not seem to have ties for the maximum area.
transformation:
  - step: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (black, 0).
  - step: Copy the pixels belonging to the selected largest solid monochromatic rectangle onto the output grid at their original positions, preserving their color.
