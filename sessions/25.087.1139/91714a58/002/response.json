            "text": "**Revised Analysis:**\n\nOkay, the tool execution reveals a critical flaw in my previous reasoning (and the previous code's logic). The task is *not* simply \"find the largest contiguous block of non-black pixels\" or \"find the largest contiguous block of same-colored non-black pixels\".\n\nLet's re-examine the metrics:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Largest non-black connected component (Tool): Size 30, multi-colored.\n    *   Largest same-color object (Code Logic): Magenta (6), size 14. At `(11, 2)` to `(12, 8)`.\n    *   Expected Output: The 14-pixel Magenta (6) object.\n    *   *Observation:* The expected output matches the largest *monochromatic* (single-color) object found by the original code. Why was this chosen over the much larger (size 30) multi-colored object?\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Largest non-black connected component (Tool): Size 24, multi-colored.\n    *   Largest same-color object (Code Logic): Red (2), size 12. At `(3, 3)` to `(6, 5)`. (The code found this, but missed pixel `(2,3)` which is also red and connected, making the true largest *red* object size 13). Let's assume the code correctly identifies the 13-pixel red object.\n    *   Expected Output: A *different* 12-pixel Red (2) object.\n    *   *Observation:* The expected output is a contiguous, monochromatic red object. Its size (12) is *not* the size of the largest non-black component (24), nor is it the size of the largest *red* component (13). It's *smaller*.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Largest non-black connected component (Tool): Size 16, multi-colored.\n    *   Largest same-color object (Code Logic): Orange (7), size 11 (connected pixels `(2,8-10), (3,7-10), (4,7-10)`). The previous code found 10 of these (missed `(3, 7)`?).\n    *   Expected Output: A 9-pixel Orange (7) object (`(2,8-10), (3,8-10), (4,8-10)`).\n    *   *Observation:* The expected output is a contiguous, monochromatic orange object. Its size (9) is *not* the size of the largest non-black component (16), nor is it the size of the largest *orange* component (11). It's *smaller*.\n\n**New Hypothesis Generation:**\n\nThe transformation seems to involve identifying *all* contiguous monochromatic (single-color) objects first. Then, some criterion is applied to select *one* of these objects for the output.\n\nWhat criterion could it be?\n1.  **Largest Size?** No, examples 2 and 3 disprove this. The expected output is *smaller* than the largest monochromatic object in those cases. Example 1 fits, but might be coincidence.\n2.  **Specific Color?** No, the color changes (Magenta, Red, Orange).\n3.  **Shape?** The shapes are irregular blocks. Example 1 is roughly rectangular, Example 2 is L-ish, Example 3 is a 3x3 square. Is it selecting the \"most rectangular\" or \"most square-like\" object?\n    *   Example 1: The 14-pixel magenta object is 2x7. Bounding box is 2x7. Density = 14/(2*7) = 1.0.\n    *   Example 2:\n        *   The 13-pixel red object (`(2,3)` + `(3,3)-(6,5)`): Bounding box is rows 2-6 (5), cols 3-5 (3). Size 5x3=15. Density = 13/15 = 0.867.\n        *   The 12-pixel expected red object (`(3,3)-(6,5)` without `(6,5)` + `(2,3)`): Bounding box is rows 2-6 (5), cols 3-5 (3). Size 5x3=15. Density = 12/15 = 0.8.\n        *   Are there other significant monochromatic objects? Let's check the tool output for Ex2: largest non-black is size 24, containing 13 red pixels. What was the *next* largest monochromatic object? We need to re-run the original code's `find_objects` logic (find *all* same-color objects).\n    *   Example 3:\n        *   The 11-pixel orange object (`(2,8-10), (3,7-10), (4,7-10)`): Bounding box rows 2-4 (3), cols 7-10 (4). Size 3x4=12. Density = 11/12 = 0.917.\n        *   The 9-pixel expected orange object (`(2,8-10), (3,8-10), (4,8-10)`): Bounding box rows 2-4 (3), cols 8-10 (3). Size 3x3=9. Density = 9/9 = 1.0. This is a perfect square/rectangle.\n        *   Are there other large monochromatic objects in Ex3? Let's look at the input. Maybe the two Gray(8) pixels at `(2, 5), (2, 6)`? Size 2. The three Green(3) pixels at `(5, 11), (5, 12), (10, 10)`? Size 3. The two Green(3) at `(10, 10), (14, 7)`? No, they are not connected. The two Red(2) at `(3, 12), (15, 12)`? No. The 11-pixel orange object seems the largest monochromatic one.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies all contiguous monochromatic (single-color) non-black objects. From these objects, it selects the one that has the highest \"rectangularity\" or \"density\" (pixels / bounding_box_area). If there's a tie in density, maybe size breaks the tie (larger preferred? smaller preferred?).\n\nLet's test this:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The 14-pixel magenta object (2x7) has density 1.0. Are there any others with density 1.0? Many single pixels (1x1, density 1.0). The 2x1 Blue(1) at `(12, 11), (12, 12)`? No, colors are 4, 4. The 2x1 Red(2) at `(3, 0), (3, 1)`? Density 1.0. Why was the magenta chosen? It's much larger. So, *highest density, then largest size*.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   13-pixel Red object: Density 13/15 = 0.867.\n    *   Any perfect rectangles? The two Blue(1) at `(0, 4), (0, 5)`? Size 2, 1x2, density 1.0. Two Maroon(9) at `(1, 8), (1, 9)`? Size 2, 1x2, density 1.0. Two Blue(1) at `(4, 8), (4, 9)`? No, colors 1, 9.\n    *   The expected output (12 red pixels) has density 12/15 = 0.8. This doesn't fit the \"highest density\" rule.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   11-pixel Orange object: Density 11/12 = 0.917.\n    *   9-pixel Orange object (expected output): Density 9/9 = 1.0.\n    *   Are there other objects with density 1.0? Gray(8) at `(2, 5), (2, 6)`? Size 2, 1x2, density 1.0. Green(3) at `(5, 11), (5, 12)`? Size 2, 1x2, density 1.0. Gray(5) at `(10, 8), (10, 9)`? No, colors 5, 6. Green(3) at `(10, 10), (10, 11)`? Size 2, 1x2, density 1.0.\n    *   Why was the 9-pixel orange object chosen over the smaller density 1.0 objects? Because it's larger. This fits: *highest density, then largest size*.\n\n**Contradiction:** Example 2 breaks the \"highest density, then largest size\" rule. The expected output has density 0.8, while other smaller objects have density 1.0. The largest monochromatic object (13 red pixels) has density 0.867.\n\n**Alternative Hypotheses:**\n\n*   Maybe it's not *all* monochromatic objects, but only the largest N ones, or ones above a certain size threshold?\n*   Could connectivity include diagonals? The prompt usually implies horizontal/vertical unless stated otherwise. The previous code used 4-way. Let's stick with that.\n*   Is there something unique about the *color* of the chosen object? Magenta(6), Red(2), Orange(7). No obvious pattern.\n*   Is location important? Top-leftmost corner? Centroid?\n    *   Ex1: Magenta object starts at `(11, 2)`.\n    *   Ex2: Expected Red object starts at `(3, 3)`. (Actual top-left pixel is `(2, 3)`).\n    *   Ex3: Expected Orange object starts at `(2, 8)`.\n    *   No clear location pattern.\n\n**Revisiting Example 2:**\nInput Grid 2:\n"

Solid.\n    *   Largest solid rectangle is the 2x7 magenta one. Area 14. Matches expected output. **Fits.**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Red object at `(3, 3)` to `(6, 5)` is 4x3. Area 12. Solid.\n    *   Blue object at `(0, 4)` to `(0, 5)` is 1x2. Area 2. Solid.\n    *   Maroon object at `(1, 8)` to `(1, 9)` is 1x2. Area 2. Solid.\n    *   Largest solid rectangle is the 4x3 red one. Area 12. Matches expected output. **Fits.**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Orange object at `(2, 8)` to `(4, 10)` is 3x3. Area 9. Solid.\n    *   Gray object at `(2, 5)` to `(2, 6)` is 1x2. Area 2. Solid.\n    *   Green object at `(5, 11)` to `(5, 12)` is 1x2. Area 2. Solid.\n    *   Green object at `(10, 10)` to `(10, 11)` is 1x2. Area 2. Solid.\n    *   Largest solid rectangle is the 3x3 orange one. Area 9. Matches expected output. **Fits.**\n\nThis hypothesis fits all three examples perfectly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the object finding process. Instead of BFS for any connected shape of the same color, iterate through all possible top-left corners and colors.\n2.  For each potential top-left `(r, c)` with a non-black color `C`, determine the largest possible solid rectangle starting at `(r, c)` consisting only of color `C`.\n3.  Keep track of the rectangle with the largest area found so far.\n4.  Construct the output grid containing only the pixels of the largest solid rectangle found.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Based on New Hypothesis):**\n\nNeed to confirm the largest solid monochromatic rectangles.\n"

The first interpretation (\"largest contiguous non-black object\") and the second (\"largest contiguous single-color object\") did not match the outputs for Examples 2 and 3. Analysis of the expected outputs revealed that the target object is always a *solid rectangle* of a single color. The selection criterion appears to be the rectangle with the largest area (number of pixels). The code execution confirms that finding the largest solid monochromatic rectangle correctly identifies the target object dimensions, location, and color for all three examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 16x16 grid.\n    *   Largest Solid Monochromatic Rectangle: 2x7 (Area 14), Color: Magenta (6), Location: (11, 2) to (12, 8).\n    *   Expected Output: Contains exactly this 14-pixel magenta rectangle.\n    *   Previous Code Output: Correctly identified this object (as it was also the largest same-color contiguous object). Match: True.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 16x16 grid.\n    *   Largest Solid Monochromatic Rectangle: 4x3 (Area 12), Color: Red (2), Location: (3, 3) to (6, 5).\n    *   Expected Output: Contains exactly this 12-pixel red rectangle.\n    *   Previous Code Output: Incorrectly identified a different 12-pixel red object based on overall largest same-color connected component size (which was actually 13 pixels, but the code outputted 12 non-rectangular pixels). Match: False.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 16x16 grid.\n    *   Largest Solid Monochromatic Rectangle: 3x3 (Area 9), Color: Orange (7), Location: (2, 8) to (4, 10).\n    *   Expected Output: Contains exactly this 9-pixel orange rectangle.\n    *   Previous Code Output: Incorrectly identified a 10-pixel non-rectangular orange object based on overall largest same-color connected component size (which was actually 11 pixels).
