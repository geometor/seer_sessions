Iterate through all possible top-left corners (r1, c1) in the input grid.\n2. If the color at (r1, c1) is not black (0), consider it as a potential start for a rectangle.\n3. For each potential top-left corner (r1, c1) with non-black color C, iterate through all possible bottom-right corners (r2, c2) such that r2 >= r1 and c2 >= c1.\n4. For each potential rectangle defined by (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), check if all pixels within this rectangular region are of the same color C.\n5. If the rectangle is monochromatic, calculate its area: area = (r2 - r1 + 1) * (c2 - c1 + 1).\n6. Keep track of the rectangle with the maximum area found so far. Store its dimensions (r1, c1, r2, c2) and color. If multiple rectangles share the maximum area, the specific one chosen depends on the iteration order, which is acceptable given no explicit tie-breaking rules.\n7. After checking all possible rectangles, create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with black (0).\n8. If a largest rectangle was found (i.e., max_area > 0), draw this rectangle onto the output grid using its stored color and coordinates.\n9.
