Identify all distinct contiguous blocks (objects) of non-black pixels in the input grid. Contiguity is defined by horizontal and vertical adjacency.\n2.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each identified object.\n3.  Find the object with the maximum size. If there's a tie, the examples suggest only one largest object exists, but the code should handle potential ties (e.g., by taking the first one found).\n4.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with black (0).\n5.  Copy the pixels belonging to the largest object found in step 3 onto the output grid at their original positions, preserving their color.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of non-black pixels in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of objects, where each object is represented as a dictionary\n        containing 'color', 'size', and 'pixels' (a list of (row, col) tuples).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If the pixel is non-black and hasn't been visited yet\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                current_object_pixels = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                # Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find all connected pixels of the same color\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    current_object_pixels.append((row, col))\n                    \n                    # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        \n                        # Check bounds, color match, and visited status\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            \n                # Store the found object\n                objects.append({\n                    'color': color,\n                    'size': len(current_object_pixels),\n                    'pixels': current_object_pixels\n                })\n                \n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by isolating the largest contiguous non-black object.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array representing the output grid with only the largest object.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array if necessary\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid with the background color (black, 0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify all non-black objects and their sizes\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # If no non-black objects are found, return the empty grid\n    if not objects:\n        return output_grid.tolist() # Return as list of lists per spec\n        \n    # Step 3: Find the object with the maximum size\n    # Use max function with a lambda key to find the object dict with the largest 'size'\n    largest_object = max(objects, key=lambda obj: obj['size'])\n    \n    # Step 4 & 5: Create output grid and draw the largest object\n    obj_color = largest_object['color']\n    for r, c in largest_object['pixels']:\n        output_grid[r, c] = obj_color\n        \n    # Return the final grid as a list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
