**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (16x16 in all examples). The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to different colors. Black (0) acts as the background color.
2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple "objects," which are contiguous regions of pixels sharing the same non-black color. These objects vary in size, shape, and color. Some objects are single pixels, while others form larger blocks.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to filter the input grid based on the size of the objects. Specifically, it identifies the single largest contiguous object (measured by the number of pixels it contains) among all non-black objects in the input.
4.  **Output Generation:** The output grid retains only the pixels belonging to this largest object, in their original positions. All other pixels in the output grid are set to the background color (black, 0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Isolate the largest contiguous block of non-black pixels from the input grid.
elements:
  - role: background
    color: black (0)
  - role: object
    definition: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same non-black color (1-9). Contiguity is defined by adjacent pixels sharing an edge (up, down, left, right).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels comprising the object.
      - size: The total number of pixels in the object.
      - pixels: A list of coordinates (row, column) for each pixel in the object.
transformation:
  - step: identify_objects
    description: Scan the input grid to find all distinct contiguous objects of non-black pixels.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_objects (each with color, size, pixels)
  - step: find_largest_object
    description: Determine the size of each object and identify the object with the maximum size. Assume a unique largest object based on examples.
    input: list_of_objects
    output: largest_object
  - step: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (black, 0).
    input: input_grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid
  - step: draw_largest_object
    description: Copy the pixels belonging to the largest_object onto the output_grid at their original coordinates, using their original color.
    input:
      - largest_object
      - output_grid
    output: modified_output_grid
final_output: The modified_output_grid containing only the largest object on a black background.
assumptions:
  - There is always a single unique largest object among the non-black colors in the input grid.
  - Object contiguity is based on orthogonal adjacency (sharing edges), not diagonal adjacency (sharing corners).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid (the "output grid") with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it entirely with black pixels (0).
2.  Examine the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous blocks of pixels that are not black. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as part of the same block if they share the same color.
3.  For each distinct block found, count the number of pixels it contains (its "size").
4.  Find the block that has the largest size. (Based on the examples, assume there will only be one block with the maximum size).
5.  Take the identified largest block. For every pixel that is part of this block in the input grid, set the pixel at the corresponding position in the output grid to the color of that block.
6.  The final output grid, containing only the largest block from the input grid on a black background, is the result.
