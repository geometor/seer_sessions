task_description: Isolate the largest contiguous block of non-black pixels from the input grid.
elements:
  - role: background
    color: black (0)
  - role: object
    definition: A contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same non-black color (1-9). Contiguity is defined by adjacent pixels sharing an edge (up, down, left, right).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels comprising the object.
      - size: The total number of pixels in the object.
      - pixels: A list of coordinates (row, column) for each pixel in the object.
transformation:
  - step: identify_objects
    description: Scan the input grid to find all distinct contiguous objects of non-black pixels.
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_objects (each with color, size, pixels)
  - step: find_largest_object
    description: Determine the size of each object and identify the object with the maximum size. Assume a unique largest object based on examples.
    input: list_of_objects
    output: largest_object
  - step: create_output_grid
    description: Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (black, 0).
    input: input_grid_dimensions
    output: output_grid
  - step: draw_largest_object
    description: Copy the pixels belonging to the largest_object onto the output_grid at their original coordinates, using their original color.
    input:
      - largest_object
      - output_grid
    output: modified_output_grid
final_output: The modified_output_grid containing only the largest object on a black background.
assumptions:
  - There is always a single unique largest object among the non-black colors in the input grid.
  - Object contiguity is based on orthogonal adjacency (sharing edges), not diagonal adjacency (sharing corners).
