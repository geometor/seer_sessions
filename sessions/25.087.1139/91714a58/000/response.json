The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to different colors. Black (0) acts as the background color.\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple \"objects,\" which are contiguous regions of pixels sharing the same non-black color. These objects vary in size, shape, and color. Some objects are single pixels, while others form larger blocks.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to filter the input grid based on the size of the objects. Specifically, it identifies the single largest contiguous object (measured by the number of pixels it contains) among all non-black objects in the input.\n4.  **Output Generation:** The output grid retains only the pixels belonging to this largest object, in their original positions. All other pixels in the output grid are set to the background color (black, 0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Examine the input grid to identify all distinct contiguous blocks of pixels that are not black. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as part of the same block if they share the same color.\n3.  For each distinct block found, count the number of pixels it contains (its \"size\").\n4.  Find the block that has the largest size.

For every pixel that is part of this block in the input grid, set the pixel at the corresponding position in the output grid to the color of that block.\n6.
