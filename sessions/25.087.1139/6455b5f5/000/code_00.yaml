objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions: variable (height x width)
  - type: shape
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - role: static barrier / boundary
      - connectivity: forms contiguous structures
  - type: region
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - role: background / fillable area
      - connectivity: forms connected components
      - adjacency: can be adjacent to red shapes or grid border
      - state: potentially changes color in output
  - type: filled_region
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - origin: derived from white (0) regions
      - condition: adjacent to red (2) AND reachable from grid border without crossing red (2)
  - type: filled_region
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - origin: derived from white (0) regions
      - condition: adjacent to red (2) AND NOT reachable from grid border without crossing red (2)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Between pixels (4-directional). Key for identifying regions adjacent to red shapes.
  - type: connectivity
    description: Defines contiguous regions of the same color (white regions, red shapes).
  - type: reachability
    description: Determines if a white pixel/region can reach the grid border without crossing a red pixel. This distinguishes between blue (1) and azure (8) fills.

actions:
  - type: copy
    source: input grid red (2) pixels
    target: output grid
    description: Red pixels are unchanged.
  - type: identify
    target: connected components of white (0) pixels
  - type: check_adjacency
    target: white (0) components
    condition: Check if any pixel in the component is adjacent to a red (2) pixel.
  - type: check_reachability
    target: white (0) components adjacent to red (2)
    method: Flood fill or BFS from grid border white pixels, blocked by red (2) pixels.
    result: Determine if the component contains any border-reachable white pixels.
  - type: fill
    target: white (0) components adjacent to red (2)
    color: blue (1)
    condition: The component is border-reachable.
  - type: fill
    target: white (0) components adjacent to red (2)
    color: azure (8)
    condition: The component is NOT border-reachable.
  - type: keep
    target: white (0) components
    color: white (0)
    condition: The component is NOT adjacent to any red (2) pixel.
