Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

### Perception

1.  **Grid Structure & Colors:** The input grids consist primarily of a white (0) background and structures made of red (2) pixels. The output grids retain the red (2) structures but change some of the white (0) pixels to either blue (1) or azure (8).
2.  **Red Objects:** The red (2) pixels form contiguous shapes, often resembling lines, L-shapes, H-shapes, or more complex branching structures. These red shapes act as barriers or boundaries. They remain unchanged from input to output.
3.  **White Regions:** The white (0) pixels form connected regions (components) separated by the red structures and the grid boundaries.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves selectively filling some of the white regions based on their relationship with the red structures and the grid boundaries.
    *   White regions that are *not* adjacent to any red pixels remain white (0).
    *   White regions that *are* adjacent to red pixels are filled with either blue (1) or azure (8).
5.  **Fill Logic:** The choice between blue (1) and azure (8) depends on whether a white region is "enclosed" by red structures or if it has access to the grid's border.
    *   **Azure (8) Fill:** White regions that are adjacent to red pixels but *cannot* reach the grid's border without crossing a red pixel (i.e., they are enclosed or isolated from the border by red barriers) are filled with azure (8). These often appear as pockets, channels, or areas surrounded by red.
    *   **Blue (1) Fill:** White regions that are adjacent to red pixels *and can* reach the grid's border without crossing a red pixel are filled with blue (1). These are typically the larger, more open areas connected to the grid edge.

      - color: azure (8)
      - origin: derived from white (0) regions
      - condition: adjacent to red (2) AND NOT reachable from grid border without crossing red (2)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Between pixels (4-directional). Key for identifying regions adjacent to red shapes.
  - type: connectivity
    description: Defines contiguous regions of the same color (white regions, red shapes).
  - type: reachability
    description: Determines if a white pixel/region can reach the grid border without crossing a red pixel. This distinguishes between blue (1) and azure (8) fills.

actions:
  - type: copy
    source: input grid red (2) pixels
    target: output grid
    description: Red pixels are unchanged.
  - type: identify
    target: connected components of white (0) pixels
  - type: check_adjacency
    target: white (0) components
    condition: Check if any pixel in the component is adjacent to a red (2) pixel.
  - type: check_reachability
    target: white (0) components adjacent to red (2)
    method: Flood fill or BFS from grid border white pixels, blocked by red (2) pixels.
    result: Determine if the component contains any border-reachable white pixels.
  - type: fill
    target: white (0) components adjacent to red (2)
    color: blue (1)
    condition: The component is border-reachable.
  - type: fill
    target: white (0) components adjacent to red (2)
    color: azure (8)
    condition: The component is NOT border-reachable.
  - type: keep
    target: white (0) components
    color: white (0)
    condition: The component is NOT adjacent to any red (2) pixel.

### Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct connected regions (components) of white (0) pixels in the input grid using 4-directional adjacency.
3.  Determine which white (0) pixels are 'border-reachable': Perform a flood fill (or Breadth-First Search) starting simultaneously from all white (0) pixels located on the grid's border (top, bottom, left, right edges). This fill should only propagate through other white (0) pixels; red (2) pixels act as barriers. Mark every white pixel reached by this fill as 'border-reachable'.
4.  Iterate through each identified white (0) component:
    a.  Check if *any* pixel within this component is 4-directionally adjacent to a red (2) pixel in the input grid.
    b.  **If no pixel in the component is adjacent to a red (2) pixel:** Leave all pixels in this component as white (0) in the output grid.
    c.  **If at least one pixel in the component is adjacent to a red (2) pixel:**
        i.  Check if *any* pixel within this component was marked as 'border-reachable' in step 3.
        ii. **If yes (component touches red AND is border-reachable):** Change the color of *all* pixels belonging to this component to blue (1) in the output grid.
        iii. **If no (component touches red AND is NOT border-reachable):** Change the color of *all* pixels belonging to this component to azure (8) in the output grid.
5.  The final output grid contains the original red (2) pixels and the appropriately colored (white (0), blue (1), or azure (8)) regions.
