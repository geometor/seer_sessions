Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: orange (7)
  - Object_Colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
  - Dimensions: Vary between examples (Input 1: 14x14, Input 2: 8x8, Input 3: 16x16)

Objects:
  - Definition: Clusters of contiguous non-orange (white or maroon) pixels. Orthogonal adjacency likely defines contiguity.
  - Location: Typically found concentrated near one edge (left, right, bottom) of the input grid.
  - Composition: Can be composed of only white pixels, only maroon pixels, or a combination of both.

Transformation:
  - Action: Relocation (Moving)
  - Target: The primary cluster/block of non-orange pixels.
  - Rule:
      - Identify the bounding box of all non-orange pixels.
      - Determine the primary edge affiliation (e.g., left edge if min_col=0 and max_col < width-1).
      - Create a new grid filled with the background color (orange).
      - Copy the content of the input bounding box to the opposite side of the output grid, aligned with that edge, preserving the internal structure.
  - Background_Handling: The area originally occupied by the moved object in the input grid becomes the background color (orange) in the output grid.

Ambiguities:
  - Example 1: Output retains some maroon pixels in the original object location.
  - Example 2: Input has multiple patterns; only one seems to move, and its transformation/placement in the output isn't a simple shift (part of it is missing, one maroon pixel seems independently placed). Suggests rules might depend on pattern complexity, presence of maroon, or handling of multiple separate patterns.
