**Perception:**

1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are orange (7), white (0), and maroon (9). Orange appears to be the background or default color. White and maroon form patterns or objects.
2.  **Structure:** The input grids contain distinct patterns made of white and maroon pixels, typically located near one edge of the grid, against an orange background.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve relocating the pattern of white and maroon pixels from its position in the input to the opposite side of the grid in the output. The original location of the pattern is filled with the orange background color.
4.  **Object Identification:** The pattern being moved consists of all contiguous non-orange pixels (white and maroon). In most examples, these non-orange pixels form a single cluster or closely related set of clusters located predominantly on one side (left, right, top, or bottom).
5.  **Movement:**
    *   If the pattern is on the left edge, it moves to the right edge in the output.
    *   If the pattern is on the right edge, it moves to the left edge.
    *   If the pattern is on the bottom edge, it moves to the top edge.
    *   The relative structure and colors within the pattern are preserved during the move.
6.  **Inconsistencies/Complexities:**
    *   Example 1 output appears to retain some maroon pixels from the input's original location, which contradicts the simple move/fill rule.
    *   Example 2 input has non-orange patterns in multiple locations (top and bottom). The output seems to move only the bottom pattern to the top, and even then, parts of the pattern and specific maroon pixels appear altered or relocated differently. This suggests a potentially more complex rule for selecting *which* pattern to move or how to handle multiple/complex patterns, possibly involving connectivity to maroon pixels, but a simple, consistent rule covering all examples is not immediately obvious. Example 3 fits the simple "move the block" rule perfectly.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Grid_Properties:
  - Background_Color: orange (7)
  - Object_Colors: [white (0), maroon (9)]
  - Dimensions: Vary between examples (Input 1: 14x14, Input 2: 8x8, Input 3: 16x16)

Objects:
  - Definition: Clusters of contiguous non-orange (white or maroon) pixels. Orthogonal adjacency likely defines contiguity.
  - Location: Typically found concentrated near one edge (left, right, bottom) of the input grid.
  - Composition: Can be composed of only white pixels, only maroon pixels, or a combination of both.

Transformation:
  - Action: Relocation (Moving)
  - Target: The primary cluster/block of non-orange pixels.
  - Rule:
      - Identify the bounding box of all non-orange pixels.
      - Determine the primary edge affiliation (e.g., left edge if min_col=0 and max_col < width-1).
      - Create a new grid filled with the background color (orange).
      - Copy the content of the input bounding box to the opposite side of the output grid, aligned with that edge, preserving the internal structure.
  - Background_Handling: The area originally occupied by the moved object in the input grid becomes the background color (orange) in the output grid.

Ambiguities:
  - Example 1: Output retains some maroon pixels in the original object location.
  - Example 2: Input has multiple patterns; only one seems to move, and its transformation/placement in the output isn't a simple shift (part of it is missing, one maroon pixel seems independently placed). Suggests rules might depend on pattern complexity, presence of maroon, or handling of multiple separate patterns.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are *not* the background color (orange, 7). Let these be the "object pixels".
3.  If no object pixels are found, return the initial output grid (copy of input).
4.  Determine the bounding box of all object pixels: find the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`).
5.  Get the dimensions of the grid: height `H`, width `W`.
6.  Determine the primary location of the object block based on which edge(s) the bounding box touches:
    *   `is_left = (min_c == 0)`
    *   `is_right = (max_c == W - 1)`
    *   `is_top = (min_r == 0)`
    *   `is_bottom = (max_r == H - 1)`
7.  Define the movement vectors based on the location. Prioritize horizontal movement if applicable, otherwise vertical. (This handles cases like Example 2 where it touches top and bottom - the primary movement seems vertical based on visual inspection).
    *   If `is_left` and not `is_right`: move right (`dr = 0`, `dc = W - 1 - max_c`).
    *   Else if `is_right` and not `is_left`: move left (`dr = 0`, `dc = -min_c`).
    *   Else if `is_bottom` and not `is_top`: move top (`dr = -min_r`, `dc = 0`).
    *   Else if `is_top` and not `is_bottom`: move bottom (`dr = H - 1 - max_r`, `dc = 0`).
    *   Else (object touches opposite sides or is centered): No move defined based on examples (return original grid or handle based on more specific rules if needed - for now, assume movement occurs
