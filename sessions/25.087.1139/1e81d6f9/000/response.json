Other pixels remain untouched.\n    *   The key factor determining whether a yellow pixel changes seems related to its context as part of a larger \"object\" (a contiguous block of the same color). Specifically, yellow pixels that form an object of size 1 (i.e., they have no adjacent yellow neighbours, including diagonals) are targeted for removal.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
