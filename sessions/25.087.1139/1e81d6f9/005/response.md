"""
Transforms the input grid based on the counts and locations of single green and single yellow pixels.

1. Find all single green (3) pixels (pixels with no green neighbors, 8-way adjacency) and their count (N_green).
2. Find all single yellow (4) pixels (pixels with no yellow neighbors, 8-way adjacency) and their count (N_yellow).
3. Conditional Transformation:
   - IF N_green == 2 AND N_yellow == 6:
     - Identify the top-leftmost single yellow pixel (minimum row, then minimum column).
     - Change all *other* single yellow pixels to white (0).
   - ELSE IF N_green == 6 AND N_yellow == 7:
     - Sort the locations of all single green pixels (by row, then column).
     - Identify the *second* pixel in the sorted list.
     - Change all *other* single green pixels to white (0).
   - ELSE:
     - Return the input grid unchanged.
