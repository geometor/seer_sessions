task_description: Modifies the input grid based on the count and position of single-pixel yellow objects.
definitions:
  - object: yellow_pixel
    description: A pixel with color value 4 (yellow).
  - object: single_yellow_object
    description: A contiguous object composed of exactly one yellow_pixel, considering 8-way adjacency.
  - property: count_single_yellow
    description: The total number of single_yellow_objects in the input grid.
  - property: top_leftmost_single_yellow
    description: The single_yellow_object with the minimum row index. If there's a tie, the one among them with the minimum column index.
actions:
  - action: identify_single_yellow_objects
    description: Find all single_yellow_objects in the input grid.
  - action: count_objects
    description: Count the number of objects identified in the previous step.
  - action: check_condition
    description: Determine if count_single_yellow is exactly equal to 6.
  - action: conditional_transform
    description: If the condition (count_single_yellow == 6) is true, perform the following:
      1. Find the top_leftmost_single_yellow object.
      2. For all other single_yellow_objects, change their color to 0 (white).
      3. Keep the top_leftmost_single_yellow object's color as 4 (yellow).
  - action: no_transform
    description: If the condition (count_single_yellow == 6) is false, the output grid is identical to the input grid.
