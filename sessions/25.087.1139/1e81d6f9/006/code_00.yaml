Task: Conditional Pixel Modification based on Single Pixel Counts

Inputs:
  - Grids containing pixels of various colors (0-9).

Key Objects:
  - Pixels: Identified by color and location (row, col).
  - Single Pixels: Pixels of a specific color (Green=3, Yellow=4, Red=2) that have no adjacent neighbors (8-way connectivity) of the *same* color.
  - Adjacent Orange Pixels: A specific pair of orange (7) pixels found at (10, 12) and (11, 12) in Example 2.

Properties:
  - Count: Number of single green pixels (N_green).
  - Count: Number of single yellow pixels (N_yellow).
  - Location: (row, col) coordinates of pixels.
  - Order: Single pixels can be sorted, typically by row then column (top-leftmost first).

Conditions & Actions:

  Condition 1:
    - Trigger: N_green == 2 AND N_yellow == 6
    - Identification: Find all single yellow pixels. Sort them by row, then column. Identify the first (top-leftmost) pixel.
    - Action: Change the color of all *other* single yellow pixels to white (0). Preserve the top-leftmost single yellow pixel.

  Condition 2:
    - Trigger: N_green == 6 AND N_yellow == 7
    - Identification: Find all single green pixels. Sort them by row, then column. Identify the second pixel in the sorted list.
    - Action: Change the color of all *other* single green pixels to white (0). Preserve the second single green pixel.

  Condition 3:
    - Trigger: N_green == 1 AND N_yellow == 2
    - Identification:
        - Find the single red (2) pixel(s). In the observed case, there is only one at (8, 11).
        - Find the pair of adjacent orange (7) pixels. In the observed case, they are at (10, 12) and (11, 12).
    - Action: Change the color of the identified single red pixel and the identified adjacent orange pixels to white (0).

  Default Condition:
    - Trigger: None of the above conditions are met.
    - Action: Return the input grid unchanged.
