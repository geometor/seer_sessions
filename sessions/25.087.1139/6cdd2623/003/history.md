## General Assessment

The initial code successfully solved the first two examples but failed on the third. The core logic identifies pairs of identical non-white colors on opposite edges (left/right or top/bottom) and draws corresponding lines (horizontal or vertical) across the output grid.

Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate cases where only horizontal lines (Ex 1: Red) or both horizontal and vertical lines for the *same* color (Ex 2: Green) are drawn.

Example 3 introduces a scenario with multiple distinct colors matching on opposite edges:
*   Red matches horizontally (rows 3 and 11).
*   Yellow matches vertically (column 2).
*   Azure matches both horizontally (row 10) and vertically (column 13).

The initial code drew lines for *all* these matches (Red, Yellow, Azure). However, the expected output for Example 3 *only* contains the Azure lines.

This suggests a refinement is needed: when a color exists that matches *both* horizontally *and* vertically, only the lines corresponding to that specific color should be drawn. If no single color satisfies both horizontal and vertical matches, then all qualifying horizontal and vertical lines are drawn (as in Examples 1 and 2).

**Correction:** The metric gathering code initially misidentified some matches in Example 3 due to an error in my manual check. The code output confirms:
*   Example 1: Only Red (2) matches horizontally. Output has Red horizontal lines. Intersection is empty.
*   Example 2: Only Green (3) matches horizontally, and only Green (3) matches vertically. Intersection is {Green}. Output has Green horizontal and vertical lines.
*   Example 3: Azure (8) matches horizontally (row 10). Yellow (4) and Azure (8) match vertically (cols 2 and 13 respectively). The intersection is {Azure}. The expected output has only the Azure lines (horizontal row 10, vertical col 13).

The initial hypothesis about Red matching horizontally in Example 3 was incorrect based on the code analysis; only Azure (8) matches horizontally.

The revised hypothesis holds: If the set of colors matching horizontally intersects with the set of colors matching vertically, only draw lines for the color(s) in the intersection. Otherwise, draw all lines for all matching colors.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Draw horizontal or vertical lines across the grid based on matching non-white pixel colors on opposite edges.

definitions:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - edge_pixels: Pixels located on the first/last row or first/last column.
  - horizontal_match: A pair of identical non-white pixels where one is on the left edge (column 0) and the other is on the right edge (last column) in the same row.
  - vertical_match: A pair of identical non-white pixels where one is on the top edge (row 0) and the other is on the bottom edge (last row) in the same column.
  - horizontal_line: Filling an entire row with the color of a horizontal_match.
  - vertical_line: Filling an entire column with the color of a vertical_match.

examples:
  example_1:
    input_dimensions: 13x20
    horizontal_matches:
      Red(2): [row 3, row 11] # Corrected by code
    vertical_matches: {}
    intersection_colors: {}
    output_rule: Since intersection is empty, draw all identified lines.
    output_lines: Horizontal Red(2) lines at rows 3 and 11.
  example_2:
    input_dimensions: 11x22
    horizontal_matches:
      Green(3): [row 8]
    vertical_matches:
      Green(3): [column 11]
    intersection_colors: {Green(3)}
    output_rule: Since intersection is {Green}, draw only Green lines.
    output_lines: Horizontal Green(3) line at row 8, Vertical Green(3) line at column 11.
  example_3:
    input_dimensions: 15x17
    horizontal_matches:
      Azure(8): [row 10] # Corrected by code
    vertical_matches:
      Yellow(4): [column 2]
      Azure(8): [column 13]
    intersection_colors: {Azure(8)}
    output_rule: Since intersection is {Azure}, draw only Azure lines.
    output_lines: Horizontal Azure(8) line at row 10, Vertical Azure(8) line at column 13.

transformation_logic:
  - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
  - Identify all horizontal_matches and the rows/colors involved. Store the set of colors (H_colors).
  - Identify all vertical_matches and the columns/colors involved. Store the set of colors (V_colors).
  - Calculate the intersection of H_colors and V_colors (I_colors).
  - Conditional Drawing:
    - If I_colors is NOT empty:
      - For each color C in I_colors:
        - Draw horizontal_lines for C at all rows identified in its horizontal_match.
        - Draw vertical_lines for C at all columns identified in its vertical_match.
    - If I_colors IS empty:
      - For each color C in H_colors:
        - Draw horizontal_lines for C at all rows identified in its horizontal_match.
      - For each color C in V_colors:
        - Draw vertical_lines for C at all columns identified in its vertical_match.
  - Note: Drawing a line overwrites existing pixels in that row/column. The order (horizontal then vertical, or vice-versa) might matter at intersections if different colors are involved in the "else" case, but based on examples, either the intersection rule applies, or only one type of line is drawn (Ex 1), or both lines are the same color (Ex 2). The provided examples don't test conflicting colors in the "else" case. Assume standard overwrite behavior (vertical potentially overwrites horizontal at intersection if both are drawn).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (output) with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Examine the input grid to find all pairs of identical, non-white pixels located on opposite horizontal edges (leftmost column vs. rightmost column) within the same row. Record the row number and color for each such horizontal match. Let `H_colors` be the set of unique colors found in these horizontal matches.
3.  Examine the input grid to find all pairs of identical, non-white pixels located on opposite vertical edges (topmost row vs. bottommost row) within the same column. Record the column number and color for each such vertical match. Let `V_colors` be the set of unique colors found in these vertical matches.
4.  Determine the set of colors that are present in *both* `H_colors` and `V_colors`. Call this set `Intersection_colors`.
5.  **If `Intersection_colors` is not empty:**
    *   For each color `C` in `Intersection_colors`:
        *   Find all rows `r` where `C` caused a horizontal match. For each such row `r`, fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with color `C`.
        *   Find all columns `c` where `C` caused a vertical match. For each such column `c`, fill the entire column `c` of the output grid with color `C`.
6.  **If `Intersection_colors` is empty:**
    *   Find all rows `r` and their corresponding colors `Ch` that caused a horizontal match. For each such pair `(r, Ch)`, fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with color `Ch`.
    *   Find all columns `c` and their corresponding colors `Cv` that caused a vertical match. For each such pair `(c, Cv)`, fill the entire column `c` of the output grid with color `Cv`. (Note: If a horizontal line and a vertical line intersect, the vertically drawn line will overwrite the intersection pixel).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
