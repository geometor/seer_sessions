"""
Identify pairs of same-colored pixels on opposite edges (left/right or top/bottom)
of the input grid. If a pair exists in the same row (left/right edges), draw a 
horizontal line of that color across the entire corresponding row in the output grid.
If a pair exists in the same column (top/bottom edges), draw a vertical line of 
that color down the entire corresponding column in the output grid. The output 
grid starts as all white and has the same dimensions as the input.
