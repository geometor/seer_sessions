task_description: Draw horizontal or vertical lines across the grid based on matching non-white pixel colors on opposite edges.

definitions:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - edge_pixels: Pixels located on the first/last row or first/last column.
  - horizontal_match: A pair of identical non-white pixels where one is on the left edge (column 0) and the other is on the right edge (last column) in the same row.
  - vertical_match: A pair of identical non-white pixels where one is on the top edge (row 0) and the other is on the bottom edge (last row) in the same column.
  - horizontal_line: Filling an entire row with the color of a horizontal_match.
  - vertical_line: Filling an entire column with the color of a vertical_match.

examples:
  example_1:
    input_dimensions: 13x20
    horizontal_matches:
      Red(2): [row 3, row 11] # Corrected by code
    vertical_matches: {}
    intersection_colors: {}
    output_rule: Since intersection is empty, draw all identified lines.
    output_lines: Horizontal Red(2) lines at rows 3 and 11.
  example_2:
    input_dimensions: 11x22
    horizontal_matches:
      Green(3): [row 8]
    vertical_matches:
      Green(3): [column 11]
    intersection_colors: {Green(3)}
    output_rule: Since intersection is {Green}, draw only Green lines.
    output_lines: Horizontal Green(3) line at row 8, Vertical Green(3) line at column 11.
  example_3:
    input_dimensions: 15x17
    horizontal_matches:
      Azure(8): [row 10] # Corrected by code
    vertical_matches:
      Yellow(4): [column 2]
      Azure(8): [column 13]
    intersection_colors: {Azure(8)}
    output_rule: Since intersection is {Azure}, draw only Azure lines.
    output_lines: Horizontal Azure(8) line at row 10, Vertical Azure(8) line at column 13.

transformation_logic:
  - Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
  - Identify all horizontal_matches and the rows/colors involved. Store the set of colors (H_colors).
  - Identify all vertical_matches and the columns/colors involved. Store the set of colors (V_colors).
  - Calculate the intersection of H_colors and V_colors (I_colors).
  - Conditional Drawing:
    - If I_colors is NOT empty:
      - For each color C in I_colors:
        - Draw horizontal_lines for C at all rows identified in its horizontal_match.
        - Draw vertical_lines for C at all columns identified in its vertical_match.
    - If I_colors IS empty:
      - For each color C in H_colors:
        - Draw horizontal_lines for C at all rows identified in its horizontal_match.
      - For each color C in V_colors:
        - Draw vertical_lines for C at all columns identified in its vertical_match.
  - Note: Drawing a line overwrites existing pixels in that row/column. The order (horizontal then vertical, or vice-versa) might matter at intersections if different colors are involved in the "else" case, but based on examples, either the intersection rule applies, or only one type of line is drawn (Ex 1), or both lines are the same color (Ex 2). The provided examples don't test conflicting colors in the "else" case. Assume standard overwrite behavior (vertical potentially overwrites horizontal at intersection if both are drawn).
