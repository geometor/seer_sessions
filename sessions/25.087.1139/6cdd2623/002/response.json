            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully solved the first two examples but failed on the third. The core logic identifies pairs of identical non-white colors on opposite edges (left/right or top/bottom) and draws corresponding lines (horizontal or vertical) across the output grid.\n\nExamples 1 and 2 demonstrate cases where only horizontal lines (Ex 1: Red) or both horizontal and vertical lines for the *same* color (Ex 2: Green) are drawn.\n\nExample 3 introduces a scenario with multiple distinct colors matching on opposite edges:\n*   Red matches horizontally (rows 3 and 11).\n*   Yellow matches vertically (column 2).\n*   Azure matches both horizontally (row 10) and vertically (column 13).\n\nThe initial code drew lines for *all* these matches (Red, Yellow, Azure). However, the expected output for Example 3 *only* contains the Azure lines.\n\nThis suggests a refinement is needed: when a color exists that matches *both* horizontally *and* vertically, only the lines corresponding to that specific color should be drawn. If no single color satisfies both horizontal and vertical matches, then all qualifying horizontal and vertical lines are drawn (as in Examples 1 and 2).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's verify the edge matches for each example.\n\n"
