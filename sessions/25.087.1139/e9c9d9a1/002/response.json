            "text": "The analysis confirms the hypothesis. The errors in the previous code stemmed from incorrectly applying the Orange color (7) to *all* white blocks in the Middle band(s), rather than just the blocks identified as \"Intermediate\" within their respective bands. The Leftmost and Rightmost blocks in the Middle bands should remain white. The logic for Top and Bottom bands appears correct.\n\n---\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the grid structure (horizontal green dividers, vertical bands) and the white blocks. It also correctly applied the coloring rules for the Top and Bottom bands. However, it failed because the rule for the Middle band(s) was oversimplified. The code colored all white blocks found in any Middle band to Orange (7). The examples show that only the *intermediate* white blocks (those that are neither the leftmost nor the rightmost within their band) should be colored Orange. Leftmost and Rightmost blocks in Middle bands should retain their original color (White, 0).\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the final coloring step. Instead of coloring all Middle band blocks Orange, we need to check the calculated `position` for each block within its band. If a block is in a Middle band and its `position` is \"Intermediate\", it should be colored Orange (7). Otherwise (if its position is \"Leftmost\", \"Rightmost\", or \"Single\"), it should remain White (0). The logic for Top and Bottom bands needs no change.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution provided a detailed analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Dividers:** Correctly identified the row indices of the horizontal green lines. Example 1: `[3, 10]`. Example 2: `[4, 7, 12]`. Example 3: `[2, 7, 10, 13]`.\n*   **Bands:** Defined Top, Middle, and Bottom bands based on dividers. Multiple Middle bands exist when there are more than two dividers.\n*   **Blocks:** Found all contiguous white blocks and calculated their bounding boxes (`bbox`), coordinate counts, and assigned them to the correct band.\n*   **Positions:** For each band, calculated the minimum starting column (`band_min_c`) and maximum ending column (`band_max_c`) spanned by the white blocks within that band. Correctly assigned \"Leftmost\", \"Rightmost\", \"Intermediate\", or \"Single\" positions to each block relative to others *within the same band*.\n\n**Key Findings from Metrics:**\n\n*   **Example 1 (Middle Band):** Blocks at (4,9,0,2), (4,9,4,6), (4,9,8,11). Positions: Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost. Expected Output requires Leftmost and Rightmost to remain White, Intermediate to become Orange. Previous code made all Orange.\n*   **Example 2 (Middle Bands):** Two distinct Middle bands exist (rows 5-6 and 8-11). Within each, blocks were correctly identified as Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost. Expected Output requires only Intermediate blocks in these bands to become Orange. Previous code made all Orange.\n*   **Example 3 (Middle Bands):** Three distinct Middle bands (rows 3-6, 8-9, 11-12). Again, Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost correctly assigned within each. Expected Output requires only Intermediate blocks in these bands to become Orange. Previous code made all Orange.\n\nThe metrics confirm that the error lies solely in the application of the coloring rule for the Middle bands.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code successfully identified the core structure of the task: using horizontal green lines as dividers to create vertical bands (Top, Middle, Bottom) and locating white blocks within these bands. The logic for coloring blocks in the Top and Bottom bands based on their relative horizontal positions (Leftmost, Rightmost, Intermediate) was correctly implemented and matches the examples.\n\nThe errors observed in all three examples stem specifically from the rule applied to the **Middle** band(s). The previous code incorrectly colored *all* white blocks in the Middle band(s) Orange (7). However, the expected outputs clearly show that only the white blocks classified as \"Intermediate\" within a Middle band should turn Orange (7). Blocks classified as \"Leftmost\", \"Rightmost\", or \"Single\" within a Middle band should remain White (0).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the coloring logic in step 5 of the previous code. The determination of bands and horizontal positions (\"Leftmost\", \"Rightmost\", \"Intermediate\", \"Single\") per band appears correct based on the analysis. The correction involves adjusting the conditional logic for coloring: only apply Orange (7) to blocks that are both in a \"Middle\" band AND have the calculated position \"Intermediate\".\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution performed an analysis of block positions within each band for all three examples.\n\n"
