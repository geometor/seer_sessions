grid_properties:
  - structure: Segmented by horizontal lines of green (3) pixels.
  - background: White (0) pixels form the background in segmented areas.
  - objects: Contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels within the segmented areas.

segmentation:
  - type: Horizontal
  - delimiter: Rows composed entirely of green (3) pixels.
  - defines: Vertical bands (regions between delimiters or grid edges).
    - band_types:
      - Top: Above the first delimiter.
      - Middle: Between any two delimiters.
      - Bottom: Below the last delimiter.

objects:
  - type: White Block
  - description: Contiguous rectangular (or rectilinear) areas of white (0) pixels.
  - properties:
    - location: Defined by bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
    - band: The vertical band (Top, Middle, Bottom) it resides in.
    - horizontal_position_in_band: Relative position based on column extents compared to other white blocks *within the same band*.
      - Leftmost: Block's min_col matches the minimum min_col of all blocks in the band.
      - Rightmost: Block's max_col matches the maximum max_col of all blocks in the band.
      - Intermediate: Neither Leftmost nor Rightmost.
      - Single: Both Leftmost and Rightmost (e.g., only block in band, or spans full width).

actions:
  - description: Recolor specific white blocks based on their band and horizontal position.
  - rules:
    - Preserve: Green delimiters and any non-white pixels remain unchanged.
    - Preserve: White blocks not meeting specific coloring criteria remain white.
    - Top Band Coloring:
      - Leftmost/Single white blocks -> Red (2).
      - Rightmost white blocks -> Yellow (4).
      - Intermediate white blocks -> White (0).
    - Middle Band Coloring:
      - Intermediate white blocks -> Orange (7).
      - Leftmost/Rightmost/Single white blocks -> White (0).
    - Bottom Band Coloring:
      - Leftmost/Single white blocks -> Blue (1).
      - Rightmost white blocks -> Azure (8).
      - Intermediate white blocks -> White (0).
