definitions:
  - grid: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - divider: A horizontal line composed entirely of green (3) pixels.
  - band: A vertical region of the grid defined by dividers or grid edges.
    - types: Top (above first divider), Middle (between dividers), Bottom (below last divider).
  - white_block: A contiguous area of white (0) pixels.

objects:
  - object: white_block
    properties:
      - band: The vertical band (Top, Middle, Bottom) containing the block.
      - bbox: Bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
      - horizontal_position: Relative position within its band, determined by comparing its column range (min_c, max_c) to the overall column range spanned by *all* white blocks in that same band (`band_min_c`, `band_max_c`).
        - Leftmost: `min_c == band_min_c` and `max_c != band_max_c`.
        - Rightmost: `max_c == band_max_c` and `min_c != band_min_c`.
        - Intermediate: `min_c != band_min_c` and `max_c != band_max_c`.
        - Single: `min_c == band_min_c` and `max_c == band_max_c`. (Covers cases where only one block exists or blocks perfectly tile the available width).

transformation:
  - input: Grid potentially containing dividers and white blocks.
  - output: Grid with specific white blocks recolored.
  - steps:
    1. Identify all horizontal green (3) dividers.
    2. Define Top, Middle, and Bottom bands based on divider locations.
    3. Find all contiguous white (0) blocks.
    4. For each band:
       a. Identify all white blocks within it.
       b. Calculate the `band_min_c` and `band_max_c` for blocks in this band.
       c. Determine the `horizontal_position` (Leftmost, Rightmost, Intermediate, Single) for each block within the band.
    5. Apply coloring rules to white blocks based on their `band` and `horizontal_position`:
       - Top Band:
         - Leftmost/Single -> Red (2)
         - Rightmost -> Yellow (4)
         - Intermediate -> White (0) (no change)
       - Middle Band(s):
         - Intermediate -> Orange (7)
         - Leftmost/Rightmost/Single -> White (0) (no change)
       - Bottom Band:
         - Leftmost/Single -> Blue (1)
         - Rightmost -> Azure (8)
         - Intermediate -> White (0) (no change)
    6. Preserve all other pixels (green dividers, other colors, background not part of identified white blocks).
