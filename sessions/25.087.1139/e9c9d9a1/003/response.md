"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identifies horizontal green lines (pixel value 3) that divide the grid into vertical bands (Top, Middle, Bottom).
2. Finds all contiguous rectangular blocks of white pixels (pixel value 0) within these bands.
3. Determines the horizontal position (Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost, or Single) of each white block relative to other white blocks *within the same vertical band*.
4. Recolors the white blocks based on their vertical band and determined horizontal position:
    - Top Band: Leftmost/Single -> Red (2), Rightmost -> Yellow (4), Intermediate -> White (0).
    - Middle Band(s): Intermediate -> Orange (7), Leftmost/Rightmost/Single -> White (0).
    - Bottom Band: Leftmost/Single -> Blue (1), Rightmost -> Azure (8), Intermediate -> White (0).
5. Preserves the original green structure and any other non-white pixels.
