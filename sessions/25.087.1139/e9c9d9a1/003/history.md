"""
Identifies horizontal green lines (dividers) that separate the grid into vertical bands (Top, Middle, Bottom).
Finds all contiguous rectangular blocks of white pixels within these bands.
Determines the horizontal position (Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost) of each white block within its band.
Recolors the white blocks based on their vertical band and horizontal position:
- Top Band: Leftmost -> Red (2), Rightmost -> Yellow (4), Intermediate -> White (0)
- Middle Bands: All -> Orange (7)
- Bottom Band: Leftmost -> Blue (1), Rightmost -> Azure (8), Intermediate -> White (0)
Keeps the original green structure intact.

The analysis confirms the hypothesis. The errors in the previous code stemmed from incorrectly applying the Orange color (7) to *all* white blocks in the Middle band(s), rather than just the blocks identified as "Intermediate" within their respective bands. The Leftmost and Rightmost blocks in the Middle bands should remain white. The logic for Top and Bottom bands appears correct.

---

**General Assessment:**

The previous code correctly identified the grid structure (horizontal green dividers, vertical bands) and the white blocks. It also correctly applied the coloring rules for the Top and Bottom bands. However, it failed because the rule for the Middle band(s) was oversimplified. The code colored all white blocks found in any Middle band to Orange (7). The examples show that only the *intermediate* white blocks (those that are neither the leftmost nor the rightmost within their band) should be colored Orange. Leftmost and Rightmost blocks in Middle bands should retain their original color (White, 0).

The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the final coloring step. Instead of coloring all Middle band blocks Orange, we need to check the calculated `position` for each block within its band. If a block is in a Middle band and its `position` is "Intermediate", it should be colored Orange (7). Otherwise (if its position is "Leftmost", "Rightmost", or "Single"), it should remain White (0). The logic for Top and Bottom bands needs no change.

**Metrics:**

The code execution provided a detailed analysis of each example:

*   **Dividers:** Correctly identified the row indices of the horizontal green lines. Example 1: `[3, 10]`. Example 2: `[4, 7, 12]`. Example 3: `[2, 7, 10, 13]`.
*   **Bands:** Defined Top, Middle, and Bottom bands based on dividers. Multiple Middle bands exist when there are more than two dividers.
*   **Blocks:** Found all contiguous white blocks and calculated their bounding boxes (`bbox`), coordinate counts, and assigned them to the correct band.
*   **Positions:** For each band, calculated the minimum starting column (`band_min_c`) and maximum ending column (`band_max_c`) spanned by the white blocks within that band. Correctly assigned "Leftmost", "Rightmost", "Intermediate", or "Single" positions to each block relative to others *within the same band*.

**Key Findings from Metrics:**

*   **Example 1 (Middle Band):** Blocks at (4,9,0,2), (4,9,4,6), (4,9,8,11). Positions: Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost. Expected Output requires Leftmost and Rightmost to remain White, Intermediate to become Orange. Previous code made all Orange.
*   **Example 2 (Middle Bands):** Two distinct Middle bands exist (rows 5-6 and 8-11). Within each, blocks were correctly identified as Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost. Expected Output requires only Intermediate blocks in these bands to become Orange. Previous code made all Orange.
*   **Example 3 (Middle Bands):** Three distinct Middle bands (rows 3-6, 8-9, 11-12). Again, Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost correctly assigned within each. Expected Output requires only Intermediate blocks in these bands to become Orange. Previous code made all Orange.

The metrics confirm that the error lies solely in the application of the coloring rule for the Middle bands.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all horizontal rows composed entirely of green (3) pixels. These are the dividers.
2.  Use the dividers to segment the grid into vertical bands: Top (above the first divider), Middle (between any two dividers), and Bottom (below the last divider). If there are no dividers, consider the entire grid as one band (likely Middle, though specific rules for this edge case might be needed if encountered). If there is only one divider, there will be a Top and Bottom band, but no Middle band.
3.  Find all distinct contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
4.  For each vertical band identified in step 2:
    a.  Determine the set of white blocks located entirely within that band.
    b.  If there are white blocks in the band, find the minimum starting column (`band_min_c`) and the maximum ending column (`band_max_c`) among all these blocks.
    c.  For each white block within this band, classify its horizontal position:
        i.  If its starting column equals `band_min_c` AND its ending column equals `band_max_c`, classify it as "Single".
        ii. Else if its starting column equals `band_min_c`, classify it as "Leftmost".
        iii. Else if its ending column equals `band_max_c`, classify it as "Rightmost".
        iv. Otherwise, classify it as "Intermediate".
5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6.  Iterate through all identified white blocks:
    a.  If the block is in the **Top** band:
        i.  If its position is "Leftmost" or "Single", change its color to Red (2) in the output grid.
        ii. If its position is "Rightmost", change its color to Yellow (4) in the output grid.
        iii. If its position is "Intermediate", leave it White (0).
    b.  If the block is in a **Middle** band:
        i.  If its position is "Intermediate", change its color to Orange (7) in the output grid.
        ii. Otherwise (Leftmost, Rightmost, Single), leave it White (0).
    c.  If the block is in the **Bottom** band:
        i.  If its position is "Leftmost" or "Single", change its color to Blue (1) in the output grid.
        ii. If its position is "Rightmost", change its color to Azure (8) in the output grid.
        iii. If its position is "Intermediate", leave it White (0).
7.  Return the modified output grid.**General Assessment:**

The provided code successfully identified the core structure of the task: using horizontal green lines as dividers to create vertical bands (Top, Middle, Bottom) and locating white blocks within these bands. The logic for coloring blocks in the Top and Bottom bands based on their relative horizontal positions (Leftmost, Rightmost, Intermediate) was correctly implemented and matches the examples.

The errors observed in all three examples stem specifically from the rule applied to the **Middle** band(s). The previous code incorrectly colored *all* white blocks in the Middle band(s) Orange (7). However, the expected outputs clearly show that only the white blocks classified as "Intermediate" within a Middle band should turn Orange (7). Blocks classified as "Leftmost", "Rightmost", or "Single" within a Middle band should remain White (0).

The strategy is to refine the coloring logic in step 5 of the previous code. The determination of bands and horizontal positions ("Leftmost", "Rightmost", "Intermediate", "Single") per band appears correct based on the analysis. The correction involves adjusting the conditional logic for coloring: only apply Orange (7) to blocks that are both in a "Middle" band AND have the calculated position "Intermediate".

**Metrics:**

The code execution performed an analysis of block positions within each band for all three examples.


```text
Example 1:
  Dividers: [3, 10]
  Bands: Top (Rows 0-2), Middle (Rows 4-9), Bottom (Rows 11-14)
  Block Positions (Correctly Identified):
    Top: Leftmost(0-2), Intermediate(4-6), Rightmost(8-11)
    Middle: Leftmost(0-2), Intermediate(4-6), Rightmost(8-11)
    Bottom: Leftmost(0-2), Intermediate(4-6), Rightmost(8-11)
  Error: Previous code colored Middle/Leftmost and Middle/Rightmost Orange; should be White.

Example 2:
  Dividers: [4, 7, 12]
  Bands: Top (Rows 0-3), Middle1 (Rows 5-6), Middle2 (Rows 8-11), Bottom (Rows 13-18)
  Block Positions (Correctly Identified per Band): e.g., Middle1: Leftmost(0-2), Intermediate(4-5), Rightmost(7-11)
  Error: Previous code colored Leftmost and Rightmost blocks in *both* Middle bands Orange; should be White.

Example 3:
  Dividers: [2, 7, 10, 13]
  Bands: Top (Rows 0-1), Middle1 (Rows 3-6), Middle2 (Rows 8-9), Middle3 (Rows 11-12), Bottom (Rows 14-17)
  Block Positions (Correctly Identified per Band): e.g., Middle1: Leftmost(0-2), Intermediate(4-6, 8-10, 12-13), Rightmost(15-15)
  Error: Previous code colored Leftmost and Rightmost blocks in *all three* Middle bands Orange; should be White.
```

The analysis confirms that the block identification, band assignment, and relative horizontal positioning logic were fundamentally correct. The failure was solely in applying the final coloring rule to the Middle bands.

        - Single: `min_c == band_min_c` and `max_c == band_max_c`. (Covers cases where only one block exists or blocks perfectly tile the available width).

transformation:
  - input: Grid potentially containing dividers and white blocks.
  - output: Grid with specific white blocks recolored.
  - steps:
    1. Identify all horizontal green (3) dividers.
    2. Define Top, Middle, and Bottom bands based on divider locations.
    3. Find all contiguous white (0) blocks.
    4. For each band:
       a. Identify all white blocks within it.
       b. Calculate the `band_min_c` and `band_max_c` for blocks in this band.
       c. Determine the `horizontal_position` (Leftmost, Rightmost, Intermediate, Single) for each block within the band.
    5. Apply coloring rules to white blocks based on their `band` and `horizontal_position`:
       - Top Band:
         - Leftmost/Single -> Red (2)
         - Rightmost -> Yellow (4)
         - Intermediate -> White (0) (no change)
       - Middle Band(s):

       - Bottom Band:
         - Leftmost/Single -> Blue (1)
         - Rightmost -> Azure (8)
         - Intermediate -> White (0) (no change)
    6. Preserve all other pixels (green dividers, other colors, background not part of identified white blocks).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Structure:** Find all horizontal rows consisting entirely of green (3) pixels. These rows act as dividers.
2.  **Define Bands:** Segment the grid vertically based on the dividers: the area above the top divider is the "Top" band, areas between consecutive dividers are "Middle" bands, and the area below the bottom divider is the "Bottom" band. Handle edge cases: no dividers means one "Middle" band; one divider means "Top" and "Bottom" bands only.
3.  **Find Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of white (0) pixels.
4.  **Analyze Objects within Bands:**
    a.  Assign each white block to its corresponding band (Top, Middle, or Bottom).
    b.  For each band containing white blocks, determine the overall horizontal span covered by those blocks by finding the minimum starting column (`band_min_c`) and maximum ending column (`band_max_c`) among them.
    c.  Classify each white block within its band based on its horizontal position relative to the `band_min_c` and `band_max_c`:
        *   "Leftmost": If its start column matches `band_min_c` but its end column does not match `band_max_c`.
        *   "Rightmost": If its end column matches `band_max_c` but its start column does not match `band_min_c`.
        *   "Intermediate": If its start column is not `band_min_c` and its end column is not `band_max_c`.
        *   "Single": If its start column matches `band_min_c` AND its end column matches `band_max_c`.
5.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a copy of the input grid. Modify the copy by recoloring the white blocks according to these rules:
    *   **Top Band:** Change "Leftmost" or "Single" blocks to Red (2); change "Rightmost" blocks to Yellow (4). Leave "Intermediate" blocks White (0).
    *   **Middle Band(s):** Change "Intermediate" blocks to Orange (7). Leave "Leftmost", "Rightmost", and "Single" blocks White (0).
    *   **Bottom Band:** Change "Leftmost" or "Single" blocks to Blue (1); change "Rightmost" blocks to Azure (8). Leave "Intermediate" blocks White (0).
6.  **Output:** Return the modified grid. All non-white pixels and white pixels not meeting the coloring criteria remain unchanged from the input.
