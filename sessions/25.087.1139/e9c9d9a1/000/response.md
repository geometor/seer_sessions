Okay, let's break down the transformation for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids feature a background of white (0) pixels. They contain structural elements made of green (3) pixels: full-width horizontal lines and partial-height vertical lines.
2.  **Dividers:** The horizontal green lines act as major dividers, splitting the grid into distinct horizontal "bands" or sections. The vertical green lines further subdivide these bands into smaller rectangular areas or "cells".
3.  **Target Areas:** The transformation focuses on the rectangular areas composed entirely of white (0) pixels that are enclosed by the green (3) lines or the grid boundaries.
4.  **Color Filling:** These white areas are selectively filled with new colors in the output grid. The original green structure remains unchanged.
5.  **Filling Logic:** The color used to fill a white area depends on its vertical position (which band it's in - top, middle, or bottom) and its horizontal position within that band (leftmost, rightmost, or intermediate).
    *   **Top Band:** The area above the first horizontal green line. The leftmost white block becomes red (2), the rightmost becomes yellow (4).
    *   **Middle Bands:** Areas between horizontal green lines. All white blocks become orange (7).
    *   **Bottom Band:** The area below the last horizontal green line. The leftmost white block becomes blue (1), the rightmost becomes azure (8).
    *   **Intermediate Blocks:** White blocks in the top and bottom bands that are neither the leftmost nor the rightmost remain white (0).

**YAML Facts:**

    - width: Integer
    - height: Integer
  Contains:
    - Pixels
    - Horizontal_Dividers
    - Vertical_Dividers
    - White_Blocks

Pixel:
  Properties:
    - color: Integer (0-9)
    - row: Integer
    - column: Integer

Horizontal_Divider:
  Is: A row composed entirely of green (3) pixels.
  Properties:
    - row_index: Integer
  Function: Divides the grid into vertical bands (Top, Middle, Bottom).

Vertical_Divider:
  Is: A column containing green (3) pixels (not part of a Horizontal_Divider).
  Properties:
    - column_index: Integer
  Function: Subdivides vertical bands into horizontal blocks.

White_Block:
  Is: A contiguous rectangular area of white (0) pixels.
  Bounded_By:
    - Horizontal_Dividers (or top/bottom grid edges)
    - Vertical_Dividers (or left/right grid edges)
  Properties:
    - top_row: Integer
    - bottom_row: Integer
    - left_col: Integer
    - right_col: Integer
    - vertical_band: Enum (Top, Middle, Bottom)
    - horizontal_position_in_band: Enum (Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost)

Transformation:
  Action: Fill White_Blocks with specific colors based on properties.
  Input: Input Grid
  Output: Output Grid (Input grid with some White_Blocks recolored)
  Rules:
    - Preserve all green (3) pixels.
    - For each White_Block:
      - Determine its vertical_band based on Horizontal_Dividers.
      - Determine its horizontal_position_in_band by comparing its left_col/right_col with other blocks in the same band.
      - Apply fill color:
        - If vertical_band is Top:
          - Leftmost -> Red (2)
          - Rightmost -> Yellow (4)
          - Intermediate -> White (0)
        - If vertical_band is Middle:
          - All -> Orange (7)
        - If vertical_band is Bottom:
          - Leftmost -> Blue (1)
          - Rightmost -> Azure (8)
          - Intermediate -> White (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the row indices of all full-width horizontal green (3) lines (Horizontal Dividers). Store these indices.
3.  Iterate through the grid to find all contiguous rectangular blocks composed solely of white (0) pixels. For each block, record its bounding box (top row, bottom row, left column, right column).
4.  For each identified white block:
    a.  Determine its vertical band:
        i.  If its top row is less than the index of the first Horizontal Divider, it's in the "Top" band.
        ii. If its bottom row is greater than the index of the last Horizontal Divider, it's in the "Bottom" band.
        iii. Otherwise, it's in a "Middle" band.
    b.  Determine its horizontal position within its band:
        i.  Find all other white blocks that exist within the same range of rows (i.e., vertically overlap significantly) and belong to the same vertical band.
        ii. Compare the `left_col` of the current block with the `left_col` of all other blocks in its group. If it has the minimum `left_col`, it's the "Leftmost".
        iii. Compare the `right_col` of the current block with the `right_col` of all other blocks in its group. If it has the maximum `right_col`, it's the "Rightmost".
        iv. If it is neither Leftmost nor Rightmost, it's "Intermediate".
    c.  Apply the fill color to the corresponding area in the output grid based on the band and position:
        i.  If in Top band AND Leftmost: Fill with Red (2).
        ii. If in Top band AND Rightmost: Fill with Yellow (4).
        iii. If in Middle band: Fill with Orange (7).
        iv. If in Bottom band AND Leftmost: Fill with Blue (1).
        v. If in Bottom band AND Rightmost: Fill with Azure (8).
        vi. Otherwise (Top/Bottom Intermediate), leave the area as White (0).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
