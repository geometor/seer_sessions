            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids feature a background of white (0) pixels. They contain structural elements made of green (3) pixels: full-width horizontal lines and partial-height vertical lines.\n2.  **Dividers:** The horizontal green lines act as major dividers, splitting the grid into distinct horizontal \"bands\" or sections. The vertical green lines further subdivide these bands into smaller rectangular areas or \"cells\".\n3.  **Target Areas:** The transformation focuses on the rectangular areas composed entirely of white (0) pixels that are enclosed by the green (3) lines or the grid boundaries.\n4.  **Color Filling:** These white areas are selectively filled with new colors in the output grid. The original green structure remains unchanged.\n5.  **Filling Logic:** The color used to fill a white area depends on its vertical position (which band it's in - top, middle, or bottom) and its horizontal position within that band (leftmost, rightmost, or intermediate).\n    *   **Top Band:** The area above the first horizontal green line. The leftmost white block becomes red (2), the rightmost becomes yellow (4).\n    *   **Middle Bands:** Areas between horizontal green lines. All white blocks become orange (7).\n    *   **Bottom Band:** The area below the last horizontal green line. The leftmost white block becomes blue (1), the rightmost becomes azure (8).\n    *   **Intermediate Blocks:** White blocks in the top and bottom bands that are neither the leftmost nor the rightmost remain white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the row indices of all full-width horizontal green (3) lines (Horizontal Dividers). Store these indices.\n3.

If its bottom row is greater than the index of the last Horizontal Divider, it's in the \"Bottom\" band.\n        iii. Otherwise, it's in a \"Middle\" band.\n    b.  Determine its horizontal position within its band:\n        i.  Find all other white blocks that exist within the same range of rows (i.e., vertically overlap significantly) and belong to the same vertical band.\n        ii. Compare the `left_col` of the current block with the `left_col` of all other blocks in its group. If it has the minimum `left_col`, it's the \"Leftmost\".\n        iii. Compare the `right_col` of the current block with the `right_col` of all other blocks in its group. If it has the maximum `right_col`, it's the \"Rightmost\".\n        iv. If it is neither Leftmost nor Rightmost, it's \"Intermediate\".\n    c.  Apply the fill color to the corresponding area in the output grid based on the band and position:\n        i.
