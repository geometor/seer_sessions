Grid:
  Properties:
    - width: Integer
    - height: Integer
  Contains:
    - Pixels
    - Horizontal_Dividers
    - Vertical_Dividers
    - White_Blocks

Pixel:
  Properties:
    - color: Integer (0-9)
    - row: Integer
    - column: Integer

Horizontal_Divider:
  Is: A row composed entirely of green (3) pixels.
  Properties:
    - row_index: Integer
  Function: Divides the grid into vertical bands (Top, Middle, Bottom).

Vertical_Divider:
  Is: A column containing green (3) pixels (not part of a Horizontal_Divider).
  Properties:
    - column_index: Integer
  Function: Subdivides vertical bands into horizontal blocks.

White_Block:
  Is: A contiguous rectangular area of white (0) pixels.
  Bounded_By:
    - Horizontal_Dividers (or top/bottom grid edges)
    - Vertical_Dividers (or left/right grid edges)
  Properties:
    - top_row: Integer
    - bottom_row: Integer
    - left_col: Integer
    - right_col: Integer
    - vertical_band: Enum (Top, Middle, Bottom)
    - horizontal_position_in_band: Enum (Leftmost, Intermediate, Rightmost)

Transformation:
  Action: Fill White_Blocks with specific colors based on properties.
  Input: Input Grid
  Output: Output Grid (Input grid with some White_Blocks recolored)
  Rules:
    - Preserve all green (3) pixels.
    - For each White_Block:
      - Determine its vertical_band based on Horizontal_Dividers.
      - Determine its horizontal_position_in_band by comparing its left_col/right_col with other blocks in the same band.
      - Apply fill color:
        - If vertical_band is Top:
          - Leftmost -> Red (2)
          - Rightmost -> Yellow (4)
          - Intermediate -> White (0)
        - If vertical_band is Middle:
          - All -> Orange (7)
        - If vertical_band is Bottom:
          - Leftmost -> Blue (1)
          - Rightmost -> Azure (8)
          - Intermediate -> White (0)
