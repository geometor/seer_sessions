            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently feature two distinct regions separated by white space:\n    *   An upper region containing various shapes or patterns made of multiple colors. Azure (8) pixels are always present within these upper patterns. Other colors like red (2), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4) also appear but vary between examples.\n    *   A lower region containing a large, solid rectangle of a single color (green, blue, or yellow in the examples), surrounded by a white (0) border.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. It consists of a background color that matches the color of the large rectangle in the lower input region. Overlaid onto this background are azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting two key pieces of information from the input:\n    *   The color and dimensions of the solid rectangle in the lower region (ignoring the surrounding white border). This defines the background color and size of the output grid.\n    *   The locations of the azure (8) pixels within the upper region. These locations are directly mapped onto the output grid.\n4.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   White (0): Acts as a separator and border.\n    *   Azure (8): Represents the foreground pattern to be preserved and transferred.\n    *   Green (3) / Blue (1) / Yellow (4): Act as the background color for the output, determined by the large rectangle in the lower input region.\n    *   Other colors (e.g., Red (2)): Seem to be ignored in the transformation process; they are part of the upper patterns but don't appear in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Background Template:** Scan the input grid to find the largest contiguous rectangular block composed of a single, non-white color located in the lower portion. Identify its color (this will be the `output_background_color`) and its dimensions (this will be the `output_height` and `output_width`). Ignore the surrounding white border when determining dimensions.\n2.  **Create the Output Canvas:** Initialize a new grid with the determined `output_height` and `output_width`, filling all its cells with the `output_background_color`.\n3.  **Identify the Foreground Pattern:** Scan the upper portion of the input grid (typically the area above the background template rectangle and any separating white rows). Find all pixels that have the color Azure (8). Record their row and column coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the input grid.\n4.  **Overlay the Pattern:** For each Azure (8) pixel identified in step 3 at coordinates `(row, column)`, change the color of the pixel at the same coordinates `(row, column)` in the output canvas (created in step 2) to Azure (8).\n5.  **Final Output:** The modified output canvas is the final result."
