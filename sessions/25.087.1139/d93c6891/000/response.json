The size of the grid is preserved in the transformation.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use a limited set of colors: white (0), yellow (4), gray (5), and orange (7). The white pixels generally form the background, while the other colors form distinct regions or objects.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur specifically to pixels with colors gray (5) and orange (7). Yellow (4) and white (0) pixels remain unchanged in all examples.\n4.  **Color Mapping Rule:** There appears to be a consistent mapping rule for the changing colors:\n    *   Every gray (5) pixel in the input becomes a yellow (4) pixel in the output.\n    *   Every orange (7) pixel in the input becomes a gray (5) pixel in the output.\n5.  **Universality:** This rule applies independently to each pixel based solely on its color, regardless of its position or neighbors. The transformation is a simple color substitution applied across the entire grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
