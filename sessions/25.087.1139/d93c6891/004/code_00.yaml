task_description: Pixel-level transformation based on color and neighborhood, involving connectivity.
colors:
  - id: 5
    name: Gray
    transformation: Changes to Yellow (4).
  - id: 7
    name: Orange
    transformation: Conditionally changes to Gray (5).
  - id: 4
    name: Yellow
    role: Output color for transformed Gray pixels.
  - id: 0
    name: White
    role: Background, unchanged.
objects:
  - type: Connected Component
    color: Gray (5)
    role: Source of transformation trigger for adjacent Orange pixels. Identified in the *input* grid.
  - type: Connected Component
    color: Orange (7)
    role: Target of conditional transformation. Identified in the *input* grid.
actions:
  - action: Color Change (Gray to Yellow)
    input_pixels: All Gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
    output_pixels: Corresponding pixels become Yellow (4).
  - action: Color Change (Orange to Gray)
    trigger: An Orange (7) pixel belongs to a connected component (orthogonally adjacent Orange pixels) where at least one pixel in that component is orthogonally adjacent to a Gray (5) pixel in the *original input grid*.
    input_pixels: All Orange (7) pixels belonging to a triggered component.
    output_pixels: Corresponding pixels become Gray (5).
  - action: No Change
    input_pixels: All pixels not matching the above rules (e.g., White, Yellow, non-triggered Orange).
    output_pixels: Remain the same color.
constraints:
  - Adjacency is orthogonal (up, down, left, right).
  - Connectivity check for Orange components uses the original input grid state.
  - Transformation decisions for Orange components depend on adjacency to original Gray pixels, not newly transformed Yellow pixels.
