task_description: Modify pixels based on adjacency to red pixels.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True
  - background_color: white (0) # Predominantly white or unchanged background
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: varies (0-9)
      - location: (row, col)
      - neighbors: set of 8 adjacent pixels (including diagonals)
actions:
  - name: identify_trigger_pixels
    input: input_grid
    criteria: color == 2 (red)
    output: set of locations of red pixels
  - name: identify_target_pixels
    input: input_grid
    criteria: color != 0 (white) and color != 2 (red)
    output: set of locations of potentially changeable pixels
  - name: check_adjacency
    input: target_pixel_location, trigger_pixel_locations
    process: Determine if any trigger pixel location is within the 8 neighbors of the target pixel location.
    output: boolean (is_adjacent_to_red)
  - name: change_color
    input: pixel_location, output_grid
    condition: pixel at location is a target pixel AND is_adjacent_to_red is true
    effect: Change the color of the pixel at the specified location in the output_grid to 4 (yellow).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: target_pixel, trigger_pixel
    condition: target_pixel is one of the 8 neighbors of a trigger_pixel
    effect: Potential color change for the target_pixel.
constants:
  - trigger_color: 2 (red)
  - result_color: 4 (yellow)
  - ignored_colors: [0 (white), 2 (red)]
