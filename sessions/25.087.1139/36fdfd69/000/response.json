The output grids introduce yellow (4).\n2.  **Conservation:** Most pixels retain their original color from input to output. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.\n3.  **Transformation Trigger:** The presence of red (2) pixels seems crucial. Changes only occur in the vicinity of red pixels.\n4.  **Affected Colors:** The color that changes is different in each example (azure, blue, green), but it's never the red (2) or white (0) pixels themselves.\n5.  **Resulting Color:** The changed pixels consistently become yellow (4).\n6.  **Spatial Relationship:** The pixels that change are always adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one red (2) pixel in the input grid.\n7.  **Rule:** It appears that any non-red, non-white pixel that has a red pixel as one of its 8 neighbors is changed to yellow. Pixels that are red, white, or not adjacent to red remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
