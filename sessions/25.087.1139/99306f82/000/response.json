The background is white (0).\n    *   The output grids retain the original frame and the external colored pixels.\n    *   The key transformation happens *inside* the frame: the white area within the frame is filled with colors.\n    *   The filling pattern consists of concentric rectangular layers, shrinking inwards.\n    *   The colors used for filling correspond exactly to the colors of the scattered pixels outside the frame.\n    *   The order of the colored layers (from outermost inwards) is determined by the position of the corresponding external pixels. Specifically, pixels closer to the top-left corner (based on row + column index) provide the colors for the outer layers.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify all non-white pixels located outside this frame's bounding box. These are the 'source' pixels.\n    3.  Create a list of the colors of these source pixels.\n    4.  Sort this list of colors based on the position of their corresponding source pixels: order them by the sum of the row and column index (r + c) of each source pixel, from smallest sum to largest.\n    5.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    6.  Iteratively fill the white interior of the frame, layer by layer, starting from the outermost layer adjacent to the frame itself and moving inwards.\n    7.  For each layer, use the next color from the sorted list created in step 4. The first color in the list fills the first (outermost) layer, the second color fills the second layer, and so on.\n    8.  Continue filling layers inwards until all white pixels within the frame's interior bounding box have been colored.\n    9.  The final grid with the filled frame is the output."
