"""
Identify the largest hollow rectangular frame in the input grid. Note its color and determine its bounding box.
Identify all non-white 'source' pixels located outside this frame's bounding box.
Create a list of the colors of these source pixels.
Sort this list of colors based on the position of their corresponding source pixels: order them by the sum of the row and column index (r + c) of each source pixel, from smallest sum to largest.
Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
Iteratively fill the white interior of the frame, layer by layer, using the sorted colors. The layer index for a pixel (r, c) inside the frame is determined by its minimum distance to the inner boundary of the frame. The color for that layer corresponds to the color at that index in the sorted list.
Continue filling layers inwards until all white pixels within the frame's interior bounding box have been colored or all source colors have been used.
The final grid with the filled frame is the output.
