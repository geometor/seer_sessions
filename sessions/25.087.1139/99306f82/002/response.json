            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully solves Examples 2 and 3 but fails on Example 1. The core logic identifies the rectangular frame, finds external source pixels, sorts their colors based on position (row + column index), and fills the frame's interior in concentric layers.\n\nThe failure in Example 1 occurs at the very center pixel(s). The calculated `layer_index` for this pixel is equal to the number of available source colors. The current code only fills if `layer_index < len(sorted_colors)`, leaving the centermost pixel unfilled (as white) when it should have been filled with the last color in the sorted list.\n\nThe strategy is to adjust the filling logic: if the calculated `layer_index` is greater than or equal to the number of available source colors, the pixel should still be filled using the *last* color from the sorted list. This implies the innermost layers reuse the last available source color.\n\n## Gather Metrics\n\nLet's examine Example 1 where the failure occurred.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   Input Grid Size: 15x15\n*   Frame: Blue (1), Bounding Box (3, 3) to (11, 11)\n*   Interior Bounding Box: (4, 4) to (10, 10)\n*   Source Pixels (r, c, color, r+c):\n    *   (0, 0, 2, 0) -> red\n    *   (1, 1, 6, 2) -> magenta\n    *   (2, 2, 4, 4) -> yellow\n*   Sorted Colors (by r+c): [red (2), magenta (6), yellow (4)]\n*   Number of Source Colors: 3\n*   Interior Pixel Analysis (Expected vs. Actual):\n    *   Layer 0 (Index 0): Pixels with min distance 0 from inner boundary. Expected: red (2). Actual: red (2). Correct.\n    *   Layer 1 (Index 1): Pixels with min distance 1 from inner boundary. Expected: magenta (6). Actual: magenta (6). Correct.\n    *   Layer 2 (Index 2): Pixels with min distance 2 from inner boundary. Expected: yellow (4). Actual: yellow (4). Correct.\n    *   Layer 3 (Index 3): Pixel at (7, 7) with min distance 3 from inner boundary. Expected: yellow (4) (using last available color). Actual: white (0) (index 3 >= length 3, so skipped). **Incorrect.**\n\nWe can use `tool_code` to verify the pixel difference.\n"

Determine its color and the coordinates of its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column). Assume the frame is the largest hollow rectangle or uses the most frequent non-white color. If no such frame exists, return the input grid unchanged.\n2.  **Find Source Pixels:** Identify all non-white pixels that are positioned completely outside the frame's bounding box. Record the color and position (row `r`, column `c`) of each source pixel.\n3.  **Order Source Colors:** Create an ordered list of colors from the identified source pixels. Sort this list based on the position of the corresponding source pixels, specifically using the sum of the row and column index (`r + c`) in ascending order. If there are no source pixels, return the input grid unchanged.\n4.  **Prepare Output Grid:** Create a new grid initially identical to the input grid.\n5.  **Fill Interior:** Iterate through each pixel location (`r`, `c`) within the inner area enclosed by the frame (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves).\n6.  **Check Background:** For each inner pixel, check if its color in the *original* input grid is white (0).\n7.  **Calculate Layer:** If the pixel is white, calculate its 'layer index'. This index is the minimum distance from the pixel (`r`, `c`) to any of the four sides of the *inner* boundary of the frame (i.e., `min(r - inner_min_r, inner_max_r - r, c - inner_min_c, inner_max_c - c)`).\n8.  **Determine Fill Color:** Use the calculated `layer_index` to select a color from the `sorted_color_list` created in step 3. If the `layer_index` is greater than or equal to the number of colors in the list, use the *last* color in the list. Otherwise, use the color at the index matching the `layer_index`.\n9.  **Update Output Grid:** Set the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to the fill color determined in the previous step.\n10. **Return Result:** After checking and potentially filling all pixels within the frame's interior, return the modified output grid."
