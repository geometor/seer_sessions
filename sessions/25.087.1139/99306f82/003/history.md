"""
Identify the largest hollow rectangular frame in the input grid. Note its color and determine its bounding box.
Identify all non-white 'source' pixels located outside this frame's bounding box.
Create a list of the colors of these source pixels.
Sort this list of colors based on the position of their corresponding source pixels: order them by the sum of the row and column index (r + c) of each source pixel, from smallest sum to largest.
Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
Iteratively fill the white interior of the frame, layer by layer, using the sorted colors. The layer index for a pixel (r, c) inside the frame is determined by its minimum distance to the inner boundary of the frame. The color for that layer corresponds to the color at that index in the sorted list.
Continue filling layers inwards until all white pixels within the frame's interior bounding box have been colored or all source colors have been used.
The final grid with the filled frame is the output.

## General Assessment

The provided code successfully solves Examples 2 and 3 but fails on Example 1. The core logic identifies the rectangular frame, finds external source pixels, sorts their colors based on position (row + column index), and fills the frame's interior in concentric layers.

The failure in Example 1 occurs at the very center pixel(s). The calculated `layer_index` for this pixel is equal to the number of available source colors. The current code only fills if `layer_index < len(sorted_colors)`, leaving the centermost pixel unfilled (as white) when it should have been filled with the last color in the sorted list.

The strategy is to adjust the filling logic: if the calculated `layer_index` is greater than or equal to the number of available source colors, the pixel should still be filled using the *last* color from the sorted list. This implies the innermost layers reuse the last available source color.

## Gather Metrics

Let's examine Example 1 where the failure occurred.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

*   Input Grid Size: 15x15
*   Frame: Blue (1), Bounding Box (3, 3) to (11, 11)
*   Interior Bounding Box: (4, 4) to (10, 10)
*   Source Pixels (r, c, color, r+c):
    *   (0, 0, 2, 0) -> red
    *   (1, 1, 6, 2) -> magenta
    *   (2, 2, 4, 4) -> yellow
*   Sorted Colors (by r+c): [red (2), magenta (6), yellow (4)]
*   Number of Source Colors: 3
*   Interior Pixel Analysis (Expected vs. Actual):
    *   Layer 0 (Index 0): Pixels with min distance 0 from inner boundary. Expected: red (2). Actual: red (2). Correct.
    *   Layer 1 (Index 1): Pixels with min distance 1 from inner boundary. Expected: magenta (6). Actual: magenta (6). Correct.
    *   Layer 2 (Index 2): Pixels with min distance 2 from inner boundary. Expected: yellow (4). Actual: yellow (4). Correct.
    *   Layer 3 (Index 3): Pixel at (7, 7) with min distance 3 from inner boundary. Expected: yellow (4) (using last available color). Actual: white (0) (index 3 >= length 3, so skipped). **Incorrect.**

We can use `tool_code` to verify the pixel difference.

outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Number of different pixels: 1
Difference at (7, 7): Expected=4, Actual=0
Calculated layer_index for (7, 7): 3
Number of source colors: 3
Condition check in current code (layer_index < num_colors): False

```
The code execution confirms the analysis: the single differing pixel is at (7, 7). The expected color is 4 (yellow), but the actual output is 0 (white). The calculated `layer_index` for this pixel is 3. Since the number of source colors is also 3, the condition `layer_index < num_colors` (i.e., `3 < 3`) evaluates to `False`, causing the code to skip filling this pixel.

      description: A hollow rectangular object made of a single, non-white color. Assumed to be the largest such object, or potentially the one made of the most frequent non-white color.
      properties:
        - color: The single color forming the frame.

  output_features:
    - name: filled_frame
      description: The output grid is a copy of the input grid, but the interior of the frame is filled.
      properties:
        - filling_pattern: Concentric layers, starting from the frame's inner boundary and moving inwards.
        - layer_color_source: A sequence of colors derived from the source_pixels.
        - layer_color_order: Source pixel colors are sorted based on their sort_key (ascending r + c).
        - layer_assignment: Pixels in the frame's interior are assigned a layer index based on their minimum distance to the inner boundary of the frame (Manhattan distance to the closest inner edge pixel). Layer 0 is adjacent to the frame, Layer 1 is next, etc.
        - color_mapping: The color for a layer is determined by the color at the corresponding index in the sorted source color sequence.
        - innermost_layer_rule: If the calculated layer index for a pixel is greater than or equal to the number of available source colors, the pixel is colored with the *last* color in the sorted sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate the hollow rectangular frame in the input grid. Determine its color and the coordinates of its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column). Assume the frame is the largest hollow rectangle or uses the most frequent non-white color. If no such frame exists, return the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Find Source Pixels:** Identify all non-white pixels that are positioned completely outside the frame's bounding box. Record the color and position (row `r`, column `c`) of each source pixel.
3.  **Order Source Colors:** Create an ordered list of colors from the identified source pixels. Sort this list based on the position of the corresponding source pixels, specifically using the sum of the row and column index (`r + c`) in ascending order. If there are no source pixels, return the input grid unchanged.
4.  **Prepare Output Grid:** Create a new grid initially identical to the input grid.
5.  **Fill Interior:** Iterate through each pixel location (`r`, `c`) within the inner area enclosed by the frame (i.e., excluding the frame pixels themselves).
6.  **Check Background:** For each inner pixel, check if its color in the *original* input grid is white (0).
7.  **Calculate Layer:** If the pixel is white, calculate its 'layer index'. This index is the minimum distance from the pixel (`r`, `c`) to any of the four sides of the *inner* boundary of the frame (i.e., `min(r - inner_min_r, inner_max_r - r, c - inner_min_c, inner_max_c - c)`).
8.  **Determine Fill Color:** Use the calculated `layer_index` to select a color from the `sorted_color_list` created in step 3. If the `layer_index` is greater than or equal to the number of colors in the list, use the *last* color in the list. Otherwise, use the color at the index matching the `layer_index`.
9.  **Update Output Grid:** Set the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to the fill color determined in the previous step.
10. **Return Result:** After checking and potentially filling all pixels within the frame's interior, return the modified output grid.
