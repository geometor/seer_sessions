Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9, mapped to colors. The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Key Colors/Objects:** The significant pixels are blue (1), red (2), green (3), and orange (7). These appear as sparse single pixels on the white background.
3.  **Relationships:** There seems to be a pairing relationship: blue (1) is associated with orange (7), and red (2) is associated with green (3).
4.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   Blue (1) and red (2) pixels remain in their original positions in the output grid.
    *   Orange (7) and green (3) pixels associated with blue (1) and red (2) respectively seem to *move* from their original positions to positions adjacent to their corresponding blue or red pixel.
    *   Specifically, for each blue pixel, the two *closest* orange pixels (using Manhattan distance, with top-down, left-right scan order for tie-breaking) are moved to the positions directly above and directly below the blue pixel.
    *   Similarly, for each red pixel, the two *closest* green pixels are moved to the positions directly to the left and directly below the red pixel.
    *   All original orange and green pixels disappear from the output grid; only the ones moved to the new adjacent positions appear, along with the original blue and red pixels. All other pixels become white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    role: center_element
  - type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: center_element
  - type: pixel
    color: orange (7)
    role: partner_element
    associated_center: blue (1)
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    role: partner_element
    associated_center: red (2)
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    role: background

Properties:
  - Center elements (blue, red) have fixed positions between input and output.
  - Partner elements (orange, green) have variable positions.
  - Each center element is associated with partner elements of a specific color.
  - Each center element seems to interact with exactly two of its associated partner elements.

Actions:
  - Identify all blue (1) and red (2) pixels (centers).
  - Identify all orange (7) and green (3) pixels (partners).
  - For each center pixel:
    - Calculate Manhattan distances to all partner pixels of the associated color.
    - Select the two partner pixels with the smallest distances (using top-down, left-right scan order for tie-breaking).
  - Create a new grid initialized to white (0).
  - Place the center pixels in the new grid at their original coordinates.
  - For each blue center at (r, c), place its selected orange partners at (r-1, c) and (r+1, c).
  - For each red center at (r, c), place its selected green partners at (r, c-1) and (r+1, c).

Relationships:
  - Proximity: The selection of partner elements depends on their Manhattan distance to the center element.
  - Association: Blue (1) is paired with Orange (7); Red (2) is paired with Green (3).
  - Adjacency: Partner elements are moved to specific adjacent positions relative to their center element based on the center element's color.
    - Blue center -> Above & Below neighbors.
    - Red center -> Left & Below neighbors.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Identify the locations of all blue pixels (1) and red pixels (2) in the input grid. These are the "center" pixels.
3.  Identify the locations of all orange pixels (7) and green pixels (3) in the input grid. These are the "partner" pixels.
4.  For each blue center pixel found at coordinates `(r, c)`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from this blue pixel to every orange partner pixel in the input grid.
    b.  Select the two orange partner pixels with the smallest Manhattan distances. If there are ties for the second-closest distance, choose the one that appears first when scanning the input grid row by row from top to bottom, and column by column from left to right within each row.
    c.  Place the blue pixel itself at `(r, c)` in the output grid.
    d.  Place an orange pixel (7) at `(r-1, c)` (above) and another orange pixel (7) at `(r+1, c)` (below) in the output grid. (Ensure these coordinates are within the grid boundaries).
5.  For each red center pixel found at coordinates `(r, c)`:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance from this red pixel to every green partner pixel in the input grid.
    b.  Select the two green partner pixels with the smallest Manhattan distances, using the same tie-breaking rule (scan order) as for the blue pixels.
    c.  Place the red pixel itself at `(r, c)` in the output grid.
    d.  Place a green pixel (3) at `(r, c-1)` (left) and another green pixel (3) at `(r+1, c)` (below) in the output grid. (Ensure these coordinates are within the grid boundaries).
6.  The final output grid contains only the placed center pixels and their newly positioned partner pixels; all other cells remain white (0).
