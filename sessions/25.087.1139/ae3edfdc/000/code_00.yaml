Properties:
  - Center elements (blue, red) have fixed positions between input and output.
  - Partner elements (orange, green) have variable positions.
  - Each center element is associated with partner elements of a specific color.
  - Each center element seems to interact with exactly two of its associated partner elements.

Actions:
  - Identify all blue (1) and red (2) pixels (centers).
  - Identify all orange (7) and green (3) pixels (partners).
  - For each center pixel:
    - Calculate Manhattan distances to all partner pixels of the associated color.
    - Select the two partner pixels with the smallest distances (using top-down, left-right scan order for tie-breaking).
  - Create a new grid initialized to white (0).
  - Place the center pixels in the new grid at their original coordinates.
  - For each blue center at (r, c), place its selected orange partners at (r-1, c) and (r+1, c).
  - For each red center at (r, c), place its selected green partners at (r, c-1) and (r+1, c).

Relationships:
  - Proximity: The selection of partner elements depends on their Manhattan distance to the center element.
  - Association: Blue (1) is paired with Orange (7); Red (2) is paired with Green (3).
  - Adjacency: Partner elements are moved to specific adjacent positions relative to their center element based on the center element's color.
    - Blue center -> Above & Below neighbors.
    - Red center -> Left & Below neighbors.
