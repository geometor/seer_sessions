Transformation rule:
1. Identify the locations of all blue (1) and red (2) pixels ("center" pixels) in the input grid.
2. Count the total number of orange (7) pixels (N_orange) and green (3) pixels (N_green) in the input grid.
3. Define the relative neighbor positions in scan order: Up (-1, 0), Left (0, -1), Right (0, +1), Down (+1, 0). Let's call this list RELATIVE_POSITIONS.
4. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
5. For each blue center pixel found at (r, c):
    a. Place the blue pixel (1) at (r, c) in the output grid.
    b. Take the first N_orange positions from the RELATIVE_POSITIONS list (where N_orange is the count from step 2, max 4).
    c. For each selected relative position (dr, dc) from step 5b:
        i. Calculate the target coordinate (tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
        ii. If (tr, tc) is within the grid boundaries, place an orange pixel (7) at (tr, tc) in the output grid.
6. For each red center pixel found at (r, c):
    a. Place the red pixel (2) at (r, c) in the output grid.
    b. Take the first N_green positions from the RELATIVE_POSITIONS list (where N_green is the count from step 2, max 4).
    c. For each selected relative position (dr, dc) from step 6b:
        i. Calculate the target coordinate (tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
        ii. If (tr, tc) is within the grid boundaries, place a green pixel (3) at (tr, tc) in the output grid.
7. Return the resulting output grid. Note: If multiple centers try to place a partner pixel at the same location, the one processed later will overwrite the earlier one (standard iteration order: blue centers first, then red centers). This seems consistent with the examples where centers are far apart.

## General Assessment

The previous code failed on Examples 1 and 3 because it incorrectly determined which neighboring positions should be colored with the partner color (orange or green). The assumption was that the *first N* neighbors in a fixed scan order (Up, Left, Right, Down) should be used, where N is the count of the partner color pixels in the input.

The analysis of all three examples reveals a different pattern: the *count* (N) of partner pixels determines a *specific subset* of the four cardinal neighbors, not just the first N. The mapping appears consistent across all examples. The original positions of the partner pixels in the input grid seem irrelevant for determining the output pattern; only their total count matters. The refined hypothesis successfully predicts the output partner locations for all three examples.

The strategy is to update the natural language program and the subsequent code to implement this count-based selection of specific neighbor positions.

## Metrics

The code execution provides detailed metrics for each example, confirming the refined hypothesis. Key observations across all examples:

*   **Center Persistence:** Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels in the input ('centers') retain their exact positions in the output grid.
*   **Partner Count:** The number of orange (7) pixels (`n_orange`) and green (3) pixels (`n_green`) in the input grid dictates the number and pattern of respective partner pixels in the output grid.
*   **Partner Placement:**
    *   Orange pixels are placed adjacent (cardinal directions) to blue centers.
    *   Green pixels are placed adjacent (cardinal directions) to red centers.
*   **Placement Pattern Mapping:** The specific adjacent positions used depend on the count (N) of the corresponding partner color in the input:
    *   N=1: Uses Up `[(-1, 0)]`
    *   N=2: Uses Left, Down `[(0, -1), (1, 0)]`
    *   N=3: Uses Up, Right, Down `[(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]`
    *   N=4: Uses Up, Left, Right, Down `[(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)]`
*   **Input Partner Location Irrelevance:** The original locations of orange and green pixels in the input do not influence the relative positions used in the output pattern.
*   **Output Grid:** The output grid starts blank (white/0) and is populated only with the center pixels and their determined partner pixels.

The `*_match` fields in the metrics confirm that the calculated `expected_*_out_hypothesis` based on this refined rule matches the actual `*_pixels_out` for all examples.

    inputs: [input_grid_shape, blue_centers_in, red_centers_in, N_orange, N_green, offset_map_logic]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    steps:
      - Initialize output_grid with background color (white).
      - Place blue centers at their original input locations.
      - Determine orange offsets using N_orange and offset_map_logic.
      - For each blue center, place orange pixels at calculated offset locations (within bounds).
      - Place red centers at their original input locations.
      - Determine green offsets using N_green and offset_map_logic.
      - For each red center, place green pixels at calculated offset locations (within bounds).

assumptions:
  - Center pixels (blue/red) do not overlap in the input.
  - Partner pixels (orange/green) only influence the pattern through their count, not their specific location.
  - The maximum count of partner pixels influencing the pattern is 4. Counts > 4 might follow the N=4 pattern or be undefined.
  - Pixel placement overwrites previous values if multiple placements target the same cell (though not observed in examples due to separation). Standard processing order (e.g., blue centers first, then red) applies.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the locations of all blue pixels (1) and red pixels (2) in the input grid. These are the 'center' pixels.
3.  Count the total number of orange pixels (7) in the input grid (`N_orange`).
4.  Count the total number of green pixels (3) in the input grid (`N_green`).
5.  Define a mapping from the count `N` (where `N` is `N_orange` or `N_green`, assumed to be between 1 and 4) to a specific set of relative neighbor positions (offsets):
    *   N=1: `[Up (-1, 0)]`
    *   N=2: `[Left (0, -1), Down (1, 0)]`
    *   N=3: `[Up (-1, 0), Right (0, 1), Down (1, 0)]`
    *   N=4: `[Up (-1, 0), Left (0, -1), Right (0, 1), Down (1, 0)]`
6.  Determine the list of relative offsets to use for orange partners based on `N_orange` using the mapping from step 5.
7.  For each blue center pixel location `(r, c)` identified in step 2:
    a.  Place a blue pixel (1) at `(r, c)` in the output grid.
    b.  For each relative offset `(dr, dc)` determined in step 6:
        i.  Calculate the target coordinate `(tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc)`.
        ii. If `(tr, tc)` is within the boundaries of the grid, place an orange pixel (7) at `(tr, tc)` in the output grid.
8.  Determine the list of relative offsets to use for green partners based on `N_green` using the mapping from step 5.
9.  For each red center pixel location `(r, c)` identified in step 2:
    a.  Place a red pixel (2) at `(r, c)` in the output grid.
    b.  For each relative offset `(dr, dc)` determined in step 8:
        i.  Calculate the target coordinate `(tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc)`.
        ii. If `(tr, tc)` is within the boundaries of the grid, place a green pixel (3) at `(tr, tc)` in the output grid.
10. Return the final output grid.
