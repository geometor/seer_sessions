            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed on Examples 1 and 3 because it incorrectly determined which neighboring positions should be colored with the partner color (orange or green). The assumption was that the *first N* neighbors in a fixed scan order (Up, Left, Right, Down) should be used, where N is the count of the partner color pixels in the input.\n\nThe analysis of all three examples reveals a different pattern: the *count* (N) of partner pixels determines a *specific subset* of the four cardinal neighbors, not just the first N. The mapping appears consistent across all examples. The original positions of the partner pixels in the input grid seem irrelevant for determining the output pattern; only their total count matters. The refined hypothesis successfully predicts the output partner locations for all three examples.\n\nThe strategy is to update the natural language program and the subsequent code to implement this count-based selection of specific neighbor positions.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe code execution provides detailed metrics for each example, confirming the refined hypothesis. Key observations across all examples:\n\n*   **Center Persistence:** Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels in the input ('centers') retain their exact positions in the output grid.\n*   **Partner Count:** The number of orange (7) pixels (`n_orange`) and green (3) pixels (`n_green`) in the input grid dictates the number and pattern of respective partner pixels in the output grid.\n*   **Partner Placement:**\n    *   Orange pixels are placed adjacent (cardinal directions) to blue centers.\n    *   Green pixels are placed adjacent (cardinal directions) to red centers.\n*   **Placement Pattern Mapping:** The specific adjacent positions used depend on the count (N) of the corresponding partner color in the input:\n    *   N=1: Uses Up `[(-1, 0)]`\n    *   N=2: Uses Left, Down `[(0, -1), (1, 0)]`\n    *   N=3: Uses Up, Right, Down `[(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]`\n    *   N=4: Uses Up, Left, Right, Down `[(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)]`\n*   **Input Partner Location Irrelevance:** The original locations of orange and green pixels in the input do not influence the relative positions used in the output pattern.\n*   **Output Grid:** The output grid starts blank (white/0) and is populated only with the center pixels and their determined partner pixels.\n\nThe `*_match` fields in the metrics confirm that the calculated `expected_*_out_hypothesis` based on this refined rule matches the actual `*_pixels_out` for all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
