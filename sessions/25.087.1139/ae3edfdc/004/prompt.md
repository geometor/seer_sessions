Transformation rule:
1. Identify the locations of all blue (1) and red (2) pixels ("center" pixels) in the input grid.
2. Count the total number of orange (7) pixels (N_orange) and green (3) pixels (N_green) in the input grid.
3. Define the relative neighbor positions in scan order: Up (-1, 0), Left (0, -1), Right (0, +1), Down (+1, 0). Let's call this list RELATIVE_POSITIONS.
4. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
5. For each blue center pixel found at (r, c):
    a. Place the blue pixel (1) at (r, c) in the output grid.
    b. Take the first N_orange positions from the RELATIVE_POSITIONS list (where N_orange is the count from step 2, max 4).
    c. For each selected relative position (dr, dc) from step 5b:
        i. Calculate the target coordinate (tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
        ii. If (tr, tc) is within the grid boundaries, place an orange pixel (7) at (tr, tc) in the output grid.
6. For each red center pixel found at (r, c):
    a. Place the red pixel (2) at (r, c) in the output grid.
    b. Take the first N_green positions from the RELATIVE_POSITIONS list (where N_green is the count from step 2, max 4).
    c. For each selected relative position (dr, dc) from step 6b:
        i. Calculate the target coordinate (tr, tc) = (r + dr, c + dc).
        ii. If (tr, tc) is within the grid boundaries, place a green pixel (3) at (tr, tc) in the output grid.
7. Return the resulting output grid. Note: If multiple centers try to place a partner pixel at the same location, the one processed later will overwrite the earlier one (standard iteration order: blue centers first, then red centers). This seems consistent with the examples where centers are far apart.
