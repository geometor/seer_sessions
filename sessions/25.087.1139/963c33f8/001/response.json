Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (orange, 7).\n2. Copy all static gray (5) pixels from their original positions in the input grid to the output grid. These act as obstacles.\n3. Identify all 'falling' pixels (blue, 1 and maroon, 9) from the input grid, noting their original row, column, and color.\n4. Process the falling pixels in a specific order: first by column index (ascending, left-to-right), and then by original row index (descending, bottom-to-top). This ensures that pixels lower down in a column land before pixels higher up in the same column are processed.\n5. For each falling pixel:\n    a. Simulate its fall straight down from its original row in its column.\n    b. Check the cell immediately below the current position in the output grid.\n    c. If the cell below is within the grid boundaries and is empty (orange, 7), the pixel continues to fall to that cell. Repeat step 5b.\n    d. If the cell below is occupied (gray, 5, or another already-landed falling pixel) or if the pixel reaches the bottom edge of the grid, the fall stops.\n    e. Place the falling pixel's color in its final calculated position (the last empty cell it occupied before stopping) in the output grid. This position now becomes an obstacle for subsequent falling pixels.\n6. Return the final output grid containing the static gray pixels and the landed blue and maroon pixels on the orange background.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies gravity to blue (1) and maroon (9) pixels, making them fall\n    downwards until they hit a gray (5) pixel, another fallen pixel, or the\n    bottom of the grid.
