The metrics confirm the hypothesis:
*   Examples 1 & 2 have rectangles with origins (top-left corners) where `r+c` is even. The transformation rule applied `(r+c)%2 == 0 -> 0` to the interior.
*   Example 3 has rectangles with origins where `r+c` is odd. The expected output corresponds to applying `(r+c)%2 != 0 -> 0` to the interior.

The key insight is that the checkerboard pattern's 'phase' depends on the parity of the sum of the coordinates of the rectangle's top-left corner.

**Refined Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all solid, axis-aligned, maximal rectangles composed of a single non-white color.
2.  For each identified rectangle:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c) and its color.
    b.  Determine the parity of the top-left corner: `origin_parity = (min_r + min_c) % 2`.
    c.  Iterate through the *interior* pixels of the rectangle. The interior includes rows from `min_r + 1` to `max_r - 1` and columns from `min_c + 1` to `max_c - 1`.
    d.  For each interior pixel at position (r, c):
        i.  Calculate the parity of the pixel's coordinates: `pixel_parity = (r + c) % 2`.
        ii. If `origin_parity` is 0 (even): If `pixel_parity` is 0 (even), change the pixel's color to white (0).
        iii. If `origin_parity` is 1 (odd): If `pixel_parity` is 1 (odd), change the pixel's color to white (0).
3.  Leave all background pixels (white) and border pixels of the rectangles unchanged.
4.  Return the modified grid.

This revised program accounts for the pattern difference observed in Example 3 while remaining consistent with Examples 1 and 2.## General Assessment

The provided code successfully implemented the initial interpretation of the task based on the first example: finding solid rectangles and applying a fixed checkerboard pattern (r+c even -> white) to their interiors. However, testing against further examples, specifically Example 3, revealed this interpretation was incomplete. The `Transformed Output` for Example 3 significantly differs from the `Expected Output`, indicating the checkerboard pattern application logic needs refinement.

The core issue appears to be that the checkerboard rule is not fixed but depends on some property of the rectangle itself. The significant number of pixel differences in Example 3 suggests the pattern applied by the code was the inverse of the required pattern for the rectangles in that specific example.

## Strategy for Resolution

1.  **Analyze Failure Case (Example 3):** Compare the `Transformed Output` and `Expected Output` for Example 3 in detail, focusing on the interior patterns of the rectangles.
2.  **Identify Pattern Variation:** Determine what property of the rectangles in Example 3 causes the checkerboard pattern to differ from Examples 1 and 2.
3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule for applying the checkerboard pattern that accounts for this variation. Based on preliminary analysis, the parity (even/odd sum) of the coordinates of the top-left corner of each rectangle seems crucial.
4.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the new hypothesis against all training examples (1, 2, and 3) to ensure consistency.
5.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the natural language program and facts based on the confirmed hypothesis.

## Facts


```yaml
background_color: 0 (white)
input_output_grid_size_preservation: true
objects:
  - type: solid_rectangle
    properties:
      - color (non-white)
      - bounding_box (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)
      - origin (top-left corner: min_r, min_c)
      - origin_coordinate_sum_parity ((min_r + min_c) % 2)
      - has_interior (height > 2 and width > 2)
      - border_pixels
      - interior_pixels
actions:
  - name: find_solid_rectangles
    input: input_grid
    output: list of solid_rectangle objects
  - name: apply_checkerboard_pattern
    target: interior_pixels of each solid_rectangle object that has_interior
    condition: depends on the rectangle's origin_coordinate_sum_parity
    effect:
      - if origin_coordinate_sum_parity is 'even':
          change interior_pixel color to white (0) if (pixel_r + pixel_c) % 2 is 'even'
      - if origin_coordinate_sum_parity is 'odd':
          change interior_pixel color to white (0) if (pixel_r + pixel_c) % 2 is 'odd'
    unchanged:
      - border_pixels of rectangles
      - background_pixels (pixels not part of any identified solid rectangle)
      - rectangles without an interior (height <= 2 or width <= 2)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous, solid, axis-aligned rectangular blocks composed of a single non-white color in the input grid. Record their bounding boxes (top-left corner `min_r`, `min_c` and bottom-right corner `max_r`, `max_c`) and their original color.
3.  For each identified rectangle:
    a.  Check if the rectangle has an interior (i.e., if its height `max_r - min_r + 1` is greater than 2 AND its width `max_c - min_c + 1` is greater than 2).
    b.  If an interior exists:
        i.  Calculate the parity of the sum of the coordinates of the rectangle's top-left corner: `origin_parity = (min_r + min_c) % 2`.
        ii. Iterate through each pixel coordinate `(r, c)` within the rectangle's *interior* (rows from `min_r + 1` to `max_r - 1`, columns from `min_c + 1` to `max_c - 1`).
        iii. Calculate the parity of the sum of the current pixel's coordinates: `pixel_parity = (r + c) % 2`.
        iv. If `pixel_parity` matches `origin_parity`, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to white (0). Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color (copied from the input).
    c.  If no interior exists (height or width is 2 or less), make no changes to the pixels belonging to this rectangle in the output grid.
4.  Pixels not belonging to any identified solid rectangle (background pixels) remain unchanged in the output grid.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
