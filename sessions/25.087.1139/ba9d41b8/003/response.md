"""
Identifies solid, non-white rectangular blocks in the input grid. 
For each identified rectangle that has an interior (height > 2 and width > 2), 
it applies a checkerboard pattern to its interior pixels (pixels not on the border). 
The specific checkerboard pattern depends on the parity of the sum of the coordinates 
of the rectangle's top-left corner (origin). 
If the origin's coordinate sum (min_r + min_c) is even, interior pixels at (r, c) 
where r + c is also even are changed to white (0). 
If the origin's coordinate sum is odd, interior pixels at (r, c) where r + c is 
also odd are changed to white (0). 
Pixels on the border of the rectangles, pixels in rectangles without an interior, 
and background pixels remain unchanged.
