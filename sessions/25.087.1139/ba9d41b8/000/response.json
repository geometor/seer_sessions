The outermost single-pixel border of each rectangle remains unchanged. However, the interior pixels of each rectangle are modified.\n4.  **Pattern:** Within the interior of each rectangle, a checkerboard pattern is introduced. Specifically, pixels whose global row and column indices `(r, c)` sum to an even number (`r + c` is even) are changed to white (0). Pixels where `r + c` is odd retain their original block color.\n5.  **Object Identification:** The core objects are the solid rectangular blocks of color. The transformation operates independently on the interior of each block.\n6.  **Background:** The white background pixels (color 0) are unaffected by the transformation.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

If the pixel `(r, c)` is identified as being in the interior of a block:\n    a.  Calculate the sum of its coordinates: `s = r + c`.\n    b.
