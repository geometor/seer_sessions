Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a white background (color 0) upon which one or more solid, axis-aligned rectangular blocks of uniform, non-white colors are placed.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the same overall structure, including the white background and the positions/colors of the rectangular blocks.
3.  **Transformation:** The key change occurs *inside* the non-white rectangular blocks. The outermost single-pixel border of each rectangle remains unchanged. However, the interior pixels of each rectangle are modified.
4.  **Pattern:** Within the interior of each rectangle, a checkerboard pattern is introduced. Specifically, pixels whose global row and column indices `(r, c)` sum to an even number (`r + c` is even) are changed to white (0). Pixels where `r + c` is odd retain their original block color.
5.  **Object Identification:** The core objects are the solid rectangular blocks of color. The transformation operates independently on the interior of each block.
6.  **Background:** The white background pixels (color 0) are unaffected by the transformation.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Apply a checkerboard pattern to the interior of solid colored rectangles.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - elements: Solid, axis-aligned rectangles of uniform non-white colors.

objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - shape: solid rectangle
      - location: defined by bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
    parts:
      - border: The single-pixel-thick outermost frame of the rectangle.
      - interior: Pixels within the rectangle's bounding box, excluding the border.
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - location: all pixels not part of a colored rectangle.

actions:
  - name: identify_rectangles
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of the same non-white color that form solid rectangles. Determine their bounding boxes and original color.
  - name: apply_checkerboard_to_interior
    description: For each identified rectangle, modify its interior pixels based on their global coordinates.
    target: interior pixels of each rectangle
    rule:
      - condition: The sum of the pixel's global row index `r` and column index `c` (`r + c`) is even.
      - effect: Change the pixel's color to white (0).
      - condition: The sum `r + c` is odd.
      - effect: Keep the pixel's original color.
  - name: preserve_border
    description: Ensure the border pixels of each rectangle remain unchanged.
    target: border pixels of each rectangle
  - name: preserve_background
    description: Ensure the background pixels remain unchanged.
    target: background pixels

relationships:
  - The checkerboard pattern application is constrained to the interior of identified rectangles.
  - The pattern depends on the absolute row and column indices of the pixels within the grid.
  - The transformation preserves the original grid size, background, and rectangle borders.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct, solid, non-white (color 1-9) rectangular blocks in the input grid. For each block, record its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) and its original color.
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the grid.
4.  For the current pixel `(r, c)`, determine if it belongs to the *interior* of any identified rectangular block. A pixel is in the interior if it's within the block's bounding box but *not* on its border (i.e., `r` is not the min/max row and `c` is not the min/max column of that block).
5.  If the pixel `(r, c)` is identified as being in the interior of a block:
    a.  Calculate the sum of its coordinates: `s = r + c`.
    b.  If `s` is an even number, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to white (0).
    c.  If `s` is an odd number, the pixel in the output grid retains its original color (which was copied in step 1).
6.  If the pixel `(r, c)` is *not* in the interior of any block (meaning it's either part of a block's border or part of the background), its color in the output grid remains unchanged from the initial copy.
7.  Return the modified output grid.
