task_description: Apply a checkerboard pattern to the interior of solid colored rectangles.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - elements: Solid, axis-aligned rectangles of uniform non-white colors.

objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - shape: solid rectangle
      - location: defined by bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
    parts:
      - border: The single-pixel-thick outermost frame of the rectangle.
      - interior: Pixels within the rectangle's bounding box, excluding the border.
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - location: all pixels not part of a colored rectangle.

actions:
  - name: identify_rectangles
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of the same non-white color that form solid rectangles. Determine their bounding boxes and original color.
  - name: apply_checkerboard_to_interior
    description: For each identified rectangle, modify its interior pixels based on their global coordinates.
    target: interior pixels of each rectangle
    rule:
      - condition: The sum of the pixel's global row index `r` and column index `c` (`r + c`) is even.
      - effect: Change the pixel's color to white (0).
      - condition: The sum `r + c` is odd.
      - effect: Keep the pixel's original color.
  - name: preserve_border
    description: Ensure the border pixels of each rectangle remain unchanged.
    target: border pixels of each rectangle
  - name: preserve_background
    description: Ensure the background pixels remain unchanged.
    target: background pixels

relationships:
  - The checkerboard pattern application is constrained to the interior of identified rectangles.
  - The pattern depends on the absolute row and column indices of the pixels within the grid.
  - The transformation preserves the original grid size, background, and rectangle borders.
