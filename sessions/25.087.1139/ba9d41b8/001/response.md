"""
Identifies solid, non-white rectangular blocks in the input grid. 
For each identified rectangle, it applies a checkerboard pattern to its interior pixels 
(pixels not on the border). The checkerboard pattern changes pixels at positions (r, c) 
where the sum r + c is even to white (0), while leaving pixels where r + c is odd 
unchanged (retaining the original block color). 
The border pixels of the rectangles and the background pixels remain unchanged.
