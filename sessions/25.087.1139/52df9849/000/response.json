Pixels belonging to the object with the lower numerical color value are changed to the color of the adjacent object if that object's color value is higher. The object with the higher color value appears to \"overwrite\" or \"take precedence\" over the object with the lower color value at the points of adjacency. Pixels not involved in such interactions (background pixels or pixels of non-background objects only adjacent to the background or pixels of the same color) remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid. Let its color be `C`.\n4.  If `C` is the background color, keep the color `C` at `(r, c)` in the output grid and proceed to the next pixel.\n5.  If `C` is *not* the background color, examine its 8 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n6.  Find the maximum color value among these neighbors, considering only colors that are *not* the background color and *not* equal to `C`. Let this maximum neighboring color value be `Max_Neighbor_Color`. If no such neighbor exists, consider `Max_Neighbor_Color` to be less than any valid color value (e.g., -1).\n7.  Compare `C` with `Max_Neighbor_Color`. If `Max_Neighbor_Color` is greater than `C`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to `Max_Neighbor_Color`.\n8.  Otherwise (if `C` is greater than or equal to `Max_Neighbor_Color`, or if no relevant neighbors were found), keep the color `C` at `(r, c)` in the output grid.\n9.  After iterating through all pixels, the modified grid is the final output."
