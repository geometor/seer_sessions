  background_color: 7 # orange (appears consistent across examples)
objects:
  - type: contiguous_pixel_group
    attributes:
      - color: non-background_color
      - shape: variable (rectangle, line)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    scope: 8-connectivity (includes diagonals)
    between: pixels_of_different_non_background_colors
actions:
  - name: resolve_color_conflict
    condition: pixel_color_A is adjacent to pixel_color_B, where A and B are different non-background colors.
    rule: If value(B) > value(A), change pixel_A's color to B. Otherwise, pixel_A remains color A.
    effect: Pixels with lower color values at the boundary are replaced by the adjacent higher color value.
invariants:
  - background_pixels: remain unchanged
  - higher_value_pixels_at_boundary: remain unchanged
