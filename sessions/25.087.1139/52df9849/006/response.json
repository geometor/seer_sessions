            "text": "**Metrics Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 16x16 grid. Colors: blue (1), yellow (4), orange (7 - background). Counts: blue=35, yellow=16, orange=205.\n    *   Output: 16x16 grid. Colors: same. Counts: blue=27, yellow=24, orange=205.\n    *   Change: 8 blue pixels changed to yellow. These are the blue pixels adjacent to the initial yellow object.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 16x16 grid. Colors: gray (5), orange (7 - background), maroon (9). Counts: gray=11, orange=236, maroon=9.\n    *   Output: 16x16 grid. Colors: same. Counts: gray=10, orange=236, maroon=10.\n    *   Change: 1 gray pixel changed to maroon. This is the gray pixel at the intersection with the maroon line.\n\nThe metrics confirm the visual analysis: the number of pixels changing color corresponds to the pixels at the initial boundary between lower-value and higher-value colors, where the lower-value pixel adopts the higher value. The background color (orange, 7) remains unchanged and acts as a boundary.\n\n**Final Checks:**\n*   Does the background color influence the change? No, background neighbors are ignored.\n*   Do neighbors of the same color influence the change? No, they are ignored.\n*   Does diagonal adjacency matter? The previous code used orthogonal adjacency, and the revised hypothesis continues this assumption based on the examples.\n*   Is the update simultaneous? Yes, the revised hypothesis implies checking all pixels against the *original* input grid and then constructing the output. This avoids the iterative spreading issue.\n\nThe revised hypothesis appears robust for the provided examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted an iterative \"spreading\" or \"infection\" model where colors with higher numerical values progressively overwrite adjacent colors with lower values, excluding the background color. The results clearly show this iterative approach is incorrect. In both failed examples (Example 1 and Example 2), the color change is much more localized in the expected output than in the transformed output generated by the code.\n\nSpecifically:\n-   **Example 1:** Yellow (4) should only overwrite the immediately adjacent Blue (1) pixels, not spread further into the blue area over multiple steps.\n-   **Example 2:** Maroon (9) should only overwrite the single Gray (5) pixel it directly touches, not spread along the gray line.\n\nThis suggests the transformation rule is not iterative but likely a single-step process based on the initial configuration of the grid. The core idea of a higher-value color overwriting an adjacent lower-value color seems correct, but its application needs refinement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs to identify the precise conditions under which a pixel changes color.\n2.  Focus on the *initial* state of the grid and the *direct* neighbors of each pixel.\n3.  Discard the iterative update mechanism.\n4.  Formulate a new natural language program based on a single-pass update rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided data and analysis using code execution:\n\n**Example 1:**\n-   Input Dimensions: 16x16\n-   Input Colors Present: Blue (1), Yellow (4), Orange (7)\n-   Input Color Counts: {1: 35, 4: 16, 7: 205}\n-   Expected Output Dimensions: 16x16\n-   Expected Output Colors Present: Blue (1), Yellow (4), Orange (7)\n-   Expected Output Color Counts: {1: 27, 4: 24, 7: 205}\n-   **Difference:** 8 pixels changed from Blue (1) to Yellow (4). The count of Orange (7) (background) remained the same.\n\n**Example 2:**\n-   Input Dimensions: 16x16\n-   Input Colors Present: Gray (5), Orange (7), Maroon (9)\n-   Input Color Counts: {5: 11, 7: 236, 9: 9}\n-   Expected Output Dimensions: 16x16\n-   Expected Output Colors Present: Gray (5), Orange (7), Maroon (9)\n-   Expected Output Color Counts: {5: 10, 7: 236, 9: 10}\n-   **Difference:** 1 pixel changed from Gray (5) to Maroon (9). The count of Orange (7) (background) remained the same.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
