Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Define the background color (assumed to be 7, Orange).\n3. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the input grid.\n4. If the current pixel's color in the input grid is the background color, skip it.\n5. Otherwise, examine the 4 orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the pixel (r, c) in the *input* grid.\n6. Find the maximum color value among valid neighbors. A neighbor is valid if it's within grid bounds, not the background color, and not the same color as the current pixel (r, c).\n7. If a valid neighbor with a color value strictly greater than the current pixel's color exists, update the pixel at (r, c) in the *output* grid to this maximum neighbor color.\n8.
