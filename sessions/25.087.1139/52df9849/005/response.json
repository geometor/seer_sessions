For each non-background pixel, find the maximum color value among its 4 orthogonal neighbors, excluding neighbors that are the background color or the same color as the pixel itself.\n   b. If this maximum neighbor color exists and is greater than the pixel's current color, update the pixel's color in the output grid to this maximum neighbor color.\n   c.
