task_context:
  - description: Selects and isolates a specific object from the input grid based on its color composition.
  - input_grid_properties:
      - background_color: azure (8)
      - contains_multiple_objects: true
      - objects_separated_by_background: true
  - output_grid_properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_single_object: true
      - dimensions: minimal bounding box of the selected object

objects:
  - id: background
    - color: azure (8) in input, white (0) in output (within bounding box)
  - id: object_to_select
    - description: The contiguous non-azure object that contains at least one yellow (4) pixel.
    - properties:
        - must_contain_color: yellow (4)
        - colors_preserved_in_output: true
        - position_relative_to_output_grid: fills the grid
  - id: other_objects
    - description: Contiguous non-azure objects that do NOT contain any yellow (4) pixels.
    - properties:
        - excluded_from_output: true

actions:
  - 1_identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of non-azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
  - 2_filter_objects: Select the single object that includes at least one yellow (4) pixel.
  - 3_determine_bounding_box: Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing the selected object.
  - 4_crop_object: Extract the portion of the input grid defined by the bounding box.
  - 5_replace_background: Change all azure (8) pixels within the cropped area to white (0).
  - 6_generate_output: Create the final output grid from the modified cropped area.

relationships:
  - selection_rule: The presence of yellow (4) pixels uniquely identifies the object to be transformed into the output.
  - spatial_transformation: The output is a subgrid (crop) of the input, focused on the selected object.
  - color_transformation: The background color within the cropped area changes from azure (8) to white (0). Object colors remain unchanged.
