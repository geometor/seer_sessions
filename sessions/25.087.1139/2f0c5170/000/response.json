These objects are separated by the azure background.\n3.  **Object Composition:** Some objects are composed solely of white (0) pixels with potentially one other non-white, non-azure pixel. Other objects have a more complex structure, often involving yellow (4) pixels alongside other colors like red (2), green (3), or blue (1), as well as white (0).\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** In each example, exactly one object contains yellow (4) pixels. The other object(s) do not contain yellow.\n5.  **Transformation:** The output grid isolates the object containing yellow pixels.\n6.  **Output Format:** The output grid represents the selected object within its minimal bounding box. The original azure background pixels within this bounding box are replaced with white (0) pixels in the output. The colors and arrangement of the pixels belonging to the selected object itself are preserved.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
