Task: Fill enclosed white regions with blue
Input: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
Output: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
Dimensions: Input and Output grids have identical dimensions.
Color_Mapping:
  0: white
  1: blue
  2-9: other colors (red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)

Transformation:
  Target_Pixels: Pixels with value 0 (white).
  Action: Some target pixels are changed to value 1 (blue).
  Condition:
    - Identify connected components of white pixels (using horizontal/vertical adjacency).
    - Check if a component has any pixel located on the grid border (row 0, col 0, last row, last col).
    - If a white component touches the border:
        - All pixels in this component remain white (0).
    - If a white component does NOT touch the border (is fully enclosed by non-white pixels):
        - All pixels in this component are changed to blue (1).
  Non_Target_Pixels: All pixels with values 1 through 9 remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Connectivity: Defines regions of white pixels.
  - Border Adjacency: Determines whether a white region is modified.
