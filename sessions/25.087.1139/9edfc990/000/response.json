The key colors involved in the transformation appear to be white (0) and blue (1). Other colors seem static.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The primary change occurs with white (0) pixels. Some white pixels remain white, while others change to blue (1). Non-white pixels appear unchanged in their position and color.\n4.  **Spatial Relationships:** The change seems dependent on the location and surroundings of the white pixels. Specifically, it relates to whether a group of connected white pixels is \"enclosed\" or \"open\" (touching the grid boundary).\n5.  **Object Identification:** We can perceive \"objects\" or \"regions\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. The transformation specifically targets regions of white pixels.\n6.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency (sharing an edge, not just a corner) is crucial for defining these connected regions of white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color white (value 0).\n3.  Keep track of which white pixels have already been processed as part of a component.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel of the grid. If a pixel is white (0) and has not yet been processed:\n    a.  Start a search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this pixel to find all connected white pixels (using horizontal and vertical adjacency only). This forms a connected component (region) of white pixels.\n    b.  Mark all pixels found in this component as processed.\n    c.  During the search, check if *any* pixel within this component is located on the border of the grid (i.e., its row index is 0 or the maximum row index, OR its column index is 0 or the maximum column index). Keep track of whether the border was touched.\n    d.  After identifying the complete component and determining if it touched the border:\n        i.  If the component *did not* touch the border, change the color of *all* pixels belonging to this component in the *output* grid to blue (value 1).\n        ii. If the component *did* touch the border, leave the corresponding pixels in the output grid as white (0) (they are already white in the copied grid).\n5.  All non-white pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid (they were copied initially).\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
