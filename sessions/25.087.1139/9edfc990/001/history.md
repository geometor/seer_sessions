Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions in each example.
2.  **Colors:** The grids use colors represented by integers 0-9. The key colors involved in the transformation appear to be white (0) and blue (1). Other colors seem static.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The primary change occurs with white (0) pixels. Some white pixels remain white, while others change to blue (1). Non-white pixels appear unchanged in their position and color.
4.  **Spatial Relationships:** The change seems dependent on the location and surroundings of the white pixels. Specifically, it relates to whether a group of connected white pixels is "enclosed" or "open" (touching the grid boundary).
5.  **Object Identification:** We can perceive "objects" or "regions" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. The transformation specifically targets regions of white pixels.
6.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency (sharing an edge, not just a corner) is crucial for defining these connected regions of white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Fill enclosed white regions with blue
Input: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
Output: Grid (2D array of integers 0-9)
Dimensions: Input and Output grids have identical dimensions.
Color_Mapping:
  0: white
  1: blue
  2-9: other colors (red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)

Transformation:
  Target_Pixels: Pixels with value 0 (white).
  Action: Some target pixels are changed to value 1 (blue).
  Condition:
    - Identify connected components of white pixels (using horizontal/vertical adjacency).
    - Check if a component has any pixel located on the grid border (row 0, col 0, last row, last col).
    - If a white component touches the border:
        - All pixels in this component remain white (0).
    - If a white component does NOT touch the border (is fully enclosed by non-white pixels):
        - All pixels in this component are changed to blue (1).
  Non_Target_Pixels: All pixels with values 1 through 9 remain unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Connectivity: Defines regions of white pixels.
  - Border Adjacency: Determines whether a white region is modified.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have the color white (value 0).
3.  Keep track of which white pixels have already been processed as part of a component.
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the grid. If a pixel is white (0) and has not yet been processed:
    a.  Start a search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this pixel to find all connected white pixels (using horizontal and vertical adjacency only). This forms a connected component (region) of white pixels.
    b.  Mark all pixels found in this component as processed.
    c.  During the search, check if *any* pixel within this component is located on the border of the grid (i.e., its row index is 0 or the maximum row index, OR its column index is 0 or the maximum column index). Keep track of whether the border was touched.
    d.  After identifying the complete component and determining if it touched the border:
        i.  If the component *did not* touch the border, change the color of *all* pixels belonging to this component in the *output* grid to blue (value 1).
        ii. If the component *did* touch the border, leave the corresponding pixels in the output grid as white (0) (they are already white in the copied grid).
5.  All non-white pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid (they were copied initially).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
