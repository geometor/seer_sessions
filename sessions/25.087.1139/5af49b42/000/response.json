The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Input Elements**: The input grids contain two types of elements:\n    *   **Single Pixels**: Isolated non-white pixels scattered across the grid (e.g., the red '2' at (1,2) in `train_1`).\n    *   **Horizontal Patterns**: Contiguous horizontal sequences of two or more non-white pixels (e.g., `1 2 4 3` and `5 7 8 6` in the last row of `train_1`). These patterns can appear anywhere, not just the edges.\n3.  **Transformation Logic**: The core transformation involves using the single pixels (\"markers\") to determine where to copy the horizontal patterns.\n    *   Each marker pixel's color dictates *which* pattern should be copied. The pattern chosen is one that contains the marker's color.\n    *   The marker pixel's location dictates *where* the chosen pattern is copied. The pattern is placed on the same row as the marker, aligned such that the pixel in the copied pattern corresponding to the marker's color lands exactly where the original marker was.\n4.  **Output Structure**:\n    *   The output grid starts as a copy of the input.\n    *   The identified patterns are copied to new locations based on the marker pixels.\n    *   The original marker pixels are effectively replaced by the corresponding pixel within the copied pattern.\n    *   The original horizontal patterns remain in their initial positions unless overwritten by a newly placed pattern triggered by a marker.\n    *   If a copied pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it is clipped.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
