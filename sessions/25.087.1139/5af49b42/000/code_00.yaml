elements:
  - type: grid
    background_color: 0 (white)
  - type: pattern
    description: Contiguous horizontal sequence of 2 or more non-white pixels.
    location: Found anywhere in the input grid.
    persistence: Patterns remain in their original location in the output unless overwritten.
  - type: marker
    description: Single non-white pixel not horizontally adjacent to another non-white pixel.
    location: Found anywhere in the input grid except as part of a pattern.
    role: Determines which pattern to copy and where to place it.

actions:
  - action: identify_patterns
    input: input_grid
    output: list of patterns (sequences of colors)
  - action: identify_markers
    input: input_grid
    output: list of markers (color, row, column)
  - action: copy_pattern_to_marker_location
    trigger: each marker (color C, position (r, c))
    steps:
      - Find a pattern P containing color C.
      - Find the index 'idx' of C within P.
      - Calculate the target start column: start_col = c - idx.
      - Place pattern P onto the output grid at row 'r', starting at 'start_col'.
      - Clip the pattern if it extends beyond grid boundaries.
    target: output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)

relationships:
  - relationship: marker_color_determines_pattern
    source: marker color (C)
    target: pattern (P)
    condition: Pattern P contains color C.
  - relationship: marker_position_determines_placement
    source: marker position (r, c) and pattern P with index idx of marker color C
    target: placement location for P on output grid (row r, starting column c - idx)
