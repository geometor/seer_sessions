            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains scattered pixels of one or more non-background colors, typically aligned within a single vertical column. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Output Grid:** The scattered pixels from the input are replaced by structured shapes at the bottom of the grid. The background remains white.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves \"gravity\" acting on the colored pixels. They \"fall\" to the bottom of the grid.\n4.  **Object Formation:** As pixels fall, they aggregate based on their original color and form pyramid-like or triangular structures.\n5.  **Structure Rule:** The shape and size of the structure depend on the *number* of pixels of that specific color in the input. The structures seem to be composed of stacked horizontal layers of odd-numbered widths (1, 3, 5, ...), with the widest layer at the bottom. The specific layers used are determined by starting with the widest possible layer (largest odd number <= pixel count) and iteratively adding the next smaller odd-width layers until the total pixel count is met. Example: 9 pixels -> layers 5, 3, 1; 4 pixels -> layers 3, 1; 5 pixels -> layer 5.\n6.  **Positional Logic:** The horizontal position of each structure in the output is centered on the column where the corresponding colored pixels were located in the input.\n7.  **Stacking Order:** If multiple colors are present in the input column, their resulting structures are stacked vertically in the output. The structure corresponding to the color whose *lowest* pixel was originally lowest in the input grid forms the base structure at the very bottom. Other structures are stacked sequentially on top.\n8.  **Conservation:** The total number of pixels for each specific color remains the same between the input and output. The dimensions of the grid also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"

Identify all unique non-background colors present in the input grid.\n3.  For each unique color found:\n    a.  Find all coordinates `(row, col)` of pixels with this color.\n    b.  Count the total number of pixels (`pixel_count`).\n    c.  Determine the common column index (`center_col`) for these pixels.\n    d.  Find the maximum row index (`max_row`) among these pixels (representing the lowest point of this color group in the input).\n    e.  Store the `color`, `pixel_count`, `center_col`, and `max_row`.\n4.  Sort the collected color information based on `max_row` in descending order (colors that appeared lower in the input come first).\n5.  Initialize the `current_base_row` variable to the index of the last row of the grid (grid height - 1).\n6.  Iterate through the sorted color information:\n    a.  For the current `color`, `pixel_count`, and `center_col`:\n        b.  Determine the necessary layer widths for the structure:\n            i.  Initialize an empty list `layer_widths`.\n            ii. Initialize `remaining_pixels = pixel_count`.\n            iii. Iterate through odd numbers `w` starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, ...).\n            iv. If `remaining_pixels >= w`, add `w` to `layer_widths` and subtract `w` from `remaining_pixels`.\n            v. If `remaining_pixels == 0`, stop iterating through widths.\n            (The `layer_widths` list now contains the widths required, e.g., [1, 3, 5] for a count of 9).\n        c.  Draw the structure onto the output grid:\n            i.  Iterate through the `layer_widths` list (representing layers from top to bottom). Let the current width be `w`.\n            ii. The row for the current layer is `current_base_row`.\n            iii. Calculate the starting column: `start_col = center_col - (w // 2)`.\n            iv. Fill the pixels in the output grid from `(current_base_row, start_col)` to `(current_base_row, start_col + w - 1)` with the current `color`.\n            v. Decrement `current_base_row` by 1 to move up for the next layer/structure.\n7.  After processing all colors, return the completed output grid."
