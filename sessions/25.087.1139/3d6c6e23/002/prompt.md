```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by performing a "gravity" operation on colored pixels.

1.  Identifies all unique non-background (non-white/0) colors in the input grid.
2.  For each color, counts its pixels, determines the column they occupy, and finds the lowest row index (max_row) of any pixel of that color.
3.  Sorts the colors based on their max_row in descending order (lowest in input goes to the bottom of the output).
4.  Initializes an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
5.  Iterates through the sorted colors:
    a.  Calculates the required layer widths for the pyramid structure using a greedy approach: starting with the largest possible odd width layer that fits the remaining pixel count, then the next largest odd width for the remainder, and so on. Layers are stacked widest at the bottom, narrowest at the top.
    b.  Draws the layers for the current color onto the output grid, starting from the current available base row and moving upwards. The structure is centered horizontally based on the original column of the pixels.
    c.  Updates the available base row for the next structure to be stacked on top.
6.  Returns the final output grid.
