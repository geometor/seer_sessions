            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code successfully solves two out of the three training examples. The failure on the first example indicates a misunderstanding of how the pyramid shapes are constructed from the pixel counts.\n\nThe core logic of identifying colors, counting pixels, finding their original column, determining the lowest point (max row), sorting them by this lowest point (gravity), and stacking them seems correct based on examples 2 and 3 passing.\n\nThe error lies specifically in the `get_layer_widths` function. The initial implementation used a greedy approach, taking the largest possible odd width layer first. However, Example 1 demonstrates that for 9 pixels, the output should be layers of width 1, 3, and 5, not a single layer of width 9.\n\nThe revised hypothesis is that the shape construction depends on whether the pixel count is a perfect square:\n1.  If the pixel count `N` is a perfect square (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16...), the shape is a symmetric pyramid built from layers with widths `1, 3, 5, ..., 2*sqrt(N)-1`.\n2.  If the pixel count `N` is *not* a perfect square, the shape is a single horizontal line of width `N`.\n\nThis revised logic correctly predicts the shapes in all three examples:\n*   Example 1: 9 pixels (Orange). 9 is 3\\*3 (perfect square). Layers: 1, 3, 5.\n*   Example 2: 4 pixels (Orange). 4 is 2\\*2 (perfect square). Layers: 1, 3.\n*   Example 3:\n    *   Yellow: 1 pixel. 1 is 1\\*1 (perfect square). Layer: 1.\n    *   Orange: 3 pixels. Not a perfect square. Layer: 3.\n    *   Magenta: 5 pixels. Not a perfect square. Layer: 5.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `get_layer_widths` function to implement this perfect square check and generate the appropriate layer widths based on the outcome.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
