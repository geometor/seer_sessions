            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (15x15 in all examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors used are white (0 - background), red (2), and gray (5).\n3.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   A prominent \"frame\" or \"container\" structure made of red pixels (2) is present in all inputs. Its shape varies slightly (spectacles-like in Ex 1 & 3, rectangular in Ex 2).\n    *   One or more distinct objects made of gray pixels (5) are located *inside* the red frame in the input. The shapes of these gray objects vary (L-shapes, T-shape, single pixel, F-like shapes).\n4.  **Transformation Core Idea:** The gray objects inside the red frame are moved to the *outside* of the frame in the output. The space they occupied inside the frame becomes white (background). The red frame itself remains unchanged.\n5.  **Transformation Details:**\n    *   **Removal:** Gray pixels inside the frame are effectively erased (turned white) in the output.\n    *   **Movement:** Each gray object is moved outside the frame.\n    *   **Reflection/Mirroring:** The gray objects appear reflected in the output. The axis of reflection seems related to the closest boundary of the red frame. Objects near the left/right sides (Ex 1, Ex 3) are reflected *horizontally*. Objects near the top/bottom (Ex 2) are reflected *vertically*.\n    *   **Placement:** The reflected gray objects are placed just outside the red frame, seemingly adjacent to the boundary they were \"reflected\" from, with a consistent one-pixel gap between the object and the frame boundary. The placement preserves the relative axis position (e.g., an object reflected from the left boundary keeps its original row(s) but is placed to the left of the frame).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
