            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\n*   **Closest Boundary Discrepancy**: The code execution confirms the issue.\n    *   In Example 1, Object 1: Closest (BBox edge) is `['top', 'left']`. The code's priority picks 'top'. The expected boundary is 'left'. Using center distance also gives `['top', 'left']`.\n    *   In Example 1, Object 2: Closest (BBox edge) is `['top', 'bottom', 'right']`. Code priority picks 'top'. Expected is 'right'. Closest (Center) is `['right']`.\n    *   In Example 1, Object 3: Closest (BBox edge) is `['top', 'bottom', 'left']`. Code priority picks 'top'. Expected is 'left'. Closest (Center) is `['left']`.\n    *   In Example 1, Object 4: Closest (BBox edge) is `['bottom', 'left']`. Code priority picks 'bottom' (incorrectly implemented as top > bottom > left > right, should have picked bottom). Expected is 'left'. Closest (Center) is `['bottom', 'left']`.\n    *   In Example 3, Object 1: Closest (BBox edge) is `['top', 'bottom']`. Code priority picks 'top'. Expected is 'left'. Closest (Center) is `['top', 'bottom']`.\n    *   In Example 3, Object 2: Closest (BBox edge) is `['top', 'bottom']`. Code priority picks 'top'. Expected is 'right'. Closest (Center) is `['top', 'bottom', 'right']`.\n*   **New Hypothesis**: The \"closest boundary\" rule seems to be: determine whether the object is horizontally or vertically closer to the center of the *frame's inner space*. If horizontally closer (min(dist_left, dist_right) < min(dist_top, dist_bottom)), reflect vertically and place top/bottom. If vertically closer (min(dist_top, dist_bottom) < min(dist_left, dist_right)), reflect horizontally and place left/right. If equidistant, use the original code's priority or perhaps another tie-breaker? Let's re-check this.\n    *   Example 1, Object 1: Center Dists: T=1.0, B=4.0, L=1.0, R=4.0. min_vert=1.0, min_horz=1.0. Tie. Expected: left (horizontal reflection).\n    *   Example 1, Object 2: Center Dists: T=2.5, B=2.5, L=4.0, R=1.0. min_vert=2.5, min_horz=1.0. Horizontally closer. Expected: right (horizontal reflection). -> This matches!\n    *   Example 1, Object 3: Center Dists: T=2.5, B=2.5, L=2.0, R=3.0. min_vert=2.5, min_horz=2.0. Horizontally closer. Expected: left (horizontal reflection). -> This matches!\n    *   Example 1, Object 4: Center Dists: T=4.0, B=1.0, L=1.0, R=4.0. min_vert=1.0, min_horz=1.0. Tie. Expected: left (horizontal reflection).\n    *   Example 2 (Successful one): Let's check its objects.\n        *   Obj 1: BBox [6, 7], [6, 8]. Center (6.5, 7.0). Frame [4, 11], [4, 10]. Inner Frame [5, 10], [5, 9]. Dists: T=1.5, B=3.5, L=2.0, R=2.0. min_vert=1.5, min_horz=2.0. Vertically closer. Expected: top (vertical reflection). -> This matches!\n        *   Obj 2: BBox [9, 9], [7, 7]. Center (9.0, 7.0). Dists: T=4.0, B=1.0, L=2.0, R=2.0. min_vert=1.0, min_horz=2.0. Vertically closer. Expected: bottom (vertical reflection). -> This matches!\n    *   Example 3, Object 1: Center Dists: T=1.0, B=1.0, L=1.5, R=3.5. min_vert=1.0, min_horz=1.5. Vertically closer. Expected: left (horizontal reflection). -> This MISMATCHES! The hypothesis fails here.\n\n*   **Revisiting Closest Boundary Rule**: Let's reconsider the simple \"closest edge\" using the object's *bounding box* distance to the *inner* frame boundary.\n    *   Example 1, Obj 1: Dist [T=1, B=4, L=1, R=4]. Min = 1. Closest = T, L. Expected = L.\n    *   Example 1, Obj 2: Dist [T=1, B=1, L=4, R=1]. Min = 1. Closest = T, B, R. Expected = R.\n    *   Example 1, Obj 3: Dist [T=2, B=2, L=2, R=3]. Min = 2. Closest = T, B, L. Expected = L.\n    *   Example 1, Obj 4: Dist [T=4, B=1, L=1, R=4]. Min = 1. Closest = B, L. Expected = L.\n    *   Example 2, Obj 1: Dist [T=1, B=3, L=1, R=1]. Min = 1. Closest = T, L, R. Expected = T.\n    *   Example 2, Obj 2: Dist [T=4, B=0, L=2, R=2]. Min = 0. Closest = B. Expected = B.\n    *   Example 3, Obj 1: Dist [T=0, B=0, L=1, R=3]. Min = 0. Closest = T, B. Expected = L.\n    *   Example 3, Obj 2: Dist [T=0, B=0, L=4, R=1]. Min = 0. Closest = T, B. Expected = R.\n\n*   **New Hypothesis 2 (Tie-breaking for BBox edge distance)**: Calculate the minimum bbox edge distance. Identify all boundaries matching this minimum distance.\n    *   If the set of closest boundaries includes 'left' or 'right' BUT NOT 'top' or 'bottom', choose the closer of left/right (using bbox edge distance). Reflect horizontally. Place left/right.\n    *   If the set includes 'top' or 'bottom' BUT NOT 'left' or 'right', choose the closer of top/bottom. Reflect vertically. Place top/bottom.\n    *   If the set includes *both* horizontal and vertical boundaries (a tie involving different directions), PRIORITIZE horizontal. Choose the closer of left/right. Reflect horizontally. Place left/right.\n    *   Let's test this tie-breaking logic:\n        *   Ex1, Obj1: Closest = {T, L}. Tie includes horizontal & vertical. Prioritize horizontal. Choose L (dist=1) vs R (dist=4). Choose Left. Reflect Horizontally. -> Matches Expected!\n        *   Ex1, Obj2: Closest = {T, B, R}. Tie includes horizontal & vertical. Prioritize horizontal. Choose R (dist=1) vs L (dist=4). Choose Right. Reflect Horizontally. -> Matches Expected!\n        *   Ex1, Obj3: Closest = {T, B, L}. Tie includes horizontal & vertical. Prioritize horizontal. Choose L (dist=2) vs R (dist=3). Choose Left. Reflect Horizontally. -> Matches Expected!\n        *   Ex1, Obj4: Closest = {B, L}. Tie includes horizontal & vertical. Prioritize horizontal. Choose L (dist=1) vs R (dist=4). Choose Left. Reflect Horizontally. -> Matches Expected!\n        *   Ex2, Obj1: Closest = {T, L, R}. Tie includes horizontal & vertical. Prioritize horizontal. Choose L (dist=1) or R (dist=1). Let's say Left (arbitrary tie break L/R?). Reflect Horizontally. -> MISMATCHES Expected (Top, Vertical reflection)!\n        *   Ex2, Obj2: Closest = {B}. Only vertical. Choose Bottom. Reflect Vertically. -> Matches Expected!\n        *   Ex3, Obj1: Closest = {T, B}. Only vertical. Choose T (dist=0) or B (dist=0). Let's say Top? Reflect Vertically. -> MISMATCHES Expected (Left, Horizontal reflection)!\n        *   Ex3, Obj2: Closest = {T, B}. Only vertical. Choose T (dist=0) or B (dist=0). Let's say Top? Reflect Vertically. -> MISMATCHES Expected (Right, Horizontal reflection)!\n\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (Refined Tie-breaking)**: Let's rethink the tie-breaking. Maybe it's not about prioritizing horizontal *placement* but about prioritizing horizontal *reflection*?\n    *   Calculate minimum bbox edge distance (d_min) to inner frame boundary.\n    *   Let C be the set of closest boundaries {b | dist(b) == d_min}.\n    *   If C contains {'left'} or {'right'} or {'left', 'right'}: Reflect horizontally. Place next to the closer of left/right (using bbox edge distance).\n    *   Else if C contains {'top'} or {'bottom'} or {'top', 'bottom'}: Reflect vertically. Place next to the closer of top/bottom (using bbox edge distance).\n    *   Else (C contains both horizontal and vertical boundaries):\n        *   If d_min > 0: Find the boundary in C with the *overall* minimum distance (could still be tied). If still tied, use priority Left > Right > Top > Bottom? (This seems complex). Let's try prioritizing horizontal *reflection* first. Reflect horizontally. Place next to the closer of left/right among the tied boundaries.\n        *   If d_min == 0 (object touching inner boundary): Reflect based on the *touching* boundary type. If touching {T} or {B}, reflect vertically. If touching {L} or {R}, reflect horizontally. If touching both (corner), reflect horizontally (arbitrary?).\n    *   Let's test this complex logic:\n        *   Ex1, Obj1: C={T, L}, d_min=1. Contains both. d_min > 0. Prioritize horizontal reflection. Closer L/R is L. Place Left. -> Matches!\n        *   Ex1, Obj2: C={T, B, R}, d_min=1. Contains both. d_min > 0. Prioritize horizontal reflection. Closer L/R is R. Place Right. -> Matches!\n        *   Ex1, Obj3: C={T, B, L}, d_min=2. Contains both. d_min > 0. Prioritize horizontal reflection. Closer L/R is L. Place Left. -> Matches!\n        *   Ex1, Obj4: C={B, L}, d_min=1. Contains both. d_min > 0. Prioritize horizontal reflection. Closer L/R is L. Place Left. -> Matches!\n        *   Ex2, Obj1: C={T, L, R}, d_min=1. Contains both. d_min > 0. Prioritize horizontal reflection. Closer L/R is L or R (tie). Place Left/Right? -> MISMATCHES Expected (Top, Vertical)!\n        *   Ex2, Obj2: C={B}, d_min=0. Contains only vertical. Reflect vertically. Place Bottom. -> Matches!\n        *   Ex3, Obj1: C={T, B}, d_min=0. Contains only vertical. Reflect vertically. Place Top/Bottom? -> MISMATCHES Expected (Left, Horizontal)!\n        *   Ex3, Obj2: C={T, B}, d_min=0. Contains only vertical. Reflect vertically. Place Top/Bottom? -> MISMATCHES Expected (Right, Horizontal)!\n\n*   **Hypothesis 4 (Back to Basics - Alignment/Placement)**: The calculation of the closest *inner* boundary might be correct, but the placement logic is wrong.\n    *   Original code placement logic:\n        *   If closest=top: place above frame (row = frame_min_r - 1 - obj_height), align col with original object (col = obj_min_c).\n        *   If closest=bottom: place below frame (row = frame_max_r + 2), align col with original object (col = obj_min_c).\n        *   If closest=left: place left of frame (col = frame_min_c - 1 - obj_width), align row with original object (row = obj_min_r).\n        *   If closest=right: place right of frame (col = frame_max_c + 2), align row with original object (row = obj_min_r).\n    *   Let's re-examine the expected outputs carefully regarding alignment:\n        *   Ex 1: Objects are placed left/right. Their vertical position seems aligned with their original vertical position. (e.g., the object originally at rows 5-8, min_c 8 gets placed at rows 5-8, min_c 12). This matches the code's `row = obj_min_r` logic for left/right placement.\n        *   Ex 2: Objects are placed top/bottom. Their horizontal position seems aligned with their original horizontal position. (e.g., object originally at rows 6-7, min_c 6 gets placed at rows 1-2, min_c 6). This matches the code's `col = obj_min_c` logic for top/bottom placement.\n        *   Ex 3: Objects are placed left/right. Aligned vertically with original. Matches logic.\n    *   Okay, the placement *alignment* logic seems correct *given* the chosen boundary and reflection type. The core issue remains selecting the correct boundary and reflection type.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 5 (Distance to OUTER boundary?)**: What if the distance calculation should be to the *outer* edge of the frame, not the inner edge?\n    *   Outer frame: T=frame_min_r, B=frame_max_r, L=frame_min_c, R=frame_max_c.\n    *   Let's recalculate distances using object BBOX edge to OUTER frame edge.\n        *   Ex1, Obj1 (bbox 5,5): Frame(3,10,3,10). Dist T=5-3=2, B=10-5=5, L=5-3=2, R=10-5=5. Closest={T, L}.\n        *   Ex1, Obj2 (bbox 5-8, 8): Frame(3,10,3,10). Dist T=5-3=2, B=10-8=2, L=8-3=5, R=10-8=2. Closest={T, B, R}.\n        *   Ex1, Obj3 (bbox 6-7, 6): Frame(3,10,3,10). Dist T=6-3=3, B=10-7=3, L=6-3=3, R=10-6=4. Closest={T, B, L}.\n        *   Ex1, Obj4 (bbox 8,5): Frame(3,10,3,10). Dist T=8-3=5, B=10-8=2, L=5-3=2, R=10-5=5. Closest={B, L}.\n        *   Ex2, Obj1 (bbox 6-7, 6-8): Frame(4,11,4,10). Dist T=6-4=2, B=11-7=4, L=6-4=2, R=10-8=2. Closest={T, L, R}.\n        *   Ex2, Obj2 (bbox 9,7): Frame(4,11,4,10). Dist T=9-4=5, B=11-9=2, L=7-4=3, R=10-7=3. Closest={B}.\n        *   Ex3, Obj1 (bbox 4-6, 5-6): Frame(3,7,3,10). Dist T=4-3=1, B=7-6=1, L=5-3=2, R=10-6=4. Closest={T, B}.\n        *   Ex3, Obj2 (bbox 4-6, 8): Frame(3,7,3,10). Dist T=4-3=1, B=7-6=1, L=8-3=5, R=10-8=2. Closest={T, B}.\n    *   Using the outer boundary distances doesn't seem to simplify the tie-breaking needed. The sets of closest boundaries are very similar to using the inner boundary distance.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 6 (Look at the reflection type in expected output)**:\n    *   Ex 1: Left/Right placement -> Horizontal reflection.\n    *   Ex 2: Top/Bottom placement -> Vertical reflection.\n    *   Ex 3: Left/Right placement -> Horizontal reflection.\n    *   Rule seems to be: If placed Left/Right, reflect horizontally. If placed Top/Bottom, reflect vertically.\n    *   Now, how to decide *where* to place it (L/R vs T/B)?\n    *   Let's revisit the \"closest boundary\" calculation (using BBox edge to inner frame boundary) and the tie-breaking needed.\n        *   Ex1, Obj1: Closest={T, L}. Expected: L (Horizontal).\n        *   Ex1, Obj2: Closest={T, B, R}. Expected: R (Horizontal).\n        *   Ex1, Obj3: Closest={T, B, L}. Expected: L (Horizontal).\n        *   Ex1, Obj4: Closest={B, L}. Expected: L (Horizontal).\n        *   Ex2, Obj1: Closest={T, L, R}. Expected: T (Vertical).\n        *   Ex2, Obj2: Closest={B}. Expected: B (Vertical).\n        *   Ex3, Obj1: Closest={T, B}. Expected: L (Horizontal).\n        *   Ex3, Obj2: Closest={T, B}. Expected: R (Horizontal).\n    *   This is tricky. In Ex3, the objects are closest (touching) the Top and Bottom inner boundaries, but they get reflected horizontally and placed Left/Right. In Ex2, Obj1 is closest to T, L, R, but gets reflected vertically and placed Top.\n    *   Maybe the *primary axis* of the object matters? No, objects are varied.\n    *   Maybe the *aspect ratio* of the frame's inner space?\n        *   Ex1: Inner space 6hx6w (Square). -> Horizontal reflection.\n        *   Ex2: Inner space 6hx5w (Taller). -> Vertical reflection.\n        *   Ex3: Inner space 3hx6w (Wider). -> Horizontal reflection.\n    *   **Hypothesis 7 (Inner Frame Aspect Ratio Determines Reflection Axis)**:\n        1.  Find the frame and the inner bounding box (1 pixel inside).\n        2.  Calculate inner height (H = inner_max_r - inner_min_r + 1) and width (W = inner_max_c - inner_min_c + 1).\n        3.  Determine reflection axis: If W >= H (wider or square), reflect horizontally. If H > W (taller), reflect vertically.\n        4.  Find internal gray objects.\n        5.  For each object, calculate distances (bbox edge) to the *four inner* boundaries.\n        6.  Determine placement boundary: If reflecting horizontally (W>=H), choose between Left/Right based on which side (L or R) has the minimum distance. If reflecting vertically (H>W), choose between Top/Bottom based on which side (T or B) has the minimum distance. Use a tie-breaker if needed (e.g., Left over Right, Top over Bottom).\n        7.  Erase original object.\n        8.  Place the reflected object outside the frame, adjacent (1 pixel gap) to the chosen placement boundary, aligned with its original position along the *other* axis.\n    *   Testing Hypothesis 7:\n        *   Ex1: Inner 6hx6w. W=H. Reflect Horizontally.\n            *   Obj1: Dist L=1, R=4. Min=L. Place Left. -> Correct.\n            *   Obj2: Dist L=4, R=1. Min=R. Place Right. -> Correct.\n            *   Obj3: Dist L=2, R=3. Min=L. Place Left. -> Correct.\n            *   Obj4: Dist L=1, R=4. Min=L. Place Left. -> Correct.\n        *   Ex2: Inner 6hx5w. H>W. Reflect Vertically.\n            *   Obj1: Dist T=1, B=3. Min=T. Place Top. -> Correct.\n            *   Obj2: Dist T=4, B=0. Min=B. Place Bottom. -> Correct.\n        *   Ex3: Inner 3hx6w. W>H. Reflect Horizontally.\n            *   Obj1: Dist L=1, R=3. Min=L. Place Left. -> Correct.\n            *   Obj2: Dist L=4, R=1. Min=R. Place Right. -> Correct.\n\n    *   This hypothesis (Hypothesis 7) seems consistent across all three examples!\n\n**Final Checks:**\n*   Connectivity: Used 4-connectivity for objects, seems okay.\n*   Frame definition: Outer bbox of all red pixels. Seems okay.\n*   Internal objects: Strictly inside the outer frame bbox. Seems okay.\n*   Erasing: Correct.\n*   Placement gap: 1 pixel. Looks correct in examples.\n*   Alignment: Original row for L/R placement, original col for T/B placement. Looks correct.\n\nThis refined understanding seems robust.## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided code successfully solved Example 2 but failed on Examples 1 and 3. The core logic of identifying the red frame (color 2) and internal gray objects (color 5), erasing the originals, and placing them outside the frame seems partially correct.\n\nThe failures in Examples 1 and 3 indicate errors in determining:\n1.  **The axis of reflection**: The code incorrectly chose vertical reflection (placing objects above the frame) when horizontal reflection (placing objects beside the frame) was expected.\n2.  **The corresponding placement boundary**: Consequently, the objects were placed adjacent to the top boundary instead of the left or right boundary.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe key insight appears to be related to the aspect ratio of the *inner space* defined by the frame.\n1.  Define the \"inner space\" as the rectangular area one pixel inside the frame's bounding box.\n2.  Calculate the height and width of this inner space.\n3.  The **reflection axis** seems determined by this aspect ratio:\n    *   If the inner space is wider or square (width >= height), reflect objects **horizontally**.\n    *   If the inner space is taller (height > width), reflect objects **vertically**.\n4.  The **placement boundary** (Top, Bottom, Left, or Right) depends on the reflection axis and the object's proximity to the corresponding inner boundaries:\n    *   If reflecting horizontally, compare the object's distance to the inner Left boundary vs. the inner Right boundary. Place the object adjacent to the closer side (Left or Right).\n    *   If reflecting vertically, compare the object's distance to the inner Top boundary vs. the inner Bottom boundary. Place the object adjacent to the closer side (Top or Bottom).\n5.  Use the distance from the object's bounding box edge to the respective inner boundary line for comparison. A simple tie-breaker (e.g., Left > Right, Top > Bottom) can be used if distances are equal.\n6.  Placement alignment should remain as implemented: align vertically with the original position for Left/Right placement, and align horizontally for Top/Bottom placement.\n\nThis strategy accounts for the difference between Example 2 (taller inner space -> vertical reflection) and Examples 1 & 3 (square or wider inner space -> horizontal reflection).\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on code execution and analysis:\n\n| Example | Frame BBox (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) | Inner Space BBox (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c) | Inner Space Size (H x W) | Aspect Ratio | Expected Reflection | Code's Reflection (Failed Runs) |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------ |\n| 1       | (3, 10, 3, 10)                          | (4, 9, 4, 9)                                  | 6 x 6                    | Square       | Horizontal          | Vertical (Incorrect)            |\n| 2       | (4, 11, 4, 10)                          | (5, 10, 5, 9)                                 | 6 x 5                    | Taller       | Vertical            | Vertical (Correct)              |\n| 3       | (3, 7, 3, 10)                           | (4, 6, 4, 9)                                  | 3 x 6                    | Wider        | Horizontal          | Vertical (Incorrect)            |\n\n**Object Distances (BBox edge to Inner Boundary) & Placement Decisions (Based on Hypothesis 7):**\n\n*   **Example 1 (Inner 6x6, W>=H -> Horizontal Reflection):**\n    *   Obj 1 (Left): Dist L=1, R=4. Closer: L. Place Left. (Matches Expected)\n    *   Obj 2 (Right): Dist L=4, R=1. Closer: R. Place Right. (Matches Expected)\n    *   Obj 3 (Left-Center): Dist L=2, R=3. Closer: L. Place Left. (Matches Expected)\n    *   Obj 4 (Bottom-Left): Dist L=1, R=4. Closer: L. Place Left. (Matches Expected)\n*   **Example 2 (Inner 6x5, H>W -> Vertical Reflection):**\n    *   Obj 1 (Top-Center): Dist T=1, B=3. Closer: T. Place Top. (Matches Expected)\n    *   Obj 2 (Bottom-Center): Dist T=4, B=0. Closer: B. Place Bottom. (Matches Expected)\n*   **Example 3 (Inner 3x6, W>H -> Horizontal Reflection):**\n    *   Obj 1 (Left): Dist L=1, R=3. Closer: L. Place Left. (Matches Expected)\n    *   Obj 2 (Right): Dist L=4, R=1. Closer: R. Place Right. (Matches Expected)\n\nThe metrics support Hypothesis 7: the inner frame's aspect ratio dictates the reflection axis, and proximity to the relevant boundaries (Left/Right for horizontal reflection, Top/Bottom for vertical reflection) determines the placement side.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Tie-breaking: Left > Right, Top > Bottom.\n      - Alignment: If placed Left/Right, aligned vertically with its original position (top row matches original top row).

Filter for content objects located strictly inside the frame's outer bounding box.\n  6. Create a copy of the input grid for the output.\n  7. For each internal content object:\n      a. Erase the object from its original position in the output grid (set to background color 0).\n      b. Calculate the object's bounding box distances to the four inner frame boundaries (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n      c. Based on the determined reflection axis (Step 3):\n          i. If Horizontal Reflection (W>=H): Compare distances to Left and Right inner boundaries. Choose the closer side (Left or Right, tie-break L > R) as the placement side. Reflect the object horizontally (flip left-right). Calculate the new top-left position adjacent to the chosen outer frame side (Left or Right) with a 1-pixel gap, maintaining the original top-row alignment.\n          ii. If Vertical Reflection (H>W): Compare distances to Top and Bottom inner boundaries. Choose the closer side (Top or Bottom, tie-break T > B) as the placement side. Reflect the object vertically (flip up-down). Calculate the new top-left position adjacent to the chosen outer frame side (Top or Bottom) with a 1-pixel gap, maintaining the original left-column alignment.\n      d. Draw the (potentially reflected) object at its new calculated position in the output grid, checking boundary conditions.\n  8. Return the modified output grid.\n\n```"

If no red pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.\n2.  **Define Inner Space:** Calculate the bounding box of the space inside the frame: inner\\_min\\_r = frame\\_min\\_r + 1, inner\\_max\\_r = frame\\_max\\_r - 1, inner\\_min\\_c = frame\\_min\\_c + 1, inner\\_max\\_c = frame\\_max\\_c - 1.\n3.  **Determine Reflection Rule:** Calculate the inner space height (H = inner\\_max\\_r - inner\\_min\\_r + 1) and width (W = inner\\_max\\_c - inner\\_min\\_c + 1).\n    *   If W >= H (inner space is wider or square), the rule is **Horizontal Reflection**.\n    *   If H > W (inner space is taller), the rule is **Vertical Reflection**.\n4.  **Identify Content Objects:** Find all distinct connected gray (5) objects using 4-way adjacency.\n5.  **Filter Internal Objects:** Select only those gray objects whose coordinates are all strictly within the *outer* bounding box of the frame (i.e., row > frame\\_min\\_r, row < frame\\_max\\_r, col > frame\\_min\\_c, col < frame\\_max\\_c).\n6.  **Prepare Output Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid.\n7.  **Process Each Internal Object:** For every selected internal gray object:\n    a.  **Erase Original:** Set the pixels of the object's original location to white (0) in the output grid.\n    b.  **Calculate Distances:** Measure the minimum distance from the object's bounding box edges to each of the four *inner* boundary lines (inner\\_min\\_r, inner\\_max\\_r, inner\\_min\\_c, inner\\_max\\_c). Let these be dist\\_T, dist\\_B, dist\\_L, dist\\_R.\n    c.  **Apply Reflection and Determine Placement:**\n        *   **If Horizontal Reflection Rule (W>=H):**\n            *   Reflect the object horizontally.\n            *   Determine placement side: If dist\\_L <= dist\\_R, place on the Left. Otherwise, place on the Right.\n            *   Calculate the new top-left corner position:\n                *   If placing Left: New row = original object's min\\_r. New col = frame\\_min\\_c - 1 - object\\_width.\n                *   If placing Right: New row = original object's min\\_r. New col = frame\\_max\\_c + 2.\n        *   **If Vertical Reflection Rule (H>W):**\n            *   Reflect the object vertically.\n            *   Determine placement side: If dist\\_T <= dist\\_B, place on the Top. Otherwise, place on the Bottom.\n            *   Calculate the new top-left corner position:\n                *   If placing Top: New row = frame\\_min\\_r - 1 - object\\_height. New col = original object's min\\_c.\n                *   If placing Bottom: New row = frame\\_max\\_r + 2. New col = original object's min\\_c.\n    d.  **Draw Moved Object:** Draw the reflected object's pixels onto the output grid starting at the calculated new top-left corner, ensuring not to draw outside grid bounds or overwrite the frame pixels.\n8.  **Return Result:** Return the completed output grid."
