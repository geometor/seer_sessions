            "text": "**Confirmation:**\nThe code execution confirms:\n1.  The calculation for the output segment length (`L_out = L_in + 1`) is correct.\n2.  The calculation for the top-right starting position `(r_out, c_out)` using `r_out = r_in - L_out` and `c_out = c_in + min(L_out, 3)` is correct for all examples.\n3.  The *drawing rule* for the output segment *changes* based on the output length (`L_out`).\n    *   If `L_out` is 2 or 3 (Examples 2 and 1), the segment is drawn diagonally down-left from `(r_out, c_out)` using relative offsets `(i, -i)`.\n    *   If `L_out` is 4 (Example 3), the segment is drawn using relative offsets `(i, -max(0, i-1))`.\n\nThe previous code failed on Example 3 because it only implemented the diagonal drawing rule `(i, -i)`.\n\n**Refined Strategy:**\nModify the drawing step in the code to use a conditional approach based on `L_out`. Keep the rest of the logic (finding the input segment, calculating `L_out`, `r_out`, `c_out`) the same.\n\n**YAML and Natural Language Program:**\nNow I can formulate the YAML facts and the updated natural language program based on this confirmed understanding.**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the transformation's core elements for the first two examples: locating a diagonal red segment, increasing its length by one, and calculating a new starting position based on the original position and the *new* length (with a capped column offset). However, the code failed on the third example because it assumed the output segment is always drawn as a simple diagonal line (down and left) from the calculated starting point. Example 3 reveals that the *shape* or *pattern* of the drawn output segment changes depending on its length. Specifically, when the output segment length becomes 4, the drawing pattern deviates from a simple diagonal. The calculation of the output segment's length and its top-right starting coordinate appears correct across all examples; only the drawing method needs refinement.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Retain the logic for finding the input red segment, calculating its length (`L_in`) and top-right coordinate (`r_in`, `c_in`).\n2.  Retain the logic for calculating the output segment length (`L_out = L_in + 1`) and its top-right starting coordinate (`r_out = r_in - L_out`, `c_out = c_in + min(L_out, 3)`).\n3.  Modify the drawing logic: Introduce a condition based on `L_out`.\n    *   If `L_out` is 2 or 3, draw pixels using the relative offset `(i, -i)` from the start `(r_out, c_out)`.\n    *   If `L_out` is 4, draw pixels using the relative offset `(i, -max(0, i-1))` from the start `(r_out, c_out)`.\n4.  Ensure boundary checks are applied during drawing.\n\n**Metrics:**\n"
