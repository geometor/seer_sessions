Task: Transform a grid containing a diagonal red line segment.

Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: Input and Output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: Consistently orange (7).

Objects:
  - name: red_segment
    color: red (2)
    shape: Diagonal line segment (top-right to bottom-left, slope -1)
    properties:
      - location: Defined by its pixels' coordinates.
      - top_right_pixel: The pixel in the segment with the minimum row index (and maximum column index in case of ties, though not relevant for a single pixel segment). Let this be (r_in, c_in).
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment. Let this be L.

Input State:
  - Contains one red_segment object on an orange background.

Output State:
  - Contains one red_segment object on an orange background.
  - The output red_segment has:
    - length: L' = L + 1
    - top_right_pixel: (r_out, c_out) calculated from the input state.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Find the red_segment in the input grid.
  - Determine its top_right_pixel (r_in, c_in) and length L.
  - Calculate the properties of the output red_segment:
    - L' = L + 1
    - r_out = r_in - (L + 1)
    - c_out = c_in + min(L + 1, 3)
  - Create the output grid:
    - Start with an all-orange grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    - Draw the output red_segment starting at (r_out, c_out) with length L'. The pixels are (r_out + i, c_out - i) for i from 0 to L'-1.
