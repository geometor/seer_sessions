The segment runs from the top-right down to the bottom-left (slope = -1).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves replacing the input red segment with a new red segment in the output.\n5.  **Segment Length:** The length (number of red pixels) of the diagonal segment in the output is always one greater than the length of the segment in the input.\n    *   Train 1: Input L=2 -> Output L=3\n    *   Train 2: Input L=1 -> Output L=2\n    *   Train 3: Input L=3 -> Output L=4\n6.  **Segment Position:** The position of the output segment is determined relative to the input segment's position and length. Specifically, the top-rightmost pixel of the output segment is calculated based on the top-rightmost pixel and length (L) of the input segment.\n7.  **Coordinate System:** Assuming (row, column) indexing starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.\n8.  **Positional Relationship:** Let the top-rightmost pixel of the input segment be (r_in, c_in) and its length be L. Let the top-rightmost pixel of the output segment be (r_out, c_out). The relationship observed across examples is:\n    *   `r_out = r_in - (L + 1)`\n    *   `c_out = c_in + min(L + 1, 3)`\n9.  **Output Grid Construction:** The output grid is initially a copy of the input grid's background (all orange). Then, the new red diagonal segment is drawn starting from (r_out, c_out) with length L+1.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to locate all pixels with the foreground color (red, 2).\n3.  Identify these pixels as forming a single diagonal segment running from top-right to bottom-left.\n4.  Determine the length (L) of this segment (the count of red pixels).\n5.  Find the coordinates (r_in, c_in) of the top-rightmost pixel of the input segment (the red pixel with the smallest row index).\n6.  Calculate the length of the output segment: `L_out = L + 1`.\n7.  Calculate the coordinates (r_out, c_out) of the top-rightmost pixel for the output segment using the following rules:\n    *   `r_out = r_in - (L + 1)`\n    *   `c_out = c_in + min(L + 1, 3)`\n8.  Draw the output red segment onto the output grid. Starting from the calculated (r_out, c_out), place `L_out` red pixels diagonally down and to the left. Specifically, color the pixels at coordinates `(r_out + i, c_out - i)` red, for `i` ranging from 0 up to `L_out - 1`.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
