**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each pair consists of an input and output grid of the same dimensions (16x16 in all examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids primarily use orange (7) as a background color and red (2) for foreground objects.
3.  **Objects:** The significant object in each input grid is a diagonal line segment composed of red pixels. The segment runs from the top-right down to the bottom-left (slope = -1).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves replacing the input red segment with a new red segment in the output.
5.  **Segment Length:** The length (number of red pixels) of the diagonal segment in the output is always one greater than the length of the segment in the input.
    *   Train 1: Input L=2 -> Output L=3
    *   Train 2: Input L=1 -> Output L=2
    *   Train 3: Input L=3 -> Output L=4
6.  **Segment Position:** The position of the output segment is determined relative to the input segment's position and length. Specifically, the top-rightmost pixel of the output segment is calculated based on the top-rightmost pixel and length (L) of the input segment.
7.  **Coordinate System:** Assuming (row, column) indexing starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.
8.  **Positional Relationship:** Let the top-rightmost pixel of the input segment be (r_in, c_in) and its length be L. Let the top-rightmost pixel of the output segment be (r_out, c_out). The relationship observed across examples is:
    *   `r_out = r_in - (L + 1)`
    *   `c_out = c_in + min(L + 1, 3)`
9.  **Output Grid Construction:** The output grid is initially a copy of the input grid's background (all orange). Then, the new red diagonal segment is drawn starting from (r_out, c_out) with length L+1.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Transform a grid containing a diagonal red line segment.

Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: Input and Output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: Consistently orange (7).

Objects:
  - name: red_segment
    color: red (2)
    shape: Diagonal line segment (top-right to bottom-left, slope -1)
    properties:
      - location: Defined by its pixels' coordinates.
      - top_right_pixel: The pixel in the segment with the minimum row index (and maximum column index in case of ties, though not relevant for a single pixel segment). Let this be (r_in, c_in).
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment. Let this be L.

Input State:
  - Contains one red_segment object on an orange background.

Output State:
  - Contains one red_segment object on an orange background.
  - The output red_segment has:
    - length: L' = L + 1
    - top_right_pixel: (r_out, c_out) calculated from the input state.

Relationships & Actions:
  - Find the red_segment in the input grid.
  - Determine its top_right_pixel (r_in, c_in) and length L.
  - Calculate the properties of the output red_segment:
    - L' = L + 1
    - r_out = r_in - (L + 1)
    - c_out = c_in + min(L + 1, 3)
  - Create the output grid:
    - Start with an all-orange grid of the same dimensions as the input.
    - Draw the output red_segment starting at (r_out, c_out) with length L'. The pixels are (r_out + i, c_out - i) for i from 0 to L'-1.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (orange, 7).
2.  Scan the input grid to locate all pixels with the foreground color (red, 2).
3.  Identify these pixels as forming a single diagonal segment running from top-right to bottom-left.
4.  Determine the length (L) of this segment (the count of red pixels).
5.  Find the coordinates (r_in, c_in) of the top-rightmost pixel of the input segment (the red pixel with the smallest row index).
6.  Calculate the length of the output segment: `L_out = L + 1`.
7.  Calculate the coordinates (r_out, c_out) of the top-rightmost pixel for the output segment using the following rules:
    *   `r_out = r_in - (L + 1)`
    *   `c_out = c_in + min(L + 1, 3)`
8.  Draw the output red segment onto the output grid. Starting from the calculated (r_out, c_out), place `L_out` red pixels diagonally down and to the left. Specifically, color the pixels at coordinates `(r_out + i, c_out - i)` red, for `i` ranging from 0 up to `L_out - 1`.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
