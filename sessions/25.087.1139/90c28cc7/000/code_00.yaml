Input:
  - type: grid
  - contains:
      - object: background
        color: white (0)
        shape: fills the grid area not occupied by blocks
      - object: blocks
        count: variable (2 to 7 in examples)
        color: non-white (1-9)
        shape: rectangular, solid color
        arrangement: non-overlapping, separated by background

Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: determined by the number of distinct row and column intervals occupied by input blocks
  - content: each cell represents a specific region defined by a row and column interval from the input
  - cell_value: the color of the input block that occupies the corresponding region in the input grid

Transformation:
  - name: Block Color Summarization by Spatial Intervals
  - steps:
      1. Identify all distinct, contiguous, non-white blocks in the input grid.
      2. For each block, determine its bounding box (min/max row, min/max column).
      3. Collect all unique minimum and maximum row indices across all blocks. Sort these indices to define the boundaries of the 'row intervals'. The number of intervals determines the output grid height.
      4. Collect all unique minimum and maximum column indices across all blocks. Sort these indices to define the boundaries of the 'column intervals'. The number of intervals determines the output grid width.
      5. Create an output grid with the calculated height and width.
      6. For each cell `(r, c)` in the output grid, representing the `r`-th row interval and `c`-th column interval:
         - Find the input block whose bounding box overlaps with the spatial region defined by this row and column interval.
         - Assign the color of that block to the output cell `(r, c)`.
