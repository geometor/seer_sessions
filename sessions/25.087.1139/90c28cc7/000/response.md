Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a white background (color 0) and several distinct, non-overlapping, rectangular blocks of solid, non-white colors.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. Each cell in the output grid contains a non-white color corresponding to one of the blocks in the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to summarize the input grid by representing each color block with a single pixel of its color in the output grid. The arrangement of these pixels in the output grid preserves the relative spatial layout of the original blocks.
4.  **Layout Determination:** The key challenge is determining the dimensions and cell assignments of the output grid. Observing the examples, especially Example 2 and 3 where blocks might span multiple 'columns' or 'rows' in the output representation, suggests a method based on dividing the input grid conceptually. It looks like the grid is divided into rows and columns based on the vertical and horizontal extents of the blocks.
5.  **Interval Mapping:** The distinct ranges of rows occupied by blocks define the rows of the output grid. Similarly, the distinct ranges of columns occupied by blocks define the columns of the output grid. A block's color is placed in the output cell(s) corresponding to the row and column ranges it occupies. If a block spans multiple conceptual columns or rows (like the green block in Example 3 or the orange/gray blocks in Example 2), its color appears in multiple adjacent cells in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
  - contains:
      - object: background
        color: white (0)
        shape: fills the grid area not occupied by blocks
      - object: blocks
        count: variable (2 to 7 in examples)
        color: non-white (1-9)
        shape: rectangular, solid color
        arrangement: non-overlapping, separated by background

Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: determined by the number of distinct row and column intervals occupied by input blocks
  - content: each cell represents a specific region defined by a row and column interval from the input
  - cell_value: the color of the input block that occupies the corresponding region in the input grid

Transformation:
  - name: Block Color Summarization by Spatial Intervals
  - steps:
      1. Identify all distinct, contiguous, non-white blocks in the input grid.
      2. For each block, determine its bounding box (min/max row, min/max column).
      3. Collect all unique minimum and maximum row indices across all blocks. Sort these indices to define the boundaries of the 'row intervals'. The number of intervals determines the output grid height.
      4. Collect all unique minimum and maximum column indices across all blocks. Sort these indices to define the boundaries of the 'column intervals'. The number of intervals determines the output grid width.
      5. Create an output grid with the calculated height and width.
      6. For each cell `(r, c)` in the output grid, representing the `r`-th row interval and `c`-th column interval:
         - Find the input block whose bounding box overlaps with the spatial region defined by this row and column interval.
         - Assign the color of that block to the output cell `(r, c)`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all separate, contiguous blocks of non-white color in the input grid.
2.  Determine the vertical boundaries (top and bottom rows) and horizontal boundaries (leftmost and rightmost columns) for each identified block.
3.  Create a sorted list of unique row boundaries (both top and bottom edges of all blocks). These boundaries define a set of horizontal "bands" or "row intervals" across the input grid. The number of intervals between the minimum top edge and the maximum bottom edge defines the height of the output grid.
4.  Create a sorted list of unique column boundaries (both left and right edges of all blocks). These boundaries define a set of vertical "bands" or "column intervals" across the input grid. The number of intervals between the minimum left edge and the maximum right edge defines the width of the output grid.
5.  Construct the output grid with the determined height and width.
6.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid. This cell corresponds to the region formed by the intersection of the `r`-th row interval and the `c`-th column interval in the input grid.
7.  Find the color block from the input grid that occupies this specific region (i.e., whose bounding box overlaps with this interval intersection).
8.  Set the color of the output grid cell `(r, c)` to be the color of the identified input block.
