These shapes often have magenta pixels embedded within them or directly adjacent to them.\n3.  **Action:** The core action seems to be a selective removal or \"erasing\" process. Pixels are changed to the background color (white).\n4.  **Relationship:** The key relationship is adjacency. The magenta pixels affect the maroon pixels that are directly next to them (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally).\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
