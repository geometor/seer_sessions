Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), maroon (9 - main shapes), and magenta (6 - modifier/marker).
2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain one or more distinct shapes primarily composed of maroon pixels. These shapes often have magenta pixels embedded within them or directly adjacent to them.
3.  **Action:** The core action seems to be a selective removal or "erasing" process. Pixels are changed to the background color (white).
4.  **Relationship:** The key relationship is adjacency. The magenta pixels affect the maroon pixels that are directly next to them (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally).

**YAML Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static_canvas
  - object: shapes
    color: maroon (9)
    role: primary_structure
    properties:
      - can_be_adjacent_to_magenta
      - can_be_modified
  - object: markers
    color: magenta (6)
    role: modifier_trigger
    properties:
      - triggers_removal_of_self
      - triggers_removal_of_adjacent_maroon_pixels

actions:
  - action: identify_markers
    target: grid
    color: magenta (6)
    output: coordinates_of_magenta_pixels
  - action: identify_adjacent_maroon
    target: grid
    input: coordinates_of_magenta_pixels
    color_to_check: maroon (9)
    adjacency: orthogonal (up, down, left, right)
    output: coordinates_of_maroon_to_remove
  - action: remove_pixels
    target: grid_copy
    input: coordinates_of_magenta_pixels
    replacement_color: white (0)
  - action: remove_pixels
    target: grid_copy
    input: coordinates_of_maroon_to_remove
    replacement_color: white (0)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: marker (magenta, 6)
    to: shape_pixel (maroon, 9)
    condition: orthogonal (sharing an edge)
    effect: target_pixel_is_removed

transformation_goal: Modify the input grid by removing specific pixels based on the location of magenta markers.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  Find the coordinates (row and column) of all magenta (6) pixels in the *original* input grid.
3.  For each magenta pixel found, find the coordinates of all its orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) neighbors within the grid boundaries.
4.  Identify which of these neighbors in the *original* input grid are maroon (9). Collect the coordinates of these adjacent maroon pixels.
5.  Modify the copied grid:
    a.  Change the color of every pixel at the coordinates identified in step 2 (the original magenta pixels) to white (0).
    b.  Change the color of every pixel at the coordinates identified in step 4 (the maroon pixels adjacent to magenta pixels) to white (0).
6.  The modified copied grid is the final output.
