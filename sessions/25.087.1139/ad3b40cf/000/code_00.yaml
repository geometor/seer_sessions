Grid_Properties:
  background_color: 8 # azure
  reflection_axis_color: 1 # blue

Objects:
  - definition: Contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color, excluding background (8) and reflection axis (1).
  - colors_present_in_examples: [2, 5, 6, 7] # red, gray, magenta, orange

Relationships:
  - reflection_axis: A line of blue (1) pixels separates the grid conceptually.
  - objects_location: Objects are located relative to the reflection axis.

Actions:
  - identify_objects: Locate all distinct objects and their colors.
  - count_pixels: For each object color, sum the total number of pixels of that color across all objects.
  - select_reflection_color: Determine the color with the minimum total pixel count among all object colors.
  - reflect_objects: For every object matching the selected reflection color, calculate its mirror image across the blue (1) reflection axis.
  - merge: Combine the original input grid content with the newly calculated reflected pixels.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Find the blue line (axis).
  - Find all non-background, non-blue objects.
  - Count the pixels for each object color.
  - Identify the color with the fewest pixels.
  - Reflect all objects of that specific color across the blue line.
  - The output contains the original input plus the reflected objects.
