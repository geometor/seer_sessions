This line acts as an axis of symmetry or reflection. The line can be vertical (train_1), diagonal (train_2, specifically y = -x + c), or horizontal (train_3).\n4.  **Objects:** There are distinct shapes (objects) made of contiguous pixels of other colors (gray-5, red-2, orange-7, magenta-6). These objects are located relative to the blue line.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves reflecting *some* of the objects across the blue line. The original objects remain in their positions, and the reflected copies are added to the grid.\n6.  **Selective Reflection:** Crucially, not all objects are reflected. In each example, only objects of *one specific color* are reflected:\n    *   train_1: Only the gray (5) object is reflected.\n    *   train_2: Only the magenta (6) objects are reflected.\n    *   train_3: Only the red (2) objects are reflected.\n7.  **Determining the Reflected Color:** The color chosen for reflection appears to be the one that has the *minimum total pixel count* among all the object colors present in the input grid (excluding the background azure-8 and the line blue-1).\n    *   train_1: Gray count = 4, Red count = 5. Minimum is Gray (4). Reflect Gray.\n    *   train_2: Orange count = 6, Magenta count = 5. Minimum is Magenta (5). Reflect Magenta.\n    *   train_3: Red count = 7, Magenta count = 8. Minimum is Red (7). Reflect Red.\n8.  **Reflection Mechanics:** The reflection correctly mirrors the shape and color of the selected objects across the blue line axis (vertical, diagonal, or horizontal).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Identify the location and orientation (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of the blue (1) line, which serves as the reflection axis.\n3.  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid, defined as contiguous areas of pixels with colors other than azure (8) or blue (1).\n4.  Create a map to store the total pixel count for each distinct object color found.\n5.  Iterate through all pixels of the input grid. If a pixel is part of an object (not color 8 or 1), increment the count for its color in the map.\n6.  Find the color in the map that has the minimum total pixel count. This is the \"reflection color\".\n7.  Iterate through all pixels of the input grid again.\n8.  If a pixel's color matches the \"reflection color\":\n    a.  Calculate the coordinates of its reflected position across the blue line axis.\n    b.  Set the pixel at the calculated reflected coordinates in the output grid to the \"reflection color\". (Do not overwrite existing non-background pixels if reflection overlaps, though this doesn't occur in examples).\n9.  Return the modified output grid."
