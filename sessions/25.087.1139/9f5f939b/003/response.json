Adjacency Check: All four pixels immediately adjacent cardinally (up, down, left, right) must be within the grid boundaries AND must also be azure (8).\n2. Marker Check: All four pixels exactly two steps away cardinally (up, down, left, right) must be within the grid boundaries AND must be blue (1).\nIf both the Adjacency Check and the Marker Check are true for an azure pixel, change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid.
