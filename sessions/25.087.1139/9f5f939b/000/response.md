Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Composition:** The input grids are primarily composed of azure pixels (8), acting as a background. Scattered within this background are blue pixels (1).
2.  **Transformation:** The output grids are nearly identical to the input grids, with the only change being the appearance of one or more yellow pixels (4) in specific locations. These yellow pixels replace azure pixels from the input.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The placement of the yellow pixels seems determined by the configuration of the surrounding blue pixels. Observing the examples:
    *   In `train_1`, a yellow pixel appears at `(5, 4)`. In the input, this location is azure (8). Looking around this location, we find blue pixels at `(3, 4)`, `(7, 4)`, `(5, 2)`, and `(5, 6)`. Notice these blue pixels are exactly two steps away vertically (`row 5 +/- 2`) and horizontally (`col 4 +/- 2`) from the target `(5, 4)`.
    *   In `train_2`, a yellow pixel appears at `(4, 3)`. Checking the input: `(2, 3)`, `(6, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(4, 5)` are all blue. Again, these are two steps away in the cardinal directions from `(4, 3)`.
    *   In `train_3`, yellow pixels appear at `(5, 10)` and `(11, 12)`.
        *   For `(5, 10)`: Input blue pixels exist at `(3, 10)`, `(7, 10)`, `(5, 8)`, and `(5, 12)`. These are two steps away.
        *   For `(11, 12)`: Input blue pixels exist at `(9, 12)`, `(13, 12)`, `(11, 10)`, and `(11, 14)`. These are also two steps away.
4.  **Rule Inference:** The consistent pattern across all examples suggests a rule: An azure pixel (8) changes to a yellow pixel (4) if and only if it has blue pixels (1) located exactly two grid steps away in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

**Facts**


```yaml
Grid:
  background_color: azure (8)
Objects:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    distribution: scattered, sometimes forming pairs or lines
  - type: target_pixel
    color: azure (8) # Initially
    becomes: yellow (4) # Conditionally
Relationships:
  - type: spatial_pattern
    description: >
      A target pixel (azure) is identified based on the presence
      of four specific marker pixels (blue).
    details:
      marker_positions: Relative to the target pixel at (r, c), the marker pixels must be at (r-2, c), (r+2, c), (r, c-2), and (r, c+2).
Action:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    input_color: azure (8)
    output_color: yellow (4)
    condition: >
      The azure pixel must satisfy the spatial_pattern relationship
      with four blue marker pixels.
Grid Transformation:
  - type: pixel_wise_check
    description: >
      Each azure pixel in the input grid is checked against the
      spatial_pattern condition.
  - type: modification
    description: >
      If an azure pixel meets the condition, its color is changed to
      yellow in the output grid. Otherwise, its color remains unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, identified by its row `r` and column `c`.
3.  For the current pixel at `(r, c)`:
    a.  Check if the color of this pixel in the input grid is azure (8).
    b.  If it is azure, then perform the following checks, ensuring that the coordinates being checked are within the grid boundaries:
        i.  Check if the pixel at `(r-2, c)` exists and is blue (1).
        ii. Check if the pixel at `(r+2, c)` exists and is blue (1).
        iii. Check if the pixel at `(r, c-2)` exists and is blue (1).
        iv. Check if the pixel at `(r, c+2)` exists and is blue (1).
    c.  If *all four* of the checks in step 3b are true, then change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to yellow (4).
4.  If the pixel's color was not azure initially, or if the four conditions in step 3b were not all met, the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid keeps its original color from the input grid.
5.  After iterating through all pixels, the resulting output grid is the final transformation.
