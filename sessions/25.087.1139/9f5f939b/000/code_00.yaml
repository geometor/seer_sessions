Grid:
  background_color: azure (8)
Objects:
  - type: marker_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    distribution: scattered, sometimes forming pairs or lines
  - type: target_pixel
    color: azure (8) # Initially
    becomes: yellow (4) # Conditionally
Relationships:
  - type: spatial_pattern
    description: >
      A target pixel (azure) is identified based on the presence
      of four specific marker pixels (blue).
    details:
      marker_positions: Relative to the target pixel at (r, c), the marker pixels must be at (r-2, c), (r+2, c), (r, c-2), and (r, c+2).
Action:
  - type: conditional_color_change
    input_color: azure (8)
    output_color: yellow (4)
    condition: >
      The azure pixel must satisfy the spatial_pattern relationship
      with four blue marker pixels.
Grid Transformation:
  - type: pixel_wise_check
    description: >
      Each azure pixel in the input grid is checked against the
      spatial_pattern condition.
  - type: modification
    description: >
      If an azure pixel meets the condition, its color is changed to
      yellow in the output grid. Otherwise, its color remains unchanged.
