The output grid is generated by drawing lines based on these input pixels. For each non-white pixel in the input, its corresponding row and column in the output grid are filled with that pixel's color. However, where these drawn lines intersect (specifically, at the row of one input pixel and the column of *another* input pixel), the intersection point is colored red (2). The original positions of the input pixels retain their original colors in the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
