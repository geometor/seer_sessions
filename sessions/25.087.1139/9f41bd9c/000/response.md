*   **Perception:** The input grid contains a background of blue (1) pixels, a distinct gray (5) object (which may contain some blue pixels within its bounding box), and a solid block of magenta (6) pixels at the bottom. The transformation involves moving the gray object and modifying the top row of the magenta block based on the object's final position.

    actions:
      - action: identify

      - action: calculate_new_position
        target: movable_shape
        details:
          - vertical_movement: move down until the row just above the top row of the bottom_area
          - horizontal_movement:
              - if initial position is right-biased: move left until left edge reaches column 0
              - if initial position is left-biased: move right until right edge reaches the last column
      - action: move
        target: movable_shape
        from: original_position
        to: calculated_new_position
        effect_on_grid:
          - clear original area (fill with blue 1)
          - draw shape at new position
      - action: modify
        target: bottom_area
        details:
          - select: top row of the bottom_area
          - for_each: column in the selected row
          - condition: column index is *not* within the horizontal span of the movable_shape's new position
          - change_color: to maroon (9)
    relationships:
      - relationship: positioning
        object1: movable_shape (final position)
        object2: bottom_area
        detail: movable_shape stops directly above bottom_area
      - relationship: modification_dependency
        modifier: movable_shape (final horizontal position)
        modified: bottom_area (top row)
        result: creation of modified_area (maroon 9) in columns not occupied by the final shape position

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the gray (5) object, potentially containing blue (1) pixels within its bounding box, and note its initial bounding box coordinates.
    2.  Identify the solid block of magenta (6) pixels at the bottom of the grid and note the row index of its top edge.
    3.  Determine the target destination row for the top-left corner of the gray object's bounding box: this is the row index just above the top edge of the magenta block minus the height of the gray object's bounding box plus one.
    4.  Determine the target destination column for the top-left corner of the gray object's bounding box:
        *   If the initial horizontal center of the gray object is closer to the right edge of the grid, the target column is 0.
        *   If the initial horizontal center of the gray object is closer to the left edge of the grid (or centered), the target column is the grid width minus the width of the gray object's bounding box.
    5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    6.  Clear the area of the gray object in its original position in the output grid, filling it with blue (1) pixels.
    7.  Draw the gray object (including its internal blue pixels) at the calculated target destination (row, column) in the output grid.
    8.  Identify the row index corresponding to the top edge of the original magenta (6) block (let this be `magenta_top_row`).
    9.  Iterate through each column index (`col`) from 0 to the grid width minus 1.
    10. Check if the current column index `col` falls outside the horizontal range occupied by the gray object in its *new* position (i.e., `col < target_column` or `col >= target_column + width_of_gray_object`).
    11. If the condition in step 10 is true, change the pixel color at `(magenta_top_row, col)` in the output grid to maroon (9).
