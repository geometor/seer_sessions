Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the gray (5) object, potentially containing blue (1) pixels within its bounding box, and note its initial bounding box.
2. Identify the solid block of magenta (6) pixels at the bottom of the grid and note the row index of its top edge.
3. Determine the target destination row for the top-left corner of the gray object's bounding box: this is the row index just above the top edge of the magenta block minus the height of the gray object's bounding box plus one.
4. Determine the target destination column for the top-left corner of the gray object's bounding box:
    * If the initial horizontal center of the gray object is closer to the right edge of the grid, the target column is 0.
    * If the initial horizontal center of the gray object is closer to the left edge of the grid (or centered), the target column is the grid width minus the width of the gray object's bounding box.
5. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
6. Clear the area of the gray object in its original position in the output grid, filling it with the background color (blue 1).
7. Draw the gray object (including its internal blue pixels) at the calculated target destination (row, column) in the output grid.
8. Identify the row index corresponding to the top edge of the original magenta (6) block.
9. Iterate through each column index (`col`) from 0 to the grid width minus 1.
10. If the current column index `col` falls outside the horizontal range occupied by the gray object in its *new* position, change the pixel color at `(magenta_top_row, col)` in the output grid to maroon (9).
