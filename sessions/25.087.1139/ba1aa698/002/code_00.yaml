Task: Extrapolate vertical marker movement within repeating subgrids.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Contains multiple vertical repetitions of a base structure (subgrid).
    - Subgrids are separated by vertical columns of a single Border_Color (BC).
    - The entire grid is framed by the same Border_Color (BC) (top, bottom, left, right).
    - Each subgrid has an internal area filled primarily with a Background_Color (BGC).
  Objects:
    - Border: Pixels forming the outer frame and vertical separators, all with Border_Color.
    - Subgrids: Repeating vertical sections defined by the borders.
      - Properties: Identical dimensions, border color, and background color.
    - Marker_Object: A small, contiguous shape within each subgrid's content area.
      - Properties:
        - Consistent shape across all subgrids.
        - Composed of a single Marker_Color (MC), which might be the same as BC or BGC but is distinct from BGC unless MC==BC.
        - Occupies a specific top-left position (P) within each subgrid's content area.
        - The vertical component of P changes by a constant difference (Diff) between consecutive subgrids.
        - The horizontal component of P remains constant relative to the subgrid's content area.

Transformation:
  Action: Predict the next state of the system.
  Steps:
    1. Identify: Border_Color (BC), Background_Color (BGC), Marker_Color (MC).
    2. Segment: Locate vertical Border columns to define Subgrids.
    3. Analyze_Subgrids:
       - Extract the first subgrid as the Output_Template (including borders).
       - For each subgrid:
         - Identify the Marker_Object shape.
         - Identify the Marker_Object's top-left absolute row position (P_row) within the subgrid. (Note: Marker position is defined relative to the full subgrid, including top/bottom borders).
    4. Calculate_Movement: Determine the constant vertical difference (Diff = P_row_i+1 - P_row_i).
    5. Determine_Last_Position: Get the row position of the marker in the last subgrid (P_last).
    6. Predict_Next_Position: Calculate the target output row (Target_Row = P_last + Diff).
    7. Adjust_Position (Conditional): If Marker_Color (MC) is the same as Border_Color (BC), increment Target_Row by 1.
    8. Construct_Output:
       - Create a copy of the Output_Template.
       - Fill the content area (inside the borders) of the copy with Background_Color (BGC), overwriting any original marker.
       - Place the identified Marker_Object shape using its Marker_Color (MC) at the calculated Target_Row and its original relative horizontal position within the content area of the output grid copy.

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - A single grid structure identical in size, border, and background color to the first subgrid of the input.
    - Contains the Marker_Object placed at the extrapolated vertical position.
