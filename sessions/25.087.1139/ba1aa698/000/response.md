**Perception:**

The input grids consist of a large rectangle defined by a border color. This rectangle is divided vertically by lines of the same border color, creating several smaller, identical rectangular subgrids. Each subgrid has a uniform background color, different from the border color. Within each subgrid, there is a small "marker" object composed of a third color (which might sometimes be the same as the border color). The shape of the marker object is identical across all subgrids within a single input example, but its vertical position changes systematically from one subgrid to the next. The vertical distance between the marker objects in adjacent subgrids is constant.

The output grid is always the size and shape of one of these subgrids, including its left and right border lines. The border and background colors are preserved from the input's first subgrid. The output grid also contains the marker object, but its vertical position is different from any of the marker positions in the input grid.

The core transformation involves:
1.  Identifying the repeating subgrid structure and the marker object within it.
2.  Extracting the structure (dimensions, borders, background) of the first subgrid.
3.  Calculating the vertical positions of the markers in all input subgrids.
4.  Determining the constant vertical difference (step) between consecutive markers.
5.  Calculating a new vertical position for the marker in the output grid based on the position of the marker in the *last* input subgrid and the calculated step. A special adjustment is made if the marker color is the same as the border color.
6.  Placing the marker object at this newly calculated position within the extracted subgrid structure to form the final output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Structure:
  - Grid with an outer border.
  - Color: Border Color (BC) defines the border and vertical separators.
  - Divided into N vertical Subgrids by BC lines.
  - Each Subgrid:
    - Contains a uniform Background Color (BGC), different from BC (usually).
    - Contains a Marker Object (MO).
      - Composed of Marker Color (MC). Note: MC can sometimes be equal to BC.
      - Shape of MO is consistent across all N subgrids.
      - Vertical position (top-most row index, P_i) varies systematically across subgrids i=1 to N.
Properties:
  - Subgrids have identical dimensions and BGC.
  - The vertical step (Diff) between marker positions is constant: Diff = P_2 - P_1 = P_3 - P_2 = ... = P_N - P_(N-1).
  - P_last refers to the top-most row index of the MO in the last subgrid (P_N).
Output Structure:
  - A single grid matching the dimensions and structure of one input subgrid (including vertical BC borders).
  - Contains BC borders and BGC background, identical to the first input subgrid.
  - Contains the Marker Object (MO) shape.
Transformation:
  - Select: The structure (frame, BGC) of the first input subgrid is used as the base for the output.
  - Select: The shape of the MO is taken (e.g., from the last subgrid).
  - Calculate: Determine N, P_1, P_2, ..., P_N.
  - Calculate: Diff = P_2 - P_1 (or any P_i - P_(i-1)).
  - Calculate: P_last = P_N.
  - Calculate: Output marker starting row (Output_Row).
    - Base formula: Output_Row = P_last + Diff
    - Condition: If MC == BC, then Output_Row = P_last + Diff + 1.
  - Place: The MO is placed in the output grid structure starting at Output_Row. The horizontal position relative to the subgrid's content area is maintained.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the border color (BC), the background color (BGC) used inside the subgrids, and the marker color (MC).
2.  Identify the vertical columns that act as separators (using BC). Use these to determine the width and structure of the repeating subgrids. Count the number of subgrids (N).
3.  Isolate the content of each subgrid (excluding borders/separators).
4.  Find the "marker object" (contiguous pixels of MC) within each subgrid's content area. Verify the marker object has the same shape in all subgrids.
5.  For each subgrid `i` (from 1 to N), determine the top-most row index (P_i) of its marker object relative to the full input grid.
6.  Calculate the constant vertical step difference between consecutive marker positions: `Diff = P_2 - P_1`.
7.  Get the starting row index of the marker in the last subgrid: `P_last = P_N`.
8.  Calculate the target starting row index for the marker in the output grid (`Output_Row`) using the formula: `Output_Row = P_last + Diff`.
9.  Check if the marker color (MC) is identical to the border color (BC). If they are the same, increment the calculated `Output_Row` by 1.
10. Create the output grid by copying the first subgrid from the input, including its left and right border columns made of BC, and filling the interior with BGC.
11. Copy the shape of the marker object (e.g., from the last subgrid).
12. Place this marker object onto the output grid, starting at the calculated `Output_Row`. Ensure its horizontal position within the content area (relative to the left border column) is the same as the horizontal position of the markers within their respective input subgrids.
