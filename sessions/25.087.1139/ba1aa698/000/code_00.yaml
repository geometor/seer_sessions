Input Structure:
  - Grid with an outer border.
  - Color: Border Color (BC) defines the border and vertical separators.
  - Divided into N vertical Subgrids by BC lines.
  - Each Subgrid:
    - Contains a uniform Background Color (BGC), different from BC (usually).
    - Contains a Marker Object (MO).
      - Composed of Marker Color (MC). Note: MC can sometimes be equal to BC.
      - Shape of MO is consistent across all N subgrids.
      - Vertical position (top-most row index, P_i) varies systematically across subgrids i=1 to N.
Properties:
  - Subgrids have identical dimensions and BGC.
  - The vertical step (Diff) between marker positions is constant: Diff = P_2 - P_1 = P_3 - P_2 = ... = P_N - P_(N-1).
  - P_last refers to the top-most row index of the MO in the last subgrid (P_N).
Output Structure:
  - A single grid matching the dimensions and structure of one input subgrid (including vertical BC borders).
  - Contains BC borders and BGC background, identical to the first input subgrid.
  - Contains the Marker Object (MO) shape.
Transformation:
  - Select: The structure (frame, BGC) of the first input subgrid is used as the base for the output.
  - Select: The shape of the MO is taken (e.g., from the last subgrid).
  - Calculate: Determine N, P_1, P_2, ..., P_N.
  - Calculate: Diff = P_2 - P_1 (or any P_i - P_(i-1)).
  - Calculate: P_last = P_N.
  - Calculate: Output marker starting row (Output_Row).
    - Base formula: Output_Row = P_last + Diff
    - Condition: If MC == BC, then Output_Row = P_last + Diff + 1.
  - Place: The MO is placed in the output grid structure starting at Output_Row. The horizontal position relative to the subgrid's content area is maintained.
