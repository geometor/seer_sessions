These objects retain their shape and relative position in the output grid but change color. The background remains white (0). The transformation rule appears to depend on the *number* of distinct azure objects found in the input and their *spatial order*.\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The first step is to find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels. Each such group constitutes a distinct object.\n2.  **Object Ordering**: The identified objects need to be sorted. The examples suggest sorting based on the top-most, then left-most pixel of each object's bounding box (or simply the first pixel encountered in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).\n3.  **Color Assignment**: A specific sequence of colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, yellow=4) is assigned to the sorted objects. The exact sequence depends on the total number (N) of objects found.\n    *   If N=3, the sequence is [Blue(1), Blue(1), Green(3)].\n    *   If N=4, the sequence is [Red(2), Blue(1), Green(3), Blue(1)].\n    *   If N=5, the sequence is [Yellow(4), Yellow(4), Green(3), Red(2), Blue(1)].\n4.  **Output Generation**: The output grid is created by replacing the azure (8) pixels of each identified object with the color assigned to it based on its position in the sorted order and the N-dependent color sequence.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Count the total number of objects found, let this be N.\n2.  For each object, determine its top-most, left-most coordinate (the minimum row index, and for that row, the minimum column index containing an azure pixel of that object).\n3.  Sort the objects based on their top-left coordinates, primarily by row index (ascending) and secondarily by column index (ascending).\n4.  Determine the sequence of colors to assign based on the total number of objects (N):\n    *   If N = 3, the color sequence is [Blue, Blue, Green].\n    *   If N = 4, the color sequence is [Red, Blue, Green, Blue].\n    *   If N = 5, the color sequence is [Yellow, Yellow, Green, Red, Blue].\n    *   (Assuming the colors map as Blue=1, Red=2, Green=3, Yellow=4).\n5.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n6.  Iterate through the sorted objects from 1 to N. For the k-th object in the sorted list, replace all its azure (8) pixels in the output grid with the k-th color from the determined color sequence.\n7.  Keep all original white (0) pixels unchanged.\n8.  Return the final modified grid as the output."
