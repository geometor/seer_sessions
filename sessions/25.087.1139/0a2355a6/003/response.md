"""
Recolors azure (8) objects in a grid based on their count (N), sort order (top-left, row-major), and the grid's height (H).

1. Find all distinct contiguous objects of azure (8) pixels using 4-way connectivity.
2. Count the total number of objects (N).
3. Sort the objects based on their top-most, left-most pixel (row-major order).
4. Determine the height (H) of the input grid.
5. Determine the color sequence based on N and H:
   - If N = 3: sequence = [Blue(1), Blue(1), Green(3)]
   - If N = 4 and H < 15: sequence = [Red(2), Blue(1), Green(3), Blue(1)]
   - If N = 4 and H >= 15: sequence = [Yellow(4), Green(3), Red(2), Blue(1)]
6. Replace the azure (8) pixels of the k-th sorted object with the k-th color from the determined sequence.
7. Keep the background white (0) pixels unchanged.
