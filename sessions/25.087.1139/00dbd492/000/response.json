The fill colors observed are green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8).\n    *   The specific fill color for a shape seems to depend on the vertical position of the single internal red pixel relative to the top edge of its enclosing shape.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "

For each red group, analyze its structure to determine if it represents a hollow shape (an \"Outer Border\") enclosing both white (0) pixels (the \"Interior\") and at least one disconnected red pixel (an \"Internal Pixel\"). Focus on shapes with exactly one Internal Pixel.\n    3.  For each such identified hollow shape with a single Internal Pixel:\n        a.  Determine the bounding box of the Outer Border (minimum and maximum row and column indices).\n        b.  Find the coordinates (row, column) of the single Internal Pixel.\n        c.  Calculate the relative row index of the Internal Pixel: `relative_row = Internal_Pixel_row - bounding_box_min_row`.\n        d.  Select the fill color based on the `relative_row`:\n            *   If `relative_row` is 2, the fill color is Azure (8).\n            *   If `relative_row` is 3, the fill color is Yellow (4).\n            *   If `relative_row` is 4, the fill color is Green (3).\n        e.  Identify all white (0) pixels that are located within the Interior of this specific Outer Border.\n        f.  In the output grid, change the color of these identified Interior white pixels to the selected fill color.\n    4.  Copy all other pixels (the Outer Borders, the Internal Pixels, and any pixels not part of these structures) from the input grid to the output grid without modification.\n    5.
