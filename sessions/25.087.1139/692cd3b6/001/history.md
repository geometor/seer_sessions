**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain a white background (color 0), two distinct "U" shaped objects made of red pixels (color 2), and a single gray pixel (color 5).
2.  **Object Structure:** Each red "U" shape is 3x3 pixels, with the center pixel missing (or replaced in some cases). One pixel within one of the "U" shapes is gray (color 5). The orientation and position of these "U" shapes vary across examples.
3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the original red "U" shapes and the gray pixel. Additionally, some areas previously occupied by white pixels (color 0) are now filled with yellow pixels (color 4).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a "flood fill" or "paint bucket" operation originating from the position of the gray pixel.
5.  **Fill Color:** The fill color is yellow (color 4).
6.  **Boundaries:** The red pixels (color 2) act as boundaries, stopping the spread of the yellow fill. The fill does not cross or replace the red pixels.
7.  **Fill Area:** The yellow fill replaces white pixels (color 0) that are reachable from the gray pixel's starting location without crossing any red pixels. The fill expands outwards in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
8.  **Gray Pixel:** The gray pixel's location dictates the starting point of the fill. The gray pixel itself remains in the output unless it gets overwritten by the yellow fill originating *from* its own location (which happens if the cell it occupies was originally white, but in these examples, it seems to always replace a red pixel initially, or is adjacent to red pixels, and its final state depends on whether the yellow fill reaches its specific coordinate). In the examples, the gray pixel persists, suggesting it's either not replaced by the fill starting from its own coordinate or it's placed within the red shape structure in a way that it doesn't get overwritten. Let's re-examine example 1. Input has gray at (4, 10). Output has gray at (4, 10). Yellow fill reaches (4, 11), (4, 12), (5, 12) adjacent to it. Re-examine example 2. Input gray at (11, 12). Output gray at (11, 12). Re-examine example 3. Input gray at (13, 10). Output gray at (13, 10). It seems the gray pixel *always* remains, even if yellow fill surrounds it. The fill operation starts conceptually *from* the gray pixel's location but only affects *white* pixels.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Perform a flood fill operation starting from a specific pixel, bounded by other pixels."
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fillable_area
  - object: boundary
    color: red (2)
    shape: "U" shape (3x3 with a potential center variation)
    count: 2 per grid
    role: stops_fill
  - object: fill_origin
    color: gray (5)
    count: 1 per grid
    location: within or adjacent to one of the red 'U' shapes
    role: defines_start_point_for_fill
  - object: fill_color
    color: yellow (4)
    role: replaces_background_pixels
transformation:
  type: flood_fill
  start_point: location of the gray (5) pixel
  fill_color: yellow (4)
  target_color: white (0)
  boundary_color: red (2)
  persistence:
    - red pixels remain unchanged.
    - the gray pixel remains unchanged at its original location.
    - white pixels reachable from the start_point without crossing boundaries are changed to yellow.
    - other white pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the location (row, column) of the single gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid. This is the starting point for the fill operation.
2.  Identify all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid. These act as boundaries.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from the identified gray pixel's location:
    *   Use yellow (color 4) as the fill color.
    *   Only change pixels that are currently white (color 0).
    *   Do not cross or change pixels that are red (color 2).
    *   The fill should spread cardinally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent eligible white pixels.
5.  Ensure the original gray pixel (color 5) remains unchanged at its starting location in the final output grid (it should not be overwritten by the yellow fill).
6.  The resulting grid after the fill operation (respecting boundaries and preserving the gray pixel) is the final output.
