The transformation rule involves a constrained flood fill operation originating from white pixels adjacent to gray pixels.

1.  **Identify Boundaries and Seeds:**
    *   Red pixels (2) and gray pixels (5) act as strict boundaries for the fill.
    *   White pixels (0) immediately adjacent (cardinally) to any gray pixel (5) are the starting points (seeds) for the fill.

2.  **Distinguish Inner vs. Outer White Pixels:**
    *   The grid contains white pixels (0) that are part of the general background ("outer") and white pixels that are enclosed or separated from the background by the red/gray boundaries ("inner").
    *   Only "inner" white pixels are potentially fillable.
    *   To identify "outer" pixels, perform a preliminary flood fill starting from all white pixels on the grid's border. This fill uses red and gray pixels as boundaries. Any white pixel reachable from the border is marked as "outer".

3.  **Perform Constrained Fill:**
    *   Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    *   Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the seed pixels identified in step 1.
    *   The BFS propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).
    *   During the BFS, if a reachable pixel is:
        *   White (0) **and** was *not* marked as "outer" in step 2: Change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid and add it to the BFS queue.
        *   Red (2), Gray (5), or an "outer" white pixel: It acts as a boundary, stopping the fill along that path.
    *   Pixels already visited during the BFS are not processed again.

4.  **Final Output:**
    *   The output grid contains the original red and gray pixels, the "outer" white pixels remain white, and the "inner" white pixels reachable from the seeds are changed to yellow.

## General Assessment

The provided code consistently fails because the implemented flood fill logic does not execute as intended. The transformed output is identical to the input in all examples, indicating that no white pixels are being changed to yellow.

The core issue lies in the "Outer Background" identification step. This step performs a flood fill from the border white pixels, marking any reachable white pixel as "outer background". Because the areas intended for the yellow fill are connected to the border in the input grids (without being completely enclosed by red/gray boundaries *from the border's perspective*), this preliminary fill marks *all* white pixels, including the intended seed pixels (white neighbors of gray), as "outer". Consequently, the main fill condition `not is_outer_background[nr, nc]` is never met, and no pixels are colored yellow.

The strategy for resolution is to **remove the concept of pre-identifying "outer background"** and simplify the logic to a direct flood fill:
1.  Identify seed pixels: White pixels adjacent (cardinally) to gray pixels.
2.  Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from these seeds.
3.  The fill should propagate only through white pixels.
4.  Red and gray pixels act as boundaries, stopping the fill.
5.  Filled white pixels are changed to yellow.
