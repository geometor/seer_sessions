This fill uses red and gray pixels as boundaries. Any white pixel reachable from the border is marked as \"outer\".\n\n3.  **Perform Constrained Fill:**\n    *   Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    *   Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the seed pixels identified in step 1.\n    *   The BFS propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).\n    *   During the BFS, if a reachable pixel is:\n        *   White (0) **and** was *not* marked as \"outer\" in step 2: Change its color to yellow (4) in the output grid and add it to the BFS queue.\n        *   Red (2), Gray (5), or an \"outer\" white pixel: It acts as a boundary, stopping the fill along that path.\n    *   Pixels already visited during the BFS are not processed again.\n\n4.  **Final Output:**\n    *   The output grid contains the original red and gray pixels, the \"outer\" white pixels remain white, and the \"inner\" white pixels reachable from the seeds are changed to yellow.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a bounded flood fill starting from neighbors of gray pixels,\n    constrained to not fill the 'outer' background white space.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    output_grid = grid.copy()\n    height, width = grid.shape\n\n    # Define colors\n    background_color = 0 # white (potentially fillable)\n    boundary_color_1 = 2   # red (barrier)\n    start_pixel_color = 5 # gray (origin point, also barrier)\n    fill_color = 4       # yellow (fill result)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Identify Outer Background ---\n    is_outer_background = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    outer_queue = deque()\n    outer_visited = set()\n\n    # Add barriers to visited set for outer fill\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r, c] == boundary_color_1 or grid[r, c] == start_pixel_color:\n                outer_visited.add((r, c))\n\n    # Add border white pixels as starting points for outer fill\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in [0, width -
