task_description: "Perform a flood fill operation starting from a specific pixel, bounded by other pixels."
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: fillable_area
  - object: boundary
    color: red (2)
    shape: "U" shape (3x3 with a potential center variation)
    count: 2 per grid
    role: stops_fill
  - object: fill_origin
    color: gray (5)
    count: 1 per grid
    location: within or adjacent to one of the red 'U' shapes
    role: defines_start_point_for_fill
  - object: fill_color
    color: yellow (4)
    role: replaces_background_pixels
transformation:
  type: flood_fill
  start_point: location of the gray (5) pixel
  fill_color: yellow (4)
  target_color: white (0)
  boundary_color: red (2)
  persistence:
    - red pixels remain unchanged.
    - the gray pixel remains unchanged at its original location.
    - white pixels reachable from the start_point without crossing boundaries are changed to yellow.
    - other white pixels remain unchanged.
