One pixel within one of the \"U\" shapes is gray (color 5). The orientation and position of these \"U\" shapes vary across examples.\n3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids retain the original red \"U\" shapes and the gray pixel. Additionally, some areas previously occupied by white pixels (color 0) are now filled with yellow pixels (color 4).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" operation originating from the position of the gray pixel.\n5.  **Fill Color:** The fill color is yellow (color 4).\n6.  **Boundaries:** The red pixels (color 2) act as boundaries, stopping the spread of the yellow fill. The fill does not cross or replace the red pixels.\n7.  **Fill Area:** The yellow fill replaces white pixels (color 0) that are reachable from the gray pixel's starting location without crossing any red pixels. The fill expands outwards in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n8.  **Gray Pixel:** The gray pixel's location dictates the starting point of the fill. The gray pixel itself remains in the output unless it gets overwritten by the yellow fill originating *from* its own location (which happens if the cell it occupies was originally white, but in these examples, it seems to always replace a red pixel initially, or is adjacent to red pixels, and its final state depends on whether the yellow fill reaches its specific coordinate). In the examples, the gray pixel persists, suggesting it's either not replaced by the fill starting from its own coordinate or it's placed within the red shape structure in a way that it doesn't get overwritten. Let's re-examine example 1. Input has gray at (4, 10). Output has gray at (4, 10). Yellow fill reaches (4, 11), (4, 12), (5, 12) adjacent to it. Re-examine example 2. Input gray at (11, 12). Output gray at (11, 12). Re-examine example 3. Input gray at (13, 10). Output gray at (13, 10). It seems the gray pixel *always* remains, even if yellow fill surrounds it. The fill operation starts conceptually *from* the gray pixel's location but only affects *white* pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
