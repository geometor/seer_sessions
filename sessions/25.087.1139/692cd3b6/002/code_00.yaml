task_context:
  description: Perform a bounded flood fill operation on a grid.
  input_colors: [white (0), red (2), gray (5)]
  output_colors: [white (0), red (2), yellow (4), gray (5)]
  grid_size: Consistent across examples (15x15 observed).

objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fillable area.
  - id: boundary
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - Forms structures, often 'U' shapes or enclosures.
      - Typically located near gray pixels.
    role: Impassable barrier for the fill operation. Remains unchanged.
  - id: start_point
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - Multiple instances possible (2 observed in examples).
      - Location varies.
    role: Defines the origin points for the fill conceptually. Remains unchanged.
  - id: fill_area
    color: yellow (4)
    role: Result of filling white background pixels under specific conditions. Not present in input.

actions:
  - name: identify_start_neighbors
    input: grid, start_point(s)
    output: set of initial white pixels adjacent (cardinally) to any gray pixel.
    description: Find all white pixels directly next to any gray pixel. These are the seeds for the fill.
  - name: flood_fill
    input: grid, initial white neighbors
    output: modified grid
    description: >
      Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the initial white neighbors.
      Change reachable white pixels (0) to yellow (4).
      The fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).
      The fill cannot enter or cross red (2) pixels (boundaries).
      The fill cannot change gray (5) pixels.
      The fill only affects connected white pixels reachable from the initial set without crossing boundaries.

constraints:
  - Fill only targets white (0) pixels.
  - Red (2) pixels are impassable barriers.
  - Gray (5) pixels remain unchanged and act as conceptual origins.
  - Fill propagates cardinally only.
  - The final output grid contains the original red and gray pixels, potentially some original white pixels (those not reachable by the fill), and the newly added yellow pixels.
