Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our approach.

**1. General Assessment**

The previous code attempted a flood fill originating conceptually from the gray pixel(s), bounded by red pixels, and filling white areas with yellow. However, the execution results show that the implementation incorrectly filled almost the entire grid with yellow in all examples, rather than confining the fill to specific regions defined by the red boundaries around the gray pixels.

The core issue seems to be how the flood fill was initiated and bounded. The previous code started the fill from the *neighbors* of the gray pixel and didn't correctly enforce the boundary conditions, allowing the fill to escape the intended regions.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Re-examine the Fill Origin:** The fill should originate *conceptually* from the gray pixel(s). This means the process starts by identifying the white neighbors adjacent to *any* gray pixel. These white neighbors are the initial candidates for being filled yellow.
2.  **Refine Boundary Logic:** The flood fill (using yellow) should only propagate through contiguous white pixels. Red pixels act as strict boundaries; the fill cannot enter or cross red pixels. The fill should be contained within the connected white area(s) that are adjacent to the initial gray pixel(s).
3.  **Handle Multiple Gray Pixels:** The examples show cases with multiple gray pixels. The fill should initiate from the vicinity of *all* gray pixels and potentially merge if the white regions they influence are connected and not separated by red boundaries.
4.  **Implement BFS Correctly:** Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the initial set of white neighbors adjacent to gray pixels. Maintain a `visited` set to avoid redundant processing and infinite loops. Ensure that the BFS only adds white, unvisited neighbors to the queue and colors them yellow in the output grid. Red pixels should stop the propagation in that direction.

**2. Metrics and Observations**

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   **Grid Size:** Consistent at 15x15.
*   **Gray Pixels:** Always 2 gray pixels (color 5) present in the input.
*   **Red Pixels:** Always 14 red pixels (color 2) present, forming boundary structures ('U' shapes) around/near the gray pixels.
*   **White Pixels (Input):** Consistently 209 white pixels (color 0) initially.
*   **Yellow Pixels (Expected vs. Transformed):** This is the major discrepancy. The transformed output consistently converts *all* original white pixels to yellow (209 yellow pixels). The expected output has significantly fewer yellow pixels (48, 58, 114), indicating the fill is selective and bounded.
*   **White Pixels (Expected vs. Transformed):** Consequently, the transformed output has 0 white pixels remaining, while the expected output retains a large number (161, 151, 95).
*   **Pixels Off:** The number of pixels off matches the number of white pixels that *should have remained* white in the expected output.

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The analysis confirms the previous assessment. The flood fill implementation incorrectly fills *all* reachable white space, ignoring the implied containment by the red boundaries relative to the gray pixels. The fill needs to start from the white neighbors of the gray pixels and be strictly contained by red boundaries.

    role: Fillable area.
  - id: boundary
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - Forms structures, often 'U' shapes or enclosures.

    description: >
      Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the initial white neighbors.
      Change reachable white pixels (0) to yellow (4).
      The fill propagates cardinally (up, down, left, right).
      The fill cannot enter or cross red (2) pixels (boundaries).
      The fill cannot change gray (5) pixels.
      The fill only affects connected white pixels reachable from the initial set without crossing boundaries.

constraints:
  - Fill only targets white (0) pixels.
  - Red (2) pixels are impassable barriers.
  - Gray (5) pixels remain unchanged and act as conceptual origins.
  - Fill propagates cardinally only.
  - The final output grid contains the original red and gray pixels, potentially some original white pixels (those not reachable by the fill), and the newly added yellow pixels.
```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Find all unique white (0) pixels that are cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to *any* of the identified gray pixels. These are the initial "seed" pixels for the fill.
4.  Create a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) and add all seed pixels to the queue.
5.  Create a set to keep track of visited coordinates, and add all seed pixels to the visited set.
6.  For each seed pixel added to the queue, change its color in the *output grid* to yellow (4).
7.  While the queue is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue a coordinate `(r, c)`.
    b.  Examine its four cardinal neighbors `(nr, nc)`.
    c.  For each neighbor `(nr, nc)`:
        i.   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries.
        ii.  Check if `(nr, nc)` has *not* been visited.
        iii. Check if the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *input grid* is white (0).
        iv.  If all checks (i, ii, iii) pass:
            1.  Change the color of the pixel at `(nr, nc)` in the *output grid* to yellow (4).
            2.  Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited.
            3.  Enqueue `(nr, nc)`.
        v.   Else (if the neighbor is out of bounds, already visited, or not white in the input): Mark `(nr, nc)` as visited (to prevent re-checking from other paths, especially useful for boundaries).
8.  Return the modified output grid.
