## General Assessment

The provided code consistently fails because the implemented flood fill logic does not execute as intended. The transformed output is identical to the input in all examples, indicating that no white pixels are being changed to yellow.

The core issue lies in the "Outer Background" identification step. This step performs a flood fill from the border white pixels, marking any reachable white pixel as "outer background". Because the areas intended for the yellow fill are connected to the border in the input grids (without being completely enclosed by red/gray boundaries *from the border's perspective*), this preliminary fill marks *all* white pixels, including the intended seed pixels (white neighbors of gray), as "outer". Consequently, the main fill condition `not is_outer_background[nr, nc]` is never met, and no pixels are colored yellow.

The strategy for resolution is to **remove the concept of pre-identifying "outer background"** and simplify the logic to a direct flood fill:
1.  Identify seed pixels: White pixels adjacent (cardinally) to gray pixels.
2.  Perform a flood fill (BFS) starting from these seeds.
3.  The fill should propagate only through white pixels.
4.  Red and gray pixels act as boundaries, stopping the fill.
5.  Filled white pixels are changed to yellow.
