            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because it was based on an incomplete understanding derived from only the first training example. The core issues were:\n1.  **Incorrect Identification of Trigger Objects:** The logic didn't correctly identify *which* red objects trigger the drawing of blue shapes. It missed the crucial \"isolation\" criterion (not being adjacent to any input blue pixels).\n2.  **Incomplete Handling of Cases:** The code only attempted logic for the vertical 1x1 pair seen in Example 1. It lacked the specific logic for the horizontal 2x2 pair (Example 2) and the single isolated object (Example 3).\n3.  **Flawed Drawing Logic:** Even for the case it attempted (Example 1), the drawing logic failed, producing incorrect output. The coordinate calculations for the new blue shapes were likely incorrect or the pair identification failed.\n\nThe strategy for resolving these errors is to:\n1.  Re-analyze all training examples to confirm the \"isolation\" rule for red objects.\n2.  Identify the distinct cases based on the shape and arrangement of *isolated* red objects (single objects, vertical 1x1 pairs, horizontal 2x2 pairs).\n3.  Carefully determine the exact geometry (position, size, shape) of the blue structures added for each case, relative to the trigger object(s).\n4.  Update the natural language program and subsequently the Python code to reflect this comprehensive understanding.\n\n## Metrics\n\nUsing `tool_code` to analyze the examples:\n"
