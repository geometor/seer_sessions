Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct red (2) objects and blue (1) objects in the input grid, considering pixels connected 8-directionally (including diagonals) as part of the same object. Store the coordinates of all pixels belonging to blue objects.
3.  Determine which red objects are "isolated". A red object is isolated if none of its pixels are adjacent (8-directionally) to any pixel belonging to any *original* blue object.
4.  Create a list of the isolated red objects and sort them based on their top-left corner coordinates (first by row, then by column). Keep track of which isolated objects have been processed.
5.  Iterate through the sorted list of isolated red objects to find and process specific pairs:
    *   **Vertical 1x1 Pair:** Search for two *unprocessed* isolated red objects where both are single pixels (1x1), have the same column index `c`, and their row indices `r1`, `r2` satisfy `r2 = r1 + 3`. If found:
        *   Draw a blue 'T' shape immediately below the first pixel: a horizontal 3-pixel bar at `r1+1` (cols `c-1` to `c+1`) and a vertical 1-pixel stem at `(r1+2, c)`.
        *   Draw an identical blue 'T' shape relative to the second pixel (rows `r2+1`, `r2+2`).
        *   Mark both red objects as processed.
    *   **Horizontal 2x2 Pair:** Search for two *unprocessed* isolated red objects where both are 2x2 squares, located on the same rows `r` and `r+1`, with the second square starting at a column `c2` that is at least 2 columns to the right of the first square's starting column `c1` (i.e., `c2 > c1+1`). Let the first square span columns `c1` to `c1+1` and the second span `c2` to `c2+1`. If found:
        *   Draw a blue connector rectangle of size 2xN between the squares: rows `r` to `r+1`, columns `c1+2` to `c2-1`.
        *   Draw a blue 2x2 square centered horizontally below the connector rectangle, starting at row `r+2`.
        *   Draw a blue bottom rectangle of size 2xM below the square structure: rows `r+4` to `r+5`, columns `c1+2` to `c2+1`.
        *   Mark both red objects as processed.
6.  Iterate through the list of isolated red objects again. For any isolated red object that is still *unprocessed*:
    *   Find its bounding box `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.
    *   If its minimum column `c1` is greater than 0, draw a blue rectangle covering all cells from row `r1` to `r2` and column `0` to `c1-1`.
7.  Return the modified output grid.

## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it was based on an incomplete understanding derived from only the first training example. The core issues were:
1.  **Incorrect Identification of Trigger Objects:** The logic didn't correctly identify *which* red objects trigger the drawing of blue shapes. It missed the crucial "isolation" criterion (not being adjacent to any input blue pixels).
2.  **Incomplete Handling of Cases:** The code only attempted logic for the vertical 1x1 pair seen in Example 1. It lacked the specific logic for the horizontal 2x2 pair (Example 2) and the single isolated object (Example 3).
3.  **Flawed Drawing Logic:** Even for the case it attempted (Example 1), the drawing logic failed, producing incorrect output. The coordinate calculations for the new blue shapes were likely incorrect or the pair identification failed.

The strategy for resolving these errors is to:
1.  Re-analyze all training examples to confirm the "isolation" rule for red objects.
2.  Identify the distinct cases based on the shape and arrangement of *isolated* red objects (single objects, vertical 1x1 pairs, horizontal 2x2 pairs).
3.  Carefully determine the exact geometry (position, size, shape) of the blue structures added for each case, relative to the trigger object(s).
4.  Update the natural language program and subsequently the Python code to reflect this comprehensive understanding.

**Assessment of Metrics Output:** The `tool_code` execution failed because it seems `skimage` is not available in the execution environment, resulting in empty analysis. I will proceed based on my manual analysis performed during the thought process, which confirmed the isolation concept and the structure of added blue shapes.

Manual Analysis Summary:

*   **Example 1:** 6 input red pixels (2 non-isolated, 4 isolated). The 4 isolated form two vertical pairs. Output adds 8 blue pixels (two 4-pixel T-shapes).
*   **Example 2:** 6 input red pixels (2 non-isolated, 4 isolated forming two 2x2 squares). The two isolated 2x2 squares form one horizontal pair. Output adds 24 blue pixels (8+4+12 structure).
*   **Example 3:** 10 input red pixels (1 non-isolated, 9 isolated forming one 3x3 square). The single isolated 3x3 square triggers the action. Output adds 21 blue pixels (3x7 rectangle).

## Facts


```yaml
# Defines colors used in the task
colors:
  BACKGROUND: 0 # white
  BLUE: 1
  RED: 2

# Describes the process
process:
  - Identify objects:
      - Find all connected components (8-way adjacency) of RED pixels.
      - Find all connected components (8-way adjacency) of BLUE pixels in the input.
      - Create a set of all coordinates occupied by input BLUE pixels.
  - Filter RED objects:
      - A RED object is 'isolated' if none of its pixels are adjacent (8-way, including diagonals) to any input BLUE pixel.
      - Separate RED objects into 'isolated' and 'non-isolated'. Non-isolated objects are ignored.
  - Process isolated RED objects:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Sort isolated RED objects based on their top-left bounding box corner (row, then column).
      - Attempt to find and process pairs first, marking processed objects.
      - Check for Vertical 1x1 Pairs:
          - Condition: Two *unprocessed* isolated RED objects, both are single pixels (1x1), located at `(r1, c)` and `(r2, c)` where `r2 == r1 + 3`.
          - Action: Draw two blue T-shapes.
              - T1 below (r1, c): Horizontal bar at `(r1+1, c-1:c+1)`, stem at `(r1+2, c)`.
              - T2 below (r2, c): Horizontal bar at `(r2+1, c-1:c+1)`, stem at `(r2+2, c)`.
          - Mark both objects as processed.
      - Check for Horizontal 2x2 Pairs:
          - Condition: Two *unprocessed* isolated RED objects, both are 2x2 squares, located with top-left corners at `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` where `c2 > c1 + 1` (meaning the squares share the same rows `r, r+1` and there's a horizontal gap between them). Let the first square end at column `c1+1`.
          - Action: Draw a blue structure connecting and below the pair.
              - Connector: Rectangle from `(r, c1+2)` to `(r+1, c2-1)`.
              - Mid-Square: 2x2 square starting at row `r+2`, horizontally positioned below the connector such that its columns are `sc` and `sc+1`, where `sc = (c1+2) + floor((c2 - (c1+1) - 2) / 2)`. Simplified: `sc = c1 + 2 + floor((c2 - c1 - 3) / 2)`. Re-simplified: `sc = (c1+2) + floor((conn_width)/2)`. (Where `conn_width = c2 - 1 - (c1+2) + 1`). Let's stick to the logic derived from example 2: `start_col = connector_start_col + floor(connector_width / 2)`. Connector starts col `c1+1+1 = c1+2`. Connector ends col `c2-1`. Width `w = (c2-1) - (c1+2) + 1 = c2 - c1 - 2`. Square start col `sc = (c1+2) + floor(w/2)`.
              - Bottom Rectangle: Rectangle from `(r+4, c1+2)` to `(r+5, c2+1)`.
          - Mark both objects as processed.
      - Process Remaining Single Isolated Objects:
          - Condition: Any isolated RED object that has not been marked as processed.
          - Action:
              - Get the object's bounding box `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.
              - If `c1 > 0`, draw a blue rectangle covering rows `r1` to `r2` and columns `0` to `c1-1`.

# Input/Output relationship
transformation:
  - Input grid contains RED (2) and sometimes BLUE (1) objects.
  - Output grid is the input grid plus additional BLUE (1) shapes.
  - The presence and configuration of *isolated* RED objects determine which, if any, BLUE shapes are added.
  - Isolation means a RED object is not adjacent (8-way) to any original BLUE pixel.
  - Three patterns trigger blue additions:
      1. Vertically aligned 1x1 isolated red pair -> Two blue T-shapes below.
      2. Horizontally aligned 2x2 isolated red pair -> Blue connector/square/rectangle structure.
      3. Single isolated red object (not part of a pair) -> Blue rectangle to its left.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct red (color 2) objects and all blue (color 1) pixel coordinates in the input grid. Use 8-way adjacency for object connectivity.
3.  Determine which red objects are "isolated" by checking if any pixel within a red object is adjacent (8-way, including diagonals) to any blue pixel coordinate found in the input grid. Red objects without such adjacency are considered isolated.
4.  Create a list of the isolated red objects, storing their coordinates and calculating their bounding boxes and shapes (e.g., 1x1, 2x2).
5.  Sort the list of isolated red objects primarily by the top row of their bounding box, and secondarily by the left column.
6.  Initialize a tracking mechanism (e.g., a set of processed object indices) to keep track of which isolated red objects have been handled.
7.  Iterate through the sorted list to find and process **Vertical 1x1 Pairs**:
    *   Search for an *unprocessed* isolated red object `obj1` that is a 1x1 pixel at `(r1, c)`.
    *   Search subsequent *unprocessed* isolated red objects for `obj2` that is also a 1x1 pixel, located at `(r2, c)` where `r2 = r1 + 3` (same column, 3 rows below).
    *   If such a pair `(obj1, obj2)` is found:
        *   Draw a blue 'T' shape below `obj1`: a 3-pixel horizontal bar `(r1+1, c-1)` to `(r1+1, c+1)` and a 1-pixel vertical stem at `(r1+2, c)`.
        *   Draw an identical blue 'T' shape relative to `obj2`: a horizontal bar `(r2+1, c-1)` to `(r2+1, c+1)` and a stem at `(r2+2, c)`.
        *   Mark both `obj1` and `obj2` as processed. Continue the search for other pairs.
8.  Iterate through the sorted list again to find and process **Horizontal 2x2 Pairs**:
    *   Search for an *unprocessed* isolated red object `obj1` that is a 2x2 square with bounding box `(r, c1, r+1, c1+1)`.
    *   Search subsequent *unprocessed* isolated red objects for `obj2` that is also a 2x2 square, located with bounding box `(r, c2, r+1, c2+1)` such that `c2 > c1 + 1` (same rows, horizontal gap).
    *   If such a pair `(obj1, obj2)` is found:
        *   Draw a blue connector rectangle covering rows `r` to `r+1` and columns `c1+2` to `c2-1`.
        *   Calculate the connector's start column `conn_sc = c1+2` and width `conn_w = c2 - c1 - 2`.
        *   Calculate the starting column for the square below: `square_sc = conn_sc + floor(conn_w / 2)`.
        *   Draw a blue 2x2 square covering rows `r+2` to `r+3` and columns `square_sc` to `square_sc+1`.
        *   Draw a blue bottom rectangle covering rows `r+4` to `r+5` and columns `c1+2` to `c2+1`.
        *   Mark both `obj1` and `obj2` as processed. Continue the search for other pairs.
9.  Iterate through the list of isolated red objects one last time. For any isolated red object that is still *unprocessed*:
    *   Find its bounding box `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.
    *   If its minimum column `c1` is greater than 0 (i.e., it doesn't touch the left edge):
        *   Draw a blue rectangle covering all cells from row `r1` to `r2` and from column `0` to `c1-1`.
10. Return the modified output grid.
