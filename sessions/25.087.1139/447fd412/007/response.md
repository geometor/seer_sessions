Transformation Rule:
1. Identify red (2) objects and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2. Filter red objects to find 'isolated' ones, defined as red objects where none of their constituent pixels are 8-way adjacent to any blue pixel from the input grid.
3. Sort the isolated red objects based on their top-left bounding box corner (first by row, then by column).
4. Process pairs of isolated red objects first, marking them as processed to avoid single-object processing later:
    a. Vertical Pair: Search for two isolated 1x1 red objects located at (r1, c) and (r2, c) where r2 = r1 + 3. If found, draw *one* blue T-shape below the *top* pixel (r1, c). The T-shape consists of pixels (r1+1, c-1), (r1+1, c), (r1+1, c+1) and (r1+2, c). Mark both red objects in the pair as processed. Check for pairs exhaustively among the sorted isolated objects.
    b. Horizontal Pair: Search for two isolated 2x2 red objects whose bounding boxes are (r_start, c1_start, r_start+1, c1_start+1) and (r_start, c2_start, r_start+1, c2_start+1), where c2_start > c1_start + 2 (meaning there's a horizontal gap between them). If found:
        i. Draw a blue connector rectangle filling the gap between them: rows r_start to r_start+1, columns (c1_start+1)+1 to c2_start-1.
        ii. Draw a blue 2x2 square below the connector, centered horizontally. Its top-left corner is at row r_start+2 and column `conn_col_end - 1` (where `conn_col_end` is the last column of the connector).
        iii. Draw a blue rectangle below the square structure: rows r_start+4 to r_start+5, columns spanning from the start of the connector (c1_start+2) to the end of the second red object (c2_start+1).
        Mark both red objects in the pair as processed. Check for pairs exhaustively among the sorted isolated objects.
5. Process any remaining isolated red objects (those not part of a processed pair):
    a. If the object's leftmost bounding box column `c1` is greater than 0, draw a blue rectangle covering all rows of the object's bounding box (from `r1` to `r2`) and columns from 0 up to (but not including) `c1`.
6. The background (0) and non-isolated red/blue pixels remain unchanged unless overwritten by the drawing steps. Return the modified grid.
