            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n## General Assessment\n\n1.  **Execution Error:** The immediate problem is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `skimage`. This is an environment issue; the `scikit-image` library needs to be installed to run the code. The core logic cannot be validated without this dependency or a reimplementation of the object finding/labeling functionality.\n2.  **Logic Based on Examples (Inferred):** The provided code attempts to implement a transformation based on identifying specific configurations of \"isolated\" red objects (color 2). \"Isolated\" means not adjacent (including diagonally) to any original blue pixels (color 1).\n3.  **Identified Cases:** The code explicitly handles three distinct scenarios for these isolated red objects:\n    *   A vertical pair of 1x1 red pixels separated by two empty rows.\n    *   A horizontal pair of 2x2 red squares on the same rows, separated by at least one column.\n    *   Any other single isolated red object.\n4.  **Actions:** For each case, specific blue shapes are drawn relative to the identified red objects. Crucially, the original input grid content (including the red and blue objects) is copied to the output first, and the new blue shapes are added.\n5.  **Strategy for Resolution:**\n    *   Address the environment issue by ensuring `scikit-image` is available or by implementing the object detection logic using standard Python/NumPy if necessary.\n    *   Verify the logic against *all* training examples. The previous code was likely based on only one or a subset. Each example needs to be checked to confirm:\n        *   The definition of \"isolated\" holds.\n        *   The specific configurations (pairs, singles) are correctly identified.\n        *   The drawing rules for the blue shapes match the output in each case.\n        *   Are there other configurations or edge cases not covered?\n\n## Metrics and Analysis (Simulated based on code logic)\n\nLet's simulate running the logic on the three types of examples the code anticipates.\n\n**Example Type 1: Vertical 1x1 Pair**\n*   **Input:** Contains at least two 1x1 red objects (e.g., at `(r, c)` and `(r+3, c)`). May contain other red/blue objects. The key red objects are not adjacent (8-way) to any blue pixels.\n*   **Processing:**\n    *   Identify red objects.\n    *   Identify blue objects' coordinates.\n    *   Filter red objects to find isolated ones.\n    *   Find a pair of isolated 1x1 red objects at `(r, c)` and `(r+3, c)`.\n*   **Output:** Input grid + blue 'T' shape below the first red pixel + blue 'T' shape below the second red pixel.\n    *   'T' shape 1: `{(r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1), (r+2, c)}`\n    *   'T' shape 2: `{(r+3+1, c-1), (r+3+1, c), (r+3+1, c+1), (r+3+2, c)}`\n\n**Example Type 2: Horizontal 2x2 Pair**\n*   **Input:** Contains at least two 2x2 red objects (e.g., top-left at `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` where `c2 > c1+1`). May contain other red/blue objects. The key red objects are not adjacent (8-way) to any blue pixels.\n*   **Processing:**\n    *   Identify red objects.\n    *   Identify blue objects' coordinates.\n    *   Filter red objects to find isolated ones.\n    *   Find a pair of isolated 2x2 red objects starting at `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)`.\n*   **Output:** Input grid + blue shapes connecting/below the pair.\n    *   Connector: Blue rectangle from `(r, c1+2)` to `(r+1, c2-1)`.\n    *   Square: Blue 2x2 square centered horizontally below the connector, starting at row `r+2`.\n    *   Bottom Rectangle: Blue rectangle from `(r+4, c1+2)` to `(r+5, c2+1)`. *(Correction: Code seems to use `c1_end+1` to `c2_end+1`, which is `c1+1+1` to `c2+1`. So, `(r+4, c1+2)` to `(r+5, c2+1)`)*.\n\n**Example Type 3: Single Isolated Object**\n*   **Input:** Contains at least one isolated red object that does not form one of the pairs above. Let its bounding box be `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.\n*   **Processing:**\n    *   Identify red objects.\n    *   Identify blue objects' coordinates.\n    *   Filter red objects to find isolated ones.\n    *   Identify isolated objects not part of processed pairs.\n*   **Output:** Input grid + blue rectangle to the left of the object.\n    *   Left Rectangle: Blue rectangle from `(r1, 0)` to `(r2, c1-1)`. Drawn only if `c1 > 0`.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"

Identify all distinct red (2) objects and blue (1) objects in the input grid, considering pixels connected 8-directionally (including diagonals) as part of the same object. Store the coordinates of all pixels belonging to blue objects.\n3.  Determine which red objects are \"isolated\". A red object is isolated if none of its pixels are adjacent (8-directionally) to any pixel belonging to any *original* blue object.\n4.  Create a list of the isolated red objects and sort them based on their top-left corner coordinates (first by row, then by column). Keep track of which isolated objects have been processed.\n5.  Iterate through the sorted list of isolated red objects to find and process specific pairs:\n    *   **Vertical 1x1 Pair:** Search for two *unprocessed* isolated red objects where both are single pixels (1x1), have the same column index `c`, and their row indices `r1`, `r2` satisfy `r2 = r1 + 3`. If found:\n        *   Draw a blue 'T' shape immediately below the first pixel: a horizontal 3-pixel bar at `r1+1` (cols `c-1` to `c+1`) and a vertical 1-pixel stem at `(r1+2, c)`.\n        *   Draw an identical blue 'T' shape relative to the second pixel (rows `r2+1`, `r2+2`).\n        *   Mark both red objects as processed.\n    *   **Horizontal 2x2 Pair:** Search for two *unprocessed* isolated red objects where both are 2x2 squares, located on the same rows `r` and `r+1`, with the second square starting at a column `c2` that is at least 2 columns to the right of the first square's starting column `c1` (i.e., `c2 > c1+1`). Let the first square span columns `c1` to `c1+1` and the second span `c2` to `c2+1`. If found:\n        *   Draw a blue connector rectangle of size 2xN between the squares: rows `r` to `r+1`, columns `c1+2` to `c2-1`.\n        *   Draw a blue 2x2 square centered horizontally below the connector rectangle, starting at row `r+2`.\n        *   Draw a blue bottom rectangle of size 2xM below the square structure: rows `r+4` to `r+5`, columns `c1+2` to `c2+1`.\n        *   Mark both red objects as processed.\n6.  Iterate through the list of isolated red objects again. For any isolated red object that is still *unprocessed*:\n    *   Find its bounding box `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.\n    *   If its minimum column `c1` is greater than 0, draw a blue rectangle covering all cells from row `r1` to `r2` and column `0` to `c1-1`.\n7.
