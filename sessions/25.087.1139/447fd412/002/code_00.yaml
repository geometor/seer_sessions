# Color Definitions:
# 0: white (background)
# 1: blue
# 2: red
# 5: gray (used implicitly in some descriptions but not transformation)

Objects:
  - type: Red Object
    color: 2
    definition: Contiguous block (8-way adjacency) of red pixels.
    properties:
      - coords: Set of (row, col) tuples.
      - bbox: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - shape_size: (height, width) derived from bbox.
      - is_isolated: Boolean, true if no pixel in the object is adjacent (8-way) to any blue (1) pixel from the original input grid.

  - type: Blue Object
    color: 1
    definition: Contiguous block (8-way adjacency) of blue pixels.
    properties:
      - coords: Set of (row, col) tuples. Used primarily for checking isolation of red objects.

Actions:
  - name: Copy Input
    description: The output grid initially matches the input grid exactly.

  - name: Find Isolated Red Objects
    description: Identify all red objects and determine which ones are isolated. Sort them by top-left coordinate (row, then column).

  - name: Process Vertical 1x1 Pair
    condition: Two isolated red objects exist, both are 1x1 pixels, located at `(r, c)` and `(r+3, c)`.
    action:
      - Draw blue 'T' shape below the first pixel (coords `{(r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1), (r+2, c)}`).
      - Draw blue 'T' shape below the second pixel (coords `{(r+4, c-1), (r+4, c), (r+4, c+1), (r+5, c)}`).
      - Mark the paired red objects as processed.

  - name: Process Horizontal 2x2 Pair
    condition: Two isolated red objects exist, both are 2x2 squares, with top-left corners at `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)` where `c2 > c1 + 1`. (Bounding boxes are `(r, c1, r+1, c1+1)` and `(r, c2, r+1, c2+1)`).
    action:
      - Draw blue connector rectangle: `(r, c1+2)` to `(r+1, c2-1)`.
      - Draw blue 2x2 square below connector: Centered horizontally relative to the connector, starting at row `r+2`. Top-left is `(r+2, floor(c1+2 + (c2-1 - (c1+2) + 1)/2 - 1))`.
      - Draw blue bottom rectangle: `(r+4, c1+2)` to `(r+5, c2+1)`.
      - Mark the paired red objects as processed.

  - name: Process Single Isolated Object
    condition: An isolated red object exists that was not processed as part of a pair. Let its bounding box be `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.
    action:
      - If `c1 > 0`, draw a blue rectangle from `(r1, 0)` to `(r2, c1-1)`.
      - Mark the object as processed.

Output:
  - The final grid after applying all relevant actions based on the isolated red objects found. Original content is preserved, blue shapes are added.
