task_description: Add blue shapes based on red shapes that are isolated from existing blue shapes. The specific blue shape added depends on the configuration (single, vertical pair, horizontal pair) and shape of the isolated red shape(s).

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    shape: variable (pixel, cross, bar, T, rectangle)
  - type: object
    color: red (2)
    shape: variable (pixel, square)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Determines if red objects are near existing blue objects (includes diagonal neighbors).
    role: Condition for transformation (only affects non-adjacent/isolated red objects).
  - type: pairing
    description: Specific configurations of identical isolated red objects.
    subtypes:
      - vertical_pair: Two identical 1x1 red pixels separated vertically by 2 background rows.
      - horizontal_pair: Two identical 2x2 red squares separated horizontally by background columns.
    role: Determines the specific transformation rule applied.

transformations:
  - name: add_T_shape
    input: A vertical pair of isolated 1x1 red pixels ((r, c) and (r+3, c)).
    output: Adds a blue T-shape below each pixel (horizontal bar at row+1, cols c-1 to c+1; vertical stem at row+2, col c).
    condition: Applied only to qualifying vertical pairs.
  - name: add_connector_and_structure
    input: A horizontal pair of isolated 2x2 red squares (starting at (r, c) and (r, c')).
    output: Adds a blue connector (rows r to r+1, cols c+2 to c'-1), a blue 2x2 square below connector center (rows r+2 to r+3), and a blue rectangle below that (rows r+4 to r+5, cols c+2 to c').
    condition: Applied only to qualifying horizontal pairs.
  - name: add_left_rectangle
    input: A single isolated red object (not part of a defined pair) with bounding box (r1:r2, c1:c2).
    output: Adds a blue rectangle (rows r1 to r2-1, cols 0 to c1-1).
    condition: Applied to isolated red objects that don't fit pair criteria.

grid_properties:
  - size: Height and width vary (up to 30x30).
  - boundaries: Actions must respect grid boundaries.
