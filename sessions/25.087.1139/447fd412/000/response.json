            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) for the background, blue (1) and red (2) for objects.\n2.  **Objects:** There are distinct objects made of blue pixels and red pixels. These objects can be single pixels or larger contiguous shapes (squares, crosses, bars, T-shapes, rectangles).\n3.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains one or more blue objects and one or more red objects.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid always contains all the objects from the input grid. Additionally, new blue objects appear in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Trigger:** The appearance of new blue objects seems related to the red objects, specifically those red objects that are *not* adjacent (including diagonally) to any existing blue objects in the input. Red objects adjacent to blue objects seem unaffected.\n6.  **Transformation Logic (Varied):** The shape and position of the *new* blue object depend on the properties of the isolated red object(s):\n    *   **Case 1 (train_1):** Isolated 1x1 red pixels that form vertical pairs (separated by 2 background rows) each get a blue 'T' shape drawn directly below them.\n    *   **Case 2 (train_2):** Isolated 2x2 red squares that form a horizontal pair get connected by a blue rectangle of the same height. Additionally, a complex blue structure (a 2x2 square and a 2x(connector\\_width + square\\_width) rectangle below it) is drawn centered beneath the connector.\n    *   **Case 3 (train_3):** A single isolated red object (which isn't part of the specific pairs above, like the 3x3 square) gets a blue rectangle drawn to its left, matching its height and extending from the left grid edge up to the column just before the red object starts.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine which red objects are \"isolated\" \u2013 meaning they have no pixels (including diagonally adjacent) touching any blue pixels from the input grid.\n4.  Create a list of these isolated red objects and a mechanism to track which ones have been processed as part of a pair.\n5.  Iterate through the isolated red objects. For each object `R` that hasn't been processed yet:\n    a.  **Check for Vertical Pair (1x1 pixels):** Search for another unprocessed isolated red object `R'` that is identical (1x1 pixel) and located exactly 3 rows below `R` in the same column. If found:\n        i.  Mark both `R` and `R'` as processed.\n        ii. For `R` at (r, c), draw a blue 'T' shape in the output grid: paint pixels (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1), and (r+2, c) blue (value 1), respecting grid boundaries.\n        iii.For `R'` at (r+3, c), draw a similar blue 'T' shape below it: paint pixels (r+4, c-1), (r+4, c), (r+4, c+1), and (r+5, c) blue, respecting grid boundaries.\n        iv. Continue to the next unprocessed isolated red object.\n    b.  **Check for Horizontal Pair (2x2 squares):** Search for another unprocessed isolated red object `R'` that is identical (2x2 square) and located in the same rows as `R` but starting in a column `c'` to the right of `R`'s columns (`c`). Let `R` start at (r, c) and `R'` start at (r, c'). If found:\n        i.  Mark both `R` and `R'` as processed.\n        ii. Draw a blue connector rectangle in the output grid covering rows `r` to `r+1` and columns `c+2` to `c'-1`.\n        iii.Calculate the horizontal center columns of the connector. Draw a blue 2x2 square below the connector, centered horizontally, starting at row `r+2`.\n        iv. Draw a blue rectangle below the 2x2 square, starting at row `r+4` and ending at row `r+5`, covering columns `c+2` to `c'`. (Width matches connector + one square width). Respect grid boundaries for all drawing.\n        v.  Continue to the next unprocessed isolated red object.\n    c.  **Handle Single Isolated Object:** If `R` was not matched with a pair in steps 5a or 5b:\n        i.  Mark `R` as processed.\n        ii. Find the bounding box of `R`: minimum row `r1`, maximum row `r2` (exclusive), minimum column `c1`, maximum column `c2` (exclusive).\n        iii.Draw a blue rectangle in the output grid covering rows `r1` to `r2-1` and columns `0` to `c1-1`. Respect grid boundaries.\n6.  After checking all isolated red objects, return the final output grid."
