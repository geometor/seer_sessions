Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The grids use white (0) for the background, blue (1) and red (2) for objects.
2.  **Objects:** There are distinct objects made of blue pixels and red pixels. These objects can be single pixels or larger contiguous shapes (squares, crosses, bars, T-shapes, rectangles).
3.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains one or more blue objects and one or more red objects.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid always contains all the objects from the input grid. Additionally, new blue objects appear in the output.
5.  **Transformation Trigger:** The appearance of new blue objects seems related to the red objects, specifically those red objects that are *not* adjacent (including diagonally) to any existing blue objects in the input. Red objects adjacent to blue objects seem unaffected.
6.  **Transformation Logic (Varied):** The shape and position of the *new* blue object depend on the properties of the isolated red object(s):
    *   **Case 1 (train_1):** Isolated 1x1 red pixels that form vertical pairs (separated by 2 background rows) each get a blue 'T' shape drawn directly below them.
    *   **Case 2 (train_2):** Isolated 2x2 red squares that form a horizontal pair get connected by a blue rectangle of the same height. Additionally, a complex blue structure (a 2x2 square and a 2x(connector\_width + square\_width) rectangle below it) is drawn centered beneath the connector.
    *   **Case 3 (train_3):** A single isolated red object (which isn't part of the specific pairs above, like the 3x3 square) gets a blue rectangle drawn to its left, matching its height and extending from the left grid edge up to the column just before the red object starts.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Add blue shapes based on red shapes that are isolated from existing blue shapes. The specific blue shape added depends on the configuration (single, vertical pair, horizontal pair) and shape of the isolated red shape(s).

elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: blue (1)
    shape: variable (pixel, cross, bar, T, rectangle)
  - type: object
    color: red (2)
    shape: variable (pixel, square)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Determines if red objects are near existing blue objects (includes diagonal neighbors).
    role: Condition for transformation (only affects non-adjacent/isolated red objects).
  - type: pairing
    description: Specific configurations of identical isolated red objects.
    subtypes:
      - vertical_pair: Two identical 1x1 red pixels separated vertically by 2 background rows.
      - horizontal_pair: Two identical 2x2 red squares separated horizontally by background columns.
    role: Determines the specific transformation rule applied.

transformations:
  - name: add_T_shape
    input: A vertical pair of isolated 1x1 red pixels ((r, c) and (r+3, c)).
    output: Adds a blue T-shape below each pixel (horizontal bar at row+1, cols c-1 to c+1; vertical stem at row+2, col c).
    condition: Applied only to qualifying vertical pairs.
  - name: add_connector_and_structure
    input: A horizontal pair of isolated 2x2 red squares (starting at (r, c) and (r, c')).
    output: Adds a blue connector (rows r to r+1, cols c+2 to c'-1), a blue 2x2 square below connector center (rows r+2 to r+3), and a blue rectangle below that (rows r+4 to r+5, cols c+2 to c').
    condition: Applied only to qualifying horizontal pairs.
  - name: add_left_rectangle
    input: A single isolated red object (not part of a defined pair) with bounding box (r1:r2, c1:c2).
    output: Adds a blue rectangle (rows r1 to r2-1, cols 0 to c1-1).
    condition: Applied to isolated red objects that don't fit pair criteria.

grid_properties:
  - size: Height and width vary (up to 30x30).
  - boundaries: Actions must respect grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct red objects and blue objects in the input grid.
3.  Determine which red objects are "isolated" â€“ meaning they have no pixels (including diagonally adjacent) touching any blue pixels from the input grid.
4.  Create a list of these isolated red objects and a mechanism to track which ones have been processed as part of a pair.
5.  Iterate through the isolated red objects. For each object `R` that hasn't been processed yet:
    a.  **Check for Vertical Pair (1x1 pixels):** Search for another unprocessed isolated red object `R'` that is identical (1x1 pixel) and located exactly 3 rows below `R` in the same column. If found:
        i.  Mark both `R` and `R'` as processed.
        ii. For `R` at (r, c), draw a blue 'T' shape in the output grid: paint pixels (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1), and (r+2, c) blue (value 1), respecting grid boundaries.
        iii.For `R'` at (r+3, c), draw a similar blue 'T' shape below it: paint pixels (r+4, c-1), (r+4, c), (r+4, c+1), and (r+5, c) blue, respecting grid boundaries.
        iv. Continue to the next unprocessed isolated red object.
    b.  **Check for Horizontal Pair (2x2 squares):** Search for another unprocessed isolated red object `R'` that is identical (2x2 square) and located in the same rows as `R` but starting in a column `c'` to the right of `R`'s columns (`c`). Let `R` start at (r, c) and `R'` start at (r, c'). If found:
        i.  Mark both `R` and `R'` as processed.
        ii. Draw a blue connector rectangle in the output grid covering rows `r` to `r+1` and columns `c+2` to `c'-1`.
        iii.Calculate the horizontal center columns of the connector. Draw a blue 2x2 square below the connector, centered horizontally, starting at row `r+2`.
        iv. Draw a blue rectangle below the 2x2 square, starting at row `r+4` and ending at row `r+5`, covering columns `c+2` to `c'`. (Width matches connector + one square width). Respect grid boundaries for all drawing.
        v.  Continue to the next unprocessed isolated red object.
    c.  **Handle Single Isolated Object:** If `R` was not matched with a pair in steps 5a or 5b:
        i.  Mark `R` as processed.
        ii. Find the bounding box of `R`: minimum row `r1`, maximum row `r2` (exclusive), minimum column `c1`, maximum column `c2` (exclusive).
        iii.Draw a blue rectangle in the output grid covering rows `r1` to `r2-1` and columns `0` to `c1-1`. Respect grid boundaries.
6.  After checking all isolated red objects, return the final output grid.
