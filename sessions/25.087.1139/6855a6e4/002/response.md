**General Assessment**

The provided code successfully handles the transformation when the red structures are separated vertically (defining a horizontal gap, as seen in Example 2). However, it fails when the red structures are separated horizontally (defining a vertical gap, as seen in Examples 1 and 3).

The failure mechanism in Examples 1 and 3 is consistent: instead of translating the original gray shapes *horizontally* into the vertical gap, the code fills a rectangular region within the gap with gray.

The strategy for resolution is to refine the logic for the horizontal separation case. The core idea should be analogous to the vertical separation case: identify the individual gray objects and translate them (horizontally, in this case) into the gap defined by the red structures, preserving their shape and relative vertical positions. The vertical separation logic appears correct and can be retained.

**Metrics and Analysis**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Two red 'C' shapes facing each other, creating a vertical gap. Four distinct gray objects (two 2x2 squares, two vertical 1x3 bars) located outside the red structures.
    *   **Expected Output:** The gray objects are translated horizontally into the vertical gap. The left-side gray objects move right, and the right-side gray objects move left, filling the gap while maintaining their original shapes and vertical positions.
    *   **Transformed Output:** The code incorrectly filled a solid 6x5 gray rectangle within the vertical gap, spanning the vertical extent defined by the red pixels adjacent to the gap.
    *   **Analysis:** Failure is due to the incorrect "fill rectangle" logic for horizontal separation. The code identified a vertical gap (`separation_axis = 'horizontal'`) but applied the wrong transformation. It needs to identify gray objects and translate them horizontally.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Two red rectangles separated vertically, creating a horizontal gap. Two distinct gray objects (a vertical 1x2 bar and a horizontal 3x1 bar) located above and below the gap, respectively.
    *   **Expected Output:** The top gray object moves down into the gap, and the bottom gray object moves up into the gap, maintaining their shapes and horizontal positions.
    *   **Transformed Output:** Matches the expected output perfectly.
    *   **Analysis:** Success confirms the vertical separation logic (`separation_axis = 'vertical'`) is correct. Identifying gray objects (`find_objects`) and translating them vertically works as intended.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Similar structure to Example 1, with two red shapes facing each other horizontally, creating a vertical gap. Four distinct gray objects (two 'L' shapes, two mirrored 'L' shapes) outside the red structures.
    *   **Expected Output:** The gray objects are translated horizontally into the vertical gap, similar to Example 1. Left objects move right, right objects move left.
    *   **Transformed Output:** Similar failure to Example 1. The code filled a solid 5x5 gray rectangle within the vertical gap.
    *   **Analysis:** Reinforces the failure pattern for horizontal separation. The "fill rectangle" approach is fundamentally incorrect for this case. Horizontal translation of original gray shapes is required.

task_description: Relocate gray objects into the gap defined by static red structures.

static_elements:
  - color: 2 # Red
  - role: Define a gap or separation between its constituent parts. Remains unchanged in the output.

mobile_elements:
  - color: 5 # Gray
  - role: Objects to be moved. Their original positions are cleared (set to white 0).
  - properties:
      - Consist of one or more connected pixels (including diagonals).
      - Retain their original shape and size after transformation.

background:
  - color: 0 # White
  - role: Empty space, including the gap between red structures and the original locations of gray objects after they are moved.

transformation_rule:
  - Identify red pixel coordinates and gray pixel coordinates.
  - Determine the primary separation axis of the red structures:
      - Calculate the bounding box of all red pixels.
      - Check for contiguous empty rows within the bounding box (excluding top/bottom edges) -> Vertical Separation (Horizontal Gap).
      - If no horizontal gap, check for contiguous empty columns within the bounding box (excluding left/right edges) -> Horizontal Separation (Vertical Gap).
  - Identify individual connected gray objects from the input grid.
  - Clear the original locations of all gray pixels in the output grid.
  - Based on the separation axis:
      - **If Vertical Separation (Horizontal Gap):**
          - Identify the gap rows (`gap_min_r`, `gap_max_r`).
          - For each gray object:
              - Determine if it's above (`obj_max_r < gap_min_r`) or below (`obj_min_r > gap_max_r`) the gap.
              - Calculate the vertical shift (`delta_r`) needed to move the object's edge adjacent to the gap boundary (top edge for objects above, bottom edge for objects below).
              - Translate the object vertically by `delta_r`, preserving its horizontal position and shape, painting the pixels gray in the output grid.
      - **If Horizontal Separation (Vertical Gap):**
          - Identify the gap columns (`gap_min_c`, `gap_max_c`).
          - For each gray object:
              - Determine if it's left (`obj_max_c < gap_min_c`) or right (`obj_min_c > gap_max_c`) of the gap.
              - Calculate the horizontal shift (`delta_c`) needed to move the object's edge adjacent to the gap boundary (right edge for objects left, left edge for objects right).
              - Translate the object horizontally by `delta_c`, preserving its vertical position and shape, painting the pixels gray in the output grid.
  - Red pixels remain unchanged from input to output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Structures:** Locate all red (2) pixels and all gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Keep the red pixels fixed in their positions for the output grid. Create a working copy of the grid where the original gray pixels are temporarily removed (set to white, 0).
2.  **Find the Gap:** Analyze the arrangement of the red pixels to find the empty space (gap) separating them.
    *   Determine the bounding box containing all red pixels.
    *   Check if there's a continuous block of empty *rows* (containing no red pixels) strictly *inside* the vertical span of the bounding box. If yes, this is a **horizontal gap**, and the separation is **vertical**. Record the top (`gap_min_r`) and bottom (`gap_max_r`) rows of this gap.
    *   If no horizontal gap is found, check if there's a continuous block of empty *columns* (containing no red pixels) strictly *inside* the horizontal span of the bounding box. If yes, this is a **vertical gap**, and the separation is **horizontal**. Record the leftmost (`gap_min_c`) and rightmost (`gap_max_c`) columns of this gap.
3.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Find all distinct connected groups (objects) of gray pixels from the *original* input grid. Connectivity includes diagonals.
4.  **Relocate Gray Objects:** Move each identified gray object into the determined gap based on the separation type:
    *   **If Vertical Separation (Horizontal Gap):**
        *   For each gray object, determine if its original position was above or below the gap.
        *   If above, calculate the downward vertical shift required to place the object's bottom edge just above the gap's top edge (`gap_min_r - 1`). Move the object down by this amount.
        *   If below, calculate the upward vertical shift required to place the object's top edge just below the gap's bottom edge (`gap_max_r + 1`). Move the object up by this amount.
        *   Draw the translated gray object in its new position onto the working grid. Maintain the object's original shape and horizontal position.
    *   **If Horizontal Separation (Vertical Gap):**
        *   For each gray object, determine if its original position was to the left or right of the gap.
        *   If left, calculate the rightward horizontal shift required to place the object's right edge just left of the gap's left edge (`gap_min_c - 1`). Move the object right by this amount.
        *   If right, calculate the leftward horizontal shift required to place the object's left edge just right of the gap's right edge (`gap_max_c + 1`). Move the object left by this amount.
        *   Draw the translated gray object in its new position onto the working grid. Maintain the object's original shape and vertical position.
5.  **Final Output:** The final grid contains the original static red pixels and the relocated gray objects.
