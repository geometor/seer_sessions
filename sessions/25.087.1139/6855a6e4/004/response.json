            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempts to relocate gray objects into a gap defined by static red structures. The results indicate that while the code correctly identifies the red structures, the gray objects, and the general orientation of the gap (horizontal or vertical), it fails to place the gray objects in their correct final positions in all three training examples.\n\nThe core issue appears to be the calculation of the target position for the gray objects relative to the identified gap boundaries. The current logic places the objects adjacent to the gap but *outside* of it (e.g., at `gap_min_r - 1` or `gap_max_c + 1`). Examination of the expected outputs suggests the objects should be moved so their nearest edge aligns *with* the first row/column of the gap itself (e.g., at `gap_min_r` or `gap_max_c`).\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n1.  Re-analyze the input/output pairs, focusing on the precise relationship between the gray objects and the gap boundaries in the expected output.\n2.  Gather detailed metrics on object positions and gap boundaries.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the corrected placement logic.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"

These remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   Determine the bounding box of all red pixels (`min_r`, `max_r`, `min_c`, `max_c`).\n    *   Search for a contiguous block of empty (white, 0) rows strictly between `min_r` and `max_r` (i.e., from `min_r + 1` to `max_r - 1`) that span at least from `min_c` to `max_c`. If found, this is a **horizontal gap**. Record its first (`gap_min_r`) and last (`gap_max_r`) rows.\n    *   If no horizontal gap is found, search for a contiguous block of empty (white, 0) columns strictly between `min_c` and `max_c` (i.e., from `min_c + 1` to `max_c - 1`) that span at least from `min_r` to `max_r`. If found, this is a **vertical gap**. Record its first (`gap_min_c`) and last (`gap_max_c`) columns.\n    *   If neither gap is found, proceed to step 6 with an output grid containing only red pixels.\n\n2.  **Identify Mobile Objects:**\n    *   Find all distinct connected groups (objects) of gray (5) pixels in the *original* input grid using 8-way connectivity. Record the coordinates of each pixel belonging to each object.\n\n3.  **Initialize Output:**\n    *   Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with white (0).\n    *   Copy all red (2) pixels from the input grid to their corresponding locations in the output grid.\n\n4.  **Calculate Relocation Shift for Each Gray Object:**\n    *   For each gray object identified in step 2:\n        *   Determine its bounding box (`obj_min_r`, `obj_max_r`, `obj_min_c`, `obj_max_c`).\n        *   Initialize shift amounts: `delta_r = 0`, `delta_c = 0`.\n        *   **If a horizontal gap was found (Vertical Separation):**\n            *   If the object is entirely above the gap (`obj_max_r < gap_min_r`): Calculate the downward shift required to align the object's bottom edge with the gap's top edge: `delta_r = gap_min_r - obj_max_r`.\n            *   If the object is entirely below the gap (`obj_min_r > gap_max_r`): Calculate the upward shift required to align the object's top edge with the gap's bottom edge: `delta_r = gap_max_r - obj_min_r`.\n        *   **Else if a vertical gap was found (Horizontal Separation):**\n            *   If the object is entirely to the left of the gap (`obj_max_c < gap_min_c`): Calculate the rightward shift required to align the object's right edge with the gap's left edge: `delta_c = gap_min_c - obj_max_c`.\n            *   If the object is entirely to the right of the gap (`obj_min_c > gap_max_c`): Calculate the leftward shift required to align the object's left edge with the gap's right edge: `delta_c = gap_max_c - obj_min_c`.\n\n5.  **Apply Shift and Paint Objects:**\n    *   For each gray object and its calculated (`delta_r`, `delta_c`):\n        *   Iterate through each original pixel coordinate `(r, c)` of the object.\n        *   Calculate the new coordinate: `new_r = r + delta_r`, `new_c = c + delta_c`.\n        *   If the `new_r` and `new_c` are within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at `(new_r, new_c)` in the output grid to gray (5).\n\n6.  **Return Result:**\n    *   Return the completed output grid."
