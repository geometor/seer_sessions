            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves manipulating gray pixels based on the configuration of static red pixels within a grid. The background is white. In all examples, the red pixels form shapes that remain unchanged. The gray pixels, however, change their positions. The transformation seems to depend on the spatial relationship between the red shapes.\n\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   **Static Elements**: Red pixels (color 2) define fixed structures.\n    *   **Mobile Elements**: Gray pixels (color 5) are the objects that move.\n    *   **Transformation Rule**: The core transformation involves relocating the gray pixels. Their original positions become white (color 0). The destination depends on the arrangement of the red shapes.\n        *   **Horizontal Separation (train_1, train_3)**: When red shapes are separated horizontally, creating a vertical gap between them, the gray pixels are moved to fill the rectangular area constituting this central gap. The vertical bounds of this filled rectangle correspond to the inner vertical extent of the red shapes (excluding potentially flat top/bottom parts of the shapes).\n        *   **Vertical Separation (train_2)**: When red shapes are separated vertically, creating a horizontal gap (empty rows) between them, the gray pixels are translated vertically. Gray objects originally above the top red shape move down to occupy the highest available rows in the gap. Gray objects originally below the bottom red shape move up to occupy the lowest available rows in the gap. The horizontal position and the shape/size of the gray objects are preserved during this translation.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
