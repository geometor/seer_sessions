## General Assessment

The provided code successfully solves Example 2, which involves a horizontal gap (vertical separation). However, it fails on Examples 1 and 3, both involving vertical gaps (horizontal separation).

*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code correctly positions the left gray object but misplaces the right gray object by one column to the left. The calculated shift (`delta_c=-5`) is incorrect; the required shift is `delta_c=-4`.
*   **Example 3 Failure:** The code correctly calculates the required shifts (`delta_c=5` for left, `delta_c=-5` for right) to align the objects according to one potential rule (left-left, right-right), but the *expected output* shows the objects placed according to these shifts AND reflected horizontally.

This suggests two issues:
1.  The rule for calculating the horizontal shift (`delta_c`) for objects to the *right* of a *vertical* gap needs refinement. It appears to depend on the properties of the gap itself (potentially its width).
2.  A conditional horizontal reflection needs to be applied to the gray objects *after* shifting, specifically when dealing with a vertical gap of a certain property (likely even width).

The strategy is to:
1.  Precisely determine the gap boundaries.
2.  Identify the separation axis (horizontal or vertical gap).
3.  For vertical gaps, calculate the gap width.
4.  Adjust the shift calculation rule for objects right of a vertical gap based on the gap width.
5.  Apply a horizontal reflection to the shifted objects if the vertical gap width meets the identified condition (even width).

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the geometry of the failed examples:
