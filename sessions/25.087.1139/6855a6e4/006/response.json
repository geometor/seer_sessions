            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully solves Example 2, which involves a horizontal gap (vertical separation). However, it fails on Examples 1 and 3, both involving vertical gaps (horizontal separation).\n\n*   **Example 1 Failure:** The code correctly positions the left gray object but misplaces the right gray object by one column to the left. The calculated shift (`delta_c=-5`) is incorrect; the required shift is `delta_c=-4`.\n*   **Example 3 Failure:** The code correctly calculates the required shifts (`delta_c=5` for left, `delta_c=-5` for right) to align the objects according to one potential rule (left-left, right-right), but the *expected output* shows the objects placed according to these shifts AND reflected horizontally.\n\nThis suggests two issues:\n1.  The rule for calculating the horizontal shift (`delta_c`) for objects to the *right* of a *vertical* gap needs refinement. It appears to depend on the properties of the gap itself (potentially its width).\n2.  A conditional horizontal reflection needs to be applied to the gray objects *after* shifting, specifically when dealing with a vertical gap of a certain property (likely even width).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Precisely determine the gap boundaries.\n2.  Identify the separation axis (horizontal or vertical gap).\n3.  For vertical gaps, calculate the gap width.\n4.  Adjust the shift calculation rule for objects right of a vertical gap based on the gap width.\n5.  Apply a horizontal reflection to the shifted objects if the vertical gap width meets the identified condition (even width).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the geometry of the failed examples:\n\n"
