"""
Identify all distinct, connected non-white (0) and non-gray (5) shapes in the input grid.
For each shape, count the number of gray (5) pixels located within its bounding box.
Construct an output grid where each row corresponds to a shape from the input.
The rows are ordered vertically based on the top-most coordinate of the shapes in the input.
Each output row contains the shape's color repeated N times, where N is the count of gray pixels within its bounding box.
Rows are padded with white (0) on the right to match the width of the row with the maximum gray pixel count.
