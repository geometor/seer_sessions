task_description: Transform input grid by summarizing information about colored shapes based on enclosed gray pixels.

elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains_shapes: true
      - contains_inclusions: true

  - type: shape
    properties:
      - definition: Contiguous block of the same non-white, non-gray color.
      - role: container
      - attributes:
        - color: (e.g., magenta, red, azure, blue, orange, green, yellow)
        - location: defined by pixel coordinates
        - bounding_box: minimum rectangle enclosing the shape
        - associated_inclusions: gray pixels within the bounding box

  - type: inclusion
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - location: specific pixel coordinates within the input grid
      - relationship: associated with a shape if located within its bounding box

transformation:
  - action: identify_shapes
    description: Find all distinct shape objects in the input grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_shapes (each with color, bounding_box)

  - action: count_inclusions_per_shape
    description: For each identified shape, count the number of gray pixels within its bounding box.
    inputs: list_of_shapes, input_grid
    outputs: list_of_shape_summaries (each with color, gray_count, top_coordinate)

  - action: sort_shapes
    description: Sort the shape summaries based on their top-most coordinate in ascending order.
    inputs: list_of_shape_summaries
    outputs: sorted_shape_summaries

  - action: determine_output_dimensions
    description: Calculate the height (number of shapes) and width (maximum gray_count) of the output grid.
    inputs: sorted_shape_summaries
    outputs: output_height, output_width

  - action: construct_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid. For each sorted shape summary, create a row using its color repeated 'gray_count' times, padded with white to match 'output_width'.
    inputs: sorted_shape_summaries, output_height, output_width, background_color (white)
    outputs: output_grid

output_specification:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - height: number of shapes found in input
      - width: maximum count of gray pixels associated with any single shape
      - structure: rows representing shapes, ordered top-to-bottom based on input position
      - content: each row contains the shape's color repeated N times (N = gray count), padded with white.
