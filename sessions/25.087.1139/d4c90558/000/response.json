These shapes act as containers.\n2.  **Contained Elements:** Within the bounding box defined by each colored shape, there are several gray pixels (color 5). These gray pixels appear to be the primary elements of interest associated with each shape.\n3.  **Background:** The background color is white (color 0) and is ignored in the transformation.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller and consists of horizontal rows of pixels.\n5.  **Input-Output Relationship:** Each row in the output corresponds to one of the colored shapes found in the input.\n6.  **Color Mapping:** The color of each output row matches the color of its corresponding shape in the input.\n7.  **Length Encoding:** The number of colored pixels in each output row is equal to the count of gray pixels found within the bounding box of the corresponding shape in the input.\n8.  **Ordering:** The rows in the output grid are arranged vertically based on the top-most coordinate of their corresponding shapes in the input grid (top shape first, bottom shape last).\n9.  **Padding:** The width of the output grid is determined by the maximum number of gray pixels associated with any single shape. Rows representing shapes with fewer gray pixels are padded with the background color (white) on the right to match this maximum width.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
