Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Identify the largest contiguous object composed of gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid. If no gray pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.
2. Identify all non-white (0), non-gray (5) colored pixels in the input grid that are *outside* the boundary of the largest gray object. These are considered 'marker' pixels.
3. Group these marker pixels by their color.
4. For each group of markers of the same color, determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all markers in that group.
5. Create a new output grid initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6. Iterate through each pixel coordinate (r, c) that belongs to the largest gray object identified in step 1.
7. For each such gray pixel coordinate (r, c):
    a. Determine how many marker bounding boxes (calculated in step 4) contain this coordinate (r, c).
    b. Count the number of containing bounding boxes.
    c. If exactly one bounding box contains the coordinate (r, c), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color of that bounding box's markers.
    d. If zero or more than one bounding box contains the coordinate (r, c), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).
8. Pixels in the output grid that do not correspond to the largest gray object remain white (0), effectively removing the original marker pixels from the output.
9. Return the resulting output grid.
