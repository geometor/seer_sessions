Identify the largest contiguous object composed of gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid. If no gray pixels exist, return the input grid unchanged.\n2. Identify all non-white (0), non-gray (5) colored pixels in the input grid. These are considered 'marker' pixels.\n3. Group these marker pixels by their color.\n4. For each group of markers of the same color, determine the minimal bounding box that encloses all markers in that group.\n5. Create a new output grid initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6. Iterate through each pixel coordinate (r, c) that belongs to the largest gray object identified in step 1.\n7. For each such gray pixel coordinate (r, c):\n    a. Determine how many marker bounding boxes (calculated in step 4) contain this coordinate (r, c).\n    b. Count the number of containing bounding boxes.\n    c. If exactly one bounding box contains the coordinate (r, c), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color of that bounding box's markers.\n    d. If zero or more than one bounding box contains the coordinate (r, c), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).\n8. Iterate through each group of marker pixels identified in step 3.\n9. For each marker pixel (r, c) with color `marker_color` belonging to a group with bounding box `bbox = (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)`:\n    a. Check if the marker pixel is *strictly inside* its bounding box: `min_r < r < max_r` AND `min_c < c < max_c`.\n    b. If the marker pixel is strictly inside its bounding box, set the corresponding pixel `output_grid[r, c]` to `marker_color`. Note: This might overwrite pixels set in step 7 if a marker happens to be inside the gray area, but the problem constraints seem to avoid this. We prioritize the coloring from step 7 for pixels within the gray object's original area.\n10. Pixels in the output grid that do not correspond to the largest gray object *and* are not preserved internal markers remain white (0).\n11. Return the resulting output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Imports needed: numpy, deque from collections\n# Helper functions: get_4_way_neighbors, find_largest_contiguous_object, get_bounding_box\n\ndef get_4_way_neighbors(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\" Gets orthogonal neighbors within grid bounds. \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_largest_contiguous_object(grid, target_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest connected component of pixels with the target_color using BFS.\n    Args:\n      grid: numpy array representing the input grid.\n      target_color: The integer color value to search for.\n    Returns:\n      A set of (row, col) tuples representing the coordinates of the largest object.\n      Returns an empty set if no pixels of target_color are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    largest_object = set()\n\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Start BFS if we find an unvisited pixel of the target color\n            if grid[r, c] == target_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                current_object = set()\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                current_object.add((r, c))\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    # Explore neighbors\n                    for nr, nc in get_4_way_neighbors(row, col, height, width):\n                        if grid[nr, nc] == target_color and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            current_object.add((nr, nc))\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # Keep track of the largest component found so far\n                if len(current_object) > len(largest_object):\n                    largest_object = current_object\n\n    return largest_object\n\ndef get_bounding_box(pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box containing all given pixel coordinates.\n    Args:\n      pixels: A list or set of (row, col) tuples.\n    Returns:\n      A tuple (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).\n      Returns None if the input list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not pixels:\n        return None\n    # Using np.min/max on array is faster for large sets\n    rows = [r for r, c in pixels]\n    cols = [c for r, c in pixels]\n    min_r = min(rows)\n    max_r = max(rows)\n    min_c = min(cols)\n    max_c = max(cols)\n    return (min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the specified rules involving the largest gray object,\n    external marker bounding boxes, and preserving markers strictly inside their boxes.\n    \n    Args:\n      input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n      \n    Returns:\n      A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n    \n    gray_color = 5\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # 1.
