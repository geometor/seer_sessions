Identify the main contiguous gray (5) object.
Find all non-white (0), non-gray (5) 'marker' pixels outside this object.
Group markers by color and calculate the bounding box for each color group.
Create a copy of the input grid.
Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the gray object in the input:
  Count how many marker bounding boxes contain (r, c).
  If exactly one bounding box contains (r, c), change the pixel at (r, c) in the output grid to the color of that bounding box's marker.
  Otherwise (0 or >1 boxes contain it), leave the pixel gray (5).
Finally, set the locations of all original marker pixels in the output grid to white (0).
