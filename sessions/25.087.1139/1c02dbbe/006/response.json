            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core transformation mechanism: finding the largest gray object, identifying external colored \"marker\" pixels, calculating bounding boxes for each marker color group, and then coloring the pixels of the original gray object based on how many bounding boxes cover them (one box = color, zero or >1 box = gray).\n\nHowever, the code failed because it incorrectly assumed that all pixels *outside* the original gray object should be background (white) in the output. The analysis of the failed examples reveals that *some* of the original marker pixels are preserved in the final output. The key challenge is determining the rule for which marker pixels are kept and which are removed.\n\nComparing the locations of kept vs. removed markers across all examples strongly suggests a new rule: **Only marker pixels that are located *strictly inside* the calculated bounding box for their color group are preserved in the output.** Markers lying on the boundary edges (min/max row or column) of their bounding box are removed (set to background).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Verify the bounding box calculations and the \"internal vs. boundary\" marker hypothesis using `tool_code`.\n2.  Update the YAML facts to reflect this new understanding.\n3.  Revise the natural language program to incorporate this specific rule for preserving marker pixels.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the bounding boxes and marker classifications (internal/boundary) for each example.\n\n"
