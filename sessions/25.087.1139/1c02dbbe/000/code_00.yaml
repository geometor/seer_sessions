Task: Recolor parts of a central gray object based on bounding boxes defined by external marker pixels.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of integer colors (0-9).
  - Background: Primarily white pixels (color 0).
  - Target_Object:
      - Type: Single, large, contiguous block of pixels.
      - Color: Always gray (color 5).
      - Role: Canvas for color changes.
  - Marker_Pixels:
      - Type: Isolated pixels or small groups.
      - Color: Various non-white (non-0) and non-gray (non-5) colors.
      - Location: Located outside the boundary of the Target_Object.
      - Role: Define regions for recoloring the Target_Object.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input.
  - Background: Retained white pixels (color 0).
  - Modified_Object: The original Target_Object, potentially with sections recolored.
      - Unchanged_Pixels: Gray pixels from the input that were not targeted for recoloring or were in overlapping target regions.
      - Recolored_Pixels: Gray pixels from the input now matching the color of a specific set of markers.
  - Erased_Markers: The locations of the original Marker_Pixels are now white (color 0).

Transformation_Steps:
  1. Identify the main contiguous gray (5) object (Target_Object).
  2. Identify all non-white (0), non-gray (5) pixels outside the Target_Object (Marker_Pixels).
  3. Group Marker_Pixels by their color.
  4. For each unique marker color `C`:
     a. Calculate the minimum bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) enclosing all markers of color `C`. Let this be `BBox_C`.
  5. Determine the set of gray pixels from the Target_Object that fall within each `BBox_C`. Let this be `Target_Pixels_C`.
  6. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  7. For each pixel `(r, c)` that was originally gray in the Target_Object:
     a. Count how many sets `Target_Pixels_C` contain `(r, c)`.
     b. If the count is exactly 1, find the unique color `C_unique` associated with that set. Set `output_grid[r][c] = C_unique`.
     c. If the count is 0 or > 1, keep `output_grid[r][c]` as gray (5).
  8. For every original Marker_Pixel location `(r_marker, c_marker)`:
     a. Set `output_grid[r_marker][c_marker] = 0` (white).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Marker pixels define rectangular regions via bounding boxes relative to the grid.
  - Influence: Each marker color potentially influences a rectangular subset of the gray Target_Object.
  - Conflict Resolution: Overlap between the influence regions of different marker colors results in no change (pixels remain gray).

Core_Knowledge_Mapping:
  - Objectness: Identifying the contiguous gray object and the distinct marker pixels.
  - Basic Geometry: Using bounding boxes (rectangles) defined by marker coordinates.
  - Topology: Intersection of bounding boxes with the gray object. Concept of overlap between regions.
  - Counting: Determining how many bounding boxes cover a specific gray pixel.
