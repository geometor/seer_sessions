Identify all horizontal separator lines: Scan the input grid rows (excluding the first and last row) to find any row composed entirely of white (0) pixels. Record the indices of these rows.\n    2.  Identify all vertical separator lines: Scan the input grid columns (excluding the first and last column) to find any column composed entirely of white (0) pixels. Record the indices of these columns.\n    3.  Determine the grid segmentation: The number of horizontal sections is one more than the number of horizontal separator lines found. The number of vertical sections is one more than the number of vertical separator lines found. These numbers define the dimensions (rows x columns) of the output grid.\n    4.  Define the boundaries of each section: Use the grid borders and the identified separator line indices to calculate the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of each rectangular section.\n    5.  Extract the representative color for each section: Iterate through the identified sections based on their layout (e.g., row by row, column by column). For each section, scan its pixels until the first non-white pixel is found. This pixel's color is the representative color for that section.\n    6.  Construct the output grid: Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 3. Populate this grid cell by cell, placing the representative color found for each section (in step 5) into the corresponding cell position based on the section's layout."
