The output grids retain these three pixels in their original positions but add gray (5) pixels. The added gray pixels form a rectangular path that connects the areas around the original three colored pixels.\n\n*   **Analysis:** Upon closer inspection, the gray pixels consistently form the perimeter of the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that encloses the initial three non-white pixels. The original three colored pixels remain in their positions; if one of these pixels lies on the perimeter of the bounding box, that specific cell retains its original color, and the gray perimeter \"skips\" that cell.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
