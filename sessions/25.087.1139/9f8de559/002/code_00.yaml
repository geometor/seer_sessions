task_description: Modify a single pixel's color based on the relative positions of a unique red pixel and the closest magenta pixel.

grid_properties:
  - height: variable (14x14 in examples)
  - width: variable (14x14 in examples)
  - background_colors: Predominantly gray (5), white (0/9), azure (8), maroon (9), orange (7).

objects:
  - object: red_pixel
    count: 1
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - position: (row, col)
  - object: magenta_pixels
    count: 1 or more
    color: magenta (6)
    properties:
      - position: (row, col)
  - object: orange_path_pixels
    count: variable
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - position: (row, col)
      - forms a path (contiguous or adjacent pixels) often originating near the red pixel.
  - object: target_pixel
    count: 1
    color: any color except orange (7)
    properties:
      - position: (row, col)
      - lies on the extended path defined by the action.

actions:
  - action: identify_pixels
    inputs: [grid, red_color_value(2), magenta_color_value(6)]
    outputs: [red_pixel_position, list_of_magenta_pixel_positions]
  - action: find_closest_magenta
    inputs: [red_pixel_position, list_of_magenta_pixel_positions]
    outputs: closest_magenta_pixel_position
    method: Calculate Euclidean distance from red pixel to each magenta pixel and find the minimum.
  - action: determine_opposite_direction
    inputs: [red_pixel_position, closest_magenta_pixel_position]
    outputs: opposite_direction_vector (dr, dc) where dr, dc are in {-1, 0, 1}
    method: Calculate vector (m_row - r_row, m_col - r_col), get signs, negate signs.
  - action: trace_path
    inputs: [grid, red_pixel_position, opposite_direction_vector]
    outputs: target_pixel_position, target_pixel_original_color
    method:
      - Start at the pixel adjacent to the red pixel in the opposite direction.
      - Step along the path defined by the opposite direction vector.
      - Stop at the first pixel encountered that is *not* orange (7).
      - Record the position and original color of this pixel.
  - action: modify_pixel
    inputs: [grid, target_pixel_position]
    outputs: modified_grid
    method: Change the color of the pixel at target_pixel_position to orange (7).

relationships:
  - The key relationship is the vector from the red pixel to the *closest* magenta pixel.
  - The transformation occurs along the line extending in the *opposite* direction of this vector, starting from the red pixel.
  - The transformation stops based on encountering a non-orange pixel color.
