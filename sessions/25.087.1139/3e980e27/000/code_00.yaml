description: The task involves identifying specific patterns (templates) and isolated pixels (triggers) in the input grid and using them to modify the grid, primarily by copying templates to trigger locations.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: Represents the input and output states, contains pixels of different colors (0-9).
  - type: object
    properties: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color.
  - type: template
    description: A specific structure consisting of an 'outer shape' and an 'inner pixel'.
    properties:
      - outer_shape: An object (contiguous block of color C_outer).
      - inner_pixel: A single pixel of color C_inner.
      - relationship: The inner_pixel is adjacent (sharing a side or corner) only to pixels belonging to the outer_shape or the background (color 0). All non-background neighbors of the inner_pixel must belong to the outer_shape.
      - location: The coordinates of all pixels comprising the template.
  - type: trigger
    description: An isolated pixel used to determine where templates should be copied.
    properties:
      - color: The color C_trigger of the pixel.
      - location: The coordinates (row, column) of the pixel.
      - condition: The pixel has no neighbors (sharing a side or corner) of the same color C_trigger.
actions:
  - name: identify_templates
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_templates
    description: Scan the grid to find all structures matching the template definition.
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_triggers
    description: Scan the grid to find all pixels matching the trigger definition.
  - name: match_and_copy
    input: list_of_templates, list_of_triggers
    output: list_of_copies_to_make (template, target_location)
    description: For each trigger, find a template whose inner_pixel color matches the trigger color. Create a plan to copy that template.
  - name: paste_templates
    input: input_grid, list_of_copies_to_make
    output: output_grid
    description: Start with a copy of the input grid. For each planned copy, overlay the template onto the grid such that the template's original inner_pixel location is mapped to the trigger's location.
relationship: The core relationship is between a trigger pixel and a template. A trigger activates the copying of a template if the trigger's color matches the template's inner pixel color.
alternative_rule (observed in train_1):
  - type: attractor
    description: An isolated single pixel.
  - type: mover
    description: A contiguous shape of a single color, not part of a template.
  - action: move_object
    description: A mover object translates its position to become adjacent to a corresponding attractor pixel. (Pairing rules and exact adjacency unclear from single example). This rule might apply if no templates are found.
