Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Core Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, typically made of contiguous blocks of non-background colors. Some objects are simple single pixels, while others are larger shapes.
2.  **Special Structures (Templates):** In multiple examples (train_2, train_3, train_4), we observe specific structures where a larger shape of one color ("outer color") surrounds or is immediately adjacent to a single pixel of a different color ("inner color"). These appear to function as "templates".
    *   Example (train_2): Yellow plus-sign (outer) around a green pixel (inner).
    *   Example (train_3): Yellow T-shape (outer) around a red pixel (inner); Blue L-shape (outer) around a green pixel (inner).
    *   Example (train_4): Blue shape (outer) around a red pixel (inner).
3.  **Trigger Pixels:** We also observe isolated single pixels of various colors that are not part of a template structure. These seem to act as "triggers".
    *   Example (train_2): Isolated green pixels.
    *   Example (train_3): Isolated red pixel, isolated green pixel.
    *   Example (train_4): Isolated red pixel.
4.  **Transformation Logic (Copy/Paste):** The predominant pattern (train_2, train_3, train_4) involves copying the template structures identified in step 2 and pasting them onto the grid. The placement of the copied template is determined by the location of a trigger pixel (step 3) whose color matches the *inner* color of the template. The template is pasted such that its inner pixel perfectly overlays the position of the trigger pixel.
5.  **Anomaly (Train 1):** The first training example (train_1) appears different. It doesn't clearly show the template structure with an inner/outer color relationship. Instead, it looks like object *movement* or *attraction*. An Azure L-shape moves to become adjacent to an isolated green pixel, and a Yellow shape moves to become adjacent to an isolated red pixel. The mechanism here seems distinct from the copy/paste logic in the other examples. Given the prevalence of the copy/paste pattern in the other three examples, I will primarily focus on that rule, treating train_1 as a potential outlier or representing a secondary rule that might apply only when no templates are found.
6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid. Then, the identified template copies are overlaid onto this grid based on the trigger pixel locations.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
description: The task involves identifying specific patterns (templates) and isolated pixels (triggers) in the input grid and using them to modify the grid, primarily by copying templates to trigger locations.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties: Represents the input and output states, contains pixels of different colors (0-9).
  - type: object
    properties: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-background color.
  - type: template
    description: A specific structure consisting of an 'outer shape' and an 'inner pixel'.
    properties:
      - outer_shape: An object (contiguous block of color C_outer).
      - inner_pixel: A single pixel of color C_inner.
      - relationship: The inner_pixel is adjacent (sharing a side or corner) only to pixels belonging to the outer_shape or the background (color 0). All non-background neighbors of the inner_pixel must belong to the outer_shape.
      - location: The coordinates of all pixels comprising the template.
  - type: trigger
    description: An isolated pixel used to determine where templates should be copied.
    properties:
      - color: The color C_trigger of the pixel.
      - location: The coordinates (row, column) of the pixel.
      - condition: The pixel has no neighbors (sharing a side or corner) of the same color C_trigger.
actions:
  - name: identify_templates
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_templates
    description: Scan the grid to find all structures matching the template definition.
  - name: identify_triggers
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_triggers
    description: Scan the grid to find all pixels matching the trigger definition.
  - name: match_and_copy
    input: list_of_templates, list_of_triggers
    output: list_of_copies_to_make (template, target_location)
    description: For each trigger, find a template whose inner_pixel color matches the trigger color. Create a plan to copy that template.
  - name: paste_templates
    input: input_grid, list_of_copies_to_make
    output: output_grid
    description: Start with a copy of the input grid. For each planned copy, overlay the template onto the grid such that the template's original inner_pixel location is mapped to the trigger's location.
relationship: The core relationship is between a trigger pixel and a template. A trigger activates the copying of a template if the trigger's color matches the template's inner pixel color.
alternative_rule (observed in train_1):
  - type: attractor
    description: An isolated single pixel.
  - type: mover
    description: A contiguous shape of a single color, not part of a template.
  - action: move_object
    description: A mover object translates its position to become adjacent to a corresponding attractor pixel. (Pairing rules and exact adjacency unclear from single example). This rule might apply if no templates are found.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Templates:** Scan the input grid to find all "template" structures. A template consists of a single "inner pixel" of color C_inner and an adjacent "outer shape" (a contiguous block of pixels of color C_outer). The defining characteristic is that all non-background neighbors (including diagonals) of the inner pixel must belong to the *same* outer shape. Record the shape, colors (C_inner, C_outer), and coordinates of each template.
3.  **Identify Triggers:** Scan the input grid to find all "trigger" pixels. A trigger is a single pixel of color C_trigger that has no neighbors (including diagonals) of the same color C_trigger. Record the color and coordinates of each trigger.
4.  **Match Triggers to Templates:** Iterate through each identified trigger pixel. For each trigger, check if there exists any identified template whose inner pixel color (C_inner) is the same as the trigger pixel's color (C_trigger).
5.  **Copy and Place Templates:** If a match is found between a trigger (at location L_trigger, color C_trigger) and a template (with inner pixel at L_inner_original, color C_inner = C_trigger), perform the following:
    *   Determine the relative positions of all pixels in the template with respect to its inner pixel (L_inner_original).
    *   Copy the entire template structure (both inner pixel and outer shape pixels).
    *   Place the copied template onto the *output grid* such that the copied inner pixel is positioned at the trigger's location (L_trigger). The other pixels of the copied template are placed relative to this new inner pixel location, maintaining the original shape.
    *   When placing pixels, overwrite any existing pixel values at those coordinates in the output grid.
6.  Repeat step 5 for all identified triggers that have a matching template. If multiple templates match a trigger color, or multiple triggers match a template, apply the copy for all valid pairs (the examples suggest non-overlapping placements, but overwrite if necessary).
7.  The final state of the output grid after all valid template copies have been placed is the result.

*(Self-Correction Note: If steps 2-6 result in no changes to the grid because no templates or no matching triggers were found, consider applying the alternative "Object Attraction" rule observed in train_1, although its specifics are less defined).*
