            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Core Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects, typically made of contiguous blocks of non-background colors. Some objects are simple single pixels, while others are larger shapes.\n2.  **Special Structures (Templates):** In multiple examples (train_2, train_3, train_4), we observe specific structures where a larger shape of one color (\"outer color\") surrounds or is immediately adjacent to a single pixel of a different color (\"inner color\"). These appear to function as \"templates\".\n    *   Example (train_2): Yellow plus-sign (outer) around a green pixel (inner).\n    *   Example (train_3): Yellow T-shape (outer) around a red pixel (inner); Blue L-shape (outer) around a green pixel (inner).\n    *   Example (train_4): Blue shape (outer) around a red pixel (inner).\n3.  **Trigger Pixels:** We also observe isolated single pixels of various colors that are not part of a template structure. These seem to act as \"triggers\".\n    *   Example (train_2): Isolated green pixels.\n    *   Example (train_3): Isolated red pixel, isolated green pixel.\n    *   Example (train_4): Isolated red pixel.\n4.  **Transformation Logic (Copy/Paste):** The predominant pattern (train_2, train_3, train_4) involves copying the template structures identified in step 2 and pasting them onto the grid. The placement of the copied template is determined by the location of a trigger pixel (step 3) whose color matches the *inner* color of the template. The template is pasted such that its inner pixel perfectly overlays the position of the trigger pixel.\n5.  **Anomaly (Train 1):** The first training example (train_1) appears different. It doesn't clearly show the template structure with an inner/outer color relationship. Instead, it looks like object *movement* or *attraction*. An Azure L-shape moves to become adjacent to an isolated green pixel, and a Yellow shape moves to become adjacent to an isolated red pixel. The mechanism here seems distinct from the copy/paste logic in the other examples. Given the prevalence of the copy/paste pattern in the other three examples, I will primarily focus on that rule, treating train_1 as a potential outlier or representing a secondary rule that might apply only when no templates are found.\n6.  **Output Construction:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid. Then, the identified template copies are overlaid onto this grid based on the trigger pixel locations.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Templates:** Scan the input grid to find all \"template\" structures. A template consists of a single \"inner pixel\" of color C_inner and an adjacent \"outer shape\" (a contiguous block of pixels of color C_outer). The defining characteristic is that all non-background neighbors (including diagonals) of the inner pixel must belong to the *same* outer shape. Record the shape, colors (C_inner, C_outer), and coordinates of each template.\n3.  **Identify Triggers:** Scan the input grid to find all \"trigger\" pixels. A trigger is a single pixel of color C_trigger that has no neighbors (including diagonals) of the same color C_trigger. Record the color and coordinates of each trigger.\n4.  **Match Triggers to Templates:** Iterate through each identified trigger pixel. For each trigger, check if there exists any identified template whose inner pixel color (C_inner) is the same as the trigger pixel's color (C_trigger).\n5.  **Copy and Place Templates:** If a match is found between a trigger (at location L_trigger, color C_trigger) and a template (with inner pixel at L_inner_original, color C_inner = C_trigger), perform the following:\n    *   Determine the relative positions of all pixels in the template with respect to its inner pixel (L_inner_original).\n    *   Copy the entire template structure (both inner pixel and outer shape pixels).\n    *   Place the copied template onto the *output grid* such that the copied inner pixel is positioned at the trigger's location (L_trigger). The other pixels of the copied template are placed relative to this new inner pixel location, maintaining the original shape.\n    *   When placing pixels, overwrite any existing pixel values at those coordinates in the output grid.\n6.  Repeat step 5 for all identified triggers that have a matching template. If multiple templates match a trigger color, or multiple triggers match a template, apply the copy for all valid pairs (the examples suggest non-overlapping placements, but overwrite if necessary).\n7.  The final state of the output grid after all valid template copies have been placed is the result.\n\n*(Self-Correction Note: If steps 2-6 result in no changes to the grid because no templates or no matching triggers were found, consider applying the alternative \"Object Attraction\" rule observed in train_1, although its specifics are less defined).*"
