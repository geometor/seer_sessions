            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and two distinct objects of different non-white colors.\n2.  **Object Colors:** One object is consistently red (color 2). The other object's color varies across examples (yellow=4, gray=5, green=3).\n3.  **Object Shapes:** The shapes are varied. The red object is always a solid rectangle. The other object has different forms ('plus' shape, 'L' shape, 'H' shape).\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** In all examples, the non-red object partially overlaps or intersects with the red object.\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the red object exactly as it was in the input. The non-red object is modified.\n6.  **Transformation:** The non-red object appears to be \"clipped\" or \"masked\" by the red object. Only the pixels of the non-red object that occupy the same position as pixels of the red object in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. All other pixels of the original non-red object are turned white (0). The red object itself remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
