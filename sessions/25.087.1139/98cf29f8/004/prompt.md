```python
import numpy as np

"""
Identifies two distinct non-white objects in the input grid. One object is a solid rectangle (the mask), and the other is the target object.
The output grid displays the mask object, but replaces the pixels where the target object overlaps the mask with the target object's color.
Essentially, the mask acts as a window or stencil, revealing the part of the target object that falls within its boundaries, while the rest of the mask remains visible. Pixels outside the mask area are white (background).
