**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted to implement a Manhattan distance-based coloring scheme within a green frame, originating from green "seed" pixels. However, the comparison between the transformed output and the expected output reveals significant discrepancies in the placement of red (2) and yellow (4) pixels across all examples. The core logic of calculating the minimum Manhattan distance independently for each white pixel to the initial seed(s) appears flawed. The expected outputs suggest a pattern more akin to a wave propagation or Breadth-First Search (BFS) originating from the seeds, where the color (red or yellow) depends on the *step number* (distance) in this propagation. The seed identification logic in the previous code might also have contributed to errors, although the primary issue seems to be the filling algorithm.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Refine Seed/Frame Identification:** Implement a simpler, more robust method to identify the green frame boundaries and the internal green seed pixels. Find the bounding box of all green pixels; frame pixels are those on the boundary, seed pixels are those strictly inside.
2.  **Implement Wave Propagation (BFS):** Replace the static distance calculation with a BFS algorithm.
    *   Initialize a queue with all seed pixel locations and their distance (0).
    *   Maintain a distance grid initialized to infinity, setting seed locations to 0.
    *   Maintain an output grid, initially a copy of the input.
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a pixel `(r, c)` with distance `d`.
        *   For each valid neighbor `(nr, nc)` (within bounds, inside the frame, and initially white in the input):
            *   If the neighbor hasn't been visited (distance is infinity):
                *   Calculate the new distance `nd = d + 1`.
                *   Update the neighbor's distance in the distance grid.
                *   Determine the color based on `nd`: Yellow (4) if `nd` is odd, Red (2) if `nd` is even.
                *   Update the color in the `output_grid`.
                *   Enqueue the neighbor `(nr, nc)` with distance `nd`.
3.  **Ensure Constraints:** The coloring should only affect pixels that are initially white (0) and strictly inside the frame boundaries. Frame pixels and seed pixels should remain green (3).

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the assumptions using the wave propagation model on Example 1's expected output.
Seed: (8, 5)
Expected Output:

```
...
0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 3
0 0 0 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 4
0 0 0 3 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 5
0 0 0 3 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 6
0 0 0 3 4 4 4 2 4 2 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 7
0 0 0 3 4 3 4 2 4 2 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 8 (Seed row)
0 0 0 3 4 4 4 2 4 2 4 3 0 0 0  <- Row 9
0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
...
```

Distances from seed (8, 5) and expected colors:
- (8, 4): d=1 (Odd) -> Expected Yellow (4). Correct.
- (7, 5): d=1 (Odd) -> Expected Yellow (4). Correct.
- (7, 4): d=2 (Even) -> Expected Red (2). Correct.
- (6, 5): d=2 (Even) -> Expected Red (2). Correct.
- (6, 4): d=3 (Odd) -> Expected Yellow (4). Correct.
- (5, 5): d=3 (Odd) -> Expected Yellow (4). Correct.
- (5, 4): d=4 (Even) -> Expected Red (2). Correct.
- (4, 5): d=4 (Even) -> Expected Red (2). Correct.
- (4, 4): d=5 (Odd) -> Expected Yellow (4). Transformed output had 4, but expected output has 2. Hmm. Let me re-recheck the expected output for Ex 1 at (4,4). It is indeed Red(2). My distance calculation is |8-4|+|5-4| = 4+1=5. This is odd. Odd should be Yellow(4). Why is it Red(2)?

Re-evaluating Example 1 Expected Output @ (4,4):
Input is white(0). Seed is (8,5). Manhattan distance is 5 (odd). Rule (odd->Yellow=4, even->Red=2) predicts Yellow(4). Expected output shows Red(2).

Let's retry the BFS wave propagation manually, carefully tracking steps:
- Seeds: {(8, 5)} dist 0, Color Green(3)
- Step 1 (Fill neighbors of seeds): {(7,5), (9,5), (8,4), (8,6)}. Set dist=1. Color Yellow(4). Output grid now has these yellow pixels.
- Step 2 (Fill neighbors of step 1 pixels, if white and dist=inf): Neighbors are:
    - (7,5) -> (6,5), (7,4), (7,6)
    - (9,5) -> (10,5 frame), (9,4), (9,6)
    - (8,4) -> (7,4), (9,4), (8,3)
    - (8,6) -> (7,6), (9,6), (8,7)
    - Unique, inside, white neighbors: {(6,5), (7,4), (7,6), (9,4), (9,6), (8,3), (8,7)}. Set dist=2. Color Red(2).
- Step 3 (Fill neighbors of step 2 pixels): Neighbors include:
    - (6,5) -> (5,5), (6,4), (6,6)
    - (7,4) -> (6,4), (7,3)
    - etc.
    - Unique, inside, white neighbors: {(5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (7,3), (7,7), (9,3), (9,7), (8,2 frame), (10,4 frame), (10,6 frame),...}. Set dist=3. Color Yellow(4). Focus on inside: {(5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (7,3), (7,7), (9,3), (9,7)}.
- Step 4 (Fill neighbors of step 3 pixels): Neighbors include:
    - (5,5) -> (4,5), (5,4), (5,6)
    - (6,4) -> (5,4), (6,3)
    - etc.
    - Unique, inside, white neighbors: {(4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,3), (6,7), (7,2 frame), (7,8 frame), (9,2 frame), (9,8 frame),...}. Set dist=4. Color Red(2). Focus on inside: {(4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,3), (6,7)}.
- Step 5 (Fill neighbors of step 4 pixels): Neighbors include:
    - (4,5) -> (3,5), (4,4), (4,6)
    - (5,4) -> (4,4), (5,3)
    - etc.
    - Unique, inside, white neighbors: {(3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,3), (5,7), ...}. Set dist=5. Color Yellow(4). Focus on inside: {(3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,3), (5,7)}.
- Step 6 (Fill neighbors of step 5 pixels): Neighbors include:
    - (3,5) -> (3,4), (3,6)
    - (4,4) -> (3,4), (4,3)
    - etc.
    - Unique, inside, white neighbors: {(3,4), (3,6), (4,3), (4,7), ...}. Set dist=6. Color Red(2). Focus on inside: {(3,4), (3,6), (4,3), (4,7)}.

Now compare with Expected Output for Example 1:
- Pixel (4,4): BFS distance is 5 (Odd). BFS color should be Yellow(4). Expected is Red(2). **Still a mismatch.**
- Pixel (3,4): BFS distance is 6 (Even). BFS color should be Red(2). Expected is Yellow(4). **Still a mismatch.**

The simple BFS wave propagation with odd/even coloring doesn't match Example 1.

Let's reconsider the expected output pattern.
Example 1 Expected:

```
. . . 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 . . .
. . . 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 . . . (Row 3) -> d=3,4,5,6 - All Yellow? No.
. . . 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 3 . . . (Row 4) -> d=2,3,4,5 - Mixed.
. . . 3 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 3 . . . (Row 5) -> d=1,2,3,4 - Mixed.
. . . 3 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 3 . . . (Row 6) -> d=2,3,4 - Mixed.
. . . 3 4 4 4 2 4 2 4 3 . . . (Row 7) -> d=1,2,3 - Mixed.
. . . 3 4 3 4 2 4 2 4 3 . . . (Row 8) -> d=0,1,2 - Seed is G(3), d=1 Y(4), d=2 R(2).
. . . 3 4 4 4 2 4 2 4 3 . . . (Row 9) -> d=1,2,3 - Mixed.
. . . 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 . . .
```

Distances from seed (8,5):
Row 3: (3,4) d=6, (3,5) d=5, (3,6) d=5, (3,7) d=6, (3,8) d=7, (3,9) d=8, (3,10) d=9. Colors: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4.
Row 4: (4,4) d=5, (4,5) d=4, (4,6) d=3, (4,7) d=4, (4,8) d=5, (4,9) d=6, (4,10) d=7. Colors: 2 2 2 2 2 2 4.
Row 8: (8,4) d=1, (8,5) d=0, (8,6) d=1, (8,7) d=2, (8,8) d=3, (8,9) d=4, (8,10) d=5. Colors: 4 3 4 2 4 2 4.

There is NO simple relationship between the Manhattan distance to the *single* seed and the output color.

What if the "distance" isn't Manhattan? What if it's steps, but diagonals are allowed (Chebyshev distance)?
Chebyshev dist((r1, c1), (r2, c2)) = max(|r1-r2|, |c1-c2|)
Seed (8,5).
(4,4): Cheb dist = max(|8-4|, |5-4|) = max(4, 1) = 4 (Even). Expected Red(2). Matches!
(3,4): Cheb dist = max(|8-3|, |5-4|) = max(5, 1) = 5 (Odd). Expected Yellow(4). Matches!
(4,10): Cheb dist = max(|8-4|, |5-10|) = max(4, 5) = 5 (Odd). Expected Yellow(4). Row 4, col 10 -> Yellow(4). Matches!
(8,10): Cheb dist = max(|8-8|, |5-10|) = max(0, 5) = 5 (Odd). Expected Yellow(4). Row 8, col 10 -> Yellow(4). Matches!

Let's test Chebyshev on Example 3. Seeds (3,9), (3,11).
Pixel (4,10):
Dist to (3,9): max(|4-3|, |10-9|) = max(1, 1) = 1 (Odd).
Dist to (3,11): max(|4-3|, |10-11|) = max(1, 1) = 1 (Odd).
Min dist = 1 (Odd). Expected color: Red(2). Rule (Odd->Yellow, Even->Red) predicts Yellow(4). Doesn't match.

Maybe the rule is swapped? Odd -> Red, Even -> Yellow?
Test Chebyshev with Odd->Red(2), Even->Yellow(4):
Ex 1:
(4,4): Cheb dist = 4 (Even). Rule predicts Yellow(4). Expected is Red(2). Fails.
(3,4): Cheb dist = 5 (Odd). Rule predicts Red(2). Expected is Yellow(4). Fails.

Let's go back to the initial description: "Fill the area inside a green rectangular frame based on the Manhattan distance from internal green 'seed' pixels. ... White pixels inside the frame are colored based on their minimum Manhattan distance (d) to any seed pixel: yellow (4) if d is odd, red (2) if d is even and positive."
This is exactly what the code *tried* to do. Why did the output differ so much from the expected?

Let's re-run the logic from the *code* on a pixel.
Example 1: Seed (8,5). Target (3,4).
Manhattan dist = |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6.
Distance is 6 (Even). Code should color Red(2).
Transformed output for (3,4) is 2. This matches the code's logic.
Expected output for (3,4) is 4 (Yellow).

Example 1: Seed (8,5). Target (4,4).
Manhattan dist = |8-4| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5.
Distance is 5 (Odd). Code should color Yellow(4).
Transformed output for (4,4) is 4. This matches the code's logic.
Expected output for (4,4) is 2 (Red).

**Conclusion:** The original code correctly implemented the logic described in its own docstring (min Manhattan distance, odd->Yellow, even->Red). However, this logic *does not produce the expected output*. The description or the understanding of the task was flawed.

The BFS/Wave propagation approach *also* failed to match when using Manhattan distance steps and the odd/even rule. The Chebyshev distance trial also failed.

There must be another mechanism. Look at Example 1 again.
The pattern looks like regions.
Seed: (8,5) Green(3)
Dist 1 (Manhattan): (7,5), (9,5), (8,4), (8,6) - All Yellow(4) in Expected.
Dist 2 (Manhattan): (6,5), (10,5 F), (7,4), (7,6), (9,4), (9,6), (8,3), (8,7) - All Red(2) in Expected (where inside).
Dist 3 (Manhattan): (5,5), (7,3), (7,7), (9,3), (9,7), (6,4), (6,6), etc. - All Yellow(4) in Expected.
Dist 4 (Manhattan): (4,5), (6,3), (6,7), (8,3), (8,7), (5,4), (5,6), etc. - All Red(2) in Expected.
Dist 5 (Manhattan): (3,5), (5,3), (5,7), (7,2 F), (7,8 F), (4,4), (4,6), etc. - All Yellow(4) in Expected.
Dist 6 (Manhattan): (2,5 F), (4,3), (4,7), (6,2 F), (6,8 F), (3,4), (3,6), etc. - All Red(2) in Expected.

Pixel (4,4) has Manhattan distance 5. Should be Yellow(4). Expected is Red(2).
Pixel (3,4) has Manhattan distance 6. Should be Red(2). Expected is Yellow(4).

It seems the coloring rule is **swapped** compared to the initial guess: **Odd distance -> Red (2), Even distance > 0 -> Yellow (4)**.

Let's re-test this hypothesis:
Rule: d > 0. Odd -> Red(2), Even -> Yellow(4).
Ex 1, Seed (8,5):
(4,4): d=5 (Odd). Rule -> Red(2). Expected -> Red(2). MATCH!
(3,4): d=6 (Even). Rule -> Yellow(4). Expected -> Yellow(4). MATCH!
(8,10): d=5 (Odd). Rule -> Red(2). Expected -> Yellow(4). FAIL! Ugh.

What is special about (8,10)? It's d=5 from (8,5). Why is it Yellow(4)?
Compare (8,10) d=5, Yellow(4) with (4,4) d=5, Red(2).
Compare (8,9) d=4, Yellow(4) with (4,5) d=4, Red(2).

Let's look at the count of Red vs Yellow in Expected Output 1:
Yellows: 37, Reds: 26.
Let's calculate distances for all inside white pixels:
