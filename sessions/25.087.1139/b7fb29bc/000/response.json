            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Each input grid consists of a white background (0) with a hollow green rectangle (3) frame. Inside this frame, there are one or more isolated green pixels (3).\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the green frame exactly as it was in the input. The background outside the frame also remains white. The key change occurs *inside* the frame.\n3.  **Transformation:** The area enclosed by the green frame, which was initially white (0) except for the isolated green 'seed' pixels, is filled with a pattern of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels in the output. The original internal green pixels remain green.\n4.  **Filling Pattern:** The filling seems to originate from the internal green 'seed' pixels. The color assigned to a filled pixel depends on its distance from the nearest seed pixel.\n    *   Pixels directly adjacent (sharing an edge, not just a corner) to a seed pixel become yellow (4).\n    *   Pixels directly adjacent to those yellow pixels (and not seeds or already yellow) become red (2).\n    *   Pixels directly adjacent to those red pixels become yellow (4) again.\n    *   This pattern continues, alternating between yellow (4) and red (2), based on the shortest Manhattan distance to any internal seed pixel. Odd distances result in yellow, and even distances result in red. The filling stops at the green frame boundary.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
