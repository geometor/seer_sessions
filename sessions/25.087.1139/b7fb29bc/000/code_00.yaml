task_description: Fill the area inside a green frame based on the distance from internal green seed pixels.
elements:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
  - object: frame
    shape: hollow rectangle
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - encloses an area
      - remains unchanged in the output
  - object: seed_pixels
    color: green (3)
    location: inside the frame
    properties:
      - isolated pixels in the input
      - act as starting points for filling
      - remain green in the output
  - object: filled_area
    location: inside the frame (originally white pixels)
    properties:
      - filled with alternating colors in the output
      - colors are yellow (4) and red (2)
relationships:
  - type: enclosure
    parent: frame
    child: seed_pixels

  - type: distance_coloring
    source: seed_pixels
    target: filled_area
    details: >
      The color of a pixel in the filled_area is determined by its minimum
      Manhattan distance (d) to any seed_pixel.
      If d=0 (it's a seed pixel), color remains green (3).
      If d > 0 and d is odd, color is yellow (4).
      If d > 0 and d is even, color is red (2).
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: frame
  - action: identify
    target: seed_pixels (green pixels inside the frame)
  - action: calculate_distance
    from: each white pixel inside the frame
    to: all seed_pixels
    metric: Manhattan distance
    result: minimum distance (d) for each white pixel
  - action: color_fill
    target: white pixels inside the frame
    rule: >
      Based on minimum distance (d):
      If d is odd, set color to yellow (4).
      If d is even, set color to red (2).
