Specifically, blue pixels that form part of a closed loop or shape which fully encloses one or more background (maroon) pixels are changed to azure.\n    *   Blue pixels that are part of shapes not enclosing any background pixels, or blue pixels that are isolated or part of lines/arcs that don't form a complete enclosure, remain blue.\n    *   The background maroon pixels (9) are never changed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
