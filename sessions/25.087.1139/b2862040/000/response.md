*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids consist primarily of a background color (maroon, 9) and foreground objects composed of blue pixels (1).
    *   The output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some blue pixels (1) are changed to azure pixels (8).
    *   The key transformation appears to be related to the topological property of the blue shapes. Specifically, blue pixels that form part of a closed loop or shape which fully encloses one or more background (maroon) pixels are changed to azure.
    *   Blue pixels that are part of shapes not enclosing any background pixels, or blue pixels that are isolated or part of lines/arcs that don't form a complete enclosure, remain blue.
    *   The background maroon pixels (9) are never changed.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Change the color of blue pixels based on whether they form part of a region that encloses background pixels.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
    
      - element: pixel
        properties:
          - color: Can be maroon (9), blue (1), or azure (8).
          - location: Defined by row and column index.
    
      - element: background
        description: The most common pixel color, typically maroon (9). It defines the space outside or potentially inside foreground objects.
        properties:
          - color: maroon (9)
    
      - element: blue_region
        description: A contiguous group of blue (1) pixels connected orthogonally or diagonally (connectivity needs checking, but orthogonal seems sufficient based on examples).
        properties:
          - color: blue (1)
          - connectivity: Pixels forming the region are adjacent.
          - enclosure_status: Can either enclose a region of background pixels or not.
    
      - element: azure_region
        description: A region in the output grid corresponding to a blue_region in the input that enclosed background pixels.
        properties:
          - color: azure (8)
    
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: Blue regions exist within the grid, potentially surrounding background pixels.
      - type: transformation
        description: A blue_region transforms into an azure_region if and only if it encloses one or more background (maroon) pixels. Otherwise, it remains a blue_region.
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_regions
        actor: system
        input: input grid
        output: sets of coordinates for each contiguous blue_region.
    
      - action: check_enclosure
        actor: system
        input: a blue_region, the grid
        description: Determine if the given blue_region completely surrounds any maroon (9) pixels. This involves checking if there are maroon pixels from which one cannot reach the grid boundary without crossing a blue pixel of the region.
        output: boolean (true if enclosing, false otherwise).
    
      - action: recolor_region
        actor: system
        input: output grid (initially a copy of input), a blue_region, enclosure_status
        description: If enclosure_status is true, change the color of all pixels in the blue_region from blue (1) to azure (8) in the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions composed of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Treat pixels connected orthogonally (up, down, left, right) as part of the same region.
    3.  For each identified blue region:
        a.  Determine if this region completely encloses any area containing only maroon (9) pixels. A region encloses maroon pixels if there exists at least one maroon pixel such that any path from this pixel to the boundary of the grid must cross a blue pixel belonging to the current region.
        b.  If the blue region encloses one or more maroon pixels, change the color of all pixels belonging to this region in the output grid from blue (1) to azure (8).
    4.  Return the modified output grid.
