Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids appear to be consistently composed of two distinct, equally sized rectangular regions placed side-by-side either horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Region Identification:** Each region is characterized by a dominant background color.
3.  **Key Background Colors:** Two specific background colors seem crucial: gray (6) and azure (8). One of the two regions in the input always uses either gray (6) or azure (8) as its background. The other region uses a different background color (blue (1) in ex1, white (0) in ex2, yellow (4) in ex3).
4.  **Shapes:** Within each region, there are patterns or "shapes" made of pixels with colors different from the region's background color.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting one region's background color and the other region's shapes.
6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the two input regions.
7.  **Rule:** It appears the rule is: identify the region whose background is gray (6) or azure (8). Extract the shapes (non-background pixels) from this region. Identify the *other* region and its background color. The output grid has the dimensions of these regions, is filled with the background color of the *other* region, and has the shapes from the gray/azure region overlaid onto it in their original relative positions.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input:
  Structure: Composite grid containing two equally sized rectangular subgrids (regions).
  Regions:
    - Identified by their dominant background color.
    - Exactly one region has a background color of gray (6) or azure (8) (let's call this the "Source Region").
    - The other region has a different background color (let's call this the "Target Region").
    - Regions share a common boundary (horizontal or vertical).
  Shapes:
    - Contiguous or non-contiguous pixels within a region whose color differs from the region's background color.
Output:
  Dimensions: Same height and width as the Target Region (and Source Region).
  Background Color: Uniformly filled with the background color of the Target Region.
  Foreground Content: Contains only the shapes extracted from the Source Region.
  Shape Placement: Shapes from the Source Region are placed onto the output grid at the same relative row and column indices they occupied within the Source Region.
Transformation:
  Action: Identify Source and Target regions based on background colors (6 or 8 vs. other).
  Action: Extract non-background pixels (shapes) and their relative coordinates from the Source Region.
  Action: Determine the background color and dimensions of the Target Region.
  Action: Construct the output grid using Target Region dimensions and background color.
  Action: Overlay the extracted shapes onto the output grid at their original relative coordinates.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the two distinct rectangular regions based on their dominant background colors. Note their dimensions, which should be identical.
2.  Determine which region has gray (6) or azure (8) as its background color (this is the "Source Region") and which region has a different background color (this is the "Target Region").
3.  Record the background color of the Target Region.
4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the Target Region, and fill it completely with the Target Region's background color.
5.  Iterate through each pixel in the Source Region.
6.  If a pixel's color in the Source Region is *not* the Source Region's background color (i.e., it's part of a shape), copy this pixel's color to the corresponding position (same row and column index relative to the region's top-left corner) in the new grid created in step 4.
7.  The final grid constructed in steps 4-6 is the output.
