            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids appear to be consistently composed of two distinct, equally sized rectangular regions placed side-by-side either horizontally or vertically.\n2.  **Region Identification:** Each region is characterized by a dominant background color.\n3.  **Key Background Colors:** Two specific background colors seem crucial: gray (6) and azure (8). One of the two regions in the input always uses either gray (6) or azure (8) as its background. The other region uses a different background color (blue (1) in ex1, white (0) in ex2, yellow (4) in ex3).\n4.  **Shapes:** Within each region, there are patterns or \"shapes\" made of pixels with colors different from the region's background color.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting one region's background color and the other region's shapes.\n6.  **Output Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the two input regions.\n7.  **Rule:** It appears the rule is: identify the region whose background is gray (6) or azure (8). Extract the shapes (non-background pixels) from this region. Identify the *other* region and its background color. The output grid has the dimensions of these regions, is filled with the background color of the *other* region, and has the shapes from the gray/azure region overlaid onto it in their original relative positions.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine which region has gray (6) or azure (8) as its background color (this is the \"Source Region\") and which region has a different background color (this is the \"Target Region\").\n3.  Record the background color of the Target Region.\n4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the Target Region, and fill it completely with the Target Region's background color.\n5.  Iterate through each pixel in the Source Region.\n6.  If a pixel's color in the Source Region is *not* the Source Region's background color (i.e., it's part of a shape), copy this pixel's color to the corresponding position (same row and column index relative to the region's top-left corner) in the new grid created in step 4.\n7.  The final grid constructed in steps 4-6 is the output."
