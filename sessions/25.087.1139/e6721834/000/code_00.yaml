Input:
  Structure: Composite grid containing two equally sized rectangular subgrids (regions).
  Regions:
    - Identified by their dominant background color.
    - Exactly one region has a background color of gray (6) or azure (8) (let's call this the "Source Region").
    - The other region has a different background color (let's call this the "Target Region").
    - Regions share a common boundary (horizontal or vertical).
  Shapes:
    - Contiguous or non-contiguous pixels within a region whose color differs from the region's background color.
Output:
  Dimensions: Same height and width as the Target Region (and Source Region).
  Background Color: Uniformly filled with the background color of the Target Region.
  Foreground Content: Contains only the shapes extracted from the Source Region.
  Shape Placement: Shapes from the Source Region are placed onto the output grid at the same relative row and column indices they occupied within the Source Region.
Transformation:
  Action: Identify Source and Target regions based on background colors (6 or 8 vs. other).
  Action: Extract non-background pixels (shapes) and their relative coordinates from the Source Region.
  Action: Determine the background color and dimensions of the Target Region.
  Action: Construct the output grid using Target Region dimensions and background color.
  Action: Overlay the extracted shapes onto the output grid at their original relative coordinates.
