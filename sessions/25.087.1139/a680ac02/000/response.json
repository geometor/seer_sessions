If two start on the same row, their left-to-right order is preserved.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

The bounding box dimensions are exactly 4x4.\n        b.  The pattern within the 4x4 bounding box represents a \"hollow square\": the 1-pixel border consists of a single non-white color, and the central 2x2 area consists of white pixels (color 0).\n    4.  Record the 4x4 pixel data and the original top-left row and column index for each qualifying hollow square object.\n    5.  Sort the identified hollow square objects based primarily on their original top-left row index (ascending order). If two objects share the same row index, sort them secondarily by their original top-left column index (ascending order).\n    6.  Create a new output grid with a height of 4 and a width equal to 4 multiplied by the number of sorted hollow squares.\n    7.  Iterate through the sorted hollow square objects.
