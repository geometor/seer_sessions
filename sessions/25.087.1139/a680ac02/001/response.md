Identify all 4x4 hollow square patterns in the input grid. A hollow square is defined 
as a 4x4 grid where the 1-pixel border consists of a single non-white color, 
and the central 2x2 area consists of white pixels (color 0). Sort these identified 
hollow squares based on their top-left corner's position in the input grid (top-to-bottom, 
then left-to-right). Construct the output grid by concatenating these sorted hollow 
squares horizontally.
