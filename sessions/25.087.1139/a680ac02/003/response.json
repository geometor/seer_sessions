A hollow square is defined\nas a 4x4 grid area where the 1-pixel border consists of a single non-white color (1-9),\nand the central 2x2 area consists entirely of white pixels (color 0).\n\nIf no hollow squares are found, the output is a 1x1 grid containing white (0).\nIf one hollow square is found, the output is that 4x4 square.\nIf multiple hollow squares are found, they are arranged based on the spatial extent\nof their top-left coordinates in the input grid:\n1. Calculate the range of row indices (max_row - min_row) and column indices (max_col - min_col)\n   covered by the top-left corners of the squares.\n2. If the row range is greater than or equal to the column range, the arrangement is Vertical.\n3. Otherwise (column range > row range), the arrangement is Horizontal.\n4. The squares are sorted primarily by their top-left column index, then by their top-left row index.\n5.
