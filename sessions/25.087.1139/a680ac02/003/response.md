"""
Identifies all 4x4 hollow squares within the input grid. A hollow square is defined
as a 4x4 grid area where the 1-pixel border consists of a single non-white color (1-9),
and the central 2x2 area consists entirely of white pixels (color 0).

If no hollow squares are found, the output is a 1x1 grid containing white (0).
If one hollow square is found, the output is that 4x4 square.
If multiple hollow squares are found, they are arranged based on the spatial extent
of their top-left coordinates in the input grid:
1. Calculate the range of row indices (max_row - min_row) and column indices (max_col - min_col)
   covered by the top-left corners of the squares.
2. If the row range is greater than or equal to the column range, the arrangement is Vertical.
3. Otherwise (column range > row range), the arrangement is Horizontal.
4. The squares are sorted primarily by their top-left column index, then by their top-left row index.
5. The sorted squares are then either stacked vertically (top-to-bottom) or concatenated
   horizontally (left-to-right) according to the determined arrangement to form the output grid.
