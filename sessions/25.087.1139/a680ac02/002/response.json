However, it failed on two out of three examples due to incorrect arrangement logic. The original code assumed horizontal concatenation sorted by row-then-column coordinates.\n\nAnalysis of the failures and the single success revealed:\n1.  The sorting criteria should be column-first, then row-second, based on the top-left coordinate of each square.\n2.  The arrangement (horizontal concatenation vs. vertical stacking) depends on the relative spatial extent of the identified squares in the input grid. Specifically, it depends on the comparison between the row span and column span of the top-left coordinates of all found squares.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation logic to incorporate the correct sorting key and the span-based arrangement rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution:\n\n"

Calculate the row span: `row_span = max_r - min_r`.\n        - c. Calculate the column span: `col_span = max_c - min_c`.\n        - d. Sort the identified hollow squares based on their top-left coordinates, primarily by column index, and secondarily by row index.\n        - e. Determine the arrangement direction: If `row_span >= col_span`, the arrangement is Vertical. Otherwise (`col_span > row_span`), the arrangement is Horizontal.\n    - 4. Construct the output grid:\n        - If the arrangement is Vertical: Create an output grid with height `4 * number_of_squares` and width `4`. Place the sorted squares one below the other in the determined order.\n        - If the arrangement is Horizontal: Create an output grid with height `4` and width `4 * number_of_squares`.

            "text": "\n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n1.  **Identify:** Scan the input grid to find all occurrences of 4x4 \"hollow squares\". A hollow square has a border exactly 1 pixel thick, made of a single non-white color, and a 2x2 center filled with the white background color. Keep track of the 4x4 pixel data and the top-left `(row, column)` coordinate of each hollow square found.\n2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If zero hollow squares are found, produce a 1x1 output grid containing only the white background color. If exactly one hollow square is found, the output is simply that 4x4 square.\n3.  **Determine Arrangement (if multiple squares found):**\n    a.  Collect the top-left `(row, column)` coordinates of all identified hollow squares.\n    b.  Find the minimum and maximum row coordinate (`min_r`, `max_r`) and the minimum and maximum column coordinate (`min_c`, `max_c`) among these coordinates.\n    c.  Calculate the vertical span (`row_span = max_r - min_r`) and horizontal span (`col_span = max_c - min_c`).\n    d.  The arrangement direction is **Vertical** if `row_span` is greater than or equal to `col_span`.\n    e.  The arrangement direction is **Horizontal** if `col_span` is greater than `row_span`.\n4.  **Sort:** Create a list of the identified hollow squares. Sort this list based on the top-left coordinates, primarily by the column index (ascending) and secondarily by the row index (ascending).\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid. Assemble the sorted hollow squares according to the determined arrangement direction:\n    *   If **Vertical**, stack the sorted squares vertically (top to bottom). The output grid dimensions will be `(4 * number_of_squares) x 4`.\n    *   If **Horizontal**, concatenate the sorted squares horizontally (left to right). The output grid dimensions will be `4 x (4 * number_of_squares)`.\n6.  **Return:** Output the newly constructed grid."
