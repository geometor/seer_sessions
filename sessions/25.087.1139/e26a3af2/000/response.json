            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a mix of different colors, often appearing as scattered pixels or small clusters within larger regions that have a predominant color.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are significantly simplified compared to the inputs. They consist of large, monochromatic rectangular blocks that partition the entire grid either horizontally or vertically.\n3.  **Color Preservation:** The colors used in the output blocks are always present in the corresponding input grid, specifically, they are the most frequent colors within certain regions of the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying major color regions in the input, determining the dominant color within each region, and then simplifying the grid by filling each region entirely with its dominant color. The \"noise\" pixels (less frequent colors within a region) are removed.\n5.  **Partitioning:** The crucial step seems to be identifying how the grid is partitioned. In some examples (train_1, train_2), the partitions are vertical columns or strips. In another example (train_3), the partitions are horizontal rows or strips. The orientation of partitioning (vertical vs. horizontal) appears to be determined by the overall structure of the dominant color regions in the input. If large color blocks primarily extend vertically, the partitioning is vertical. If they extend horizontally, the partitioning is horizontal.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

The regions form a partition of the grid, either as vertical strips or horizontal strips.\n\ngrid_properties:\n  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.\n  - content_change: Pixels within the grid change color based on regional dominance.\n\npartitioning:\n  type: Monochromatic blocks (either horizontal or vertical strips).\n  orientation_determination: Check if the dominant color regions primarily extend vertically (forming columns) or horizontally (forming rows). This can be inferred by finding rows or columns that are composed mostly or entirely of a single color and span the grid's width or height, respectively.\n  boundaries: Defined by the transition points between these dominant color regions along the determined orientation (vertical or horizontal).\n\nregional_transformation:\n  - identify_regions: Based on the determined partitioning (vertical or horizontal strips) and their boundaries.\n  - find_dominant_color: For each region (strip) in the input grid, calculate the frequency of each color. The color with the highest frequency is the dominant color for that region.\n  - fill_region: In the output grid, fill the entire area corresponding to the input region with its identified dominant color.\n\ncolor_mapping:\n  output_colors: Are a subset of input colors. Specifically, they are the dominant colors of the identified regions.\n  input_colors_ignored: Colors within a region that are not the dominant color are replaced by the dominant color in the output.\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Grid Structure:** Examine the input grid to determine the primary orientation of large, dominant color blocks. Check if there are columns that span most of the grid's height and consist mainly of a single color, OR if there are rows that span most of the grid's width and consist mainly of a single color. This determines whether the grid should be partitioned vertically or horizontally.\n2.  **Identify Partition Boundaries:**\n    *   If partitioning is **vertical**: Find the column indices where the dominant color changes significantly compared to the previous column. These indices define the vertical boundaries of the partitions (strips). Include the start (column 0) and end (grid width) as implicit boundaries.\n    *   If partitioning is **horizontal**: Find the row indices where the dominant color changes significantly compared to the previous row. These indices define the horizontal boundaries of the partitions (strips). Include the start (row 0) and end (grid height) as implicit boundaries.\n3.  **Process Each Partition:** Iterate through the identified partitions (vertical or horizontal strips).\n4.  **Find Dominant Color:** For the current partition, examine all the pixels within that region in the *input* grid. Count the occurrences of each color. Identify the color that appears most frequently (the mode).\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input. Fill the area corresponding to the current partition in the *output* grid entirely with the dominant color found in step 4.\n6.  **Final Output:** Once all partitions have been processed and filled in the new grid, this grid represents the final output."
