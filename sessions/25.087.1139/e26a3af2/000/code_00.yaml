task_description: Identify the dominant color within distinct regions of the input grid and fill those regions entirely with their dominant color in the output grid. The regions form a partition of the grid, either as vertical strips or horizontal strips.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - content_change: Pixels within the grid change color based on regional dominance.

partitioning:
  type: Monochromatic blocks (either horizontal or vertical strips).
  orientation_determination: Check if the dominant color regions primarily extend vertically (forming columns) or horizontally (forming rows). This can be inferred by finding rows or columns that are composed mostly or entirely of a single color and span the grid's width or height, respectively.
  boundaries: Defined by the transition points between these dominant color regions along the determined orientation (vertical or horizontal).

regional_transformation:
  - identify_regions: Based on the determined partitioning (vertical or horizontal strips) and their boundaries.
  - find_dominant_color: For each region (strip) in the input grid, calculate the frequency of each color. The color with the highest frequency is the dominant color for that region.
  - fill_region: In the output grid, fill the entire area corresponding to the input region with its identified dominant color.

color_mapping:
  output_colors: Are a subset of input colors. Specifically, they are the dominant colors of the identified regions.
  input_colors_ignored: Colors within a region that are not the dominant color are replaced by the dominant color in the output.
