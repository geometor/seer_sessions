elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      height: varies (e.g., 12, 13, 7, 17)
      width: varies (e.g., 12, 13, 7, 17)
      pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - object: column
    attributes:
      index: integer from 0 to width-1
      pixels: sequence of pixels from top to bottom

transformation:
  type: columnar_fill
  direction: vertical (bottom-to-top propagation)
  input_dependency: non-white pixels determine the fill color
  output_generation:
    process: Iterate through each column independently.
    column_process:
      - Initialize a 'current_fill_color' to white (0).
      - Iterate through the rows of the column from bottom to top (row_index = height-1 down to 0).
      - Get the color of the pixel in the input grid at (row_index, column_index). Let this be 'input_color'.
      - If 'input_color' is not white (0), update 'current_fill_color' to 'input_color'.
      - Set the color of the pixel in the output grid at (row_index, column_index) to the 'current_fill_color'.

relationship:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The transformation for each column is independent of other columns.
  - The color of an output pixel depends on the input pixels at or below it in the same column. Specifically, it depends on the color of the nearest non-white input pixel at or below its row index.
