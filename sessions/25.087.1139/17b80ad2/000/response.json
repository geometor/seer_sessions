The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors).\n2.  **Color Preservation:** The colors present in the input grid are the only colors (other than white) present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to operate column by column. Within each column, colored pixels seem to \"fill\" or \"propagate\" vertically.\n4.  **Vertical Filling:** Observing the examples, particularly `train_1` and `train_3`, suggests that a colored pixel in the input influences the cells above it in the same column in the output, up to the next colored pixel or the top of the grid.\n5.  **Direction of Influence:** When scanning a column from bottom to top in the input, if a non-white pixel is encountered, that color seems to \"paint\" the corresponding output cells upwards until another non-white pixel is encountered in the input column. The color then switches to the new color, which continues painting upwards. White pixels in the input do not change the painting color; the previously encountered non-white color continues to propagate upwards through white input cells.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
