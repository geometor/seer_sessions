Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions. The grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors).
2.  **Color Preservation:** The colors present in the input grid are the only colors (other than white) present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to operate column by column. Within each column, colored pixels seem to "fill" or "propagate" vertically.
4.  **Vertical Filling:** Observing the examples, particularly `train_1` and `train_3`, suggests that a colored pixel in the input influences the cells above it in the same column in the output, up to the next colored pixel or the top of the grid.
5.  **Direction of Influence:** When scanning a column from bottom to top in the input, if a non-white pixel is encountered, that color seems to "paint" the corresponding output cells upwards until another non-white pixel is encountered in the input column. The color then switches to the new color, which continues painting upwards. White pixels in the input do not change the painting color; the previously encountered non-white color continues to propagate upwards through white input cells.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    attributes:
      height: varies (e.g., 12, 13, 7, 17)
      width: varies (e.g., 12, 13, 7, 17)
      pixels: integers 0-9 representing colors
  - object: column
    attributes:
      index: integer from 0 to width-1
      pixels: sequence of pixels from top to bottom

transformation:
  type: columnar_fill
  direction: vertical (bottom-to-top propagation)
  input_dependency: non-white pixels determine the fill color
  output_generation:
    process: Iterate through each column independently.
    column_process:
      - Initialize a 'current_fill_color' to white (0).
      - Iterate through the rows of the column from bottom to top (row_index = height-1 down to 0).
      - Get the color of the pixel in the input grid at (row_index, column_index). Let this be 'input_color'.
      - If 'input_color' is not white (0), update 'current_fill_color' to 'input_color'.
      - Set the color of the pixel in the output grid at (row_index, column_index) to the 'current_fill_color'.

relationship:
  - The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - The transformation for each column is independent of other columns.
  - The color of an output pixel depends on the input pixels at or below it in the same column. Specifically, it depends on the color of the nearest non-white input pixel at or below its row index.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0).
2.  Process each column of the input grid independently, from left to right (column index `c` from 0 to width-1).
3.  For the current column `c`:
    a.  Initialize a variable `current_color` to white (0).
    b.  Iterate through the rows of this column from bottom to top (row index `r` from height-1 down to 0).
    c.  Read the color of the input pixel at position (`r`, `c`), let's call it `input_pixel_color`.
    d.  If `input_pixel_color` is not white (i.e., not 0), update `current_color` to be `input_pixel_color`.
    e.  Set the color of the output grid pixel at position (`r`, `c`) to the value stored in `current_color`.
4.  After processing all columns, the resulting output grid is the final result.
