task_description: Apply a color transformation independently to each column of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the default background color.
column_processing:
  - scope: Each column is processed independently.
  - direction: Processing occurs from the bottom row upwards for each column.
  - state: A 'current color' is maintained for each column during processing.
pixel_transformation:
  - rule: For a pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid:
      - Its color is determined by the color of the topmost non-white pixel found at or below it in the same column `c` of the input grid.
      - If there are no non-white pixels at or below `(r, c)` in the input column `c`, the output pixel `(r, c)` remains white (0).
  - initialization: The 'current color' for a column starts as white (0) when beginning the scan from the bottom.
  - update: When scanning a column upwards, if a non-white pixel is encountered in the input grid, the 'current color' for that column is updated to the color of that input pixel.
  - assignment: The output pixel `(r, c)` is assigned the 'current color' value held at the moment row `r` is processed.
