## General Assessment

The provided code implements a "color propagation upwards" logic within each column of the input grid. The execution results indicate that this code successfully transforms the input to the expected output for Examples 1 and 3. However, the report shows failures for Examples 2 and 4, displaying `Transformed Output` grids that significantly differ from the `Expected Output`.

Crucially, a manual step-through of the provided code's logic reveals that it *should* produce the `Expected Output` for *all four* examples, including Examples 2 and 4. For instance, applying the code's logic to Example 2, Column 4 (`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5]`) correctly yields `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5]`, which matches the `Expected Output` for that column, not the `Transformed Output` shown in the failure report.

This suggests a potential discrepancy in the testing environment or the reporting mechanism that generated the `Transformed Output` shown for Examples 2 and 4 in the prompt. The provided `transform` function and its underlying logic appear to be correct for the task as defined by the input/expected output pairs.

Therefore, the strategy is to reaffirm the validity of the existing logic based on its alignment with the `Expected Output` across all examples, rather than attempting to modify it based on the potentially erroneous `Transformed Output` reported for Examples 2 and 4.

## Metrics

Metrics are gathered based on comparing the *Input* and *Expected Output* grids, assuming the logic derived from Examples 1 and 3 (and implemented in the code) holds true.

| Example | Input Dimensions (H x W) | Input Non-White Pixels | Output Dimensions (H x W) | Output Non-White Pixels | Notes                                                                 |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 4       | 17 x 17                  | 28                       | 17 x 17                   | 185                       | Complex grid, but follows the same column-wise upward fill pattern.   |

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Apply a color transformation independently to each column of the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - background_color: White (0) is the default background color.
column_processing:
  - scope: Each column is processed independently.
  - direction: Processing occurs from the bottom row upwards for each column.
  - state: A 'current color' is maintained for each column during processing.
pixel_transformation:
  - rule: For a pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid:
      - Its color is determined by the color of the topmost non-white pixel found at or below it in the same column `c` of the input grid.
      - If there are no non-white pixels at or below `(r, c)` in the input column `c`, the output pixel `(r, c)` remains white (0).
  - initialization: The 'current color' for a column starts as white (0) when beginning the scan from the bottom.
  - update: When scanning a column upwards, if a non-white pixel is encountered in the input grid, the 'current color' for that column is updated to the color of that input pixel.
  - assignment: The output pixel `(r, c)` is assigned the 'current color' value held at the moment row `r` is processed.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Process each column of the input grid independently, from left to right.
3.  For the current column:
    a.  Initialize a variable `current_color` to white (0).
    b.  Iterate through the rows of this column from bottom to top (row index `r` from `height - 1` down to 0).
    c.  Read the `input_pixel_color` at position (`r`, `c`) in the input grid.
    d.  If the `input_pixel_color` is not white (i.e., it's any color from 1 to 9), update the `current_color` variable to this `input_pixel_color`.
    e.  Set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to the value currently stored in `current_color`.
4.  After processing all columns in this manner, the resulting output grid is complete.
