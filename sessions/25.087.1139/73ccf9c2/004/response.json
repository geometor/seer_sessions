The core logic, based on classifying objects as 'signal' (area > 1) or 'noise' (area = 1) and selecting based on counts and position, appears incorrect. The transformed outputs often seemed to be single pixels or very small incorrect crops.\n\nThe new strategy involves:\n1.  Re-analyzing the relationship between input objects and the expected output across all examples.\n2.  Using code execution to systematically gather metrics about all objects (area, bounding box, position) in each input grid.\n3.  Identifying which input object corresponds to the expected output grid after cropping.\n4.  Determining the selection criteria based on the properties of the chosen object compared to the others.\n5.  Formulating a revised natural language program based on this analysis.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using python code execution to analyze the objects in each training example:\n\n"
