            "text": "**Observations from Metrics:**\n\n*   **Multiple Objects:** All inputs contain multiple distinct objects of the same non-white color. Some objects are complex shapes, others are just single pixels.\n*   **Target Object Identification:** The `target_object_in_input` field correctly identifies the input object that matches the expected output object's shape, size, and color for each example.\n*   **Object Selection Criterion:** The previous \"largest area\" criterion is incorrect. Let's examine the properties of the target objects identified:\n    *   **Example 1:** Target object (id=6, color=2, area=7, bbox=[14, 13, 17, 15], height=4, width=3). This is neither the largest (area 20) nor the smallest (area 1). It's the 4th largest object. Its bounding box is 4x3.\n    *   **Example 2:** Target object (id=8, color=1, area=9, bbox=[15, 4, 18, 7], height=4, width=4). This is the 3rd largest object (Areas: 15, 14, 9, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1). Its bounding box is 4x4.\n    *   **Example 3:** Target object (id=12, color=3, area=1, bbox=[13, 9, 13, 9], height=1, width=1). This is one of the smallest objects (area 1). The largest areas are 12, 10, 10, 9, 2. Its bounding box is 1x1.\n*   **No Obvious Pattern:** There's no immediately obvious pattern based on area, bounding box size, height, width, or position (e.g., lowest, rightmost) that consistently selects the target object across all three examples.\n    *   Example 1 target: Area 7, 4x3 bbox.\n    *   Example 2 target: Area 9, 4x4 bbox.\n    *   Example 3 target: Area 1, 1x1 bbox.\n\n**Revisiting the Task Visuals:**\n\nLet's look at the *shapes* again. Perhaps there's something about the configuration or relationship between the objects.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input has 4 main red shapes and 4 isolated red pixels. Output is the bottom-right main shape.\n*   **Example 2:** Input has 4 main blue shapes and 5 isolated blue pixels. Output is the bottom-left main shape (visually, it's the one starting at row 15, col 4). Wait, the metrics say `target_object_in_input` is id=8, bbox=[15, 4, 18, 7]. Yes, bottom-left main shape.\n*   **Example 3:** Input has 4 main green shapes, one 2-pixel green shape, and 8 isolated green pixels. Output is one of the isolated pixels (the one at row 13, col 9).\n\n**New Hypothesis:**\n\nWhat if the selection criteria involves *how many* objects there are?\n\n*   Example 1: 8 red objects total. The target is the 4th largest.\n*   Example 2: 9 blue objects total. The target is the 3rd largest.\n*   Example 3: 13 green objects total. The target is one of the smallest (area=1). If we sort by area descending, then row, then col, it's the last one.\n\nThis doesn't seem consistent.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem description or common ARC patterns. Sometimes, the task involves finding a unique property.\n\n*   Is there only one object with a specific area?\n    *   Ex 1: Areas: 20, 16, 14, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1. Target area 7 is unique.\n    *   Ex 2: Areas: 15, 14, 9, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. Target area 9 is unique.\n    *   Ex 3: Areas: 12, 10, 10, 9, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Target area 1 is *not* unique. Hmm.\n\nOkay, area uniqueness isn't it. What about bounding box dimensions?\n\n*   Ex 1: BBoxes (HxW): 4x9, 5x7, 4x5, **4x3**, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1. Target 4x3. Are dimensions unique? No, several 1x1. Is 4x3 unique among non-1x1? Yes.\n*   Ex 2: BBoxes (HxW): 4x7, 5x5, **4x4**, 2x2, 1x2, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1. Target 4x4. Are dimensions unique? No, several 1x1. Is 4x4 unique among non-1x1? Yes.\n*   Ex 3: BBoxes (HxW): 4x5, 3x6, 4x5, 3x5, 1x2, **1x1**, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1, 1x1. Target 1x1. Are dimensions unique? No. Is 1x1 unique among non-1x1? N/A. This breaks the pattern.\n\nLet's re-examine Example 3. The target is the pixel at (13, 9). Are there any other properties?\nInput objects sorted by area (desc), then row, then col:\n1. Area 12, bbox [2, 11, 5, 15]\n2. Area 10, bbox [10, 14, 12, 19]\n3. Area 10, bbox [13, 5, 16, 9] <-- This one starts at row 13.\n4. Area 9, bbox [3, 2, 5, 6]\n5. Area 2, bbox [13, 16, 13, 17] <-- This one starts at row 13.\n6. Area 1, bbox [6, 12, 6, 12]\n7. Area 1, bbox [6, 14, 6, 14]\n8. Area 1, bbox [9, 15, 9, 15]\n9. Area 1, bbox [9, 18, 9, 18]\n10. Area 1, bbox [12, 4, 12, 4]\n11. Area 1, bbox [12, 10, 12, 10]\n12. Area 1, bbox [13, 5, 13, 5] <-- This one starts at row 13.\n13. Area 1, bbox [13, 9, 13, 9] <-- **TARGET**, starts at row 13.\n\nMany objects start at row 13.\n\nLet's consider the total number of non-white pixels of the primary color.\n*   Ex 1 (Red): 20+16+14+7+1+1+1+1 = 61 pixels. Target area = 7.\n*   Ex 2 (Blue): 15+14+9+4+2+1+1+1+1 = 48 pixels. Target area = 9.\n*   Ex 3 (Green): 12+10+10+9+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 51 pixels. Target area = 1.\n\nNo obvious relationship there.\n\nWhat if we only consider objects with area > 1?\n*   Ex 1: Areas > 1: 20, 16, 14, 7. Target area 7. (Smallest area > 1).\n*   Ex 2: Areas > 1: 15, 14, 9, 4, 2. Target area 9. (Not smallest).\n*   Ex 3: Areas > 1: 12, 10, 10, 9, 2. Target area 1. (Excluded).\n\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet's think about symmetry or other geometric properties. The target objects don't seem particularly symmetrical.\n\nCould it be related to the *number* of objects?\n*   Ex 1: 8 objects. Target is 4th largest.\n*   Ex 2: 9 objects. Target is 3rd largest.\n*   Ex 3: 13 objects. Target is 8th largest (or tied for last).\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\n**Re-evaluation of \"Unique Property\":**\nMaybe the property isn't area or bbox size, but something more complex?\n\nLet's look at the object *shapes* within their bounding boxes.\n\n*   Ex 1 Target:\n    "

            "text": "\n\nWhat if it's the object whose bounding box has the **smallest area** (height * width), excluding single-pixel objects unless *all* objects are single pixels?\n\n*   Ex 1: BBoxes (HxW -> Area): 4x9=36, 5x7=35, 4x5=20, **4x3=12**, 1x1=1, 1x1=1, 1x1=1, 1x1=1. Smallest non-1x1 bbox area is 12. This corresponds to the target object (id=6). **Matches!**\n*   Ex 2: BBoxes (HxW -> Area): 4x7=28, 5x5=25, **4x4=16**, 2x2=4, 1x2=2, 1x1=1, 1x1=1, 1x1=1, 1x1=1. Smallest non-1x1 bbox area is 2 (from the 1x2 object). This doesn't match the target (4x4=16). **Fails.**\n\nOkay, that hypothesis fails.\n\nLet's try the object whose bounding box area (H * W) is the **largest**, excluding single-pixel objects?\n*   Ex 1: BBox Areas (non-1x1): 36, 35, 20, 12. Largest is 36 (Obj id=1). Target is obj id=6 (area 12). **Fails.**\n\nMaybe the object with the **minimum height** (excluding 1x1)?\n*   Ex 1: Heights (non-1x1): 4, 5, 4, 4. Minimum is 4. Tie between id=1, id=5, id=6 (target). How to break tie? Smallest width? (9, 5, 3). Smallest width is 3 (id=6). **Matches!**\n*   Ex 2: Heights (non-1x1): 4, 5, 4, 2, 1. Minimum is 1 (1x2 object, id=9). If we exclude H=1? Minimum is 2 (id=5, 2x2). Target is id=8 (height 4). **Fails.**\n\nMaybe the object with the **minimum width** (excluding 1x1)?\n*   Ex 1: Widths (non-1x1): 9, 7, 5, 3. Minimum is 3 (id=6). **Matches!**\n*   Ex 2: Widths (non-1x1): 7, 5, 4, 2, 2. Minimum is 2. Tie between id=5 (2x2) and id=9 (1x2). Target is id=8 (width 4). **Fails.**\n\nThis is tricky. Let's look at the raw data again. The `target_object_in_input` field was generated by comparing the *shape* of the output object to the shapes of the input objects (extracted within their bboxes). This comparison seems reliable.\n\nExample 1: Target object id=6, area 7, bbox [14, 13, 17, 15], H=4, W=3.\nExample 2: Target object id=8, area 9, bbox [15, 4, 18, 7], H=4, W=4.\nExample 3: Target object id=12, area 1, bbox [13, 9, 13, 9], H=1, W=1.\n\nIs there a relationship between the *input grid dimensions* and the target object?\n*   Ex 1: Input 21x21. Target bbox [14, 13, 17, 15].\n*   Ex 2: Input 23x23. Target bbox [15, 4, 18, 7].\n*   Ex 3: Input 20x20. Target bbox [13, 9, 13, 9].\n\nNo obvious relationship to center, corners, etc.\n\nCould it be related to noise? Many inputs have isolated pixels (area=1).\n*   Ex 1: 4 main objects, 4 noise pixels. Target is one of the main objects.\n*   Ex 2: 4 main objects, 1 two-pixel object, 4 noise pixels. Target is one of the main objects.\n*   Ex 3: 4 main objects, 1 two-pixel object, 8 noise pixels. Target is one of the noise pixels.\n\nWhy is the noise pixel chosen in Ex 3, but not Ex 1 or 2?\nIn Ex 3, the target noise pixel is at (13, 9). The other noise pixels are at: (6, 12), (6, 14), (9, 15), (9, 18), (12, 4), (12, 10), (13, 5).\nThe target (13, 9) is the one with the largest row index among noise pixels? No, (13, 5) has the same row index.\nLargest col index among those with max row index? Target col=9, other col=5. Yes, (13, 9) is the bottom-most, right-most noise pixel.\n\nLet's test this \"bottom-most, right-most noise pixel\" idea on Ex 1 and 2.\n*   Ex 1 Noise Pixels: (13, 2), (13, 6), (16, 12), (16, 16). Bottom-most are (16, 12) and (16, 16). Right-most of these is (16, 16). The target object is id=6, not a noise pixel. **Fails.**\n\nMaybe the rule is:\n1. Find all connected objects of the non-white color.\n2. Count how many objects have area > 1 (`N_main`).\n3. Count how many objects have area = 1 (`N_noise`).\n4. If `N_noise` >= `N_main`: Select the noise pixel that is bottom-most, then right-most.\n5. If `N_noise` < `N_main`: Select a main object based on some other criteria... (what?)\n\nLet's test step 4:\n*   Ex 1: N_main=4, N_noise=4. N_noise >= N_main is TRUE. Rule says select noise pixel at (16, 16). Expected output is object id=6. **Contradiction.**\n*   Ex 2: N_main=4 (area 15, 14, 9, 4), N_noise=5 (area 2, 1, 1, 1, 1). N_noise >= N_main is TRUE. Rule says select noise pixel. Bottom-most noise pixels: (14, 14), (14, 17). Right-most is (14, 17). Expected output is object id=8. **Contradiction.**\n*   Ex 3: N_main=4 (area 12, 10, 10, 9), N_noise=9 (area 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). N_noise >= N_main is TRUE. Rule says select noise pixel. Bottom-most noise pixels: (13, 5), (13, 9). Right-most is (13, 9). Expected output is noise pixel (13, 9). **Matches!**\n\nThis rule only works for Example 3.\n\n**Let's simplify.** What is the most basic description?\nIdentify all distinct objects. Select one specific object. Output that object in its minimal bounding box.\nThe core problem is the selection criteria.\n\nConsider the *input shapes* again. They look somewhat like letters or symbols.\n*   Ex 1: Red shapes vaguely resemble 'H', 'E', 'L', 'P'? No, stretching it.\n*   Ex 2: Blue shapes... 'L', 'O', 'V', 'E'? Maybe? Target is 'V'-like shape (id=8).\n*   Ex 3: Green shapes... Target is a dot.\n\nIf we take the objects with area > 1:\n*   Ex 1: id=1 (area 20), id=2 (area 16), id=5 (area 14), id=6 (area 7, target).\n*   Ex 2: id=2 (area 15), id=1 (area 14), id=8 (area 9, target), id=5 (area 4).\n*   Ex 3: id=1 (area 12), id=7 (area 10), id=3 (area 10), id=2 (area 9). Target is area 1.\n\nWhat if we look at the object with the **median area**?\n*   Ex 1: Areas [20, 16, 14, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Sorted: [1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 14, 16, 20]. Median is avg(1, 7) = 4. Not helpful. Or maybe the object *at* the median position? Pos 4 or 5 -> Area 1 or 7. Target is 7.\n*   Ex 2: Areas [15, 14, 9, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Sorted: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 14, 15]. Median is 2. Target is 9.\n*   Ex 3: Areas [12, 10, 10, 9, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Sorted: [1.. (8 times), 2, 9, 10, 10, 12]. Median is 1. Target is 1.\n\nThis is getting closer!\nHypothesis: Select the object whose area is the median area of all objects of that color. If there's an even number of objects, choose the object corresponding to the higher of the two middle areas. If multiple objects have the median area, apply a tie-breaker.\n\n*   Ex 1: Sorted Areas [1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 14, 16, 20]. N=8 (even). Middle areas are 1 and 7. Choose higher: 7. Only one object has area 7 (id=6). **Matches target!**\n*   Ex 2: Sorted Areas [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 14, 15]. N=9 (odd). Median area is 2. Object id=9 has area 2. Target object is id=8 (area 9). **Fails.**\n\nDarn. Backtrack. Let's look at the successful code output analysis again.\n\nEx 1 Target: id=6, area=7, bbox=[14, 13, 17, 15], H=4, W=3.\nEx 2 Target: id=8, area=9, bbox=[15, 4, 18, 7], H=4, W=4.\nEx 3 Target: id=12, area=1, bbox=[13, 9, 13, 9], H=1, W=1.\n\nCould it be related to the number of pixels *not* belonging to the object within its bounding box (i.e., holes or background)?\nLet BBox Area = H * W. Let Object Area = A. Density = A / (H*W). Or maybe just count non-object pixels = (H*W) - A.\n\n*   Ex 1 Objects (id, obj_area, bbox_h, bbox_w, bbox_area, non_obj_pixels):\n    *   1: A=20, H=4, W=9, BA=36, NonObj=16\n    *   2: A=16, H=5, W=7, BA=35, NonObj=19\n    *   5: A=14, H=4, W=5, BA=20, NonObj=6\n    *   6: A=7, H=4, W=3, BA=12, NonObj=5 <-- Target\n    *   Noise pixels: A=1, H=1, W=1, BA=1, NonObj=0\n*   Ex 2 Objects:\n    *   2: A=15, H=4, W=7, BA=28, NonObj=13\n    *   1: A=14, H=5, W=5, BA=25, NonObj=11\n    *   8: A=9, H=4, W=4, BA=16, NonObj=7 <-- Target\n    *   5: A=4, H=2, W=2, BA=4, NonObj=0\n    *   9: A=2, H=1, W=2, BA=2, NonObj=0\n    *   Noise pixels: A=1, H=1, W=1, BA=1, NonObj=0\n*   Ex 3 Objects:\n    *   1: A=12, H=4, W=5, BA=20, NonObj=8\n    *   7: A=10, H=3, W=6, BA=18, NonObj=8\n    *   3: A=10, H=4, W=5, BA=20, NonObj=10\n    *   2: A=9, H=3, W=5, BA=15, NonObj=6\n    *   13: A=2, H=1, W=2, BA=2, NonObj=0\n    *   Noise pixels: A=1, H=1, W=1, BA=1, NonObj=0 <-- Target is one of these\n\nHypothesis: Select the object with the **minimum number of non-object pixels** within its bounding box, with a tie-breaker rule.\n\n*   Ex 1: NonObj values: [16, 19, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Minimum is 0 (noise pixels). Target has NonObj=5. **Fails.**\n\nHypothesis: Select the object with the **maximum number of non-object pixels** within its bounding box?\n*   Ex 1: NonObj values: [16, 19, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Maximum is 19 (id=2). Target has NonObj=5. **Fails.**\n\nWhat if we only consider objects with Area > 1?\n*   Ex 1: NonObj (Area>1): [16, 19, 6, 5]. Min=5 (id=6). Max=19 (id=2). Target has Min NonObj. **Match (Min)**\n*   Ex 2: NonObj (Area>1): [13, 11, 7, 0, 0]. Min=0 (id=5, id=9). Max=13 (id=2). Target has NonObj=7. **Neither Min nor Max.**\n*   Ex 3: NonObj (Area>1): [8, 8, 10, 6, 0]. Min=0 (id=13). Max=10 (id=3). Target has NonObj=0. **Match (Min - but target has Area=1)**\n\nThis seems inconsistent too.\n\nLet's reconsider the shapes and positions.\nIs the target object always the one that is \"most complex\" or \"most simple\"?\nMaybe related to perimeter? Or ratio of area to perimeter?\n\nLet's go back to the visual inspection.\nInput 1: Four main red shapes + noise. Output is bottom-right shape.\nInput 2: Four main blue shapes + noise + 2px obj. Output is bottom-left main shape.\nInput 3: Four main green shapes + noise + 2px obj. Output is a noise pixel.\n\nIt feels like there are \"signal\" objects and \"noise\" objects.\nSignal = area > 1?\n*   Ex 1: 4 signal, 4 noise. Target is signal.\n*   Ex 2: 5 signal, 4 noise. Target is signal.\n*   Ex 3: 5 signal, 8 noise. Target is noise.\n\nThe transition seems to happen when noise > signal?\n*   Ex 1: N_signal=4, N_noise=4. Signal=Noise. Rule: ??? -> Select Signal obj id=6.\n*   Ex 2: N_signal=5, N_noise=4. Signal>Noise. Rule: ??? -> Select Signal obj id=8.\n*   Ex 3: N_signal=5, N_noise=8. Noise>Signal. Rule: ??? -> Select Noise obj id=12.\n\nHypothesis:\n1. Identify signal (area>1) and noise (area=1) objects.\n2. If N_noise > N_signal: Select the noise object that is bottom-most, then right-most.\n3. If N_noise <= N_signal: Select a signal object based on some criteria. What criteria?\n    *   Ex 1 (N_signal=4, N_noise=4): Signal objects: id=1(A=20), id=2(A=16), id=5(A=14), id=6(A=7). Target is id=6 (smallest area).\n    *   Ex 2 (N_signal=5, N_noise=4): Signal objects: id=2(A=15), id=1(A=14), id=8(A=9), id=5(A=4), id=9(A=2). Target is id=8 (middle area?). Or 3rd largest area.\n\nLet's refine the hypothesis:\n1. Identify signal (area>1) and noise (area=1) objects of the dominant non-white color.\n2. If N_noise > N_signal: Select the noise object that is bottom-most, then right-most (using max row of bbox, then max col of bbox as tie-breaker).\n3. If N_noise <= N_signal: Select the signal object with the **smallest area**. If there's a tie for smallest area, use bottom-most, then right-most as a tie-breaker among those tied.\n\nLet's test this:\n*   Ex 1: N_signal=4, N_noise=4. N_noise <= N_signal is TRUE. Select signal object with smallest area. Signal areas: [20, 16, 14, 7]. Smallest is 7 (id=6). **Matches target!**\n*   Ex 2: N_signal=5, N_noise=4. N_noise <= N_signal is TRUE. Select signal object with smallest area. Signal areas: [15, 14, 9, 4, 2]. Smallest is 2 (id=9). Target is id=8 (area 9). **Fails.**\n\nOkay, the criteria for N_noise <= N_signal must be different. What if it's the signal object with the *largest* area?\n*   Ex 1: Signal areas: [20, 16, 14, 7]. Largest is 20 (id=1). Target is id=6. **Fails.**\n\nWhat if it's the signal object whose bounding box has the smallest area?\n*   Ex 1: Signal BBox Areas (H*W): [36, 35, 20, 12]. Smallest is 12 (id=6). **Matches target!**\n*   Ex 2: Signal BBox Areas (H*W): [28, 25, 16, 4, 2]. Smallest is 2 (id=9). Target is id=8 (BBox Area 16). **Fails.**\n\nWhat if it's the signal object whose bounding box has the largest area?\n*   Ex 1: Signal BBox Areas (H*W): [36, 35, 20, 12]. Largest is 36 (id=1). Target is id=6. **Fails.**\n\nLet's reconsider the unique property idea, but apply it differently.\nMaybe the target object is the *only* object with a certain property?\n\nProperties to check: Area, Height, Width, BBox Area, Number of non-object pixels in BBox.\n\n*   Ex 1:\n    *   Areas: [20, 16, 14, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1].
