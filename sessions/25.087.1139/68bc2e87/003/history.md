```python
"""
Identify nested colored frames within an azure (8) background in the input grid.
List the frame colors in the output, ordered from the outermost frame to the innermost frame.
The output is presented as a column vector (Nx1 grid).

Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty list `frame_colors` to store the result.
2. Define the background color `background_color = 8`.
3. Keep track of colors already identified as frames or background in `found_colors`, initialized with `{background_color}`.
4. Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the background pixels located at the border of the grid.
5. Maintain a queue `q` for the BFS and a `visited` array to track visited cells.
6. Iteratively identify frame layers:
   a. In each iteration, perform BFS starting from the cells of the current boundary color (initially the background).
   b. While exploring neighbors during BFS:
      i. If a neighbor has the same color as the current boundary, continue the BFS from it.
      ii. If a neighbor has a color C that has not been found yet (C not in `found_colors`), add C to a set `next_boundary_candidates`. Store the coordinates of these neighbors to potentially start the next BFS wave.
   c. After exploring all reachable cells of the current boundary color, check `next_boundary_candidates`.
   d. If the set is empty, it means no new frames were found adjacent to the current layer; stop the process.
   e. If the set contains exactly one color, this is the color of the next frame. Add it to `frame_colors`, add it to `found_colors`, and set it as the `current_boundary_color` for the next iteration.
   f. Prepare the queue `q` for the next iteration by adding the coordinates (stored in step 6.b.ii) corresponding to the newly found frame color. Mark these starting cells as visited.
   g. If `next_boundary_candidates` contains more than one color, the frame structure is ambiguous based on the current logic; raise an error.
7. Once the loop terminates, convert the `frame_colors` list into an Nx1 numpy array (column vector).

## General Assessment

The previous code assumed a pattern of nested frames, where each layer (starting from the azure background) was adjacent to exactly one new color, forming the next inner frame. The errors clearly show this assumption is incorrect. In all examples, multiple distinct colors are found adjacent to the initial azure background region.

However, the expected output for all training examples is consistently `[[2]]`, representing the color red. This suggests the task is not about identifying all adjacent colors or nested structures, but rather about detecting a specific condition related to the color red (2) and its relationship with the azure (8) background.

The strategy is to abandon the nested frame hypothesis and focus on identifying the specific rule involving red and azure. We need to determine if the presence and specific location (adjacency to the background) of red pixels trigger the output `[[2]]`.

## Metrics and Analysis

We will analyze the adjacency relationship between the main azure (8) background region and red (2) pixels in each training example. The "main background region" is defined as the contiguous area of azure pixels connected to the grid's border.

**Correction:** The initial analysis code was flawed. It checked adjacency between *any* red pixel and the background region, but the key might be whether the red pixels *themselves* form a frame *directly* adjacent to the background. Let's re-evaluate.

Looking closely at the grids:
*   **Example 1:** Background (8) -> Yellow (4) -> Green (3) -> Red (2). Red is *not* directly adjacent to the azure background.
*   **Example 2:** Background (8) -> Orange (7) -> Green (3) -> Red (2). Red is *not* directly adjacent to the azure background.
*   **Example 3:** Background (8) -> Green (3) -> Magenta (6) -> Red (2). Red is *not* directly adjacent to the azure background.
*   **Example 4:** Background (8) -> Blue (1) -> Magenta (6) -> Yellow (4) -> Red (2). Red is *not* directly adjacent to the azure background.

My previous analysis and the code execution results based on direct adjacency are incorrect. The output is always `[[2]]` even when red is *not* directly adjacent to the azure background.

Let's reconsider the "nested frames" idea, but with a different goal. Perhaps the task is to find the color of the *innermost* frame?

*   **Example 1:** Innermost color is Magenta (6). Output is Red (2). No.
*   **Example 2:** Innermost color is Red (2). Output is Red (2). Yes.
*   **Example 3:** Innermost color is Red (2). Output is Red (2). Yes.
*   **Example 4:** Innermost color is Red (2). Output is Red (2). Yes.

This matches examples 2, 3, and 4. What's different about Example 1?
Input 1:

```
8888888888
8444444448
8433333348
8432222348  <-- Red frame
8432662348  <-- Magenta frame inside Red
8432662348
8432222348
8433333348
8444444448
8888888888
```

Output: `[[2]]`

It seems the rule might be: "Identify the color of the innermost frame. If that color is red (2) OR magenta (6), output red (2). Otherwise, output the color of the innermost frame." This is getting complicated and doesn't feel right.

Let's simplify. The output is *always* `[[2]]`. This suggests the task might be identifying *if* a specific structure exists, and if it does, the answer is always red (2). The structure seems to be these nested frames surrounded by an azure (8) background.

Could it be as simple as: "If the input grid contains nested frames surrounded by an azure (8) background, output `[[2]]`"? How do we define "nested frames"? A region completely enclosed by another region of a different color, which itself is enclosed, ultimately ending with the azure background.

Let's re-run the original BFS idea, but instead of stopping when multiple candidates are found, let's collect *all* colors adjacent to the current layer and see what happens.

**Refined BFS Logic Idea:**
1. Start BFS from the azure (8) border background. Mark visited.
2. Find all unique colors directly adjacent to this background region. Let this be `Set1`.
3. For *each* color C in `Set1`, start a new BFS from all cells of color C that were adjacent to the background.
4. Find all unique colors directly adjacent to the region(s) of color C (excluding the background color 8 and color C itself). Let this be `Set2`.
5. Continue this process layer by layer.
6. The sequence of colors identified might be important.

*   **Example 1:** Layer 0: Azure (8). Adjacent: {Yellow (4)}. Layer 1: Yellow (4). Adjacent: {Green (3)}. Layer 2: Green (3). Adjacent: {Red (2)}. Layer 3: Red (2). Adjacent: {Magenta (6)}. Layer 4: Magenta (6). Adjacent: {}. Sequence: [4, 3, 2, 6]. Output: [[2]].
*   **Example 2:** Layer 0: Azure (8). Adjacent: {Orange (7)}. Layer 1: Orange (7). Adjacent: {Green (3)}. Layer 2: Green (3). Adjacent: {Red (2)}. Layer 3: Red (2). Adjacent: {}. Sequence: [7, 3, 2]. Output: [[2]].
*   **Example 3:** Layer 0: Azure (8). Adjacent: {Green (3)}. Layer 1: Green (3). Adjacent: {Magenta (6)}. Layer 2: Magenta (6). Adjacent: {Red (2)}. Layer 3: Red (2). Adjacent: {}. Sequence: [3, 6, 2]. Output: [[2]].
*   **Example 4:** Layer 0: Azure (8). Adjacent: {Blue (1)}. Layer 1: Blue (1). Adjacent: {Magenta (6)}. Layer 2: Magenta (6). Adjacent: {Yellow (4)}. Layer 3: Yellow (4). Adjacent: {Red (2)}. Layer 4: Red (2). Adjacent: {}. Sequence: [1, 6, 4, 2]. Output: [[2]].

**Pattern:** The process generates a sequence of frame colors, ordered from outermost to innermost. The output is always `[[2]]` (red). Red appears in the sequence for every example. Could the rule be: "Find the sequence of nested frame colors starting from the azure background. If red (2) is present *anywhere* in this sequence, output `[[2]]`"?

Let's verify this hypothesis using code to extract the sequence.

The code successfully extracted the sequence of nested frame colors for each example:
*   Example 1: [Yellow (4), Green (3), Red (2), Magenta (6)]
*   Example 2: [Orange (7), Green (3), Red (2)]
*   Example 3: [Green (3), Magenta (6), Red (2)]
*   Example 4: [Blue (1), Magenta (6), Yellow (4), Red (2)]

In all cases, the sequence contains Red (2). The output is always `[[2]]`.

This strongly supports the hypothesis: **If the sequence of nested frame colors (starting from the azure background) contains red (2), the output is `[[2]]`.** We haven't seen a case where red is *not* in the sequence, so we assume based on the examples that if the nested frame structure exists, red will be one of the frames, and the output should be `[[2]]`. If the nested frame structure (starting with azure background) doesn't exist or is ill-formed, the behavior is undefined by these examples, but likely results in an empty or error state (though the previous code's errors were due to a faulty assumption, not necessarily an invalid input structure according to this new hypothesis).

## Facts YAML


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
    - Size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
    - Contains: Pixels of various colors.
  Objects:
    - Background Region:
        - Color: Azure (8).
        - Location: Typically forms the outermost border and connected area.
        - Role: Defines the starting point for analysis.
    - Frame Regions:
        - Color: Any color other than the background (e.g., Yellow(4), Green(3), Red(2), Magenta(6), Orange(7), Blue(1)).
        - Property: Form contiguous regions.
        - Relationship: Nested structure, where one frame color completely encloses the next inner frame color. Frames are adjacent to each other.
        - Sequence: An ordered list of frame colors exists, from the one adjacent to the background inwards.
    - Target Color:
        - Color: Red (2).
        - Role: Its presence within the sequence of frame colors determines the output.

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 1x1 grid (2D array).
    - Size: Always 1x1 based on examples.
  Content:
    - Contains the color Red (2) if the transformation condition is met.

Transformation Rule:
  Action: Identify nested frames and check for a specific color.
  Steps:
    1. Identify the main background region (azure=8 connected to the border).
    2. Perform a layer-by-layer search inwards from the background region.
    3. Determine the sequence of unique frame colors encountered (e.g., [color_adjacent_to_background, next_inner_color, ...]).
    4. Check if the color Red (2) exists anywhere in this sequence.
  Condition: If Red (2) is found in the sequence of nested frame colors.
  Result: Output a 1x1 grid containing Red (2).
  Alternative (Implicit): If no valid nested frame structure starting with azure is found, or if red is not in the sequence (though this case wasn't observed), the output is implicitly undefined by the examples but likely not `[[2]]`.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list called `frame_sequence`.
2.  Identify the main background region: Find all azure (8) pixels connected to the grid's border using a search algorithm (like BFS or Flood Fill). Keep track of visited pixels globally. Mark the starting azure pixels as visited.
3.  Set the `current_layer_color` to azure (8) and the `current_boundary_pixels` to the set of background pixels found in step 2.
4.  Start a loop to find nested frames:
    a.  Initialize an empty set `next_layer_candidates` to store potential colors for the next inner frame, and an empty dictionary `next_boundary_pixel_candidates` mapping {color: list_of_coordinates}.
    b.  Perform a search (e.g., BFS) starting from a copy of `current_boundary_pixels`. During this search:
        i.  Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right) of pixels belonging to the `current_layer_color`.
        ii. If a neighbor has the `current_layer_color` and has not been globally visited, mark it as visited and add it to the exploration queue and the set of `current_boundary_pixels`.
        iii. If a neighbor has a color `C` that is *not* azure (8) and has *not* been previously added to `frame_sequence`, add `C` to `next_layer_candidates`. If the neighbor pixel has not been globally visited, add its coordinates to the list associated with color `C` in `next_boundary_pixel_candidates`.
    c.  After the search for the current layer completes, examine `next_layer_candidates`.
    d.  If `next_layer_candidates` is empty, stop the loop (no more inner frames found).
    e.  If `next_layer_candidates` contains exactly one color, `next_color`:
        i.  Add `next_color` to the `frame_sequence`.
        ii. Mark all coordinates associated with `next_color` in `next_boundary_pixel_candidates` as globally visited.
        iii. Set `current_layer_color` to `next_color`.
        iv. Set `current_boundary_pixels` to the list of coordinates associated with `next_color`.
        v.  Continue the loop (go to step 4a).
    f.  If `next_layer_candidates` contains more than one color, this indicates an unexpected structure based on observed examples; handle as an error or undefined case (stop the loop).
5.  After the loop terminates, check if the color red (2) is present in the `frame_sequence`.
6.  If red (2) is in `frame_sequence`, the output is a 1x1 grid containing `[[2]]`.
7.  Otherwise (e.g., no frames found, red not in sequence), the output is undefined based on examples (likely empty or reflects an error state, but for this specific task, the examples always result in `[[2]]`).
