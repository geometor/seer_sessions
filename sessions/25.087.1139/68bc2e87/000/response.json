One shape encloses another, which encloses another, and so on.\n4.  **Colors:** Each frame has a single, uniform color. Colors observed forming frames include green (3), magenta (6), yellow (4), red (2), gray (5), orange (7), maroon (9), and blue (1).\n5.  **Non-Frame Content:** Sometimes, within the innermost frame, there are pixels of other colors that do not form enclosing frames themselves (e.g., yellow and red pixels inside the gray frame in train_1).\n6.  **Output:** The output is always a vertical list (or 1D array) of colors (represented by numbers).\n7.  **Relationship:** The colors in the output list correspond directly to the colors of the nested frames identified in the input grid.\n8.  **Ordering:** The order of colors in the output list consistently matches the nesting order of the frames in the input, starting from the outermost frame and proceeding to the innermost frame.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

There should be only one such outermost frame color at each step.\n    c.  Add this identified frame color to the ordered list.\n    d.
