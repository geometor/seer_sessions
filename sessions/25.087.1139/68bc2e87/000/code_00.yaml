task_description: Identify nested colored frames within a background color and list the frame colors from outermost to innermost.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: background
    color_code: 8
    color_name: azure
    description: The dominant color filling most of the grid area, surrounding other shapes.
  - element: frame
    description: A contiguous object of a single color that forms a closed or nearly closed boundary, enclosing an inner area.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the frame pixels (not azure).
      - nesting_level: Its position in the sequence of nested frames (outermost = 1, next inner = 2, etc.).
      - encloses: Other frames or non-frame pixels.
  - element: non_frame_content
    description: Pixels or shapes located inside the innermost frame that do not themselves form enclosing frames. These are ignored in the output.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: containment / nesting
    subject: frame
    object: frame / non_frame_content
    description: One frame encloses another frame or non-frame content if the enclosed object lies within the boundary defined by the enclosing frame.
  - type: sequential
    relation: ordering
    subject: frame colors
    object: output list
    description: The colors of the identified frames are listed in the output based on their nesting order, from the outermost frame to the innermost frame.

transformation:
  input: grid
  output: list_of_colors
  process:
    - Identify the background color (azure - 8).
    - Find all unique non-background colors present.
    - For each unique non-background color, determine if it forms a frame structure.
    - Identify the nesting relationship between the frames based on spatial containment.
    - Sort the frame colors according to this nesting order (outermost first).
    - Output the sorted list of frame colors.
