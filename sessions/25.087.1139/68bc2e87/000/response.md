Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Background:** All input grids feature a dominant background color, azure (8).
2.  **Objects/Shapes:** Within the background, there are distinct shapes formed by contiguous pixels of other colors.
3.  **Structure:** These shapes often form nested rectangular or near-rectangular "frames" or "containers". One shape encloses another, which encloses another, and so on.
4.  **Colors:** Each frame has a single, uniform color. Colors observed forming frames include green (3), magenta (6), yellow (4), red (2), gray (5), orange (7), maroon (9), and blue (1).
5.  **Non-Frame Content:** Sometimes, within the innermost frame, there are pixels of other colors that do not form enclosing frames themselves (e.g., yellow and red pixels inside the gray frame in train_1).
6.  **Output:** The output is always a vertical list (or 1D array) of colors (represented by numbers).
7.  **Relationship:** The colors in the output list correspond directly to the colors of the nested frames identified in the input grid.
8.  **Ordering:** The order of colors in the output list consistently matches the nesting order of the frames in the input, starting from the outermost frame and proceeding to the innermost frame.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify nested colored frames within a background color and list the frame colors from outermost to innermost.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9).
  - element: background
    color_code: 8
    color_name: azure
    description: The dominant color filling most of the grid area, surrounding other shapes.
  - element: frame
    description: A contiguous object of a single color that forms a closed or nearly closed boundary, enclosing an inner area.
    properties:
      - color: The uniform color of the frame pixels (not azure).
      - nesting_level: Its position in the sequence of nested frames (outermost = 1, next inner = 2, etc.).
      - encloses: Other frames or non-frame pixels.
  - element: non_frame_content
    description: Pixels or shapes located inside the innermost frame that do not themselves form enclosing frames. These are ignored in the output.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: containment / nesting
    subject: frame
    object: frame / non_frame_content
    description: One frame encloses another frame or non-frame content if the enclosed object lies within the boundary defined by the enclosing frame.
  - type: sequential
    relation: ordering
    subject: frame colors
    object: output list
    description: The colors of the identified frames are listed in the output based on their nesting order, from the outermost frame to the innermost frame.

transformation:
  input: grid
  output: list_of_colors
  process:
    - Identify the background color (azure - 8).
    - Find all unique non-background colors present.
    - For each unique non-background color, determine if it forms a frame structure.
    - Identify the nesting relationship between the frames based on spatial containment.
    - Sort the frame colors according to this nesting order (outermost first).
    - Output the sorted list of frame colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the frame colors in order.
2.  Define the background color as azure (8).
3.  Identify the set of all unique pixel colors present in the input grid, excluding the background color.
4.  Start with the full set of non-background colors as potential candidates for the outermost frame.
5.  Iteratively identify the current outermost frame:
    a.  For each candidate color `C`, check if it forms a frame that directly borders the current "outside" region (initially, the background). A color `C` forms such a frame if its pixels are contiguous and enclose a region containing other non-background colors that are *not* currently reachable from the outside without crossing `C`.
    b.  There should be only one such outermost frame color at each step.
    c.  Add this identified frame color to the ordered list.
    d.  Update the set of candidate colors by removing the identified frame color.
    e.  Update the definition of the "outside" region to be the area outside the *next* frame to be found (i.e., the area currently enclosed by the frame just identified).
6.  Repeat step 5 until no more enclosing frames can be found among the remaining candidate colors.
7.  Return the ordered list of frame colors.
