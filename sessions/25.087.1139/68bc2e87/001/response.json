Initialize an empty list `frame_colors` to store the result.\n2. Define the background color `background_color = 8`.\n3. Keep track of colors already identified as frames or background in `found_colors`, initialized with `{background_color}`.\n4. Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the background pixels located at the border of the grid.\n5. Maintain a queue `q` for the BFS and a `visited` array to track visited cells.\n6. Iteratively identify frame layers:\n   a. In each iteration, perform BFS starting from the cells of the current boundary color (initially the background).\n   b. While exploring neighbors during BFS:\n      i. If a neighbor has the same color as the current boundary, continue the BFS from it.\n      ii. If a neighbor has a color C that has not been found yet (C not in `found_colors`), add C to a set `next_boundary_candidates`. Store the coordinates of these neighbors to potentially start the next BFS wave.\n   c. After exploring all reachable cells of the current boundary color, check `next_boundary_candidates`.\n   d. If the set is empty, it means no new frames were found adjacent to the current layer; stop the process.\n   e. If the set contains exactly one color, this is the color of the next frame. Add it to `frame_colors`, add it to `found_colors`, and set it as the `current_boundary_color` for the next iteration.\n   f. Prepare the queue `q` for the next iteration by adding the coordinates (stored in step 6.b.ii) corresponding to the newly found frame color. Mark these starting cells as visited.\n   g. If `next_boundary_candidates` contains more than one color, the frame structure is ambiguous based on the current logic; raise an error.\n7. Once the loop terminates, convert the `frame_colors` list into an Nx1 numpy array (column vector).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport collections\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies nested frame colors in a grid and returns them as a column vector.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a 2D list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: An Nx1 grid (column vector) containing the ordered frame colors.\n                       Returns empty list `[]` if input is empty or has no frames.\n                       Returns `[[color]]` if only one frame.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return [] # Handle empty input\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Initialize data structures\n    q = collections.deque()\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    frame_colors = []\n    background_color = 8\n    found_colors = {background_color} # Keep track of colors already identified\n\n    # Initialize queue with all border background cells\n    # These cells form the starting points for finding the first frame\n    initial_boundary_color = background_color\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in [0, cols - 1]: # Check first and last columns\n            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols: # Ensure indices are valid (for 1xN or Nx1 grids)\n                if grid[r, c] == initial_boundary_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                    q.append((r, c))\n                    visited[r, c] = True\n    for c in range(cols): # Check first and last rows (avoid double-adding corners)\n         for r in [0, rows - 1]:\n             if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n                if grid[r, c] == initial_boundary_color and not visited[r, c]:\n                    q.append((r, c))\n                    visited[r, c] = True\n    \n    # Iteratively find frames layer by layer using BFS\n    current_boundary_color = initial_boundary_color\n    while True:\n        next_boundary_candidates = set()\n        # Keep track of coordinates adjacent to the current layer that belong to potential next frames\n        coords_for_next_layer_start = [] \n\n        # Use a temporary queue for the current layer's BFS exploration\n        # so 'q' can be repopulated for the *next* layer's start points\n        current_layer_q = q.copy()\n        q.clear() # Clear q to be ready for the next layer's starting points\n\n        # Perform BFS for the current boundary color\n        while current_layer_q:\n            r, c = current_layer_q.popleft()\n\n            # Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                # Check if neighbor is within grid bounds\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    neighbor_color = grid[nr, nc]\n                    \n                    if not visited[nr, nc]:\n                        if neighbor_color == current_boundary_color:\n                            # Continue BFS within the same color region\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            current_layer_q.append((nr, nc))\n                        elif neighbor_color not in found_colors:\n                            # Found a potential next frame color adjacent to the current layer\n                            next_boundary_candidates.add(neighbor_color)\n                            # Store its location - we'll use these to start the *next* BFS\n                            coords_for_next_layer_start.append((nr, nc)) \n                        # else: neighbor has a color that's already been found (part of a previous frame or background) - ignore\n        \n        # Check results of the layer's BFS\n        if not next_boundary_candidates:\n            # No new adjacent colors found, means we've found all frames\n            break \n\n        # Based on examples, assume exactly one new frame color is found per layer\n        if len(next_boundary_candidates) > 1:\n            # This case is ambiguous or not handled by the current logic based on observed patterns\n            # You might need a more sophisticated way to choose if multiple candidates appear\n            print(f\"Warning: Found multiple candidates {next_boundary_candidates} adjacent to color {current_boundary_color}.
