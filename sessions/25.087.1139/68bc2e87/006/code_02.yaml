# Example 1:
Input:
  Objects:
    - Type: Background Layer
      Color: Azure (8)
      Property: Connected to border, Surrounds other layers
    - Type: Layer 1
      Color: Yellow (4)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Background (8)
    - Type: Layer 2
      Color: Green (3)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Layer 1 (4)
    - Type: Layer 3
      Color: Red (2)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Layer 2 (3), Innermost
Output:
  Objects:
    - Type: Grid
      Content: Red (2) pixel
      Size: 1x1
Action: Identify nested layers inward from Azure border. Check if Red (2) is a layer color.

# Example 2:

      Color: Azure (8)
      Property: Connected to border, Surrounds other layers
    - Type: Layer 1
      Color: Green (3)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Background (8)
    - Type: Layer 2
      Color: Yellow (4)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Layer 1 (3)
    - Type: Layer 3
      Color: Green (3)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Layer 2 (4), Innermost
Output:
  Objects:
    - Type: Grid
      Content: Empty
      Size: 0x0 (represented as [])
Action: Identify nested layers inward from Azure border. Check if Red (2) is a layer color.

# Example 3:
Input:
  Objects:
    - Type: Background Layer
      Color: Azure (8)
      Property: Connected to border, Surrounds other layers
    - Type: Layer 1
      Color: Yellow (4)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Background (8)
    - Type: Layer 2
      Color: Green (3)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Layer 1 (4)
    - Type: Inner Region (multi-color)
      Colors: [Yellow (4), Red (2)]
      Property: Adjacent to Layer 2 (3)
Output:
  Objects:
    - Type: Grid
      Content: Empty
      Size: 0x0 (represented as [])
Action: Identify nested layers inward from Azure border. Stop when adjacent region has multiple colors. Check if Red (2) was a layer color *before stopping*.

# Example 4:
Input:
  Objects:
    - Type: Background Layer
      Color: Azure (8)
      Property: Connected to border, Surrounds other layers
    - Type: Layer 1
      Color: Green (3)
      Property: Contiguous, Adjacent to Background (8), Innermost
Output:
  Objects:
    - Type: Grid
      Content: Empty
      Size: 0x0 (represented as [])
Action: Identify nested layers inward from Azure border. Check if Red (2) is a layer color.

# General Observations:
Input Structure:
  - Always an Azure (8) background connected to the grid border.
  - Inside the background, there are one or more nested, contiguous regions (layers) of single colors.
  - Layers are identified iteratively, moving inwards from the background.
Transformation:
  - Find the Azure (8) region connected to the border.
  - Iteratively find the unique color of the region(s) immediately adjacent to the currently known region(s).
  - If exactly one adjacent color is found, identify the full contiguous region of that color. Add this color to a sequence. Repeat using this new region as the current region.
  - If zero adjacent unvisited regions are found, stop.
  - If more than one color is found in the adjacent regions, stop.
Output Determination:
  - After stopping, check if the color Red (2) exists in the sequence of layer colors identified.
  - If Red (2) is in the sequence, output a 1x1 grid containing Red ([[2]]).
  - Otherwise (Red (2) not in sequence, or no Azure background found), output an empty grid ([]).
