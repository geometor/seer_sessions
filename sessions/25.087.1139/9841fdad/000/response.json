This column acts as a dividing line and also forms the border around the entire grid and potentially frames internal areas. The grid is effectively split into a left and a right section relative to this dividing line.\n    The left section contains a background color (blue=1) and various objects composed of other colors (green=3, azure=8).\n    The right section initially contains only a different background color (yellow=4 in example 1, red=2 in example 2) within the border.\n    The transformation involves mirroring the objects (non-blue pixels) from the left section horizontally across the dividing line onto the right section. These mirrored objects overwrite the background color pixels of the right section. The blue background pixels from the left are not mirrored. The dividing line and the outer border remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Identify the column index (`divider_index`) of the single vertical line that divides the grid.\n    3.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid located to the left of the `divider_index` (i.e., column index < `divider_index`). Let the current pixel's coordinates be (`row`, `col`) and its color be `pixel_color`.\n    4.  Check if `pixel_color` is not blue (1).\n    5.  If `pixel_color` is not blue (1), calculate the mirrored column index (`mirrored_col`) in the right section using the formula: `mirrored_col = divider_index + (divider_index - col)`.\n    6.  Update the pixel at coordinates (`row`, `mirrored_col`) in the output grid with `pixel_color`.\n    7.
