"""
Transforms the input grid by mirroring non-background objects from a left panel 
to a right panel across a vertical divider column. The transformation preserves 
the original right panel's background color in areas not overwritten by mirrored objects.

1. Identify the outer border color (assumed uniform and 1-pixel thick).
2. Locate the vertical divider column, which typically matches the border color 
   and separates two inner regions (left and right panels) with distinct 
   background colors different from the border color.
3. Determine the background color of the left panel (most common color within 
   that panel, excluding border/divider).
4. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5. Iterate through the pixels of the left panel (inside border, left of divider).
6. If a pixel's color differs from the left panel background color, calculate 
   its mirrored position in the right panel relative to the divider.
7. Update the output grid at the mirrored position with the pixel's color.
8. Return the modified grid.
