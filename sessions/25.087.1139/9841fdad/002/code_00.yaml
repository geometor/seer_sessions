task_description: Mirror objects from a left panel to a right panel across a vertical divider, preserving the right panel's original background where objects are not placed.

definitions:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  - border: The outermost single-pixel frame of the grid. Often a single color.
  - divider: A vertical column, typically the same color as the border, separating the grid's interior into a left and right panel. It is located where the background colors of the adjacent columns differ.
  - left_panel: The region of the grid inside the border and to the left of the divider.
  - right_panel: The region of the grid inside the border and to the right of the divider.
  - background_color: The most frequent color within a panel (excluding the border and divider).
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels within a panel whose color is different from the panel's background color.

example_analysis:
  - example: 1
    input_grid: (14, 25)
    output_grid: (14, 25)
    border_color: 2 (Red)
    divider_column_index: 8
    divider_color: 2 (Red)
    left_panel_columns: 1-7
    left_panel_background: 1 (Blue)
    left_panel_objects:
      - color: 3 (Green), shape: rectangle
      - color: 8 (Azure), shape: L-shapes
    right_panel_columns: 9-23
    right_panel_background: 4 (Yellow)
    transformation: Non-blue pixels from columns 1-7 are mirrored horizontally relative to column 8, overwriting the yellow background in columns 9-23.
  - example: 2
    input_grid: (11, 22)
    output_grid: (11, 22)
    border_color: 4 (Yellow)
    divider_column_index: 7
    divider_color: 4 (Yellow)
    left_panel_columns: 1-6
    left_panel_background: 1 (Blue)
    left_panel_objects:
      - color: 8 (Azure), shape: various small shapes
    right_panel_columns: 8-20
    right_panel_background: 2 (Red)
    transformation: Non-blue pixels from columns 1-6 are mirrored horizontally relative to column 7, overwriting the red background in columns 8-20.

general_transformation_rule:
  1. Identify the single-pixel outer border color (if one exists and is uniform).
  2. Identify the vertical divider column. This column typically shares the border color and separates two regions with different background colors. Specifically, find a column `d` such that `grid[:, d]` consists solely of the border color, and the dominant colors of `grid[:, d-1]` and `grid[:, d+1]` are different from each other and from the border color.
  3. Determine the background color of the left panel (region left of the divider, inside the border).
  4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
  5. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the left panel (inside border, left of divider).
  6. If the pixel's color `input_grid[r, c]` is *not* the left panel background color:
     a. Calculate the mirrored column index `mc = divider_column_index + (divider_column_index - c)`.
     b. If `mc` is within the grid bounds and within the right panel (right of divider, inside border):
        i. Set `output_grid[r, mc]` to `input_grid[r, c]`.
  7. Ensure all other pixels in the output grid retain their color from the input grid copy (this preserves the original right panel background where not overwritten).
