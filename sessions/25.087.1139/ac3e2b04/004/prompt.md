Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input grid based on identifying a specific pattern and drawing lines.
The pattern consists of a central red (2) pixel surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right) by green (3) pixels.

For each instance of this pattern found in the input grid, centered at coordinates (r, c):
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Draw lines extending horizontally (left and right) and vertically (up and down) from the center (r, c).
3. These lines are composed of blue (1) pixels.
4. The lines are drawn onto the output grid, replacing existing pixels.
5. A line extends outwards from the center pixel by pixel in one of the four orthogonal directions.
6. For each pixel position along the potential line path, check the color of the corresponding pixel in the *original input* grid.
7. If the pixel in the input grid is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to blue (1).
8. If the pixel in the input grid is *not* white (any color other than 0), stop drawing the line in that specific direction. The non-white pixel itself is not changed by this line segment.
9. The process repeats for all four directions (up, down, left, right) for each identified pattern center.
10. Pixels from the original input grid (including the pattern pixels) remain in the output grid unless they are white (0) and lie on the path of a drawn blue line.
