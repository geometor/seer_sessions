objects:
  - type: grid
    description: The main canvas for the task, containing pixels of different colors.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default pixel color.
  - type: pattern
    name: green_cross_red_center
    description: A 3x3 pattern consisting of green (3) pixels forming a cross shape around a central red (2) pixel.
      structure:
        - [ignore, green, ignore]
        - [green, red, green]
        - [ignore, green, ignore]
    properties:
      - center_coordinate: The (row, column) index of the central red pixel.
  - type: line
    color: red (2)
    description: Can be vertical or horizontal lines of red pixels. Their presence doesn't directly trigger the main transformation but they can be overwritten by the output blue lines if they fall on the path.
  - type: line
    color: blue (1)
    description: These pixels are added in the output grid.

actions:
  - identify: Locate all instances of the 'green_cross_red_center' pattern in the input grid.
  - determine_coordinates: For each identified pattern, record the row and column index of its central red pixel.
  - draw_lines: For each recorded coordinate (center_row, center_col):
      - Draw a horizontal blue line along center_row.
      - Draw a vertical blue line along center_col.
  - constraint: When drawing blue lines, only replace white (0) pixels. Stop drawing outwards from the center if a non-white pixel from the input grid is encountered. The central red pixel of the pattern is not replaced.

relationships:
  - trigger: The presence and location of the 'green_cross_red_center' pattern triggers the drawing of blue lines.
  - spatial: The blue lines originate from the center coordinates of the pattern and extend horizontally and vertically.
  - replacement: Blue pixels replace only white background pixels along the designated rows and columns.
