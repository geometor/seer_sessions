They extend from the central pixel outwards towards the grid boundaries, stopping if they encounter any non-white pixel from the original input grid. The central red pixel itself is *not* changed to blue.\n\n4.  **Key Elements:** The crucial element triggering the transformation is the specific 3x3 pattern of a green cross with a red center. The coordinates of this red center dictate where the blue lines are drawn. Other red lines or shapes do not trigger the addition of blue pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
