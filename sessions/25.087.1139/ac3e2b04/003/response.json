Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Draw lines extending horizontally (left and right) and vertically (up and down) from the center (r, c).\n3. These lines are composed of blue (1) pixels.\n4. The lines are drawn onto the output grid, replacing existing pixels.\n5. A line extends outwards from the center pixel by pixel in one of the four orthogonal directions.\n6. For each pixel position along the potential line path, check the color of the corresponding pixel in the *original input* grid.\n7. If the pixel in the input grid is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to blue (1).\n8. If the pixel in the input grid is *not* white (any color other than 0), stop drawing the line in that specific direction. The non-white pixel itself is not changed by this line segment.\n9. The process repeats for all four directions (up, down, left, right) for each identified pattern center.\n10. Pixels from the original input grid (including the pattern pixels) remain in the output grid unless they are white (0) and lie on the path of a drawn blue line.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds red centers surrounded by green crosses and draws blue lines \n    outwards into white areas.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    # Create a copy of the input array to modify, which will become the output\n    output_array = np.copy(input_array)\n    height, width = input_array.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel that could potentially be the center of a 3x3 pattern\n    # We exclude the borders because a full pattern cannot be centered there.\n    for r in range(1, height - 1):\n        for c in range(1, width - 1):\n            # Check if the current pixel is the center of the pattern (red color 2)\n            if input_array[r, c] == 2:\n                # Check if the orthogonal neighbors form the green (3) cross\n                is_pattern_center = (\n                    input_array[r - 1, c] == 3 and  # Pixel above is green\n                    input_array[r + 1, c] == 3 and  # Pixel below is green\n                    input_array[r, c - 1] == 3 and  # Pixel left is green\n                    input_array[r, c + 1] == 3     # Pixel right is green\n                )\n\n                # If the pattern is found, proceed to draw the blue lines\n                if is_pattern_center:\n                    center_row, center_col = r, c\n\n                    # Draw horizontal line leftwards from the center\n                    # Iterate through columns from the one left of the center down to the edge (0)\n                    for col in range(center_col - 1, -1, -1):\n                        # Check the color in the original input grid at this position\n                        if input_array[center_row, col] == 0:\n                            # If it's white (0), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1)\n                            output_array[center_row, col] = 1\n                        else:\n                            # If it's not white, stop drawing the line further in this direction\n                            break \n\n                    # Draw horizontal line rightwards from the center\n                    # Iterate through columns from the one right of the center up to the edge (width-1)\n                    for col in range(center_col + 1, width):\n                        if input_array[center_row, col] == 0:\n                            output_array[center_row, col] = 1\n                        else:\n                            break \n\n                    # Draw vertical line upwards from the center\n                    # Iterate through rows from the one above the center up to the edge (0)\n                    for row in range(center_row - 1, -1, -1):\n                        if input_array[row, center_col] == 0:\n                            output_array[row, center_col] = 1\n                        else:\n                            break\n\n                    # Draw vertical line downwards from the center\n                    # Iterate through rows from the one below the center down to the edge (height-1)\n                    for row in range(center_row + 1, height):\n                        if input_array[row, center_col] == 0:\n                            output_array[row, center_col] = 1\n                        else:\n                            break \n\n    # Convert the final numpy array back to a list of lists for the return value\n    return output_array.tolist()\n```"
