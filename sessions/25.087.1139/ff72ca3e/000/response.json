            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a background of white pixels (0) and scattered single pixels of gray (5) and yellow (4).\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid retains the original gray and yellow pixels. Additionally, areas around the yellow pixels are filled with red pixels (2).\n3.  **Key Objects:** The primary objects are the individual gray (5) and yellow (4) pixels. The transformation introduces areas of red (2) pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve each yellow pixel interacting with its \"closest\" gray pixel(s). For each yellow pixel, a square area centered on it is filled with red pixels. The size of this red square appears determined by the distance and relative position to the closest gray pixel(s).\n5.  **Size Determination:** The side length of the red square centered on a yellow pixel `Y` is calculated based on the gray pixel `G` which has the minimum Manhattan distance to `Y`. If multiple gray pixels share the minimum Manhattan distance, the one that results in the smallest square size based on the formula `Size = 2 * max(abs(Y_row - G_row), abs(Y_col - G_col)) - 1` is chosen.\n6.  **Drawing:** The red square is drawn centered on the yellow pixel. Pixels within this square that are originally background (0) are changed to red (2). Original non-background pixels (gray and yellow) within the square's area remain unchanged. If multiple yellow pixels generate overlapping red squares, the red color is applied additively (a background pixel becomes red if it falls within *any* generated square).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
