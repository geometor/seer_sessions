Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are grids of varying sizes containing pixels of different colors (0-9).
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are also grids, generally smaller than the corresponding inputs.
3.  **Key Feature:** In each input grid, there are prominent horizontal lines (contiguous segments of the same non-white color). Specifically, there seems to be a pair of identical horizontal lines (same color, same length, same start and end columns) positioned one above the other.
4.  **Identifying the Pair:** Among all possible pairs of identical, vertically aligned horizontal lines, the relevant pair appears to be the *widest* one (i.e., the pair whose lines have the greatest length).
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be a subgrid extracted from the input. The boundaries of this subgrid are determined by the location of the identified widest pair of horizontal lines.
6.  **Extraction Logic:**
    *   The top boundary of the output corresponds to the row immediately *below* the top line of the pair.
    *   The bottom boundary of the output corresponds to the row immediately *above* the bottom line of the pair.
    *   The left boundary of the output corresponds to the column immediately *to the right* of the starting column of the lines.
    *   The right boundary of the output corresponds to the column immediately *to the left* of the ending column of the lines.
7.  **Example 1 Walkthrough:**
    *   Input has two yellow (4) lines at rows 11 and 20, spanning columns 11 to 22 (width 12). This is the widest such pair.
    *   Top line row `r1 = 11`, bottom line row `r2 = 20`.
    *   Start column `c1 = 11`, end column `c2 = 22`.
    *   Output rows: `r1 + 1 = 12` to `r2 - 1 = 19`.
    *   Output columns: `c1 + 1 = 12` to `c2 - 1 = 21`.
    *   The extracted subgrid `input[12:20, 12:22]` matches the output.
8.  **Example 2 Walkthrough:**
    *   Input has two gray (8) lines at rows 1 and 8, spanning columns 1 to 9 (width 9). This is the widest pair.
    *   `r1 = 1`, `r2 = 8`, `c1 = 1`, `c2 = 9`.
    *   Output rows: `1 + 1 = 2` to `8 - 1 = 7`.
    *   Output columns: `1 + 1 = 2` to `9 - 1 = 8`.
    *   The extracted subgrid `input[2:8, 2:9]` matches the output.
9.  **Example 3 Walkthrough:**
    *   Input has two blue (1) lines at rows 2 and 7, spanning columns 7 to 13 (width 7). This is the widest pair.
    *   `r1 = 2`, `r2 = 7`, `c1 = 7`, `c2 = 13`.
    *   Output rows: `2 + 1 = 3` to `7 - 1 = 6`.
    *   Output columns: `7 + 1 = 8` to `13 - 1 = 12`.
    *   The extracted subgrid `input[3:7, 8:13]` matches the output.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input grid row by row to identify all maximal horizontal contiguous segments (lines) of pixels where the color is not white (0). For each line found, record its color, row index, starting column index, ending column index, and width (length).
2.  Iterate through all possible pairs of the identified lines.
3.  Select pairs that satisfy the following conditions:
    *   Both lines in the pair have the same color.
    *   Both lines have the same starting column index.
    *   Both lines have the same ending column index.
    *   The lines are in different rows.
4.  From the selected pairs, find the pair (or pairs) where the lines have the maximum width. If there's a tie for maximum width, any of the tied pairs can be chosen (the examples suggest uniqueness or that any choice leads to the same result, but let's assume for now we just pick one, e.g., the one with the topmost line appearing first).
5.  If no such pair is found, the transformation might be undefined or result in an empty grid (this case needs clarification if encountered).
6.  Let the chosen widest pair consist of a top line (at row `r1`, columns `c1` to `c2`) and a bottom line (at row `r2`, columns `c1` to `c2`, where `r2 > r1`).
7.  Define the boundaries for the output subgrid:
    *   Top row: `r1 + 1`
    *   Bottom row: `r2 - 1`
    *   Left column: `c1 + 1`
    *   Right column: `c2 - 1`
8.  If the calculated bottom row is less than the top row, or the right column is less than the left column, the resulting grid is empty.
9.  Otherwise, extract the subgrid from the input grid using these calculated boundaries. This extracted subgrid is the final output.
