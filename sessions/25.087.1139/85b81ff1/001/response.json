Identify the primary color: This is the most frequent non-white (non-zero) color present in the input grid.\n2. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n3. Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.\n4. If a cell in the input grid contains the white color (0):\n    a. Check its vertical neighbors (the cell directly above and the cell directly below). If both vertical neighbors exist within the grid boundaries and both contain the primary color, change the corresponding cell in the output grid from white (0) to the primary color.\n    b. If the vertical condition was not met, check its horizontal neighbors (the cell directly to the left and the cell directly to the right). If both horizontal neighbors exist within the grid boundaries and both contain the primary color, change the corresponding cell in the output grid from white (0) to the primary color.\n5. Cells that are not white (0) in the input grid, or white cells that do not meet the neighbor conditions (a or b), remain unchanged in the output grid.\n6.
