            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified that the transformation involves scaling the grid and replacing input pixels with larger blocks of the same color. However, it incorrectly assumed the size of these blocks. The comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` clearly shows that the code generated 4x4 blocks while the correct transformation uses 2x2 blocks.\n\nThe core logic seems to be:\n1.  Double the dimensions of the input grid to get the output grid dimensions.\n2.  Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n4.  If an input pixel at `(r, c)` has a color `C` different from the background color, place a 2x2 block of color `C` in the output grid, with its top-left corner at `(2*r, 2*c)`.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the block size in the transformation logic from 4x4 to 2x2.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's verify the dimensions and the mapping using the first example.\n"

Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1`.\n4.  Get the color `C` of the input cell `(r, c)`.\n5.  If the color `C` is not the background color (i.e., `C != 0`):\n    a.  Calculate the target top-left coordinates `(R, C_out)` for the output block using the formula: `R = 2*r - 2` and `C_out = 2*c - 2`.\n    b.  Ensure the calculated coordinates `(R, C_out)` are valid (non-negative). Based on example data, `r` and `c` seem to always be >= 1, so `R` and `C_out` should be >= 0.\n    c.  Fill a 4x4 area in the output grid, starting at `(R, C_out)` and ending at `(R+3, C_out+3)`, with the color `C`. Ensure the block stays within the output grid boundaries (though this seems guaranteed by the dimension scaling and the observed `r, c >= 1`).\n6.  Return the completed output grid."
