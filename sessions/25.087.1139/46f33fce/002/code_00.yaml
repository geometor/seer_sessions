task_description: Upscale non-background pixels into larger blocks.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - background_color: 0 (white).
  - output_dimensions: The output grid dimensions are exactly twice the input grid dimensions (H_out = 2 * H_in, W_out = 2 * W_in).

object_transformations:
  - object: Each non-background pixel (color C != 0) in the input grid at position (r, c).
  - action: Is transformed into a solid 4x4 square block of the same color C in the output grid.
  - output_position: The top-left corner of the 4x4 block in the output grid is located at coordinates (R, C_out), where R = 2*r - 2 and C_out = 2*c - 2.
  - background_handling: Background pixels (color 0) in the input implicitly become part of the background in the larger output grid; they do not generate blocks.

edge_cases:
  - Input pixels near the top or left edge (r=0 or c=0) might lead to negative coordinates using the formula (2*r-2, 2*c-2). This task's examples don't show pixels at r=0 or c=0. If such inputs were possible, the placement rule might need adjustment or clipping for those specific cases. However, based *only* on the provided examples, all non-background pixels are at r >= 1 and c >= 1. The formula works for all examples.
