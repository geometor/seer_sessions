    Transforms the input grid by scaling it by a factor of 2 in both dimensions 
    and expanding each non-background pixel into a 4x4 block in the output grid.

    1. Determine the dimensions of the input grid (H x W).
    2. Create an output grid with dimensions (2*H x 2*W), initialized with the background color (0).
    3. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
    4. If the input pixel's color (C) is not the background color (0):
       a. Calculate the top-left coordinate (R, C_start) for the output block: R = 2*r, C_start = 2*c.
       b. Fill the 4x4 area in the output grid starting at (R, C_start) with the color C.
    5. Return the completed output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified that the transformation involves scaling the grid and replacing input pixels with larger blocks of the same color. However, it incorrectly assumed the size of these blocks. The comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` clearly shows that the code generated 4x4 blocks while the correct transformation uses 2x2 blocks.

The core logic seems to be:
1.  Double the dimensions of the input grid to get the output grid dimensions.
2.  Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  If an input pixel at `(r, c)` has a color `C` different from the background color, place a 2x2 block of color `C` in the output grid, with its top-left corner at `(2*r, 2*c)`.

The strategy is to correct the block size in the transformation logic from 4x4 to 2x2.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's verify the dimensions and the mapping using the first example.

**Analysis Update**:

My manual check of the first example's expected output was incorrect. Let me re-examine Example 1 carefully.

*Input:*
Pixel Blue (1) at (1, 1)
Pixel Green (3) at (1, 3)
Pixel Yellow (4) at (3, 3)
Pixel Azure (8) at (7, 9)  <- Correction: Column index is 9, not 8
Pixel Red (2) at (9, 7)
Pixel Red (2) at (9, 9)

*Expected Output:*
Block Blue (1) covers (0,0) to (3,3) - This is a 4x4 block, top-left at (0,0)
Block Green (3) covers (0,4) to (3,7) - This is a 4x4 block, top-left at (0,4)
Block Yellow (4) covers (4,4) to (7,7) - This is a 4x4 block, top-left at (4,4)
Block Azure (8) covers (12,16) to (15,19) - This is a 4x4 block, top-left at (12,16)
Block Red (2) covers (16,12) to (19,15) - This is a 4x4 block, top-left at (16,12)
Block Red (2) covers (16,16) to (19,19) - This is a 4x4 block, top-left at (16,16)

Wait, the positions don't seem to follow a simple `(2*r, 2*c)` rule anymore. Let's re-evaluate the mapping.

Input (r, c) | Color | Output Block Top-Left (R, C) | Relationship (R/r, C/c)? | Expected Block Size
----------------|-------|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------
(1, 1)          | 1     | (0, 0)                       | (0/1, 0/1) = (0, 0) ??     | 4x4
(1, 3)          | 3     | (0, 4)                       | (0/1, 4/3) = (0, 1.33)??  | 4x4
(3, 3)          | 4     | (4, 4)                       | (4/3, 4/3) = (1.33, 1.33)?? | 4x4
(7, 9)          | 8     | (12, 16)                     | (12/7, 16/9) = (1.71, 1.78)?? | 4x4
(9, 7)          | 2     | (16, 12)                     | (16/9, 12/7) = (1.78, 1.71)?? | 4x4
(9, 9)          | 2     | (16, 16)                     | (16/9, 16/9) = (1.78, 1.78)?? | 4x4

This simple scaling rule `(2*r, 2*c)` for the top-left corner is incorrect based on the first example's expected output. The block size *is* 4x4, but the placement is different from what the previous code and my initial reassessment assumed.

Let's re-examine the `Transformed Output` from the code (which used 4x4 blocks starting at `(2*r, 2*c)`):
- Input (1, 1) -> Code places 4x4 block at (2, 2). Expected output has 4x4 block at (0, 0).
- Input (1, 3) -> Code places 4x4 block at (2, 6). Expected output has 4x4 block at (0, 4).
- Input (3, 3) -> Code places 4x4 block at (6, 6). Expected output has 4x4 block at (4, 4).
- Input (7, 9) -> Code places 4x4 block at (14, 18). Expected output has 4x4 block at (12, 16).
- Input (9, 7) -> Code places 4x4 block at (18, 14). Expected output has 4x4 block at (16, 12).
- Input (9, 9) -> Code places 4x4 block at (18, 18). Expected output has 4x4 block at (16, 16).

Comparing the code's placement `(2r, 2c)` with the expected placement `(R, C)`:
Input (r, c) | Code (2r, 2c) | Expected (R, C) | Difference (R-2r, C-2c)
----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------
(1, 1)          | (2, 2)        | (0, 0)          | (-2, -2)
(1, 3)          | (2, 6)        | (0, 4)          | (-2, -2)
(3, 3)          | (6, 6)        | (4, 4)          | (-2, -2)
(7, 9)          | (14, 18)      | (12, 16)        | (-2, -2)
(9, 7)          | (18, 14)      | (16, 12)        | (-2, -2)
(9, 9)          | (18, 18)      | (16, 16)        | (-2, -2)

It appears the correct placement for the top-left corner of the 4x4 block is `(2*r - 2, 2*c - 2)`.

Let's verify this hypothesis with Example 2.
Input (1, 1) -> Color 2. Expected Top-Left (0, 0). Formula: `(2*1 - 2, 2*1 - 2) = (0, 0)`. Matches.
Input (3, 1) -> Color 4. Expected Top-Left (4, 0). Formula: `(2*3 - 2, 2*1 - 2) = (4, 0)`. Matches.
Input (3, 3) -> Color 1. Expected Top-Left (4, 4). Formula: `(2*3 - 2, 2*3 - 2) = (4, 4)`. Matches.
Input (5, 5) -> Color 3. Expected Top-Left (8, 8). Formula: `(2*5 - 2, 2*5 - 2) = (8, 8)`. Matches.
Input (7, 7) -> Color 4. Expected Top-Left (12, 12). Formula: `(2*7 - 2, 2*7 - 2) = (12, 12)`. Matches.
Input (9, 9) -> Color 3. Expected Top-Left (16, 16). Formula: `(2*9 - 2, 2*9 - 2) = (16, 16)`. Matches.

The hypothesis `(2*r - 2, 2*c - 2)` seems correct for the top-left corner placement of the 4x4 blocks.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task_description: Upscale non-background pixels into larger blocks.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
  - background_color: 0 (white).
  - output_dimensions: The output grid dimensions are exactly twice the input grid dimensions (H_out = 2 * H_in, W_out = 2 * W_in).

object_transformations:
  - object: Each non-background pixel (color C != 0) in the input grid at position (r, c).
  - action: Is transformed into a solid 4x4 square block of the same color C in the output grid.
  - output_position: The top-left corner of the 4x4 block in the output grid is located at coordinates (R, C_out), where R = 2*r - 2 and C_out = 2*c - 2.
  - background_handling: Background pixels (color 0) in the input implicitly become part of the background in the larger output grid; they do not generate blocks.

edge_cases:
  - Input pixels near the top or left edge (r=0 or c=0) might lead to negative coordinates using the formula (2*r-2, 2*c-2). This task's examples don't show pixels at r=0 or c=0. If such inputs were possible, the placement rule might need adjustment or clipping for those specific cases. However, based *only* on the provided examples, all non-background pixels are at r >= 1 and c >= 1. The formula works for all examples.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 2*H and width 2*W, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, from row `r=0` to `H-1` and column `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  Get the color `C` of the input cell `(r, c)`.
5.  If the color `C` is not the background color (i.e., `C != 0`):
    a.  Calculate the target top-left coordinates `(R, C_out)` for the output block using the formula: `R = 2*r - 2` and `C_out = 2*c - 2`.
    b.  Ensure the calculated coordinates `(R, C_out)` are valid (non-negative). Based on example data, `r` and `c` seem to always be >= 1, so `R` and `C_out` should be >= 0.
    c.  Fill a 4x4 area in the output grid, starting at `(R, C_out)` and ending at `(R+3, C_out+3)`, with the color `C`. Ensure the block stays within the output grid boundaries (though this seems guaranteed by the dimension scaling and the observed `r, c >= 1`).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
