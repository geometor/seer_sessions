            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size Transformation:** The output grid is consistently twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. If the input is HxW, the output is (2H)x(2W). In the examples, 10x10 inputs become 20x20 outputs.\n2.  **Object Identification:** The inputs contain isolated, single pixels of non-white colors (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Azure) scattered on a white background (color 0). These single colored pixels can be considered the primary objects.\n3.  **Object Transformation:** Each non-white input pixel seems to \"expand\" into a larger square block in the output grid.\n4.  **Block Size:** Observing the outputs, each input pixel corresponds to a 4x4 block of the *same* color in the output.\n5.  **Positional Mapping:** The position of the 4x4 block in the output grid is directly related to the position of the original single pixel in the input grid. If an input pixel is at `(r, c)` (using 0-based indexing), the corresponding 4x4 block in the output starts at `(2*r, 2*c)`.\n6.  **Background Preservation:** The background color (white, 0) from the input effectively expands to fill the space in the larger output grid that isn't occupied by the colored 4x4 blocks.\n\n**Facts Documentation:**\n\n"

Check if the color `C` is not the background color (i.e., `C != 0`).\n7.  If the color `C` is not the background color:\n    a.
