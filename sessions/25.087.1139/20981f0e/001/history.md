Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure & Colors:** The input and output grids use white (0) as the background, red (2) for marker pixels, and blue (1) for shape pixels.
2.  **Red Markers:** Red pixels appear individually and seem stationary; their positions are identical in both input and output grids. They often appear in regular arrangements (like grid points).
3.  **Blue Shapes:** Blue pixels form small, sometimes fragmented, shapes in the input. In the output, the blue pixels always form solid 2x2 squares.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves converting the fragmented blue input shapes into solid 2x2 blue squares in the output. The placement of these output squares is determined by the location of the red marker pixels and the presence of nearby blue pixels in the input.
5.  **Rule Discovery:** By examining the relationship between input red pixels, input blue pixels, and output blue squares, a pattern emerges:
    *   Each red pixel seems to define a "zone of influence" or a "detection area".
    *   If any blue pixel from the input falls within a specific 3x3 detection area relative to a red pixel, it triggers the creation of a 2x2 blue square in the output.
    *   The detection area for a red pixel at `(r, c)` appears to be the 3x3 square whose top-left corner is at `(r+1, c+1)`.
    *   The corresponding 2x2 blue square created in the output has its top-left corner at `(r+2, c+2)`.
