This pixel seems to be the \"source\" or \"trigger\" for the transformation. Its color varies between examples (green in Ex1, red in Ex2, azure in Ex3).\n4.  **White Pixels:** There are also white pixels (color 0) present in the input grids, often forming simple shapes. These white pixels, along with the background, seem to remain unchanged in the output, *unless* overwritten by the transformation process. They don't appear to directly influence the core transformation logic.\n5.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves adding a pattern of pixels to the grid. The color of the added pixels is the same as the color of the \"source\" pixel identified in step 3.\n6.  **Pattern Characteristics:** The shape and relative position of the added pattern depend entirely on the *color* of the source pixel. Each source color (green, red, azure) corresponds to a unique, fixed pattern of relative coordinates.\n7.  **Pattern Application:** The pattern (defined as a set of relative row/column offsets) is applied relative to the location of the source pixel. The source pixel itself is part of the pattern (offset (0,0)). Pixels in the input grid at the target locations are overwritten with the source pixel's color.\n8.  **Boundary Conditions:** The pattern application respects the grid boundaries; only pixels within the grid dimensions are modified.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine the most frequent color in the input grid; this is the `background_color`.\n3.  Find the coordinates (`source_row`, `source_col`) and color (`source_color`) of the unique pixel in the input grid that is neither the `background_color` nor white (color 0).\n4.  Define the patterns associated with specific `source_color` values:\n    *   `pattern_green` = `{(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,-2), (2,0), (3,-3), (3,-2), (3,-1), (4,-4), (4,-2), (5,-4), (5,-3)}`\n    *   `pattern_red` = `{(0,0), (1,-1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,3), (5,5), (6,4), (6,6)}`\n    *   `pattern_azure` = `{(-4,0), (-4,1), (-4,3), (-4,4), (-3,0), (-3,1), (-3,3), (-3,4), (-2,2), (-1,0), (-1,1), (-1,3), (-1,4), (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4)}`\n5.  Select the appropriate pattern based on the identified `source_color`:\n    *   If `source_color` is green (3), select `pattern_green`.\n    *   If `source_color` is red (2), select `pattern_red`.\n    *   If `source_color` is azure (8), select `pattern_azure`.\n    *   (Assume other colors, if encountered, might have their own patterns or default behavior, though only these three are shown).\n6.  Iterate through each relative offset coordinate (`dr`, `dc`) in the selected pattern.\n7.  For each offset, calculate the target grid coordinates: `target_row = source_row + dr`, `target_col = source_col + dc`.\n8.  Check if the `target_row` and `target_col` are within the valid row and column ranges of the grid.\n9.  If the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries, update the pixel at (`target_row`, `target_col`) in the output grid to be the `source_color`.\n10. Return the modified output grid."
