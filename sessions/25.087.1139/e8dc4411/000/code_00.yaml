task_elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - background_color: most frequent color in the input grid
      - dimensions: height and width
  - element: source_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid whose color is neither the background color nor white (0).
    attributes:
      - color: identifies the type of transformation/pattern
      - location: (row, column) coordinates, serves as the anchor point for the pattern
  - element: pattern
    description: A set of relative (row, column) offsets specific to the source_pixel's color.
    attributes:
      - color_association: Each potential source_pixel color (e.g., green, red, azure) maps to a distinct pattern.
      - shape: The collection of offsets defines the shape of the pixels to be added/changed.
      - origin: Includes the offset (0,0), meaning the source_pixel location is part of the pattern.
  - element: white_pixels
    description: Pixels with color 0.
    attributes:
      - role: Appear to be distractors or fixed elements, preserved unless overwritten by the pattern application.

transformation:
  - action: identify_background_color
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: background_color
  - action: identify_source_pixel
    inputs: input_grid, background_color
    outputs: source_pixel (color and location)
  - action: select_pattern
    inputs: source_pixel_color
    outputs: pattern (set of relative offsets)
    details: Uses a predefined mapping {source_color -> pattern}.

  - action: apply_pattern
    inputs: input_grid, source_pixel (color and location), selected_pattern
    outputs: output_grid
    details:
      - Create a copy of the input grid.
      - For each offset (dr, dc) in the pattern:
        - Calculate target coordinates (source_row + dr, source_col + dc).
        - If target coordinates are within grid bounds, set the pixel at that location in the copied grid to the source_pixel's color.

relationships:
  - The output pattern's color matches the source_pixel's color.
  - The output pattern's shape and position relative to the source_pixel depend only on the source_pixel's color.
  - The background color helps identify the source_pixel but doesn't directly influence the pattern shape or color.
  - White pixels are static elements unless overwritten.
