*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input grids consist of a white (0) background.
    *   Multiple distinct rectangular "objects" are present in the input grid.
    *   These objects are composed primarily of blue (1) pixels, but also contain some red (2) pixels scattered within them.
    *   The objects are separated from each other by the white background.
    *   The output grid contains only one rectangular object.
    *   This output object appears to be identical in shape, size, and pixel pattern to one of the objects present in the input grid.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: selection
    input_elements:
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
      - type: object_set
        description: Multiple distinct rectangular regions composed of non-white pixels.
        objects:
          - type: rectangular_region
            properties:
              composition: Primarily blue (1) pixels with interspersed red (2) pixels.
              separation: Separated by white (0) background pixels.
              variability: Objects differ in size, position, and the specific pattern/count of red pixels.
    output_elements:
      - type: object
        description: A single rectangular region, identical to one of the input objects.
        properties:
          origin: Selected from the input object set based on a specific criterion.
    transformation:
      action: identify_and_select
      steps:
        - Identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-white pixels in the input grid.
        - For each identified object:
          - Determine its bounding box.
          - Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box.
          - Count the number of red (2) pixels within this subgrid.
        - Select the object (subgrid) that has the maximum count of red (2) pixels.
        - The selected object (subgrid) becomes the output grid.
      selection_criterion: Maximum count of red (2) pixels within an object.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Scan the input grid to locate all separate connected components (objects) made of non-white pixels (blue and red).
    2.  For each identified object, determine its boundaries (minimum and maximum row and column).
    3.  Within the boundaries of each object, count how many pixels have the color red (2).
    4.  Compare the counts of red pixels for all identified objects.
    5.  Identify the object that contains the highest number of red pixels.
    6.  Extract the rectangular subgrid corresponding exactly to this identified object (including its blue and red pixels).
    7.  Produce this extracted subgrid as the output grid.
