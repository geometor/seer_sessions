Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes, one in the top left and one in the bottom right.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape:  Two separate L-shapes, identical to the input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: two single separate pixels

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects made of color 8 (azure). Also, two distinct L shaped are preent in the output grid, which looks the same, and two blue single pixel objects are placed at (1,2) and (4,4).

2.  **Detect Action:** The azure (8) objects have not changed. The blue (1) single pixels are new in the output grid.

3. **Determine the creation rule**: The azure colored objects are the key to the transformation. Find the azure colored pixel in the second row. Take the next x. Find the azure colored pixel in the n-2 row. Take the x-1.
  
**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

Copy the azure colored pixels from input to output grid. Fill the next column of the first azure colored pixel with a blue (1) pixel. Fill one column before the last azure colored pixel.


**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
