Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(0, 5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 3), (4, 3)]
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5,0)]
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells

output_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(5, 5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(4, 3),(5,3)]
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5,0)]
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white colored cells in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve and Shift Some Objects:** Non-white objects present in rows 3, 4, and 5 are kept and remain in their relative input positions within those rows in the output.
3.  **Move Other Objects to the Bottom Row**:
    *   The maroon object that was originally at (0, 5) is moved to (5, 5).
     *   The azure object that was originally at (1, 3) is moved to (5, 3).

4. **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells not occupied by the moved objects are filled with white (0).

The provided Python code correctly implements the initial transformation rule. However, it needs a minor adjustment to account for preserving colored object present in the row 3 and 4, like the previous provided example.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify all non-white colored cells in the input grid.
2. Move all non-white cells to the last row of the output grid, maintaining their original horizontal order.
3. Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).
