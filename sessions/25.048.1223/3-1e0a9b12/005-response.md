Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 5x5
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(0, 3), (2, 3)]
    - color: 3 (green)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 1)]
    - color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(2, 4)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(3, 0)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells

output_grid:
  size: 5x5
  objects:
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(3, 3), (4,3)]
    - color: 3 (green)
      positions: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4,1)]
    - color: 2 (red)
      positions: [(4, 4)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      positions: [(4, 0)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white colored cells in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve and Shift Some Objects:** Non-white objects present in rows 2, 3, and 4 are kept and remain in their relative input positions within those rows in the output.
3.  **Move Other Objects to the Bottom Row**:
     *  The blue object at (0,3) is moved to the last row, at the first available position starting from the left.
     * The green object that was originally at (1, 1) is moved to (4, 1).

4. **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells not occupied by the moved objects are filled with white (0).
   The previously provided code does exactly what we need.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify all non-white colored cells in the input grid.
2. Move all non-white cells present in rows 0, 1 and 2 to the last row of the output grid, maintaining their original horizontal order.
3. Keep the colored object present in rows 3,4 and 5.
4. Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).
