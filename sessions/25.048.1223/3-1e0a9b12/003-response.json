            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 6x6\n  objects:\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      positions: [(0, 5)]\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(1, 3), (4, 3)]\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5,0)]\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 6x6\n  objects:\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      positions: [(5, 5)]\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      positions: [(4, 3),(5,3)]\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5,0)]\n    - color: 7 (orange)\n      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white colored cells in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Preserve and Shift Some Objects:** Non-white objects present in rows 3, 4, and 5 are kept and remain in their relative input positions within those rows in the output.\n3.  **Move Other Objects to the Bottom Row**:\n    *   The maroon object that was originally at (0, 5) is moved to (5, 5).\n     *   The azure object that was originally at (1, 3) is moved to (5, 3).\n\n4. **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells not occupied by the moved objects are filled with white (0).\n\nThe provided Python code correctly implements the initial transformation rule. However, it needs a minor adjustment to account for preserving colored object present in the row 3 and 4, like the previous provided example.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Identify all non-white colored cells in the input grid.\n2. Move all non-white cells to the last row of the output grid, maintaining their original horizontal order.\n3. Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_non_white_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and returns a list of non-white objects with their positions and colors.\n    Each object is a tuple: ((row, col), color).\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                objects.append(((r, c), grid[r, c]))\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Get non-white objects from the input grid.\n    objects = get_non_white_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Sort objects by their original column to maintain horizontal order.\n    objects.sort(key=lambda x: x[0][1])\n\n    # Place the objects in the last row of the output grid.\n    last_row = output_grid.shape[0] - 1\n\n    # Iterate through the objects\n    for (r,c), color in objects:\n      if r >= 3: # objects in rows 3, 4 and 5 should be left alone.\n        output_grid[r,c] = color\n      else:\n          # Find the next available position in last_row\n          col_index = 0\n          while output_grid[last_row, col_index] != 0: #find an empty slot.\n            col_index +=1\n\n          output_grid[last_row,col_index] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
