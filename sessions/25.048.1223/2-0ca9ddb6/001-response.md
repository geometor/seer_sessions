Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 7
      positions:  [(5,6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6)]
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 0
      position: all other cells
      shape: background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** In the input grid, we have two significant single-cell objects: a red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2) and a blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6). All the other cells are white (color 0, the background).

2.  **Preservation:** The red and the blue objects are maintained in the output.

3.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 "aura" appears around the red object. Specifically, two yellow cells is created, simmetrically opposed, one cell to the left and another to the right of the object.

4. **Orange Expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 "aura" appears around the blue object. Specifically, three orange cells appear: one to the left, one to the right, and the last one below.

5. **Background Persistence:** The other cells remain unchanged (white, color 0).

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The transformation preserves a red cell and a blue cell. Then, it draws a yellow, simmetrical, aura one cell distant to the red object and an orange aura one cell distant to the blue object.
