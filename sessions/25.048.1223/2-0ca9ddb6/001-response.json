All the other cells are white (color 0, the background).\n\n2.  **Preservation:** The red and the blue objects are maintained in the output.\n\n3.  **Yellow Expansion:** A yellow (color 4) 1x1 \"aura\" appears around the red object. Specifically, two yellow cells is created, simmetrically opposed, one cell to the left and another to the right of the object.\n\n4. **Orange Expansion:** An orange (color 7) 1x1 \"aura\" appears around the blue object. Specifically, three orange cells appear: one to the left, one to the right, and the last one below.\n\n5. **Background Persistence:** The other cells remain unchanged (white, color 0).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nThe transformation preserves a red cell and a blue cell. Then, it draws a yellow, simmetrical, aura one cell distant to the red object and an orange aura one cell distant to the blue object.\n\n"
