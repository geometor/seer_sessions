Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, resembling a mirrored, rotated "F" or a Tetris "T" piece.
      position: Centered, spanning rows 2-7 and columns 2-7.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Filling the entire grid except where the object of color 5 is.
      count: 1
  
output_grid:
  dimensions: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: A 2x2 square, and partial parts of it that conform to the "arms" of the "F" shape in the input.
      position: Roughly at the same position as the upper and lower portions of the "F" from the input.
      count: multiple
    - color: 2
      shape: A mirrored and slightly stretched "L".
      position: Replaces the "stem" of the input "F" from rows 3 to 7.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Filling the entire grid except where colors 8 and 2 are.
      count: 1

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color '5' (gray) in the input grid. This object has a shape similar to a mirrored and rotated "F".

2.  **Decompose and Recolour:**
    *   The top 2x2 square formed by color 5 at rows 2,3 and columns 2,3 is recolored to color 8 (azure).
    *   The parts that follow the same columns are recolored in azure too, up to the intersection.
    *   The central vertical part, or stem, of the "F" shape (from the third row to the seventh, the intersection), is recolored to color 2 (red).

3.  **Background:** The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**Explanation and Reasoning:**
The gray object gets decomposed and recolored. The core of the gray shape and the arms that come out from the sides get the color azure. The "stem" gets recolored to red. The background (white/0) stays untouched.

Okay, let's analyze the second example of transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 8x10
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, appears to be a combination of rectangles, resembling a shape with a thick "stem" and two "arms".
      position: Spans rows 1-6 and columns 1-6.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the rest of the grid.
      count: 1

output_grid:
  dimensions: 8x10
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Rectangular segments.
      position: Occupies positions similar to the "arms" and the top part of the input shape.
      count: multiple
    - color: 2
      shape: A vertical line and a single separate point.
      position:  Corresponds to the "stem" of the input shape, and some parts of the branches.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Fills the rest of the grid.
      count: 1
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Find the contiguous region of color '5' (gray) in the input grid.

2.  **Decompose and Recolour:**
    *   The pixels in the first two rows that are color 5 are changed to color 8 (azure) if they are in the extremes, and color 2 if they are in between.
    *   The vertical "stem" of the shape (pixels of color 5 at column 3 from the second row) are changed to color 2 (red).
    *   The pixels in the "arms" (pixels connected horizontally with the shape) change to color 8 in rows where they are connected to the azure pixels.

3.  **Background:** The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**Explanation and Reasoning:**
This rule effectively splits the initial gray shape into sections. The "arms" and the extremes of the gray shape are set to azure, while the "stem" and parts of the "arms" are set to red. The background (color 0) remains the same.

Okay, let's analyze the third example and determine the transformation rule.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 8x9
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, resembling a shape with a vertical section and some extensions to the right.
      position: Centered, spanning rows 1-5 and columns 1-5.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Filling the entire grid except where the object of color 5 is.
      count: 1

output_grid:
  dimensions: 8x9
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: Rectangular, two 2x2 squares.
      position: Located where the rightmost "extensions" of the input shape were.
      count: 2
    - color: 2
      shape: Vertical line and horizontal segments.
      position:  Covers the vertical "stem" and the top horizontal segment.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Filling the entire grid except where colors 8 and 2 are.
      count: 1
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color '5' (gray) in the input grid.

2.  **Decompose and Recolour:**
    *   The right extensions (the two squares where 5 is) are turned into color 8 (azure).
    *   The "stem" (the central axis) is recolored to 2.
    *   The part that branches out to the left on the top is also recolored to 2.

3.  **Background:** The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The transformation recolors specific parts of the gray object (5). The central "stem" and the first row become red (2). The right-side extensions are turned to azure (8). The rest of the grid, the background color (0) remains white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
