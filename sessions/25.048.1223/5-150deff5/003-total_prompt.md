Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: Irregular, resembling a mirrored, rotated "F" or a Tetris "T" piece.
      position: Centered, spanning rows 2-7 and columns 2-7.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Filling the entire grid except where the object of color 5 is.
      count: 1
  
output_grid:
  dimensions: 11x9
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: A 2x2 square, and partial parts of it that conform to the "arms" of the "F" shape in the input.
      position: Roughly at the same position as the upper and lower portions of the "F" from the input.
      count: multiple
    - color: 2
      shape: A mirrored and slightly stretched "L".
      position: Replaces the "stem" of the input "F" from rows 3 to 7.
      count: 1
    - color: 0
      shape: Background
      position: Filling the entire grid except where colors 8 and 2 are.
      count: 1

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color '5' (gray) in the input grid. This object has a shape similar to a mirrored and rotated "F".

2.  **Decompose and Recolour:**
    *   The top 2x2 square formed by color 5 at rows 2,3 and columns 2,3 is recolored to color 8 (azure).
    *   The parts that follow the same columns are recolored in azure too, up to the intersection.
    *   The central vertical part, or stem, of the "F" shape (from the third row to the seventh, the intersection), is recolored to color 2 (red).

3.  **Background:** The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**Explanation and Reasoning:**
The gray object gets decomposed and recolored. The core of the gray shape and the arms that come out from the sides get the color azure. The "stem" gets recolored to red. The background (white/0) stays untouched.

```python
"""
The input grid contains a gray object (color 5) shaped like a mirrored and rotated "F". This object is decomposed and recolored: the top 2x2 square and the "arms" extending to the sides become azure (color 8), while the central vertical "stem" becomes red (color 2). The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
