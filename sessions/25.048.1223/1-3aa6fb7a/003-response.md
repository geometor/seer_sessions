Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (0, 4)
        - (0, 5)
        - (1, 5)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 2)
        - (3, 3)
        - (5, 4)
        - (6, 4)
        - (6, 3)

      shape: Three separate L-shapes.

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (0, 4)
        - (0, 5)
        - (1, 5)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 2)
        - (3, 3)
        - (5, 4)
        - (6, 4)
        - (6, 3)
      shape:  Three separate L-shapes (same as input).
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions:
        - (1,4)
        - (2,3)
        - (5,3)
      shape: single pixels
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve:** Copy all azure pixels to the output grid, keeping their position unchanged.
3.  **Detect L-Shapes:** Identify 3-pixel "L" shapes among the azure pixels. In this case, there are three such L-shapes.
4. **Insert Blue Pixel:** Place a blue (color 1) pixel inside the corner of each detected "L" shape.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

The transformation copies the azure pixels without modification.  The change involves adding a blue pixel to the "elbow" or inner corner of each 3-pixel L-shaped azure object. The code I wrote before correctly describes this general rule and it will work in this case.
