Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (1, 1)
        - (2, 1)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 4)
        - (3, 5)
        - (4, 5)
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (or could be considered individual pixels)

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:
        - (1, 1)
        - (2, 1)
        - (2, 2)
        - (3, 4)
        - (3, 5)
        - (4, 5)
      shape:  Two separate L-shapes (same as input)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions:
        - (1,2)
        - (4,4)
      shape: single pixels
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid. Note their positions.

2.  **Preserve:** Copy every azure pixel to the output grid, keeping its position unchanged.

3. **Detect Particular Shape:** The azure pixels form two separated 'L' shapes made of three pixels each.

4.  **Insert:** For each one of the two shapes, insert a blue (color 1) pixel inside the corner of the "L" shape. The blue pixel should connect the two lines of the "L".

**Step-by-step explanation of the transformation:**
The azure pixels did not move. The only change from the input to the output is the addition of blue pixels in the "elbows" of the two L-shapes.
