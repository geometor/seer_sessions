Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape and single block
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [4,4], [4,5], [5,4]]
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      positions: fills the rest of the grid
output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape and single block
      positions:  [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [4,4], [4,5], [5,4]]
       - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: Single block
      positions: [[1,2], [5,3]]
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      positions: fills the rest of the grid

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two primary objects defined by color: azure (8) colored objects and the white (0) background. The azure objects form two distinct shapes: an "L" shape (at the top-left) and some other contiguous blocks(at bottom-right.)

2.  **Detect Change**: Comparing the input to the output some azure (8) blocks are subsituted by blue(1).

3. **Describe the Rule.** The azure(8) blocks most to the right of the L-shape and most to the left of the other shape are changed to blue(1).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows: for each azure(8) shape composed of more than one block, substitute by a blue(1) block the azure(8) block that is most to the right for the shape at the top-left of the grid, and most to the left of the shape at the bottom-right.
