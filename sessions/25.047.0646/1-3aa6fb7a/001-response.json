The azure objects form two distinct shapes: an \"L\" shape (at the top-left) and some other contiguous blocks(at bottom-right.)\n\n2.  **Detect Change**: Comparing the input to the output some azure (8) blocks are subsituted by blue(1).\n\n3. **Describe the Rule.** The azure(8) blocks most to the right of the L-shape and most to the left of the other shape are changed to blue(1).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows: for each azure(8) shape composed of more than one block, substitute by a blue(1) block the azure(8) block that is most to the right for the shape at the top-left of the grid, and most to the left of the shape at the bottom-right.\n"
