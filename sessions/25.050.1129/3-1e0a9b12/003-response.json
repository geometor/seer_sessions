Find all cells where the value is not 0.\n2. Move all non-zero cells the the last rows of the grid, from bottom to top.\n3. Change the position of the cell without modifying the original column.\n\nThe provided Python code from the previous example should correctly implement this rule. It iterates through the columns, identifies non-zero cells, and moves them to the bottom row while preserving their color and relative order within the column. The changes, compared to the first example, are not in conflict with the functionality of the code.\n"
