Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    3: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Green
    1: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Blue
    2: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Red
  objects:
      - description: "column of green color (3)"
      - description: "column of blue color (1)"
      - description: "column of red color (2)"

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    4: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Yellow
    5: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Gray
    6: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Magenta
  objects:
     - description: "column of yellow color (4)"
     - description: "column of gray color (5)"
     - description: "column of magenta color (6)"
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping, incrementing each color value by a fixed amount:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three columns, each filled with a single color: green (3), blue (1), and red (2), from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color in the output grid by adding +1 to each number.

    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note that here the colors jump from 1 (blue) to 5 (grey). This suggests that the transformation considers a modulo 10 of the input +1.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
    *  In essence: new color = old color + 1 (+3 if old color = 1)

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The spatial arrangement and shape of the objects (the three columns) remain identical between the input and output. Only the colors change.

**Summary**
The rule consists on increasing the value associated to each color.
If the input value is 1, the output value is 5.
Otherwise, the output value is the input value + 1.

```python

Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    2: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Red
    3: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Green
    8: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Azure
  objects:
      - description: "column of red color (2)"
      - description: "column of green color (3)"
      - description: "column of azure color (8)"

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    6: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Magenta
    4: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Yellow
    9: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Maroon
  objects:
     - description: "column of magenta color (6)"
     - description: "column of yellow color (4)"
     - description: "column of maroon color (9)"
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule, similar to the previous example, is a color mapping. It seems, again, we increment by adding +4. Let's check the first guess.

1.  **Identify Objects:**  The structure is identical to the previous example: three columns, each a single color. The colors are red (2), green (3), and azure (8).

2.  **Color Mapping:**

    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).

    This shows that the general form of the rule is the same, a color change
    depending on the original number.
    new color = old color + 4

3. **Preservation of Structure:** Once again, the shape and location are the same.

**Summary**
The rule consists on increasing the value associated to each color by 4, except for the 1 which is increased by 5-1=4, 2 which is increased by 6-2=4, 3 that becomes 3+1=4 and 8 that becomes 9.

It can be simplified by adding +4 and taking modulo 10:
`new_color = (old_color + 4) % 10`

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
      for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        output_grid[i,j] = (input_grid[i,j] + 4) % 10
    return output_grid
```

```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping where each color in the input grid is replaced by a new color in the output grid. The new color is determined by adding 4 to the original color value and taking the modulo 10 of the result. This ensures that the new color value remains within the range 0-9.

Okay, let's analyze this third example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    5: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Gray
    8: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Azure
    6: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Magenta
  objects:

      - description: "column of azure color (8)"
      - description: "column of magenta color (6)"

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    1: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Blue
    9: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Maroon
    2: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Red
  objects:
     - description: "column of blue color (1)"
     - description: "column of maroon color (9)"
     - description: "column of red color (2)"
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The structure remains consistent: three columns, each filled with a single color. The colors are gray (5), azure (8), and magenta (6).

2.  **Color Mapping:**

    *   Gray (5) becomes Blue (1).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).
    *   Magenta (6) becomes Red (2).

    This confirms the previously identified rule: `new_color = (old_color + 4) % 10`

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The structure is, again, preserved.

**Summary**

The rule remains consistent with the previous examples. Add 4 to the original color and use a modulo 10.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
