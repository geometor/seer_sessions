Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    3: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Green
    1: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Blue
    2: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Red
  objects:
      - description: "column of green color (3)"
      - description: "column of blue color (1)"
      - description: "column of red color (2)"

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    4: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ]  # Yellow
    5: [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) ]  # Gray
    6: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) ]  # Magenta
  objects:
     - description: "column of yellow color (4)"
     - description: "column of gray color (5)"
     - description: "column of magenta color (6)"
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping, incrementing each color value by a fixed amount:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three columns, each filled with a single color: green (3), blue (1), and red (2), from left to right.

2.  **Color Mapping:** Each color in the input grid is transformed to a new color in the output grid by adding +1 to each number.

    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note that here the colors jump from 1 (blue) to 5 (grey). This suggests that the transformation considers a modulo 10 of the input +1.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
    *  In essence: new color = old color + 1 (+3 if old color = 1)

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The spatial arrangement and shape of the objects (the three columns) remain identical between the input and output. Only the colors change.

**Summary**
The rule consists on increasing the value associated to each color.
If the input value is 1, the output value is 5.
Otherwise, the output value is the input value + 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
