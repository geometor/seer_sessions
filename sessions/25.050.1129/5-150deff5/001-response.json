This is our primary object.\n\n2.  **Substitution 1:** Change all the cells of color 5 by color 8.\n\n3.  **Substitution 2:** Every cell with value 0 and inside the object 1 (that is, surrounded by color 8 objects) will turn into color 2.\n\n**Explanation and Justification**\nThe transformation performs substitutions, changing color 5 to color 8 and some internal cells to color 2.\n"
