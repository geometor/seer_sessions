These are our primary objects.\n\n2.  **Preserve Key Objects:** The red and blue cells remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Create Yellow Cross:** For the red cell:\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position above.\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position below.\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position to the left.\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position to the right.\n\n4.  **Create Orange Cross:** For the blue cell:\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position above.\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position below.\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position to the left.\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position to the right.\n\n5. **Fill the remaining cells:** keep them as color 0 (white, background)\n\nIn essence, the transformation creates a cross-shaped pattern of a specific color around each of the initially present, single-cell colored objects (red and blue), while keeping the original cells unchanged. The surrounding colors are different for red and blue.\n"
