There can be more than one of each. Also identify any other non-zero cells, like the azure (color 8) one in this case.\n\n2.  **Preserve Key Objects:** The red, blue and other single color cells remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Create Yellow Crosses:** For *each* red cell:\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position above.\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position below.\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position to the left.\n    *   Place a yellow (color 4) cell one position to the right.\n\n4.  **Create Orange Crosses:** For *each* blue cell:\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position above.\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position below.\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position to the left.\n    *   Place an orange (color 7) cell one position to the right.\n\n5. **Fill remaining cells:** keep them as color 0 (white/background)\n\n**Refinement of the Rule:**\n\nThe key refinement from the first example is that the rule applies to *all* instances of red and blue cells, not just a single instance. The azure cell is preserved, acting similar to the red/blue cells, however, no cross is made around it. This shows that the cross creating logic is specific for colors 1 and 2.\n\nThe Python code already correctly handles multiple red and blue cells, so no code change is needed. The find_object method would need modification to find all instances, but since the current implementation is general for all colors it works without modification. The logic in the transform function applies the cross-creation around each found position, achieving the desired effect.\n"
