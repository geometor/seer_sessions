Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program performs a color substitution on a pixel grid. It iterates through each cell of the input grid.
If a cell is yellow (4), it's changed to grey (5). If a cell is red (2) or green (3), it's changed to white (0).
All other colors remain unchanged (although no other colors are present in this example).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified color mapping."""
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid and apply color changes
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Yellow to grey
                output_grid[i, j] = 5
            elif input_grid[i, j] == 2 or input_grid[i, j] == 3:  # Red or Green to white
                output_grid[i, j] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple color substitution rule observed in the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation is more complex. It seems that while yellow is consistently changed to gray, the rule for red/green changing to white may not always hold true. We need to analyze all examples and, if possible, determine a more comprehensive, potentially context-dependent rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine all examples:** Carefully review each input/output pair in the training set to identify consistent patterns and exceptions.
2.  **Object Identification:** Determine if the transformation depends on object properties (size, shape, position) rather than just color.
3.  **Contextual Rules:** Explore the possibility of rules based on the surrounding pixels or the overall structure of the input grid.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to reflect the more complex transformation rule uncovered.
5. Use code execution to generate reports about the examples.

**Metrics and Reports (via code execution):**

Since I don't have direct code execution capabilities, I'll guide the analysis, describing what information should be collected.

*For each input-output pair, collect the following:*

1.  **Dimensions:** Input grid dimensions (height, width). Output grid dimensions (height, width).
2.  **Color Counts (Input):** Count of each color (0-9) in the input grid.
3.  **Color Counts (Output):** Count of each color (0-9) in the output grid.
4.  **Color Changes:** For each color present in the input, list the colors it transforms into in the output. Note any inconsistencies.
5. **Object analysis**: How many objects are present in the input and output?
6. **Error Report**: compare the actual output with the result of running the
   transform function, highlighting the locations and values of the errors.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Yellow Transformation:** All yellow (4) pixels in the input grid are transformed to gray (5) pixels in the output grid.

2.  **Red and Green Preservation:** If there are distinct rectangular regions of Red (2) *and* Green (3) in the input, do *not* change their colors.

3.  **Red and Green Transformation (Conditional):** If either Red (2) or Green (3) are absent, or are not separated, then transform all instances of both of those colors to White (0).

This refined natural language program captures the color changes for yellow pixels in all cases, the exception for preserving Green and Red when present in separate objects, and the default behavior.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
