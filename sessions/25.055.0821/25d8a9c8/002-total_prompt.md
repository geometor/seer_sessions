## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 4
2 3 2
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C7852A6C4C0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C7852A6D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in this case). The colors in the input grid (yellow, red, green) are replaced with different colors in the output grid (grey, white). The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping, where each color in the input is consistently replaced by a specific color in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Each color in the input grid corresponds to a unique color in the output grid.
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cells: pixels with color values
  - action: Color replacement
    details:
      - yellow (4) is replaced with grey (5)
      - red (2) is replaced with white (0)
      - green (3) is replaced with white (0)
  - relationship: One-to-one mapping between input and output colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program performs a color substitution on a pixel grid. It iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is yellow (4), it's changed to grey (5). If a cell is red (2) or green (3), it's changed to white (0).  All other colors remain unchanged (although no other colors are present in this example). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
