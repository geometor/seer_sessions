This forms the primary object.\n\n2.  **Bounding Box (Implicit):** Conceptually, imagine a bounding box around the \"5\" shaped object.\n\n3. **Color Substitution within the bounding box:** The transformation recolors portions of the object of '5'.\n\n4. **Recolor Rule**: The area defined by color 5 is recolored according to the following rule: The bounding box is divided into two parts:\n   + The first part of the shape is the rectangle with the corners in (2,2) and (3,3). And a second shape that are all the rest of the points of color '5'.\n   + The first part is recolored to 8.\n   + The second part is recolored to 2.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation (symbolic):**\n\n1. Find the connected component of color 5.\n2. Consider the coordinates (row, col) = (2,2) and (3,3) of the input. All cells of color 5 in those positions are replaced by color 8 in the output.\n3. The rest of the color 5 cells in the original connected component are all replaced by color 2.\n4. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n"
