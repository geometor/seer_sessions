There are two of each in this case. The azure cell (color 8) does not participate to the transformation.\n\n2.  **Red Cell Transformation:** For *each* red cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to yellow (color 4). Do not change diagonal cells. The red cells themselves remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell Transformation:** For *each* blue cell, change the color of the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it to orange (color 7). Do not change diagonal cells. The blue cells themselves remain unchanged.\n\n4.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other cells, including those of color 8, maintain their original color.\n\n**Explanation of the Reasoning**\n\nThis transformation builds upon the logic observed in the first example. The key difference is that it now applies the \"aura\" effect to *multiple* instances of the red and blue cells. The transformation is applied independently to each instance of the red and blue colors. The azure cell is a distractor, as it does not affect the transformation.  The rule is consistent with the previous one, just extended to work with multiple trigger objects (of colors 1 and 2).\n\n"
