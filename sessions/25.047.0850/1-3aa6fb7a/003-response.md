Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Three separate azure blue objects: a 1x2 rectangle, a 2x1 rectangle, and a 1x1 square, and a 1x2 rectangle rotated by -45 degrees."
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: "Same as input."
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three blue 1x1 squares."
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains four azure (color 8) objects of various shapes and sizes.

2.  **Preserve Azure:** The azure colored objects from the input grid remain unchanged in the output.

3.  **Introduce Blue:** The transformation rule is:
    *   Find the azure object and consider the top-left most pixel.
    *   Paint with blue (color 1) the pixel to the left of the top-left most azure.

**Elaborated explanation of the transformation**:

The azure objects are copied from input to output. For each azure object, a single blue pixel is introduced. This blue pixel is located immediately to the *left* of what we consider the top-left corner of each distinct azure object.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is: Find the cell immediately to the left of the top-left corner cell of each azure object. Change the color of that cell to blue (color 1).
