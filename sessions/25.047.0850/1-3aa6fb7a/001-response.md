Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure blue rectangles"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure blue rectangles"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two blue 1x1 squares."
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, there are two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical 2x1 rectangle on the left, and the other is an horizontal 1x2 rectangle on the right.

2.  **Preserve Azure:** The azure (color 8) objects from the input are not modified and they are present in the output grid in exactly the same locations and shapes.

3.  **Introduce Blue:** The transformation rule is: Find the cell immediately to the right of the top-left corner cell of each azure object. Change the color of that cell to blue (color 1).

**Elaborated explanation of the transformation**:

The azure objects are maintained. Blue squares appear on the right of each of the top-left corners of the two azure objects.
