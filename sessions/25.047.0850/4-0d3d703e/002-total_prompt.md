Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left column
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: middle column
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right column
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color substitution, incrementing each color value by one.

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of vertical lines of single colors in each column.
2.  **Color Mapping:** The transformation involves adding +1 to the color of each cell value in the grid:
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (2).
    *    Red (2) becomes Magenta (3).
3.  **Apply Transformation:** For each cell in the input grid, increment its value to produce the output grid.

This is equivalent to applying this function: `output_color = input_color + 1`.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [3, 1, 2],
        [3, 1, 2],
        [3, 1, 2]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [4, 5, 6],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [4, 5, 6]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
