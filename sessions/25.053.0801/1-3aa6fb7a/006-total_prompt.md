Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track, focusing on azure (8) pixels and their right-hand neighbors. However, the code incorrectly added blue (1) pixels *after* any azure pixel that wasn't followed by another azure pixel. The examples reveal a more specific rule: a blue pixel is placed to the *left* of a *sequence* of azure pixels, but only if the azure sequence is at the edge of the grid or is next to a 0, and the blue pixel replaces a 0. The original code also incorrectly appended a blue pixel in cases where the sequence of azure was not adjancent to zero or an edge.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs, not just the first one, to identify the *complete* rule.
2.  **Refine the rule:** Revise the natural language program to accurately describe the placement of the blue pixel *before* a sequence of azure pixels, not after isolated azure pixels.
3.  **Consider edge cases:** Specifically address how the rule applies at the edges of the grid, since this seems to be part of the logic.
4.  **Update the logic:** Adjust from an "append" to a "prepend and only if adjacent to a 0 or an edge" strategy.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on azure pixel sequences and their context:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 8 0 0 0 0 0
    0 8 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 8 1 0 0 0 0
    0 8 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0
    0 0 0 0 1 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

*    Analysis
    *   Row 2: `0 8 0` becomes `0 8 0`. The program should insert `1` to the *left* of the 8 if there is a zero to replace
    *   Row 3: `0 8 8 0` remains unchanged. The 8s are adjacent, and no insertion is needed.
    *   Row 4: `0 0 0 0 8 8 0`. remains unchanged.
    *  Row 5: `0 0 0 0 0 8 0`. The program should insert `1` to the *left* of the 8.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0
    0 0 0 0 0 8 0
    0 0 8 0 0 0 0
    0 0 8 8 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 8 0 0
    0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 8 8 0
    0 0 0 0 1 8 0
    0 0 8 1 0 0 0
    0 0 8 8 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 1 8 0 0
    0 0 0 8 8 0 0
    ```

*    Analysis
    *   Row 1:  `0 0 0 0 8 8 0` - no change.
    *   Row 2: `0 0 0 0 0 8 0` becomes `0 0 0 0 1 8 0`.  Blue is inserted to the *left* of the azure, replacing a zero.
    *   Row 3: `0 0 8 0 0 0 0` becomes `0 0 8 1 0 0 0` - incorrect - should insert to the left.
    *  Row 4 and 7, no change
    *  Row 6, `0 0 0 0 8 0 0`, The program should insert `1` to the *left* of the 8.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    type: pixel_sequence
    properties:
      length: variable  # Length of the contiguous sequence of azure pixels
      left_neighbor: [0, other]  # The color of the pixel immediately to the left (0 or edge)
      right_neighbor: [any] # The color to the right (any color is possible)

actions:
  - name: insert_blue
    condition: "object.left_neighbor == 0" #if sequence is next to a 0
    preposition: "before"
    target: object #target is a "sequence" not a single pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      relative_position: "replaces left_neighbor"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Sequences:** Find all contiguous horizontal sequences of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Check Left Neighbor:** For each azure sequence, examine the pixel immediately to its left.
3.  **Conditional Insertion:** If the left neighbor is a 0, replace that 0 with a blue (1) pixel. If at the left edge, do not insert anything.
4. **All Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not azure, or a zero to the left of an azure sequence, remain unchanged.

This revised natural language program accounts for the "prepending" behavior and the edge-case/zero-adjacent condition observed in the examples. It also clarifies that the operation acts on *sequences* of azure pixels, not individual azure pixels in isolation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
