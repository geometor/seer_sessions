            "text": "Okay, here's my assessment of the provided input-output example and a plan for determining the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe input and output grids are 7x7. The primary change appears to be the introduction of azure (color code `1`) pixels in the output. These azure pixels seem to be related to the positioning of the original azure (color code `8`) pixels. The task likely involves identifying a pattern or rule governing the placement of the new azure pixels based on the existing azure pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identify the azure (8) pixels as the primary objects of interest in the input grid.\n2.  **Property Analysis:** Analyze properties like position (row, column) and adjacency of the azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** Determine the spatial relationship between the original azure (8) pixels and the newly introduced azure (1) pixels. For example, are the new pixels placed adjacent to, diagonally from, or at a specific offset from the original pixels?\n4.  **Natural Language Program:** Formulate a clear, concise natural language program describing this rule.\n5. **YAML Fact documentation:** Create a YAML file that documents properties of objects and actions, so that the python implementation will be easier to write.\n\n**Metrics & Reports (using `tool_code`):**\n\nFirst I want to develop a representation of the input and output as 2d arrays.\nThen I want to obtain the coordinates of the `8` pixels and the `1` pixels\n\n"
