Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid with the value '8'.

2.  **Check neighbors and Find a pattern:**
    *   The output value '1' appears when the input value is '8' and is vertically or horizontally adjacent to at most one other '8'.

3.  **Apply the change based on the context:**
    - If an '8' pixel is next to at most one other '8', change the pixel color value from 8 to 1.
    - If the '8' pixel matches more than one another '8', then keep value as 8.
    - Keep the '0' in the same places.

**In summary:** The transformation identifies '8' pixels, examines the number of immediate adjacent neighbor with '8', and those that are "alone" or has one neighbor changes that to '1' in the output grid. Other pixels remain unchanged.

Okay, I understand the transformation rule and the instructions for generating the Python code. Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the resulting code:

**Thought Process:**

1.  **Understanding the Rule:** The core of the transformation is identifying '8' pixels and changing to '1' when they are "alone" or have one neighbor. All other pixels ('0' pixels in this case) should remain unchanged.

2.  **Implementation Strategy:**
    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    *   For each cell, check if its value is '8'.
    *   If it's an '8', count its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also '8'.
    *   If the neighbor count of '8' is less than or equal to 1, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to '1'. Otherwise, keep it as '8'
    *   If it is not '8', copy original to output

3.  **Code Structure:**
    *   The `transform` function will encapsulate the core logic.
    *   The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block will handle testing and validation.

**Python Code:**

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the value '8'.

2.  **Neighbor Analysis:** For each '8' pixel:
    *   Count the number of immediately adjacent (horizontal and vertical) neighbors that are also '8'.

3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If an '8' pixel has *exactly one* adjacent '8' neighbor, change its value to '1' in the output grid.
    *   If the '8' has zero or more than one '8' neighbor it remains '8'.
    *    All '0' pixels remain unchanged.

**Key Differences from Previous Example:**

The critical difference is the condition for changing '8' to '1'. In the first example the condition was less than or equal to one neighbor. Now it is only when the '8' pixels have *exactly one* neighbor.

**Python Code:**

```python
"""

```

The code is almost identical to the previous one, except for the crucial change in the `if` condition within the nested loops. Now, `output_grid[r][c] = 1` only happens when `neighbors_8 == 1`. This accurately reflects the "exactly one neighbor" rule. The rest of the code (initialization, neighbor counting, and copying other values) remains the same. The testing framework is also preserved.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [

    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
