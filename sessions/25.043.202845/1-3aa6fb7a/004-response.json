This is crucial because we only modify '3's under a specific condition; all other pixels remain the same.\n2.  **Neighbor Checking:** The code uses nested loops to check all eight neighbors.  The `0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols` part is important for handling edge cases; prevents going out of bounds.\n3.  `surrounded` Flag: Using boolean flag `surrounded` to control the logic. It starts as `True`, and gets set to `False` if *any* neighbor isn't a '1'.\n4.  **Deep Copy:** Using `output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]` will create a copy, to keep original `input_grid` values.\n"
