            "text": "Okay, I understand the transformation rule and the instructions for generating the Python code. Here's a breakdown of my thought process and the resulting code:\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Rule:** The core of the transformation is identifying '8' pixels and changing to '1' when they are \"alone\" or have one neighbor. All other pixels ('0' pixels in this case) should remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Implementation Strategy:**\n    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    *   For each cell, check if its value is '8'.\n    *   If it's an '8', count its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors (up, down, left, right) that are also '8'.\n    *   If the neighbor count of '8' is less than or equal to 1, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to '1'. Otherwise, keep it as '8'\n    *   If it is not '8', copy original to output\n\n3.  **Code Structure:**\n    *   The `transform` function will encapsulate the core logic.\n    *   The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block will handle testing and validation.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n"
