            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Each input is a 10x10 grid. Most cells are white (0), with a few scattered non-white pixels (colors 1-9). The positions and colors of these non-white pixels vary between examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Each output is a fixed-size 3x3 grid. It contains some or all of the non-white colors found in the corresponding input grid, potentially rearranged. The output grid can also contain white pixels (0) if the number of non-white pixels in the input is less than 9.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core task seems to be selecting the non-white pixels from the input, potentially reordering them based on their original positions, and then placing them into the smaller 3x3 output grid according to a specific filling pattern.\n4.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the order of non-white pixels collected from the input (using different scanning methods) with their order in the output reveals a pattern. Collecting the colors by scanning columns first (left-to-right, then top-to-bottom) and then performing a specific swap operation on the collected sequence before placing them into the output grid seems to match the examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through the columns of the 10x10 input grid from left to right (column index 0 to 9).\n3.  Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom (row index 0 to 9).\n4.  If the pixel at the current `[row, column]` is not white (value is not 0), append its color value to the `collected_colors` list.\n5.  After scanning the entire input grid, check the number of colors in the `collected_colors` list. If the list contains 6 or more colors, swap the color at index 3 with the color at index 5.\n6.  Create a new 3x3 grid and fill it entirely with the white color (0).\n7.  Initialize a counter `color_index` to 0.\n8.  Iterate through the rows of the 3x3 output grid from top to bottom (row index 0 to 2).\n9.  Within each row, iterate through the columns from left to right (column index 0 to 2).\n10. If `color_index` is less than the total number of colors in the `collected_colors` list, set the value of the output grid cell at the current `[row, column]` to the color found at `collected_colors[color_index]`, and increment `color_index`. Otherwise, leave the cell as white (0).\n11. The final 3x3 grid is the result."
