Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid:** Each input is a 10x10 grid. Most cells are white (0), with a few scattered non-white pixels (colors 1-9). The positions and colors of these non-white pixels vary between examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** Each output is a fixed-size 3x3 grid. It contains some or all of the non-white colors found in the corresponding input grid, potentially rearranged. The output grid can also contain white pixels (0) if the number of non-white pixels in the input is less than 9.
3.  **Transformation:** The core task seems to be selecting the non-white pixels from the input, potentially reordering them based on their original positions, and then placing them into the smaller 3x3 output grid according to a specific filling pattern.
4.  **Key Observation:** Comparing the order of non-white pixels collected from the input (using different scanning methods) with their order in the output reveals a pattern. Collecting the colors by scanning columns first (left-to-right, then top-to-bottom) and then performing a specific swap operation on the collected sequence before placing them into the output grid seems to match the examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size_input: [10, 10]
  grid_size_output: [3, 3]
  background_color: 0 # white

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (1-9)
      position: [row, column]
    relationship: Scattered across the input grid against a white background.

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: non-white pixels
    details: Locate all pixels in the input grid with color values from 1 to 9.
  - action: collect
    target: identified non-white pixel colors
    order: Column-major (scan columns left-to-right, then rows top-to-bottom within each column). Store colors in a sequence.
  - action: conditional_swap
    target: collected sequence
    condition: If the sequence length is 6 or more.
    details: Swap the element at index 3 with the element at index 5 in the sequence.
  - action: create_grid
    target: output grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      initial_value: 0 # white
  - action: populate
    source: the (potentially swapped) sequence of colors
    target: the 3x3 output grid
    order: Row-major (fill rows top-to-bottom, then columns left-to-right within each row).
    details: Fill cells sequentially using colors from the sequence. Stop when the sequence is exhausted or the grid is full. Any remaining cells stay white.

relationships:
  - input_output: The colors in the output grid are derived exclusively from the non-white colors in the input grid.
  - order_transformation: The order of colors in the output grid depends on the column-major collection order from the input, followed by a specific conditional swap (indices 3 and 5), and then placement in row-major order into the 3x3 output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `collected_colors`.
2.  Iterate through the columns of the 10x10 input grid from left to right (column index 0 to 9).
3.  Within each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom (row index 0 to 9).
4.  If the pixel at the current `[row, column]` is not white (value is not 0), append its color value to the `collected_colors` list.
5.  After scanning the entire input grid, check the number of colors in the `collected_colors` list. If the list contains 6 or more colors, swap the color at index 3 with the color at index 5.
6.  Create a new 3x3 grid and fill it entirely with the white color (0).
7.  Initialize a counter `color_index` to 0.
8.  Iterate through the rows of the 3x3 output grid from top to bottom (row index 0 to 2).
9.  Within each row, iterate through the columns from left to right (column index 0 to 2).
10. If `color_index` is less than the total number of colors in the `collected_colors` list, set the value of the output grid cell at the current `[row, column]` to the color found at `collected_colors[color_index]`, and increment `color_index`. Otherwise, leave the cell as white (0).
11. The final 3x3 grid is the result.
