"""
Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
Identify all non-white pixels (value > 0) in the input grid, called "seed pixels".
For each seed pixel located at (seed_row, seed_col) with color C:
  Iterate through all row indices r from seed_row + 1 down to the last row index of the grid.
  If the row index r is odd:
    If the column seed_col - 1 is within the grid's width boundaries, set the pixel at (r, seed_col - 1) in the output grid to color C.
    If the column seed_col + 1 is within the grid's width boundaries, set the pixel at (r, seed_col + 1) in the output grid to color C.
  If the row index r is even:
    Set the pixel at (r, seed_col) in the output grid to color C (boundary check is implicit as seed_col is valid).
The final modified grid is the result.
