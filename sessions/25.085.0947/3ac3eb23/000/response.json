The rest of the grid is white (0).\n    *   The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input.\n    *   Additional non-white pixels appear in the output grid in the rows below the original non-white pixels.\n    *   The pattern of new pixels depends on the column of the original pixel and the row number.\n    *   For a non-white pixel at `(0, c)` with color `C`, new pixels of color `C` are added in subsequent rows `r > 0`.\n    *   If row `r` is odd, pixels are added at `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)`.\n    *   If row `r` is even, a pixel is added at `(r, c)`.\n    *   This pattern continues down to the bottom of the grid.\n    *   Each initial non-white pixel generates its own independent pattern.\n    *   The generation respects grid boundaries; pixels are only placed if the coordinates are valid.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
