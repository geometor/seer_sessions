**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Each example pair consists of an input grid and a smaller output grid. The input grids are 8x8, while the output grids are 3x6.
2.  **Content**: The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and a single "object" composed of non-white pixels (red 2, azure 8, or blue 1). The output grids contain only the non-white color from the input object and white pixels (0).
3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The non-white object within the input grid seems to be the focus. The output grid appears to be constructed based on this object.
4.  **Bounding Box**: Observing the coordinates of the non-white pixels in each input reveals that they fit within a 3x3 bounding box.
    *   Example 1: Red pixels span rows 5-7 and columns 2-4.
    *   Example 2: Azure pixels span rows 1-3 and columns 1-3.
    *   Example 3: Blue pixels span rows 1-3 and columns 4-6.
5.  **Output Construction**: When the 3x3 bounding box containing the object (including any background pixels within that box) is extracted from the input, the output grid is formed by placing this 3x3 extracted grid side-by-side with a copy of itself. The resulting grid dimensions are 3 rows and 3+3=6 columns, matching the output grid dimensions.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that have a color different from white (0).
2.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_r`), maximum row index (`max_r`), minimum column index (`min_c`), and maximum column index (`max_c`) among these non-white pixels. This defines the bounding box of the object.
3.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid starting at `min_r`, ending at `max_r` (inclusive), starting at `min_c`, and ending at `max_c` (inclusive). Let this be the `extracted_grid`.
4.  Create the output grid by placing the `extracted_grid` side-by-side with an identical copy of itself. The resulting output grid will have the same number of rows as the `extracted_grid` and twice the number of columns.
