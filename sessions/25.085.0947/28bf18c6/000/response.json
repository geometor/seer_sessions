The input grids are 8x8, while the output grids are 3x6.\n2.  **Content**: The input grids contain a background of white pixels (0) and a single \"object\" composed of non-white pixels (red 2, azure 8, or blue 1). The output grids contain only the non-white color from the input object and white pixels (0).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The non-white object within the input grid seems to be the focus. The output grid appears to be constructed based on this object.\n4.  **Bounding Box**: Observing the coordinates of the non-white pixels in each input reveals that they fit within a 3x3 bounding box.\n    *   Example 1: Red pixels span rows 5-7 and columns 2-4.\n    *   Example 2: Azure pixels span rows 1-3 and columns 1-3.\n    *   Example 3: Blue pixels span rows 1-3 and columns 4-6.\n5.  **Output Construction**: When the 3x3 bounding box containing the object (including any background pixels within that box) is extracted from the input, the output grid is formed by placing this 3x3 extracted grid side-by-side with a copy of itself. The resulting grid dimensions are 3 rows and 3+3=6 columns, matching the output grid dimensions.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
