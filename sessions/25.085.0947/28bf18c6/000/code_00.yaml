task_description: Extracts the minimal bounding box around the non-background object and duplicates it horizontally to form the output.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - element: background_pixel
    value: 0 (white)
    description: The predominant pixel color in the input grid, ignored during object identification.
  - element: object
    description: A set of contiguous or non-contiguous pixels with the same non-background color. In this task, there is only one such object per input.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the object's pixels (non-zero).
      - pixels: The coordinates of the object's pixels.
  - element: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels belonging to the object.
    properties:
      - top_row: The minimum row index of the object's pixels.
      - bottom_row: The maximum row index of the object's pixels.
      - left_col: The minimum column index of the object's pixels.
      - right_col: The maximum column index of the object's pixels.
      - content: The subgrid extracted from the input using the bounding box coordinates.

actions:
  - action: identify_object_pixels
    description: Find all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (0).
  - action: determine_bounding_box
    description: Calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices encompassing all identified object pixels.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Create a new grid containing the pixels from the input grid within the determined bounding box.
  - action: duplicate_horizontally
    description: Concatenate the extracted subgrid with a copy of itself along the column axis.

relationships:
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting the object's bounding box content and duplicating it horizontally.
    rule: Output = HorizontalConcatenate(BoundingBoxContent, BoundingBoxContent)
