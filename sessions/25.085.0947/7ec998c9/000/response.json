The output grid retains the original marker pixel and the background color in most positions. However, a path-like structure of blue pixels (color 1) is introduced. This path seems to originate from the top-left corner, follow the top edge to the marker's column, descend along that column (skipping the marker pixel itself), reach the bottom edge, and then proceed along the bottom edge either leftwards to the first column or rightwards to the last column. The direction taken along the bottom edge appears dependent on the marker's horizontal position relative to the grid's center.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Check if the marker column `marker_col` is strictly less than half the grid width (`width / 2`).\n        ii. If it is (marker is in the left half), then for each column `c` from `marker_col` up to `width - 1`, if the pixel at `(height - 1, c)` has the background color, change it to blue.\n        iii.
