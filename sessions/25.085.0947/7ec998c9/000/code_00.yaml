task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels with dimensions between 1x1 and 30x30.
    properties:
      - dominant_color: The color appearing in most cells (background_color).
      - unique_pixel: One cell contains a color different from the dominant_color (marker_pixel).
        properties:
          - color: marker_color
          - position: (marker_row, marker_col)
      - dimensions: (height, width)

  - item: output_grid
    description: A 2D grid, same dimensions as the input_grid.
    properties:
      - background_color: Same as the input_grid's dominant_color.
      - marker_pixel: Unchanged from the input_grid (same color and position).
      - blue_path: A set of pixels changed to blue (color 1). These pixels were originally background_color pixels in the input_grid.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: Pixels along a specific path defined by the marker_pixel's position are changed from background_color to blue.
    details:
      - step_1: Identify background_color (most frequent color in input).
      - step_2: Identify marker_pixel (the unique non-background pixel) and its position (marker_row, marker_col).
      - step_3: Determine the path segments:
          - Segment 1 (Top Row): From (0, 0) to (0, marker_col).
          - Segment 2 (Marker Column): From (0, marker_col) to (height - 1, marker_col), excluding (marker_row, marker_col).
          - Segment 3 (Bottom Row): Direction depends on marker_col relative to grid width.
            - If marker_col < width / 2: Path runs from (height - 1, marker_col) to (height - 1, width - 1).
            - If marker_col >= width / 2: Path runs from (height - 1, 0) to (height - 1, marker_col).
      - step_4: Change the color of all background_color pixels located on these path segments to blue (1). Keep the marker_pixel and other background_color pixels unchanged.
