The path starts at the top-left corner (0,0), goes right along the top edge to the marker's column, then down that column (skipping the marker pixel itself), and finally along the bottom edge. The direction along the bottom edge depends on the grid width and the marker's column position: if the width is odd and the marker is exactly in the center column (width // 2), the path goes left from column 0 to the marker's column; otherwise, it goes right from the marker's column to the right edge.
