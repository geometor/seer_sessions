- task_description: "Draw a blue path on the background, starting and ending points determined by a unique marker pixel."
- grid_properties:
    - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
    - output_grid: Same dimensions as input, modified by the path.
    - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
    - marker_pixel: The single pixel with a color different from the background color.
    - marker_position: (marker_row, marker_col) coordinates of the marker pixel.
    - path_color: blue (1).
- path_segments:
    - segment_1: Horizontal path on the top row (row 0).
    - segment_2: Vertical path on the marker's column (marker_col), excluding the marker pixel itself.
    - segment_3: Horizontal path on the bottom row (row height-1).
- conditional_logic:
    - condition: Check if grid width is odd AND the marker_col is exactly the center column index (width // 2).
    - if_condition_true: # Example 2
        - segment_1_direction: Starts at marker_col, goes right to the last column (width - 1).
        - segment_3_direction: Starts at the first column (0), goes right to marker_col.
    - if_condition_false: # Examples 1 and 3
        - segment_1_direction: Starts at the first column (0), goes right to marker_col.
        - segment_3_direction: Starts at marker_col, goes right to the last column (width - 1).
- constraints:
    - Path only overwrites pixels that originally had the background_color.
    - The marker pixel itself is never overwritten by the path.
