"""
Transforms the input grid by drawing a blue path (color 1) based on a unique marker pixel. The path starts at the top-left corner (0,0), goes right along the top edge to the marker's column, then down that column (skipping the marker pixel itself), and finally along the bottom edge. The direction along the bottom edge depends on the grid width and the marker's column position: if the width is odd and the marker is exactly in the center column (width // 2), the path goes left from column 0 to the marker's column; otherwise, it goes right from the marker's column to the right edge. Only pixels matching the background color (most frequent color) are changed to blue.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code successfully transforms the input grids for Example 1 and Example 3, indicating that the core logic for identifying the background and marker, as well as the general path-drawing concept (top row, marker column, bottom row), is largely correct. However, the code fails on Example 2, specifically producing an incorrect pattern on the top row. The comparison shows the transformed top row is `1 1 1 7 7` while the expected is `7 7 1 1 1`. This suggests the rule determining the start and end points of the path segments (particularly the top row) needs refinement based on the specific properties of the grid and marker position observed in Example 2.

**Strategy:**

1.  Analyze the properties (dimensions, marker position) of Example 2 compared to Examples 1 and 3.
2.  Identify the specific condition in Example 2 (likely related to grid width being odd and the marker being in the exact center column) that triggers a different path behavior on the top row.
3.  Update the path-drawing logic for the top row segment to incorporate this condition, mirroring the existing conditional logic for the bottom row.
4.  Refine the natural language program to accurately describe the complete, conditional transformation rule.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the background color, which is the most frequent color in the input grid. If white (0) is present but not the only color, prioritize the most frequent non-white color as the background.
2.  Locate the unique marker pixel, which is the single pixel whose color differs from the identified background color. Record its row (`marker_row`) and column (`marker_col`).
3.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
4.  Determine if a special condition is met: the grid's width is odd AND the `marker_col` is equal to the integer division of the width by 2 (`width // 2`).
5.  Draw the blue path (color 1) in three segments, only changing pixels in the output grid that currently match the background color:
    *   **Segment 1 (Top Row):**
        *   If the special condition (Step 4) is TRUE: Draw horizontally from column `marker_col` to the rightmost column (`width - 1`) along the top row (row 0).
        *   If the special condition is FALSE: Draw horizontally from the leftmost column (0) to column `marker_col` along the top row (row 0).
    *   **Segment 2 (Marker Column):** Draw vertically from the top row (row 0) to the bottom row (`height - 1`) along column `marker_col`, skipping the pixel at the `marker_position` (`marker_row`, `marker_col`).
    *   **Segment 3 (Bottom Row):**
        *   If the special condition (Step 4) is TRUE: Draw horizontally from the leftmost column (0) to column `marker_col` along the bottom row (`height - 1`).
        *   If the special condition is FALSE: Draw horizontally from column `marker_col` to the rightmost column (`width - 1`) along the bottom row (`height - 1`).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
