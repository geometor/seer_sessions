task_description: Draws a blue path connecting the top-left corner, the marker column, and one side of the bottom row, based on a unique marker pixel.

objects:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with varying dimensions and colors. Contains a background and a single marker pixel.
    properties:
      height: Integer row count.
      width: Integer column count.
      pixels: Each pixel has a color (0-9).
      background_color: The most frequent color in the grid. Determined by counting pixel occurrences.
      marker_pixel:
        description: The single pixel whose color is different from the background color.
        properties:
          position: (row, column) coordinates.
          color: The color value of the marker pixel.
  - object: path
    description: A sequence of blue (color 1) pixels drawn onto the grid.
    properties:
      color: Always blue (1).
      segments:
        - segment: top_horizontal
          description: Runs along the top row (row 0) from the left edge (column 0) up to and including the marker_pixel's column.
        - segment: vertical
          description: Runs along the marker_pixel's column from the top row (row 0) to the bottom row (row height-1). The marker_pixel itself is *not* changed to blue.
        - segment: bottom_horizontal
          description: Runs along the bottom row (row height-1). Its direction depends on grid width and marker position.
          direction_rule:
            - condition: Grid width is odd AND marker_pixel's column is exactly the center column (width // 2).
              action: Draw path from the left edge (column 0) up to and including the marker_pixel's column.
            - condition: Otherwise (grid width is even OR marker_pixel is not in the exact center column of an odd-width grid).
              action: Draw path from the marker_pixel's column up to and including the right edge (column width-1).
      overwrite_rule: Only pixels matching the original background_color are changed to blue. The marker_pixel is never changed.

actions:
  - action: find_background_color
    input: input_grid
    output: background_color
    method: Find the most frequent pixel color value in the grid.
  - action: find_marker_pixel
    input: input_grid, background_color
    output: marker_position (row, col), marker_color
    method: Iterate through the grid to find the single pixel whose color does not match the background_color.
  - action: initialize_output
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    method: Create a copy of the input_grid.
  - action: draw_path
    input: output_grid, background_color, marker_position, path_color (blue=1)
    output: Modified output_grid
    steps:
      - Draw top_horizontal segment.
      - Draw vertical segment (skipping marker_position).
      - Determine bottom_horizontal direction based on width and marker_position column.
      - Draw bottom_horizontal segment based on determined direction.
    constraint: Only change pixels if their current color matches background_color.
