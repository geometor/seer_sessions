            "text": "The metrics confirm Hypothesis v4. The code failed on Examples 2 and 3 because its logic for the bottom row path direction was incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The code incorrectly chose \"Right\" when \"Left\" was needed (marker centered on odd width).\n*   **Example 3:** The code incorrectly chose \"Left\" when \"Right\" was needed (marker not centered on odd width).\n\nThe analysis script correctly identified the expected directions and the directions produced by the flawed code, matching the hypothesis.\n\nFinalizing the YAML and NL program based on Hypothesis v4.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully transforms the first example but fails on the second and third. The core logic identifies the background color and the unique marker pixel correctly. The path drawing logic is also correct for the top row segment and the vertical segment along the marker's column.\n\nThe discrepancy arises in the logic for drawing the path segment along the **bottom row**. The initial code used a simple comparison (`marker_col < width / 2`) which worked for Example 1 but failed for Examples 2 and 3, producing paths in the wrong direction along the bottom edge.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is to refine the condition that determines the direction of the path along the bottom row, considering the grid width (odd/even) and the marker's column position relative to the exact center.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using code execution to confirm observations:\n\n"

The expected path goes left (`0` to `marker_col`), but the code drew right (`marker_col` to end).\n    *   In Example 3, the grid width is odd (7) but the marker is *not* centered (column 4, center is 3). The expected path goes right (`marker_col` to end), but the code drew left (`0` to `marker_col`).\n    *   In Example 1, the grid width is even (8), the marker is not centered, and the expected/transformed path goes right (`marker_col` to end).\n3.  **Refined Rule:** The correct rule for the bottom path direction appears to be: Draw left (`0` to `marker_col`) *only if* the grid width is odd AND the marker column is exactly the center column (`width // 2`). Otherwise, draw right (`marker_col` to `width - 1`).\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
