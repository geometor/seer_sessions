            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size Transformation:** The most immediate observation is the change in grid dimensions. The input grids are consistently 3x3, while the output grids are always 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.\n2.  **Input Grid Replication:** The output grid is not just a scaled-up version but contains multiple copies (or partial copies) of the original input grid placed within the larger 9x9 structure.\n3.  **Conditional Placement:** The placement of these input grid copies within the output grid is not arbitrary. It seems to depend on the *content* of the input grid itself.\n4.  **Background Color:** The areas in the output grid that are *not* filled with copies of the input grid are consistently 'white' (value 0).\n5.  **Positional Mapping:** If we conceptually divide the 9x9 output grid into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 sub-regions (slots), the placement of the input grid copies seems to correspond to the positions of specific colored pixels within the original 3x3 input grid.\n6.  **Key Color:** Examining the examples reveals a pattern: A copy of the input grid appears in a specific 3x3 slot within the 9x9 output grid *if and only if* the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 input grid is 'red' (value 2).\n    *   In `train_1`, red pixels are at (0,2) and (2,0). Copies appear in the top-right (0,2) and bottom-left (2,0) slots of the output.\n    *   In `train_2`, the red pixel is at (1,0). A copy appears in the middle-left (1,0) slot of the output.\n    *   In `train_3`, red pixels are at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (2,0). Copies appear in the top-left (0,0), top-right (0,2), center (1,1), and bottom-left (2,0) slots of the output.\n7.  **Other Colors:** Pixels with colors other than red (like blue=1 or white=0) in the input grid do not seem to trigger the placement of a copy in the corresponding output slot.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
