task_description: Add markers below U-shaped objects.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    identifier: U_shape
    properties:
      structure:
        - A horizontal segment of 3 pixels of the same color.
        - Two vertical segments of 1 pixel each, extending downwards from the ends of the horizontal segment, using the same color.
      color: variable (e.g., green(3), magenta(6), azure(8))
      location: variable within the grid
  - type: marker
    identifier: position_marker
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      location:
        row: bottom-most row of the grid
        column: aligned with the center column of the horizontal segment of a U_shape
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: all U_shapes in the input grid
  - action: for_each
    target: identified U_shape
    sub_actions:
      - action: determine
        property: center column index of the U_shape's horizontal segment
      - action: place
        element: position_marker (yellow pixel)
        location:
          row: last row index of the grid
          column: determined center column index
relationships:
  - Each U_shape in the input corresponds to exactly one yellow position_marker in the output.
  - The column position of the yellow marker is directly determined by the column position of the center of its corresponding U_shape.
  - The row position of the yellow marker is always the last row of the grid, regardless of the U_shape's vertical position.
