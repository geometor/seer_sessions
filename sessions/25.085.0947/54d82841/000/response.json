These shapes resemble the letter 'U'.\n2.  **'U' Shapes:** These shapes consist of a horizontal bar of three pixels of the same color, with single pixels of the same color extending downwards from the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the bar. The color of the 'U' shape varies between examples (green, magenta, azure).\n3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, with the addition of one or more yellow pixels.\n4.  **Added Yellow Pixels:** For each 'U' shape present in the input, a single yellow pixel is added in the output.\n5.  **Position of Yellow Pixels:** The added yellow pixels are always located in the bottom-most row of the grid. Their horizontal position (column index) aligns perfectly with the center pixel of the horizontal bar of the corresponding 'U' shape above it.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
