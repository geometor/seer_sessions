Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids contain one or more distinct shapes made of non-white pixels on a white background. These shapes resemble the letter 'U'.
2.  **'U' Shapes:** These shapes consist of a horizontal bar of three pixels of the same color, with single pixels of the same color extending downwards from the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the bar. The color of the 'U' shape varies between examples (green, magenta, azure).
3.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, with the addition of one or more yellow pixels.
4.  **Added Yellow Pixels:** For each 'U' shape present in the input, a single yellow pixel is added in the output.
5.  **Position of Yellow Pixels:** The added yellow pixels are always located in the bottom-most row of the grid. Their horizontal position (column index) aligns perfectly with the center pixel of the horizontal bar of the corresponding 'U' shape above it.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Add markers below U-shaped objects.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    identifier: U_shape
    properties:
      structure:
        - A horizontal segment of 3 pixels of the same color.
        - Two vertical segments of 1 pixel each, extending downwards from the ends of the horizontal segment, using the same color.
      color: variable (e.g., green(3), magenta(6), azure(8))
      location: variable within the grid
  - type: marker
    identifier: position_marker
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      location:
        row: bottom-most row of the grid
        column: aligned with the center column of the horizontal segment of a U_shape
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: all U_shapes in the input grid
  - action: for_each
    target: identified U_shape
    sub_actions:
      - action: determine
        property: center column index of the U_shape's horizontal segment
      - action: place
        element: position_marker (yellow pixel)
        location:
          row: last row index of the grid
          column: determined center column index
relationships:
  - Each U_shape in the input corresponds to exactly one yellow position_marker in the output.
  - The column position of the yellow marker is directly determined by the column position of the center of its corresponding U_shape.
  - The row position of the yellow marker is always the last row of the grid, regardless of the U_shape's vertical position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct 'U' shapes. A 'U' shape is defined as a 3-pixel wide horizontal segment connected at its ends to two 1-pixel vertical segments extending downwards, all composed of the same non-white color.
2.  For each identified 'U' shape:
    a.  Determine the column index of the middle pixel of its 3-pixel horizontal segment.
    b.  Determine the index of the last row of the grid.
    c.  Place a yellow (4) pixel in the output grid at the position defined by the last row index and the determined column index.
3.  Ensure all other pixels from the input grid are copied unchanged to the output grid.
