task_description: Duplicate the input grid horizontally.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: 2D grid of pixels
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      content: Pixel data arranged in H rows and W columns.
  - element: output_grid
    type: 2D grid of pixels
    properties:
      height: H (same as input_grid)
      width: W * 2 (double the input_grid width)
      content: Derived from input_grid.

transformation:
  action: Horizontal Concatenation
  input: input_grid
  output: output_grid
  rule: The output_grid is formed by placing two copies of the input_grid side-by-side horizontally.
  details:
    - For each row 'r' from 0 to H-1:
      - The pixels in the output_grid from column 0 to W-1 are identical to the pixels in the corresponding row 'r' of the input_grid.
      - The pixels in the output_grid from column W to (2*W)-1 are also identical to the pixels in the corresponding row 'r' of the input_grid.
    - Equivalently: `output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c % W]` for all `r` and `c`.

relationships:
  - Output height is equal to input height.
  - Output width is double the input width.
  - The left half of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
  - The right half of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
