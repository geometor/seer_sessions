Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both inputs and outputs are 2D grids of pixels represented by integers (colors).
2.  **Grid Dimensions:** The examples show that the output grid always maintains the same height as the input grid but has exactly double the width.
    *   Example 1: Input 5x7 -> Output 5x14
    *   Example 2: Input 5x6 -> Output 5x12
    *   Example 3: Input 5x8 -> Output 5x16
3.  **Content Transformation:** The content of the input grid appears to be duplicated horizontally to form the output grid. The entire input grid pattern is placed side-by-side with a copy of itself.
4.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels often form horizontal patterns or rows of patterns. The transformation applies to the entire grid structure, including the white background pixels.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Duplicate the input grid horizontally.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: 2D grid of pixels
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      content: Pixel data arranged in H rows and W columns.
  - element: output_grid
    type: 2D grid of pixels
    properties:
      height: H (same as input_grid)
      width: W * 2 (double the input_grid width)
      content: Derived from input_grid.

transformation:
  action: Horizontal Concatenation
  input: input_grid
  output: output_grid
  rule: The output_grid is formed by placing two copies of the input_grid side-by-side horizontally.
  details:
    - For each row 'r' from 0 to H-1:
      - The pixels in the output_grid from column 0 to W-1 are identical to the pixels in the corresponding row 'r' of the input_grid.
      - The pixels in the output_grid from column W to (2*W)-1 are also identical to the pixels in the corresponding row 'r' of the input_grid.
    - Equivalently: `output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c % W]` for all `r` and `c`.

relationships:
  - Output height is equal to input height.
  - Output width is double the input width.
  - The left half of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
  - The right half of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height H and width (W * 2).
3.  For each row `r` from 0 to H-1:
    a.  Copy the entire row `r` from the input grid into the output grid at the same row `r`, columns 0 to W-1.
    b.  Copy the entire row `r` from the input grid *again* into the output grid at the same row `r`, columns W to (W * 2)-1.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
