Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** In all three examples, the input grid is 7x7 and the output grid is 6x6. This immediately suggests a reduction in size, possibly by removing rows and/or columns.
2.  **Content Relationship:** Comparing the input and output grids side-by-side for each example reveals a consistent pattern. The output grid appears to be identical to a specific sub-section of the input grid.
3.  **Identifying the Sub-grid:**
    *   In `train_1`, the output `8 8 8 4 4 4 ... 1 1 1 1 1 5` corresponds exactly to the input grid's content starting from the second row and second column (`input[1][1]`).
    *   In `train_2`, the output `5 5 9 9 8 8 ... 8 3 3 3 1 1` also corresponds to the input grid's content starting from `input[1][1]`.
    *   In `train_3`, the output `3 5 5 5 5 5 ... 1 1 8 8 8 8` again corresponds to the input grid's content starting from `input[1][1]`.
4.  **Transformation Rule:** The consistent observation across all examples is that the output grid is formed by removing the first row (index 0) and the first column (index 0) from the input grid. The remaining 6x6 subgrid becomes the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract a subgrid from the input grid by removing the first row and the first column.

examples:
  - example_id: train_1
    input_grid:
      height: 7
      width: 7
      content_summary: Various colored pixels, potentially forming small shapes or patterns.
    output_grid:
      height: 6
      width: 6
      relationship_to_input: Is identical to the subgrid of the input starting at row 1, column 1.
    transformation_details:
      removed_row_index: 0
      removed_col_index: 0

  - example_id: train_2
    input_grid:
      height: 7
      width: 7
      content_summary: Various colored pixels.
    output_grid:
      height: 6
      width: 6
      relationship_to_input: Is identical to the subgrid of the input starting at row 1, column 1.
    transformation_details:

      removed_col_index: 0

  - example_id: train_3
    input_grid:
      height: 7
      width: 7
      content_summary: Various colored pixels.
    output_grid:
      height: 6
      width: 6
      relationship_to_input: Is identical to the subgrid of the input starting at row 1, column 1.
    transformation_details:
      removed_row_index: 0
      removed_col_index: 0

derived_rule:
  dimensionality_change: Input HxW -> Output (H-1)x(W-1)
  action: Cropping or Subgrid Extraction
  specifics: Remove the topmost row (index 0) and the leftmost column (index 0) of the input grid.
  result: The remaining grid section constitutes the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Identify and select the portion of the input grid that excludes the first row (row index 0) and the first column (column index 0).
3.  Return this selected subgrid as the output grid.
