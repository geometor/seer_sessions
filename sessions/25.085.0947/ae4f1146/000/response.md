*   **Perception**
    *   The input is always a 9x9 grid containing white (0), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels.
    *   The output is always a 3x3 grid containing only blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
    *   The output grid appears to be a subgrid extracted directly from the input grid.
    *   By comparing the output grids with their corresponding input grids, it's clear that the output is a specific 3x3 section of the input.
    *   This 3x3 section in the input is unique because it is the only 3x3 area composed entirely of non-white pixels (specifically, blue and azure pixels). All other 3x3 areas in the input contain at least one white (0) pixel.
    *   The task is to locate this unique 3x3 subgrid within the input grid that contains no white pixels and output it.

```yaml
    task_type: extraction
    input_grid:
        size: 9x9
        colors: [white, blue, azure]
    output_grid:
        size: 3x3
        colors: [blue, azure]
        source: subgrid from input
    key_feature:
        type: subgrid
        size: 3x3
        property: contains only non-white pixels (blue and azure)
        uniqueness: exactly one such subgrid exists in the input
    action:
        operation: find_and_extract
        target: the unique 3x3 subgrid composed entirely of non-white pixels
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Scan the input 9x9 grid to find all possible 3x3 subgrids.
    2.  For each 3x3 subgrid, check if all its pixels are non-white (i.e., their value is not 0).
    3.  Identify the single 3x3 subgrid that meets this condition (contains only non-white pixels, which are blue and azure in the examples).
    4.  Return this identified 3x3 subgrid as the output.
