- task: Find and extract a specific 3x3 subgrid from a larger input grid.
- grid_properties:
    - input_size: 9x9
    - output_size: 3x3
    - colors_present: white (0), blue (1), azure (8)
- objects:
    - type: 3x3 subgrid
    - property: Contains only non-white pixels (values > 0).
    - property: Multiple such subgrids exist in each input (exactly 4 in examples).
    - property: Each subgrid has a calculable sum of its pixel values.
- selection_criterion:
    - Among all non-white 3x3 subgrids, the one with the minimum sum of pixel values is chosen.
- action:
    - Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input.
    - Filter these to keep only those containing no white pixels.
    - Calculate the sum of pixel values for each filtered subgrid.
    - Select the subgrid with the minimum sum.
    - Return the selected subgrid as the output.
- assumption: The minimum sum is unique among the candidate subgrids for any given input.
