Okay, the code confirms there are 4 non-white 3x3 subgrids in each example. The previous code simply returned the first one found during the scan (top-left corner coordinates):
*   Ex 1: Returned (0, 4), Expected (4, 6)
*   Ex 2: Returned (0, 1), Expected (4, 2)
*   Ex 3: Returned (0, 2), Expected (1, 6)
*   Ex 4: Returned (0, 0), Expected (5, 6)

Now, let's find a consistent rule for selecting the correct subgrid among the candidates.

Let the candidate subgrids (non-white 3x3) and their top-left coordinates be:
*   Ex 1: Candidates at (0, 4), (1, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0). Correct is (4, 6).
*   Ex 2: Candidates at (0, 1), (1, 5), (4, 2), (6, 6). Correct is (4, 2).
*   Ex 3: Candidates at (0, 2), (1, 6), (4, 0), (5, 4). Correct is (1, 6).
*   Ex 4: Candidates at (0, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1), (5, 6). Correct is (5, 6).

Let's check simple location rules again:
*   Bottom-most?
    *   Ex 1: (5, 0) is bottom-most. Correct is (4, 6). -> No.
    *   Ex 2: (6, 6) is bottom-most. Correct is (4, 2). -> No.
    *   Ex 3: (5, 4) is bottom-most. Correct is (1, 6). -> No.
    *   Ex 4: (5, 6) is bottom-most. Correct is (5, 6). -> Yes. (Inconsistent)
*   Right-most?
    *   Ex 1: (4, 6) is right-most. Correct is (4, 6). -> Yes.
    *   Ex 2: (6, 6) is right-most. Correct is (4, 2). -> No.
    *   Ex 3: (1, 6) is right-most. Correct is (1, 6). -> Yes.
    *   Ex 4: (5, 6) is right-most. Correct is (5, 6). -> Yes. (Inconsistent overall)
*   Bottom-most, then right-most?
    *   Ex 1: Bottom-most is (5, 0). -> No.
    *   Ex 2: Bottom-most is (6, 6). -> No.
    *   Ex 3: Bottom-most is (5, 4). -> No.
    *   Ex 4: Bottom-most are (5, 6). Right-most of these is (5, 6). -> Yes. (Inconsistent overall)
*   Right-most, then bottom-most?
    *   Ex 1: Right-most are (4, 6). Bottom-most of these is (4, 6). -> Yes.
    *   Ex 2: Right-most is (6, 6). -> No.
    *   Ex 3: Right-most are (1, 6). Bottom-most of these is (1, 6). -> Yes.
    *   Ex 4: Right-most are (5, 6). Bottom-most of these is (5, 6). -> Yes. (Inconsistent overall)

Location rules don't seem to work consistently. Let's look at the content of the subgrids. Colors are blue (1) and azure (8).

Let's calculate properties for each candidate subgrid in each example:
*   Sum of pixel values
*   Number of blue (1) pixels
*   Number of azure (8) pixels

**Example 1:** Candidates at (0, 4), (1, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0). Correct is (4, 6).
*   (0, 4): `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=65, #1=1, #8=8
*   (1, 0): `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=72, #1=0, #8=9
*   (4, 6): `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8], [1, 8, 1]]` -> Sum=38, #1=5, #8=4 **(Correct)**
*   (5, 0): `[[8, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1], [1, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=50, #1=3, #8=6

**Example 2:** Candidates at (0, 1), (1, 5), (4, 2), (6, 6). Correct is (4, 2).
*   (0, 1): `[[8, 8, 1], [8, 1, 8], [8, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=58, #1=2, #8=7
*   (1, 5): `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1]]` -> Sum=50, #1=3, #8=6
*   (4, 2): `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1]]` -> Sum=44, #1=4, #8=5 **(Correct)**
*   (6, 6): `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=65, #1=1, #8=8

**Example 3:** Candidates at (0, 2), (1, 6), (4, 0), (5, 4). Correct is (1, 6).
*   (0, 2): `[[1, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1], [1, 1, 8]]` -> Sum=37, #1=5, #8=4
*   (1, 6): `[[8, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 8]]` -> Sum=31, #1=6, #8=3 **(Correct)**
*   (4, 0): `[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1], [1, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=58, #1=2, #8=7
*   (5, 4): `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1]]` -> Sum=50, #1=3, #8=6

**Example 4:** Candidates at (0, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1), (5, 6). Correct is (5, 6).
*   (0, 0): `[[8, 8, 8], [1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=65, #1=1, #8=8
*   (1, 4): `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8], [8, 8, 8]]` -> Sum=50, #1=3, #8=6
*   (4, 1): `[[8, 8, 1], [8, 8, 8], [8, 1, 8]]` -> Sum=58, #1=2, #8=7
*   (5, 6): `[[8, 1, 8], [1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1]]` -> Sum=38, #1=5, #8=4 **(Correct)**

Now, let's look for a pattern in the properties of the *correct* subgrid:
*   Ex 1 (Correct: (4, 6)): Sum=38, #1=5, #8=4
*   Ex 2 (Correct: (4, 2)): Sum=44, #1=4, #8=5
*   Ex 3 (Correct: (1, 6)): Sum=31, #1=6, #8=3
*   Ex 4 (Correct: (5, 6)): Sum=38, #1=5, #8=4

Is the correct subgrid the one with the:
*   Minimum sum?
    *   Ex 1: Min sum is 38. Yes.
    *   Ex 2: Min sum is 44. Yes.
    *   Ex 3: Min sum is 31. Yes.
    *   Ex 4: Min sum is 38. Yes.

It seems the rule is:
1. Find all 3x3 subgrids within the input grid that contain only non-white pixels (pixels > 0).
2. Calculate the sum of the pixel values for each of these candidate subgrids.
3. Select the subgrid that has the minimum sum.
4. If there's a tie for the minimum sum, we need a tie-breaking rule. Let's check Ex 1 and Ex 4, which both have a minimum sum of 38.
    *   Ex 1: Correct is (4, 6).
    *   Ex 4: Correct is (5, 6).
    What if there are multiple subgrids with the minimum sum? This doesn't happen in the examples provided. Every example has a unique minimum sum among the candidates.

Let's assume the rule is simply selecting the subgrid with the unique minimum sum.## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the task of finding a 3x3 subgrid but failed because it assumed the *first* encountered 3x3 subgrid consisting entirely of non-white pixels was the target. The results clearly show this is incorrect, as the outputs generated by the code do not match the expected outputs for any training example.

The analysis indicates that:
1.  There are multiple 3x3 subgrids composed solely of non-white pixels within each input grid.
2.  The target output corresponds to *one specific* subgrid among these candidates.
3.  A selection criterion is needed to distinguish the correct subgrid from the other candidates.

The strategy will be to:
1.  Identify *all* 3x3 subgrids containing only non-white pixels.
2.  Analyze the properties of these candidate subgrids and the corresponding expected output subgrid for each example.
3.  Determine the rule used to select the correct subgrid based on these properties. Potential properties include location (top-left corner coordinates) or content (sum of pixel values, count of specific colors).

## Metrics

Based on the analysis using `tool_code`, the following metrics were gathered:

| Example | Input Size | Output Size | # Non-White 3x3 Candidates | Candidate Locations (Row, Col) | Correct Candidate Location | Correct Candidate Sum | Candidate Sums           | Min Sum | Max Sum |
| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------- | :------ | :------ |
| 1       | 9x9        | 3x3         | 4                          | (0,4), (1,0), (4,6), (5,0)     | (4, 6)                     | 38                    | [65, 72, 38, 50]         | 38      | 72      |
| 2       | 9x9        | 3x3         | 4                          | (0,1), (1,5), (4,2), (6,6)     | (4, 2)                     | 44                    | [58, 50, 44, 65]         | 44      | 65      |
| 3       | 9x9        | 3x3         | 4                          | (0,2), (1,6), (4,0), (5,4)     | (1, 6)                     | 31                    | [37, 31, 58, 50]         | 31      | 58      |
| 4       | 9x9        | 3x3         | 4                          | (0,0), (1,4), (4,1), (5,6)     | (5, 6)                     | 38                    | [65, 50, 58, 38]         | 38      | 65      |

Observations from metrics:
*   Each input grid contains exactly 4 candidate 3x3 subgrids composed entirely of non-white pixels (colors blue-1 and azure-8).
*   The correct output subgrid consistently corresponds to the candidate subgrid with the *minimum sum* of pixel values.
*   In all provided examples, the minimum sum is unique among the candidates for that example.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Scan the input 9x9 grid to identify all possible 3x3 subgrids.
2.  For each 3x3 subgrid, check if all its pixels have a value greater than 0 (i.e., are non-white). Keep a list of these "candidate" subgrids and their properties (e.g., top-left coordinates, pixel values).
3.  For each candidate subgrid found in step 2, calculate the sum of all 9 pixel values within it.
4.  Compare the sums calculated in step 3. Identify the candidate subgrid that has the minimum sum.
5.  Return this minimum-sum 3x3 subgrid as the output.
