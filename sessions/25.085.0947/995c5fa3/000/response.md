Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is always a 4x14 grid containing gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Separators:** There are two vertical columns composed entirely of white pixels (column indices 4 and 9). These columns act as separators, dividing the input grid into three distinct 4x4 sections or subgrids.
3.  **Subgrids:** The three 4x4 subgrids are located at column indices 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13 respectively.
4.  **Subgrid Content:** Each 4x4 subgrid contains a pattern formed by gray (5) and white (0) pixels. Across the examples, four distinct patterns (shapes) appear within these subgrids.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 3x3 grid. Each row of the output grid consists of pixels of a single color. The colors observed in the output are azure (8), red (2), yellow (4), and green (3).
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves recognizing the specific gray/white pattern within each of the three input subgrids (from left to right) and mapping that pattern to a specific output color. This color then fills the corresponding row (top to bottom) in the 3x3 output grid.
7.  **Pattern-Color Mapping:** By observing the examples, we can deduce the following mapping between the 4x4 input patterns and the output colors:
    *   Pattern 1 (Solid 4x4 gray square) maps to Red (2).
    *   Pattern 2 (4x4 gray square frame with a 2x2 white center) maps to Azure (8).
    *   Pattern 3 (4x4 grid with gray top/bottom rows and two central rows like `[5, 0, 0, 5]`) maps to Yellow (4).
    *   Pattern 4 (4x4 grid with gray top/bottom rows and two central rows like `[0, 5, 5, 0]`) maps to Green (3).

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Recognize patterns in subgrids and map them to colors in the output grid.

Input:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 4x14
  - pixels:
      - color: gray (5)
      - color: white (0)
  - structure:
      - Contains two vertical separator columns of white pixels at indices 4 and 9.
      - Separators divide the grid into three 4x4 subgrids.
      - Subgrid 1: Columns 0-3
      - Subgrid 2: Columns 5-8
      - Subgrid 3: Columns 10-13

Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 3x3
  - pixels:
      - color: azure (8)
      - color: red (2)
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: green (3)
  - structure: Each row contains pixels of a single color.

    description: Divide the input 4x14 grid into three 4x4 subgrids using the white columns (index 4 and 9) as delimiters.
  - name: Pattern Recognition
    description: Identify the specific pattern of gray and white pixels within each 4x4 subgrid.
  - name: Mapping
    description: Map each identified pattern to a specific output color based on a fixed rule.
    rules:
      - pattern: Solid gray square -> color: red (2)
      - pattern: Gray square frame -> color: azure (8)
      - pattern: "C" shape (gray top/bottom, `[5,0,0,5]` middle rows) -> color: yellow (4)
      - pattern: "H" shape (gray top/bottom, `[0,5,5,0]` middle rows) -> color: green (3)
  - name: Output Construction
    description: Create a 3x3 output grid.
    details:
      - Fill the first row (index 0) with the color corresponding to the pattern in the first input subgrid.
      - Fill the second row (index 1) with the color corresponding to the pattern in the second input subgrid.
      - Fill the third row (index 2) with the color corresponding to the pattern in the third input subgrid.

Relationships:
  - The i-th subgrid (from left, 0-indexed) in the input determines the color of the i-th row (from top, 0-indexed) in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the three 4x4 subgrids within the 4x14 input grid by using the vertical white columns at indices 4 and 9 as separators. The subgrids occupy columns 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13.
2.  For each subgrid (proceeding from left to right):
    a.  Examine the pattern formed by gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    b.  Determine which of the four predefined patterns it matches:
        i.  A solid 4x4 gray square.
        ii. A 4x4 gray square frame (gray border, white 2x2 center).
        iii. A pattern with gray top/bottom rows and middle rows `[5, 0, 0, 5]`.
        iv. A pattern with gray top/bottom rows and middle rows `[0, 5, 5, 0]`.
    c.  Assign an output color based on the matched pattern:
        i.  Solid square maps to Red (2).
        ii. Square frame maps to Azure (8).
        iii. Pattern iii maps to Yellow (4).
        iv. Pattern iv maps to Green (3).
3.  Construct a 3x3 output grid.
4.  Fill the first row of the output grid entirely with the color determined from the first subgrid.
5.  Fill the second row of the output grid entirely with the color determined from the second subgrid.
6.  Fill the third row of the output grid entirely with the color determined from the third subgrid.
