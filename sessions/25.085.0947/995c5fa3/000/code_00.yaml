Task: Recognize patterns in subgrids and map them to colors in the output grid.

Input:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 4x14
  - pixels:
      - color: gray (5)
      - color: white (0)
  - structure:
      - Contains two vertical separator columns of white pixels at indices 4 and 9.
      - Separators divide the grid into three 4x4 subgrids.
      - Subgrid 1: Columns 0-3
      - Subgrid 2: Columns 5-8
      - Subgrid 3: Columns 10-13

Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 3x3
  - pixels:
      - color: azure (8)
      - color: red (2)
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: green (3)
  - structure: Each row contains pixels of a single color.

Transformation:
  - name: Segmentation
    description: Divide the input 4x14 grid into three 4x4 subgrids using the white columns (index 4 and 9) as delimiters.
  - name: Pattern Recognition
    description: Identify the specific pattern of gray and white pixels within each 4x4 subgrid.
  - name: Mapping
    description: Map each identified pattern to a specific output color based on a fixed rule.
    rules:
      - pattern: Solid gray square -> color: red (2)
      - pattern: Gray square frame -> color: azure (8)
      - pattern: "C" shape (gray top/bottom, `[5,0,0,5]` middle rows) -> color: yellow (4)
      - pattern: "H" shape (gray top/bottom, `[0,5,5,0]` middle rows) -> color: green (3)
  - name: Output Construction
    description: Create a 3x3 output grid.
    details:
      - Fill the first row (index 0) with the color corresponding to the pattern in the first input subgrid.
      - Fill the second row (index 1) with the color corresponding to the pattern in the second input subgrid.
      - Fill the third row (index 2) with the color corresponding to the pattern in the third input subgrid.

Relationships:
  - The i-th subgrid (from left, 0-indexed) in the input determines the color of the i-th row (from top, 0-indexed) in the output.
