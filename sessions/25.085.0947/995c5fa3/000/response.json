These columns act as separators, dividing the input grid into three distinct 4x4 sections or subgrids.\n3.  **Subgrids:** The three 4x4 subgrids are located at column indices 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13 respectively.\n4.  **Subgrid Content:** Each 4x4 subgrid contains a pattern formed by gray (5) and white (0) pixels. Across the examples, four distinct patterns (shapes) appear within these subgrids.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a 3x3 grid. Each row of the output grid consists of pixels of a single color. The colors observed in the output are azure (8), red (2), yellow (4), and green (3).\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves recognizing the specific gray/white pattern within each of the three input subgrids (from left to right) and mapping that pattern to a specific output color. This color then fills the corresponding row (top to bottom) in the 3x3 output grid.\n7.  **Pattern-Color Mapping:** By observing the examples, we can deduce the following mapping between the 4x4 input patterns and the output colors:\n    *   Pattern 1 (Solid 4x4 gray square) maps to Red (2).\n    *   Pattern 2 (4x4 gray square frame with a 2x2 white center) maps to Azure (8).\n    *   Pattern 3 (4x4 grid with gray top/bottom rows and two central rows like `[5, 0, 0, 5]`) maps to Yellow (4).\n    *   Pattern 4 (4x4 grid with gray top/bottom rows and two central rows like `[0, 5, 5, 0]`) maps to Green (3).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
