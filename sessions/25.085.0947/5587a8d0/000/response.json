            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids vary in size (6x6, 9x9, 7x7). They typically contain a dominant background color (orange, 7 in all examples) and several smaller distinct shapes or groups of pixels made of other colors.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids also vary in size (3x3, 5x5, 7x7). They exhibit a clear structure of nested square frames. The colors used in the output are derived from the non-background colors present in the input grid.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The key transformation involves identifying the non-background colors in the input, counting how many pixels of each color exist, and then using this count information to determine the order and placement of colors in the output's nested frame structure.\n4.  **Size Transformation:** The size of the output grid appears directly related to the *number* of unique non-background colors found in the input. If there are `N` such colors, the output grid size is `(2N - 1) x (2N - 1)`.\n5.  **Structural Pattern:** The output grid is constructed starting with the color that had the highest pixel count (among non-background colors) forming the outermost frame. The color with the next highest count forms the next frame inward, and so on, until the color with the lowest count fills the center.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Identify the background color, which is the color with the highest total pixel count in the input grid.\n3.  Collect all other colors found in the input grid; these are the non-background colors. Count how many unique non-background colors there are, let this number be `N`.\n4.  Create a list of these `N` non-background colors, sorted in descending order based on their pixel counts in the input grid. Let the sorted colors be `C1, C2, ..., CN`.\n5.  Determine the size `S` for the output square grid using the formula `S = 2 * N - 1`.\n6.  Initialize an `S x S` grid.\n7.  Construct the output grid by drawing concentric square frames, starting from the outside and moving inwards:\n    *   Fill the outermost frame (pixels at row 0, row S-1, column 0, column S-1) with color `C1`.\n    *   Fill the next frame inside (pixels at row 1, row S-2, column 1, column S-2, excluding those already filled) with color `C2`.\n    *   Continue this process iteratively: for the k-th frame (where k ranges from 1 to N), fill the pixels at rows `k-1` and `S-k`, and columns `k-1` and `S-k` (that haven't been filled by outer frames) with the color `Ck`.\n    *   The final color `CN` will fill the centermost part (a single pixel if S is odd, or potentially a small square if the logic were different, but here it results in the k=N layer).\n8.  The fully constructed `S x S` grid is the output."
