Task: Construct a nested square grid based on color frequency.

Input_Analysis:
  - Grid: Contains pixels of various colors.
  - Background_Color: The color with the highest frequency in the input grid (e.g., orange/7 in examples). This color is ignored for the output construction.
  - Objects: Groups of pixels corresponding to the non-background colors.
  - Properties:
    - Color: The specific color index (0-9) of each non-background object/pixel group.
    - Pixel_Count: The total number of pixels for each unique non-background color.

Output_Analysis:
  - Grid: A square grid whose size depends on the number of unique non-background colors.
  - Size_Rule: If N unique non-background colors exist, output dimensions are (2N - 1) x (2N - 1).
  - Structure: Nested square frames.
  - Color_Assignment: Based on the pixel counts from the input.

Transformation:
  - Step_1: Identify unique colors in the input and count their occurrences.
  - Step_2: Determine the background color (highest count).
  - Step_3: Identify all other colors (non-background colors). Let N be the count of unique non-background colors.
  - Step_4: Sort the non-background colors based on their pixel counts in descending order (C1, C2, ..., CN).
  - Step_5: Calculate output grid size S = 2N - 1.
  - Step_6: Create an S x S output grid.
  - Step_7: Fill the grid with nested frames:
      - Outermost frame (layer 1) uses color C1.
      - Next frame inward (layer 2) uses color C2.
      - ...
      - Innermost pixel or block (layer N) uses color CN.

Relationships:
  - Input_Color_Frequency -> Output_Color_Layering: The frequency rank determines the frame layer (highest frequency = outermost frame).
  - Input_NonBackground_Color_Count -> Output_Grid_Size: The number of unique non-background colors (N) determines the output grid size (2N - 1).
