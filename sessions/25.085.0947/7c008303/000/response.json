            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9x9. Each input grid contains exactly one solid horizontal line and one solid vertical line composed of azure (8) pixels. These lines intersect and divide the grid into four distinct rectangular quadrants. The position of these lines varies between examples.\n2.  **Key Quadrants:** Two of the four quadrants are crucial:\n    *   **Pattern Quadrant (PQ):** One quadrant, which is always 6x6 in size, contains a pattern made of green (3) pixels against a white (0) background. The location of this 6x6 quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, or Bottom-Right relative to the azure lines) changes between examples.\n    *   **Color Quadrant (CQ):** Another quadrant, which is always 2x2 in size, contains four pixels that define the color mapping. This 2x2 quadrant is always located diagonally opposite the Pattern Quadrant (PQ).\n3.  **Color Mapping Information:** The 2x2 Color Quadrant (CQ) contains two pairs of colors, arranged in two rows. Let the colors be `[[C1, C2], [C3, C4]]`. These four colors determine how the green pattern is transformed.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always 6x6, matching the dimensions of the Pattern Quadrant (PQ). The output grid essentially reproduces the pattern from the PQ, but the green (3) pixels are replaced by other colors based on a specific rule. White (0) pixels from the PQ remain white (0) in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves mapping the green (3) pixels from the input's Pattern Quadrant (PQ) to new colors in the output grid. This mapping depends on *both* the colors found in the Color Quadrant (CQ) *and* the position of the green pixel within the 6x6 PQ. Specifically, the 6x6 PQ is treated as being composed of four 3x3 sub-quadrants.\n    *   Green pixels in the Top-Left 3x3 sub-quadrant of PQ map to color `C1` (from `CQ[0,0]`).\n    *   Green pixels in the Top-Right 3x3 sub-quadrant of PQ map to color `C2` (from `CQ[0,1]`).\n    *   Green pixels in the Bottom-Left 3x3 sub-quadrant of PQ map to color `C3` (from `CQ[1,0]`).\n    *   Green pixels in the Bottom-Right 3x3 sub-quadrant of PQ map to color `C4` (from `CQ[1,1]`).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the 6x6 quadrant containing the green (3) pattern (this is the Pattern Quadrant, PQ). Identify the 2x2 quadrant located diagonally opposite the PQ (this is the Color Quadrant, CQ).\n3.  **Extract Color Key:** Read the four color values from the 2x2 Color Quadrant (CQ). Store them as a 2x2 structure, let's call it `ColorKey`, where `ColorKey[0][0]` is C1, `ColorKey[0][1]` is C2, `ColorKey[1][0]` is C3, and `ColorKey[1][1]` is C4.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a new 6x6 grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each cell of the 6x6 Pattern Quadrant (PQ), using relative row `r` (from 0 to 5) and column `c` (from 0 to 5).\n    a.  Check the color of the cell `PQ[r][c]`.\n    b.  If `PQ[r][c]` is green (3):\n        i.

If `PQ[r][c]` is not green (it will be white 0), leave the corresponding cell `OutputGrid[r][c]` as white (0).\n6.  **Final Output:** The resulting 6x6 `OutputGrid` is the final output."
