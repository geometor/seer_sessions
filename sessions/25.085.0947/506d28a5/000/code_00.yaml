task_description: Combine information from two vertically stacked grids separated by a specific color line.
input_elements:
  - element: input_grid
    description: A 9x5 grid of pixels.
  - element: separator_line
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - location: Always at row index 4.
      - function: Divides the input_grid into two main parts.
  - element: top_grid
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_grid (rows 0-3)
      - dimensions: 4x5
      - content: Pixels with colors white (0) and red (2).
  - element: bottom_grid
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_grid (rows 5-8)
      - dimensions: 4x5
      - content: Pixels with colors white (0) and blue (1).
output_elements:
  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x5 (same as top_grid and bottom_grid)
      - content: Pixels with colors white (0) and green (3).
relationships:
  - type: positional_correspondence
    description: Each cell (r, c) in the output_grid corresponds to cell (r, c) in the top_grid and cell (r, c) in the bottom_grid.
transformation_rule:
  - name: pixel_wise_combination
    description: The value of a pixel in the output_grid is determined by the values of the corresponding pixels in the top_grid and bottom_grid.
    condition: >
      If the pixel value in top_grid is red (2) OR the pixel value in bottom_grid is blue (1),
      then the corresponding output_grid pixel value is green (3).
    otherwise: >
      If the pixel value in top_grid is white (0) AND the pixel value in bottom_grid is white (0),
      then the corresponding output_grid pixel value is white (0).
