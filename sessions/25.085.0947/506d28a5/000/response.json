They are visually divided into three distinct sections by a horizontal yellow line (color 4) located at the 5th row (index 4).\n    *   The top section (rows 0-3) is a 4x5 grid containing white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n    *   The middle section (row 4) is a single row of yellow (4) pixels acting as a separator.\n    *   The bottom section (rows 5-8) is a 4x5 grid containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids consistently have dimensions 4x5, matching the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input grid. They contain only white (0) and green (3) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve comparing the top section (red/white) and the bottom section (blue/white) of the input grid on a cell-by-cell basis. The yellow separator line is discarded. The color of a pixel in the output grid depends on the colors of the corresponding pixels in the top and bottom input sections. Specifically, if the top pixel is red OR the bottom pixel is blue, the output pixel is green. If both corresponding input pixels are white, the output pixel is white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
