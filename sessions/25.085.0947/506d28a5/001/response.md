"""
Combine information from two vertically stacked grids separated by a yellow line.
The top grid (rows 0-3) has red (2) and white (0) pixels.
The bottom grid (rows 5-8) has blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
The output grid has the same dimensions as these subgrids (4x5).
A pixel in the output is green (3) if the corresponding pixel in the top grid
is red (2) OR the corresponding pixel in the bottom grid is blue (1).
Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).
