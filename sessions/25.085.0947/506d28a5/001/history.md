Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consistently have dimensions 9x5. They are visually divided into three distinct sections by a horizontal yellow line (color 4) located at the 5th row (index 4).
    *   The top section (rows 0-3) is a 4x5 grid containing white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    *   The middle section (row 4) is a single row of yellow (4) pixels acting as a separator.
    *   The bottom section (rows 5-8) is a 4x5 grid containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids consistently have dimensions 4x5, matching the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input grid. They contain only white (0) and green (3) pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve comparing the top section (red/white) and the bottom section (blue/white) of the input grid on a cell-by-cell basis. The yellow separator line is discarded. The color of a pixel in the output grid depends on the colors of the corresponding pixels in the top and bottom input sections. Specifically, if the top pixel is red OR the bottom pixel is blue, the output pixel is green. If both corresponding input pixels are white, the output pixel is white.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the horizontal separator line (color yellow, value 4) within the input grid.
2.  Extract the subgrid located above the separator line (let's call this `top_grid`). This grid will have dimensions 4x5 and contain red (2) and white (0) pixels.
3.  Extract the subgrid located below the separator line (let's call this `bottom_grid`). This grid will also have dimensions 4x5 and contain blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as `top_grid` and `bottom_grid` (4x5). Initialize all its cells to a default value (e.g., white/0).
5.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `4`.
6.  For the current cell position (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Get the color value from `top_grid` at (`r`, `c`). Let this be `top_color`.
    b.  Get the color value from `bottom_grid` at (`r`, `c`). Let this be `bottom_color`.
    c.  Check if `top_color` is red (2) OR `bottom_color` is blue (1).
    d.  If the condition in step 6c is true, set the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to green (3).
    e.  Otherwise (if `top_color` is white (0) AND `bottom_color` is white (0)), set the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to white (0).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
