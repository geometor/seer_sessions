The shape and position of this azure object vary between examples.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to depend on a property of the azure object in the input. Specifically, the output grid seems to be determined by the dimensions of the bounding box enclosing the azure object.\n5.  **Output Patterns:** There are two distinct 5x5 output patterns observed across the training examples. Both patterns feature a central white cross (row 2 and column 2 are all white), dividing the grid into four 2x2 quadrants. The difference lies in which pixels within these quadrants are azure.\n    *   *Pattern A* (seen in train_1, train_2): All four 2x2 quadrants are completely filled with azure pixels.\n    *   *Pattern B* (seen in train_3, train_4, train_5): The top-right and bottom-right quadrants are filled with azure, while the top-left and bottom-left quadrants have their first column as white and the second column as azure.\n6.  **Correlation:** By calculating the bounding box of the azure object in each input, a correlation emerges:\n    *   Inputs where the bounding box width is 6 result in *Pattern A*.\n    *   Inputs where the bounding box width is 5 result in *Pattern B*.\n    *   The height of the bounding box does not seem to influence the output pattern.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
