## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The input grids are 6x6, and the output grids are consistently 5x5.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors are white (0) used for the background and azure (8) used to form shapes.
3.  **Objects:** Each input grid contains a single connected object made of azure pixels against a white background. The shape and position of this azure object vary between examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to depend on a property of the azure object in the input. Specifically, the output grid seems to be determined by the dimensions of the bounding box enclosing the azure object.
5.  **Output Patterns:** There are two distinct 5x5 output patterns observed across the training examples. Both patterns feature a central white cross (row 2 and column 2 are all white), dividing the grid into four 2x2 quadrants. The difference lies in which pixels within these quadrants are azure.
    *   *Pattern A* (seen in train_1, train_2): All four 2x2 quadrants are completely filled with azure pixels.
    *   *Pattern B* (seen in train_3, train_4, train_5): The top-right and bottom-right quadrants are filled with azure, while the top-left and bottom-left quadrants have their first column as white and the second column as azure.
6.  **Correlation:** By calculating the bounding box of the azure object in each input, a correlation emerges:
    *   Inputs where the bounding box width is 6 result in *Pattern A*.
    *   Inputs where the bounding box width is 5 result in *Pattern B*.
    *   The height of the bounding box does not seem to influence the output pattern.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all grid cells containing the azure color (8) in the input grid.
2.  Determine the coordinates (row, column) of all identified azure cells.
3.  Find the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among these azure cells. This defines the bounding box of the azure object.
4.  Calculate the width of the bounding box using the formula: `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
5.  Check the calculated `width`:
    *   If `width` is equal to 6, select the predefined 5x5 output grid `Pattern_A`:
        
```
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

    *   If `width` is equal to 5, select the predefined 5x5 output grid `Pattern_B`:
        
```
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

6.  Return the selected 5x5 grid as the final output.
