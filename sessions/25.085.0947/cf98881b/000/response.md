Okay, I will analyze the task examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 14 columns. The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 4 columns.
2.  **Separators:** All input grids contain two vertical lines of red pixels (color 2) at columns 4 and 9. These lines perfectly separate the input grid into three distinct 4x4 sections, plus the two separator columns themselves.
3.  **Input Sections:**
    *   Section 1: Columns 0-3
    *   Section 2: Columns 5-8
    *   Section 3: Columns 10-13
4.  **Output Generation:** The output grid dimensions (4x4) match the dimensions of the input sections. Comparing the output grid with the three input sections pixel by pixel suggests a combination rule.
5.  **Pixel Combination Rule:** For each position (row `r`, column `c`) in the output grid, the color seems to be determined by the colors at the corresponding position (`r`, `c`) within the three input sections.
6.  **Priority/Layering:** Observing the examples, especially where multiple sections have non-white pixels at the same coordinates, reveals a priority order. The color from Section 1 takes precedence if it's non-white (not 0). If Section 1's pixel is white, the color from Section 2 is used if it's non-white. If both Section 1 and Section 2 pixels are white, the color from Section 3 is used. If all three corresponding pixels are white, the output pixel is white. This suggests a layering effect where Section 1 is "on top", followed by Section 2, and finally Section 3 at the bottom. White pixels act as transparent.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:

      function: divide input_grid into sections
  - name: input_sections
    type: list_of_grids
    properties:
      count: 3

        - section_3: columns 10-13
  - name: background_color
    type: color
    value: white (0)
    role: acts as transparent in the combination process

transformation:
  - action: extract_sections
    inputs: input_grid, separator_columns
    outputs: input_sections (section_1, section_2, section_3)
  - action: combine_sections
    inputs: section_1, section_2, section_3, background_color
    output: output_grid
    rule: |
      For each coordinate (r, c) from (0,0) to (3,3):
      - pixel_1 = section_1[r, c]
      - pixel_2 = section_2[r, c]
      - pixel_3 = section_3[r, c]
      - if pixel_1 is not background_color:
          output_grid[r, c] = pixel_1
      - else if pixel_2 is not background_color:
          output_grid[r, c] = pixel_2
      - else:
          output_grid[r, c] = pixel_3
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the columns containing only red (2) pixels; these columns act as vertical separators (columns 4 and 9).
2.  Extract three 4x4 subgrids (sections) from the input grid based on these separators: Section 1 (columns 0-3), Section 2 (columns 5-8), and Section 3 (columns 10-13).
3.  Initialize an empty 4x4 output grid.
4.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
5.  For the current position (r, c), examine the pixel values in the three extracted sections: `pixel1 = Section1[r, c]`, `pixel2 = Section2[r, c]`, `pixel3 = Section3[r, c]`.
6.  Determine the output pixel value `Output[r, c]` based on the following priority:
    *   If `pixel1` is not white (0), set `Output[r, c]` to `pixel1`.
    *   Otherwise (if `pixel1` is white), if `pixel2` is not white (0), set `Output[r, c]` to `pixel2`.
    *   Otherwise (if both `pixel1` and `pixel2` are white), set `Output[r, c]` to `pixel3`.
7.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
