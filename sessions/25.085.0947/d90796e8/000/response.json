            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are Green (3), Red (2), Azure (8), White (0), and Gray (5). Other colors might appear but seem static (e.g., Gray(5)).\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves Green (3) and Red (2) pixels. When they are adjacent, they transform. Specifically, Green pixels turn into Azure (8), and Red pixels turn into White (0).\n4.  **Adjacency:** The transformation appears triggered by adjacency (including diagonals, based on ARC priors, although only orthogonal adjacency is strictly necessary to explain these examples). A Green pixel changes if *any* neighbor is Red, and a Red pixel changes if *any* neighbor is Green.\n5.  **Independence:** The transformation of a Green pixel depends only on its neighbors being Red, and vice-versa. The presence of other colors (like Gray) doesn't seem to affect the Green-Red interaction. Pixels that are not Green or Red, or are Green/Red but lack the triggering adjacent color, remain unchanged.\n6.  **Simultaneity:** It seems the state of the *input* grid determines the output. We check all adjacencies in the input grid simultaneously to decide the color of each pixel in the output grid. A Green changing to Azure doesn't prevent its adjacent Red from changing to White based on the original adjacency in the input.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
