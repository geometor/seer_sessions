Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.
2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are Green (3), Red (2), Azure (8), White (0), and Gray (5). Other colors might appear but seem static (e.g., Gray(5)).
3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves Green (3) and Red (2) pixels. When they are adjacent, they transform. Specifically, Green pixels turn into Azure (8), and Red pixels turn into White (0).
4.  **Adjacency:** The transformation appears triggered by adjacency (including diagonals, based on ARC priors, although only orthogonal adjacency is strictly necessary to explain these examples). A Green pixel changes if *any* neighbor is Red, and a Red pixel changes if *any* neighbor is Green.
5.  **Independence:** The transformation of a Green pixel depends only on its neighbors being Red, and vice-versa. The presence of other colors (like Gray) doesn't seem to affect the Green-Red interaction. Pixels that are not Green or Red, or are Green/Red but lack the triggering adjacent color, remain unchanged.
6.  **Simultaneity:** It seems the state of the *input* grid determines the output. We check all adjacencies in the input grid simultaneously to decide the color of each pixel in the output grid. A Green changing to Azure doesn't prevent its adjacent Red from changing to White based on the original adjacency in the input.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Color transformation based on adjacency.

Input_Grid:
  - Type: 2D Array of integers (pixels)
  - Colors_Present: White(0), Red(2), Green(3), Gray(5)

Output_Grid:
  - Type: 2D Array of integers (pixels)
  - Dimensions: Same as Input_Grid
  - Colors_Present: White(0), Red(2), Green(3), Azure(8), Gray(5)

Objects:
  - Type: Individual Pixels
  - Key_Colors_Input: Green(3), Red(2)
  - Key_Colors_Output: Azure(8), White(0)
  - Static_Colors: Gray(5), and any Green(3)/Red(2) not meeting adjacency criteria.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (orthogonal or diagonal).
  - Trigger: Adjacency between a Green(3) pixel and a Red(2) pixel in the input grid.

Actions:
  - Transformation_Rule_1:
    - Condition: A pixel is Green(3) AND has at least one adjacent Red(2) pixel in the input grid.
    - Action: The pixel becomes Azure(8) in the output grid.
  - Transformation_Rule_2:
    - Condition: A pixel is Red(2) AND has at least one adjacent Green(3) pixel in the input grid.
    - Action: The pixel becomes White(0) in the output grid.
  - No_Change_Rule:
    - Condition: A pixel does not meet the conditions for Transformation_Rule_1 or Transformation_Rule_2.
    - Action: The pixel retains its original color in the output grid.

Process:
  - The transformation rules are applied based on the state of the *input* grid to generate the *output* grid.
  - Each pixel's potential transformation is evaluated independently based on its color and its neighbors' colors in the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same pixel values.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the **input** grid using its row and column index.
3.  For the current pixel at `(row, col)`:
    a.  Check its color in the **input** grid.
    b.  If the color is Green (3):
        i.  Examine all 8 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the **input** grid, handling boundary conditions (ignore neighbors outside the grid).
        ii. If any neighbor's color is Red (2), set the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the **new** grid to Azure (8).
    c.  If the color is Red (2):
        i.  Examine all 8 neighboring pixels in the **input** grid, handling boundary conditions.
        ii. If any neighbor's color is Green (3), set the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the **new** grid to White (0).
4.  After iterating through all pixels in the input grid, the new grid represents the final output.
