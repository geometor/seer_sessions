            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid consists of several rows. The top part has distinct features:\n    *   A row containing a sequence of different colors (non-white, non-gray).\n    *   Immediately below that, a row filled entirely with gray (color 5).\n    *   Below the gray row, several rows filled entirely with white (color 0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the top two rows (the color sequence row and the gray separator row) exactly as they were in the input. The rows that were white in the input are now filled with solid colors.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens in the lower part of the grid (the initially white rows). These rows are filled row-by-row using the colors found in the very first row of the input. The sequence of colors from the first row is repeated cyclically to determine the fill color for each subsequent white row.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   The first row in the input acts as a \"pattern\" or \"template\" defining a sequence of colors.\n*   The second row, always gray, acts as a separator between the pattern and the area to be filled.\n*   The white rows below the gray separator are the target area for the transformation.\n*   The transformation fills each target row completely with a single color.\n*   The color used for filling is determined by iterating through the color sequence from the first row. The first white row gets the first color from the sequence, the second white row gets the second color, and so on. If the end of the sequence is reached, it cycles back to the beginning.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
