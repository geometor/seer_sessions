task_description: Fill white rows below a gray separator using a repeating color sequence from the first row.
grid_properties:
  width: variable
  height: variable

elements:
  - object: pattern_row
    description: The first row of the input grid. Contains the sequence of colors to be used for filling. Excludes gray and white.
    properties:
      - colors: A sequence of non-white (0) and non-gray (5) colors.
      - position: Row index 0.
  - object: separator_row
    description: A row filled entirely with gray (color 5).
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - position: Row index 1 (immediately below pattern_row).
  - object: fill_area
    description: Rows below the separator_row initially filled entirely with white (color 0).
    properties:
      - initial_color: white (0)
      - position: Rows starting from index 2 to the bottom of the grid.

transformation:
  - action: identify_pattern_sequence
    input: pattern_row
    output: sequence_of_colors (e.g., [3, 2, 1, 4] for train_1)
  - action: identify_fill_rows
    input: input_grid
    criteria: Rows below separator_row that are entirely white (0).
    output: list_of_row_indices_to_fill
  - action: apply_fill
    input: 
      - fill_rows (from identify_fill_rows)
      - pattern_sequence (from identify_pattern_sequence)
    process: |
      Iterate through the identified fill rows.
      For each fill row, determine the next color from the pattern sequence, cycling back to the start if needed.
      Fill the entire row with that single color.
    output_grid_modification: The identified fill rows in the output grid are filled according to the pattern sequence.
  - action: preserve_upper_rows
    input: input_grid
    process: Copy the pattern_row and separator_row from the input grid to the output grid without modification.
    output_grid_modification: The first two rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid.

relationships:
  - separator_row is always directly below pattern_row.
  - fill_area is always below separator_row.
  - The width of the filled rows matches the width of the pattern_row and separator_row.
  - The color sequence from pattern_row dictates the fill colors for the fill_area rows in a cyclical order.
