"""
Transforms an input grid based on a comparison between its upper and lower halves, separated by an orange line.

1. The input grid is divided into two 6x4 subgrids by a horizontal orange (7) separator line located at the 7th row (index 6).
2. The grid above the separator (rows 0-5) is the `upper_grid`.
3. The grid below the separator (rows 7-12) is the `lower_grid`.
4. A 6x4 output grid is created, initialized with white (0).
5. The function iterates through each corresponding pixel position (r, c) in the `upper_grid` and `lower_grid`.
6. If the pixel at `upper_grid[r][c]` is white (0) AND the pixel at `lower_grid[r][c]` is white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid `output_grid[r][c]` is set to azure (8).
7. Otherwise, the pixel `output_grid[r][c]` remains white (0).
8. The final output grid is returned.
