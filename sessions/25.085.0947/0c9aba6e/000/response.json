            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a size of 13 rows by 4 columns. They feature a distinct horizontal separator line made entirely of orange (7) pixels, always located at the 7th row (index 6, 0-based). This line divides the input into two distinct 6x4 subgrids.\n2.  **Upper Subgrid:** The top 6 rows (indices 0-5) form the upper subgrid. This subgrid contains patterns primarily composed of red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.\n3.  **Lower Subgrid:** The bottom 6 rows (indices 7-12) form the lower subgrid. This subgrid contains patterns primarily composed of magenta (6) pixels on a white (0) background.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have a size of 6 rows by 4 columns, matching the dimensions of the upper and lower subgrids from the input. The output grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The task appears to involve comparing the upper and lower subgrids of the input pixel by pixel to generate the output grid. The specific relationship seems to be based on the presence or absence of non-white pixels in corresponding locations.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Extract the 6x4 subgrid located directly above the orange separator line. Call this the `upper_grid`.\n3.  Extract the 6x4 subgrid located directly below the orange separator line. Call this the `lower_grid`.\n4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the `upper_grid` and `lower_grid` (6 rows by 4 columns), initially filled with white (0) pixels.\n5.  Iterate through each pixel position `(row, col)` from `(0, 0)` up to `(5, 3)`.\n6.  For each position `(row, col)`, examine the color of the pixel at `upper_grid[row][col]` and the color of the pixel at `lower_grid[row][col]`.\n7.  If *both* the pixel in the `upper_grid` and the pixel in the `lower_grid` at the current position `(row, col)` are white (0), then set the pixel in the output grid at the same position `(row, col)` to azure (8).\n8.  If the condition in step 7 is not met (i.e., at least one of the corresponding pixels in the `upper_grid` or `lower_grid` is not white), then leave the pixel in the output grid at position `(row, col)` as white (0).\n9.  After iterating through all positions, the resulting grid is the final output."
