task_context:
  problem_description: The task transforms an input grid into an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width.
  input_characteristics:
    - Contains a background of white pixels (0).
    - Contains scattered non-white pixels of various colors.
  output_characteristics:
    - Dimensions are 2x height and 2x width of the input.
    - Appears to be composed of four identical quadrants (2x2 tiling).
    - Each quadrant seems to be a modified version of the input grid.
    - The modification involves adding azure pixels (8).

observed_transformation:
  - type: Grid Modification and Tiling
  - steps:
    - 1. **Identify Source Pixels**: Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid.
    - 2. **Create Base Grid**: Start with a copy of the input grid.
    - 3. **Apply Projection**: For each non-white source pixel at `(r_orig, c_orig)`:
        - **Vertical Projection**: Iterate through all rows `r_new` from 0 to `H-1`. If `r_new != r_orig` and the pixel at `(r_new, c_orig)` in the *original input* is white (0), change the pixel at `(r_new, c_orig)` in the *base grid* to azure (8).
        - **Horizontal Projection**: Iterate through all columns `c_new` from 0 to `W-1`. If `c_new != c_orig` and the pixel at `(r_orig, c_new)` in the *original input* is white (0), change the pixel at `(r_orig, c_new)` in the *base grid* to azure (8).
    - 4. **Construct Output Grid**: Create a new grid with dimensions `(2*H, 2*W)`.
    - 5. **Tile Base Grid**: Copy the modified base grid into each of the four quadrants of the output grid.

objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (represented by integers 0-9)
      - location (row, column)
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (height, width)
      - pixel_data (2D array)

actions:
  - name: Identify
    parameters:
      - object_type: Pixel
      - condition: color is not white (0)
  - name: Copy
    parameters:
      - source: Grid (input)
      - destination: Grid (base_grid)
  - name: Modify Pixel
    parameters:
      - grid: base_grid
      - location: (row, column)
      - new_color: azure (8)
      - condition: The corresponding pixel in the original input grid at this location must be white (0), AND the location must lie on the same row or same column as an original non-white pixel (but not be the non-white pixel itself).
  - name: Tile
    parameters:
      - source_grid: base_grid
      - target_grid: output_grid
      - pattern: 2x2 (filling all four quadrants)

uncertainties:
  - Does the projection always use azure (8)?
  - Does the projection behavior change if multiple non-white pixels project onto the same white pixel? (The current logic implies the last projection wins, or simply sets it to azure).
  - Is the tiling always exactly 2x2?
