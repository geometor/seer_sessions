            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and refine our understanding of the task.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code implemented a transformation based solely on the first training example. The core logic involved identifying non-white pixels, vertically projecting an 'azure' color onto white pixels in the same column within the input grid's bounds, creating a modified 'base grid', and then tiling this base grid 2x2 into a larger output grid.\n\nThe reported \"Train Set Error\" indicates this logic, derived from a single example, is insufficient or incorrect for other examples in the training set. This suggests the transformation rule is likely more complex or nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nOur strategy will be to re-evaluate the transformation by considering the common elements across *all* examples (which I will assume follow a consistent pattern, despite not having the visual data here). We need to identify how the projection, color usage, grid modification, and final composition (tiling) might differ or be more generalized than the initial hypothesis. The most likely point of failure is the projection rule being overly specific (only vertical). A common pattern in ARC is symmetry or operations along both axes.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nTo better understand the discrepancies, we would ideally compare the output of the previous code (`code_00.py`) with the expected output for *each* training example. Since I cannot execute code here to generate the incorrect outputs and compare them pixel-by-pixel, I will outline the metrics that *should* be gathered if the examples and outputs were available:\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions:**\n    *   Input grid dimensions (height `H_in`, width `W_in`).\n    *   Expected output grid dimensions (height `H_out`, width `W_out`).\n    *   Verify if `H_out == 2 * H_in` and `W_out == 2 * W_in` holds for all examples.\n2.  **Pixel Discrepancies (per example):**\n    *   For each example where the code failed:\n        *   Count the number of pixels where `generated_output[r, c] != expected_output[r, c]`.\n        *   Identify the locations `(r, c)` of these discrepancies.\n        *   Note the incorrect value placed by the code and the correct value expected.\n3.  **Projection Analysis (per example):**\n    *   Identify all non-white pixels in the input.\n    *   Trace their expected influence on the output grid.\n    *   Does the influence extend only vertically (as coded), or also horizontally, diagonally, or based on other rules?\n    *   Is the projected color always azure (8), or does it vary?\n    *   Does the projection stop at other non-white pixels, or does it fill all white pixels along the line?\n4.  **Tiling/Composition Analysis:**\n    *   Does the output consistently look like a 2x2 tiling?\n    *   Is the element being tiled always a modified version of the input grid? How is it modified across different examples?\n\n*Without the visual examples and specific error outputs, I will proceed by refining the hypothesis based on the structure of the previous code and common ARC patterns, specifically incorporating horizontal projection.*\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
