task_description: "Perform a flood fill operation starting from initial Green pixels."

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels representing colors."
    properties:
      - height: integer
      - width: integer
      - pixels: list of lists of integers (0-9)

  - object: pixel
    description: "A single cell within the grid."
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: tuple (row, column)

colors:
  - color: Green (3)
    role: [initial_source, fill_color]
    description: "Pixels with value 3. Act as starting points for the fill and are the color used to fill."
  - color: Orange (7)
    role: [fillable_area]
    description: "Pixels with value 7. These are the pixels eligible to be changed to Green during the fill."
  - color: Azure (8)
    role: [barrier]
    description: "Pixels with value 8. These act as barriers, blocking the spread of the Green fill."

actions:
  - action: identify_seeds
    description: "Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the Green (3) color."
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [list_of_seed_coordinates]

  - action: flood_fill
    description: "Starting from the seed coordinates, change adjacent Orange (7) pixels to Green (3), respecting Azure (8) barriers and grid boundaries."
    inputs: [input_grid, list_of_seed_coordinates]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    details:
      - The fill spreads orthogonally (up, down, left, right).
      - Only pixels that are initially Orange (7) in the input grid can be changed.
      - Azure (8) pixels in the input grid block the spread.
      - The grid boundaries block the spread.
      - Pixels initially Green (3) or Azure (8) remain unchanged.
      - Pixels changed during the fill become Green (3).

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: "Orthogonal adjacency (sharing an edge) determines how the fill spreads."
  - relationship: barrier
    description: "Azure (8) pixels prevent the fill from spreading into or through them."
  - relationship: source
    description: "Initial Green (3) pixels are the origin points for the fill operation."
  - relationship: target
    description: "Orange (7) pixels are the only targets for the fill color change."
