            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input grids are relatively small (3x3 in all examples), while the output grids are significantly larger (9x9). The output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions in both height and width.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grid appears to be constructed from smaller blocks, each the same size as the input grid (3x3). The output can be visualized as a 3x3 arrangement of these blocks.\n3.  **Block Content**: Each block in the 3x3 output arrangement is either a direct copy of the entire input grid or a block filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  **Pattern Determination**: The key challenge is determining *which* blocks in the output grid contain the copy of the input grid and which contain zeros. This placement pattern seems to be derived directly from the input grid itself.\n5.  **Pattern Rule**: By analyzing the examples, a consistent rule emerges:\n    *   Find the non-zero color that appears most frequently in the input grid.\n    *   Create a \"pattern\" grid (same size as the input) where cells are marked 'True' if they contain this most frequent color, and 'False' otherwise.\n    *   Use this pattern grid to construct the output: if the pattern grid cell at `(r, c)` is 'True', place a copy of the *entire* input grid into the corresponding block `(r, c)` of the output grid. If 'False', fill that block with zeros.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
