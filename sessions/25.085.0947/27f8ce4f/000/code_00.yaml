task_description: Construct a larger grid by selectively tiling copies of the input grid based on the locations of its most frequent non-background color.

definitions:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: 3 * H
      - width: 3 * W
      - background_color: 0 (white)
  - object: tile
    type: grid
    value: copy of input_grid
  - object: zero_block
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - value: all cells are 0 (white)
  - object: pattern_grid
    type: grid (boolean)
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - derivation: Based on the locations of the most frequent non-zero color in input_grid.

parameters:
  - name: most_frequent_color
    description: The non-zero color value that occurs most often in the input_grid.
    computation: Count occurrences of each non-zero color in input_grid and find the maximum. (Handle ties if necessary, e.g., by choosing the lowest color value).

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_grid
    to: pattern_grid
    rule: pattern_grid[r][c] = (input_grid[r][c] == most_frequent_color)
  - type: construction
    of: output_grid
    using: [input_grid, pattern_grid, zero_block]
    rule: The output_grid is a 3x3 grid of blocks. Block (br, bc) is a copy of input_grid if pattern_grid[br][bc] is True, otherwise it is zero_block.
