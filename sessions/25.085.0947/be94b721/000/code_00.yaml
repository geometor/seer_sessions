- task: Identify and isolate the largest object
  description: >
    The task involves processing an input grid containing multiple distinct objects,
    each defined by a contiguous block of non-white pixels of the same color.
    The goal is to identify the object with the largest area (pixel count) and
    output only that object, cropped to its bounding box.
  examples:
    - id: train_1
      input_objects:
        - object: L-shape
          color: azure (8)
          pixel_count: 7
        - object: C-shape
          color: orange (7)
          pixel_count: 6
        - object: square
          color: red (2)
          pixel_count: 4
      selected_object:
        object: L-shape
        color: azure (8)
        reason: Largest pixel count (7)
      output: Cropped azure L-shape
    - id: train_2
      input_objects:
        - object: cross-shape
          color: green (3)
          pixel_count: 5
        - object: rectangle
          color: yellow (4)
          pixel_count: 6
        - object: L-shape
          color: magenta (6)
          pixel_count: 3
      selected_object:
        object: rectangle
        color: yellow (4)
        reason: Largest pixel count (6)
      output: Cropped yellow rectangle
    - id: train_3
      input_objects:
        - object: T-shape
          color: orange (7)
          pixel_count: 4
        - object: S-shape
          color: red (2)
          pixel_count: 7
        - object: L-shape
          color: azure (8)
          pixel_count: 4
      selected_object:
        object: S-shape
        color: red (2)
        reason: Largest pixel count (7)
      output: Cropped red S-shape
    - id: train_4
      input_objects:
        - object: S-shape
          color: red (2)
          pixel_count: 7
        - object: L-shape
          color: green (3)
          pixel_count: 4
        - object: triangle-shape
          color: blue (1)
          pixel_count: 5
      selected_object:
        object: S-shape
        color: red (2)
        reason: Largest pixel count (7)
      output: Cropped red S-shape
  rules:
    - rule: Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input grid.
    - rule: Calculate the area (number of pixels) for each identified object.
    - rule: Determine the object with the maximum area. (Assume no ties based on examples).
    - rule: Create the output grid containing only the pixels belonging to the largest object.
    - rule: Crop the output grid to the minimal bounding box enclosing the largest object.
