Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions**: The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 8 columns. The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 4 columns. The height remains the same, while the width is halved.
2.  **Color Palette**:
    *   Input grids use magenta (6), gray (5), and white (0).
    *   Output grids use yellow (4) and white (0).
3.  **Input Structure**: The input grid seems divisible into two equal horizontal halves: columns 0-3 (left half) and columns 4-7 (right half). The left half predominantly features magenta and white, while the right half features gray and white.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The output grid's dimensions (4x4) match the dimensions of the input grid's halves. This strongly suggests a relationship where each cell in the output grid corresponds to a pair of cells in the input grid â€“ one from the left half and one from the right half, specifically at the same row and relative column index within their respective halves.
5.  **Rule Identification**: Observing the examples, a yellow pixel (4) appears in the output grid at position `(r, c)` if and only if the input grid pixels at `(r, c)` *and* `(r, c + 4)` are both white (0). In all other cases, the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).

      input_cell_left: input[row, col]
      input_cell_right: input[row, col + 4] # 4 is the width of the left_half
      condition:
        if input_cell_left == 0 (white) AND input_cell_right == 0 (white):
          output[row, col] = 4 (yellow)
        else:
          output[row, col] = 0 (white)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same number of rows as the input grid and half the number of columns (4 rows, 4 columns).
2.  Initialize all cells of this new output grid to white (0).
3.  For each row `r` (from 0 to 3) and each column `c` (from 0 to 3):
    a.  Examine the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the input grid.
    b.  Examine the color of the cell at `(r, c + 4)` in the input grid (this is the corresponding cell in the right half).
    c.  If both the cell at `(r, c)` and the cell at `(r, c + 4)` in the input grid are white (0), then set the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the output grid to yellow (4).
    d.  Otherwise, leave the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the output grid as white (0).
4.  The resulting grid is the final output.
