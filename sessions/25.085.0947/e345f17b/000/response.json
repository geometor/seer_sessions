The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 4 columns. The height remains the same, while the width is halved.\n2.  **Color Palette**:\n    *   Input grids use magenta (6), gray (5), and white (0).\n    *   Output grids use yellow (4) and white (0).\n3.  **Input Structure**: The input grid seems divisible into two equal horizontal halves: columns 0-3 (left half) and columns 4-7 (right half). The left half predominantly features magenta and white, while the right half features gray and white.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The output grid's dimensions (4x4) match the dimensions of the input grid's halves. This strongly suggests a relationship where each cell in the output grid corresponds to a pair of cells in the input grid \u2013 one from the left half and one from the right half, specifically at the same row and relative column index within their respective halves.\n5.  **Rule Identification**: Observing the examples, a yellow pixel (4) appears in the output grid at position `(r, c)` if and only if the input grid pixels at `(r, c)` *and* `(r, c + 4)` are both white (0). In all other cases, the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
