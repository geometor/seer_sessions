*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain various colored shapes (green, yellow, orange) on a white background.
    *   The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids.
    *   In the output grids, the original white background pixels are consistently replaced with gray pixels.
    *   The colored shapes from the input appear shifted one position to the left in the output grid.
    *   If a colored pixel from the input shifts off the left edge of the grid (column index becomes less than 0), it disappears.
    *   The original colors of the shapes are preserved in their new, shifted positions.
    *   Positions in the output grid that correspond to originally white pixels in the input, *and* do not receive a shifted colored pixel, become gray.
    *   Positions in the output grid that correspond to originally colored pixels in the input, but whose color shifts away, also become gray. This simplifies to: initialize the output as gray and only overwrite with shifted colors.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
      colors_present: Input contains white (0) background and other colors (e.g., green(3), yellow(4), orange(7)). Output contains gray (5) and the original non-white colors.
    elements:
      - element: background
        properties:
          input_color: white (0)
          output_color: gray (5)
      - element: colored_pixels
        properties:
          input_color: Any color except white (0)
          output_color: Same as input_color
        actions:
          - action: horizontal_shift
            direction: left
            distance: 1 column
            boundary_condition: Pixels shifting beyond the left edge (column < 0) are removed.
    transformation_summary:
      - step: 1. Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with gray (5).
      - step: 2. For each pixel in the input grid that is not white (0), located at (row, col), copy its color to the output grid at position (row, col - 1), but only if col - 1 is a valid column index (>= 0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Fill the entire output grid with the gray color (5).
    3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates (row, column).
    4.  If the color of the input pixel is not white (0) and its column index is greater than 0 (i.e., `column > 0`):
        a.  Determine the target position in the output grid by shifting one column to the left: (row, column - 1).
        b.  Set the color of the pixel at the target position (row, column - 1) in the output grid to the color of the input pixel at (row, column).
    5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
