Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The examples show 5x11 grids.
2.  **Key Elements:** The transformation focuses on a specific row in the grid. This row is characterized by containing exactly two non-white pixels (pixels with values > 0). In both examples, these two pixels are located at the far left (column 0) and far right (column 10) of their respective rows.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens *between* these two non-white pixels on the identified row. The space between them is filled with colors related to the original two pixels and a specific gray color (5).
4.  **Filling Pattern:**
    *   The pixels immediately to the right of the leftmost non-white pixel are filled with the *same color* as the leftmost pixel.
    *   The pixels immediately to the left of the rightmost non-white pixel are filled with the *same color* as the rightmost pixel.
    *   There is a single gray pixel (color 5) placed exactly in the middle of the horizontal segment between the original two non-white pixels.
    *   All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between two uniquely positioned non-white pixels on a single row, using their colors and a central gray marker.

definitions:
  - &grid Represents the 2D array of pixels.
  - &pixel A single cell in the grid with a color value (0-9).
  - &non_white_pixel A pixel with a color value > 0.
  - &target_row The unique row in the input grid that contains exactly two non_white_pixels.
  - &left_pixel The non_white_pixel with the smaller column index on the target_row.
  - &right_pixel The non_white_pixel with the larger column index on the target_row.
  - &midpoint_column The column index calculated as the integer division floor of the sum of the column indices of left_pixel and right_pixel divided by 2. `(left_pixel.column + right_pixel.column) // 2`.
  - &gray_color The color gray, represented by the value 5.

observations:
  - input_grid: *grid
  - output_grid: *grid
  - transformation_scope: Limited to the identified target_row. All other rows are identical between input and output.
  - target_row_criteria: Contains exactly two non_white_pixels. Assumed to be unique per grid based on examples.
  - identified_pixels:
    - In train_1:
      - left_pixel: { color: green (3), row: 3, column: 0 }
      - right_pixel: { color: orange (7), row: 3, column: 10 }
      - midpoint_column: (0 + 10) // 2 = 5
    - In train_2:
      - left_pixel: { color: blue (1), row: 1, column: 0 }
      - right_pixel: { color: red (2), row: 1, column: 10 }
      - midpoint_column: (0 + 10) // 2 = 5
  - fill_actions_on_target_row:
    - Pixels from `left_pixel.column + 1` up to `midpoint_column - 1` are filled with `left_pixel.color`.
    - The pixel at `midpoint_column` is filled with `gray_color` (5).
    - Pixels from `midpoint_column + 1` up to `right_pixel.column - 1` are filled with `right_pixel.color`.
  - preserved_pixels_on_target_row: The `left_pixel` and `right_pixel` retain their original positions and colors in the output grid.

assumptions:
  - There will be exactly one row in the input grid that meets the target_row_criteria.
  - The column index of left_pixel will always be less than the column index of right_pixel.
  - The distance between left_pixel and right_pixel ( `right_pixel.column - left_pixel.column`) will be greater than 1, allowing space for at least the gray midpoint pixel.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Target Row:** Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, count the number of non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0). Identify the single row (`target_row_index`) that contains exactly two non-white pixels.
3.  **Identify Boundary Pixels:** On the `target_row_index`, find the two non-white pixels. Record the one with the smaller column index as `left_pixel` (noting its column `c_left` and color `C_left`) and the one with the larger column index as `right_pixel` (noting its column `c_right` and color `C_right`).
4.  **Calculate Midpoint:** Compute the middle column index `c_mid` between `c_left` and `c_right` using integer division: `c_mid = (c_left + c_right) // 2`.
5.  **Fill Left Segment:** Iterate through the columns `c` from `c_left + 1` up to (but not including) `c_mid`. For each column `c`, set the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `c`) in the output grid to `C_left`.
6.  **Place Gray Marker:** Set the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `c_mid`) in the output grid to gray (5).
7.  **Fill Right Segment:** Iterate through the columns `c` from `c_mid + 1` up to (but not including) `c_right`. For each column `c`, set the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `c`) in the output grid to `C_right`.
8.  **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
