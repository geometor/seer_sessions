The examples show 5x11 grids.\n2.  **Key Elements:** The transformation focuses on a specific row in the grid. This row is characterized by containing exactly two non-white pixels (pixels with values > 0). In both examples, these two pixels are located at the far left (column 0) and far right (column 10) of their respective rows.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens *between* these two non-white pixels on the identified row. The space between them is filled with colors related to the original two pixels and a specific gray color (5).\n4.  **Filling Pattern:**\n    *   The pixels immediately to the right of the leftmost non-white pixel are filled with the *same color* as the leftmost pixel.\n    *   The pixels immediately to the left of the rightmost non-white pixel are filled with the *same color* as the rightmost pixel.\n    *   There is a single gray pixel (color 5) placed exactly in the middle of the horizontal segment between the original two non-white pixels.\n    *   All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

For each row, count the number of non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0). Identify the single row (`target_row_index`) that contains exactly two non-white pixels.\n3.  **Identify Boundary Pixels:** On the `target_row_index`, find the two non-white pixels. Record the one with the smaller column index as `left_pixel` (noting its column `c_left` and color `C_left`) and the one with the larger column index as `right_pixel` (noting its column `c_right` and color `C_right`).\n4.  **Calculate Midpoint:** Compute the middle column index `c_mid` between `c_left` and `c_right` using integer division: `c_mid = (c_left + c_right) // 2`.\n5.  **Fill Left Segment:** Iterate through the columns `c` from `c_left + 1` up to (but not including) `c_mid`. For each column `c`, set the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `c`) in the output grid to `C_left`.\n6.  **Place Gray Marker:** Set the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `c_mid`) in the output grid to gray (5).\n7.  **Fill Right Segment:** Iterate through the columns `c` from `c_mid + 1` up to (but not including) `c_right`. For each column `c`, set the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `c`) in the output grid to `C_right`.\n8.  **Return Output:** The modified grid is the final output."
