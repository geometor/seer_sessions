task_description: Fill the horizontal gap between two uniquely positioned non-white pixels on a single row, using their colors and a central gray marker.

definitions:
  - &grid Represents the 2D array of pixels.
  - &pixel A single cell in the grid with a color value (0-9).
  - &non_white_pixel A pixel with a color value > 0.
  - &target_row The unique row in the input grid that contains exactly two non_white_pixels.
  - &left_pixel The non_white_pixel with the smaller column index on the target_row.
  - &right_pixel The non_white_pixel with the larger column index on the target_row.
  - &midpoint_column The column index calculated as the integer division floor of the sum of the column indices of left_pixel and right_pixel divided by 2. `(left_pixel.column + right_pixel.column) // 2`.
  - &gray_color The color gray, represented by the value 5.

observations:
  - input_grid: *grid
  - output_grid: *grid
  - transformation_scope: Limited to the identified target_row. All other rows are identical between input and output.
  - target_row_criteria: Contains exactly two non_white_pixels. Assumed to be unique per grid based on examples.
  - identified_pixels:
    - In train_1:
      - left_pixel: { color: green (3), row: 3, column: 0 }
      - right_pixel: { color: orange (7), row: 3, column: 10 }
      - midpoint_column: (0 + 10) // 2 = 5
    - In train_2:
      - left_pixel: { color: blue (1), row: 1, column: 0 }
      - right_pixel: { color: red (2), row: 1, column: 10 }
      - midpoint_column: (0 + 10) // 2 = 5
  - fill_actions_on_target_row:
    - Pixels from `left_pixel.column + 1` up to `midpoint_column - 1` are filled with `left_pixel.color`.
    - The pixel at `midpoint_column` is filled with `gray_color` (5).
    - Pixels from `midpoint_column + 1` up to `right_pixel.column - 1` are filled with `right_pixel.color`.
  - preserved_pixels_on_target_row: The `left_pixel` and `right_pixel` retain their original positions and colors in the output grid.

assumptions:
  - There will be exactly one row in the input grid that meets the target_row_criteria.
  - The column index of left_pixel will always be less than the column index of right_pixel.
  - The distance between left_pixel and right_pixel ( `right_pixel.column - left_pixel.column`) will be greater than 1, allowing space for at least the gray midpoint pixel.
