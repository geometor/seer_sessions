Let's call this the \"marker color\".\n\nThe output grids are identical to the input grids, except that some white pixels (0) have been changed to red (2).\n\nThe red pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of marker-colored pixels that reside within the same row. Specifically, if two marker pixels exist in a row, and all the pixels horizontally situated strictly between them are white, then those white pixels are changed to red in the output. If there are more than two marker pixels in a row, this filling process applies to every consecutive pair of marker pixels in that row. Pixels outside these horizontal segments, including the marker pixels themselves, remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
