task_description: Fill horizontal segments between pairs of marker pixels in each row with red.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: marker_pixel
    description: A pixel whose color is the single non-white color present in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Varies per example (8, 4, 1, 3)
      - is_non_white: true
  - type: white_pixel
    description: A pixel with color 0.
  - type: red_pixel
    description: A pixel with color 2, appearing only in the output.
  - type: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels in the grid.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Pixels located next to each other in the same row.
  - type: horizontal_segment
    description: A sequence of pixels within a single row, located strictly between two marker pixels.

actions:
  - name: identify_marker_color
    description: Determine the single non-white color present in the input grid.
  - name: find_marker_pairs_in_row
    description: For each row, locate all pairs of marker pixels. If more than two exist, consider consecutive pairs (1st-2nd, 2nd-3rd, etc.).
  - name: check_segment_pixels
    description: For a given pair of marker pixels in a row, examine all pixels horizontally between them.
  - name: fill_segment
    description: If all pixels within a horizontal segment between two marker pixels are white (0), change their color to red (2).

transformation:
  - input: grid
  - steps:
    - Identify the marker color (the single non-white color in the input).
    - Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    - For each row in the input grid:
      - Find the column indices of all pixels with the marker color.
      - If there are two or more marker pixels in the row:
        - Iterate through consecutive pairs of these marker pixel indices (index_A, index_B).
        - Check if all pixels in the row between column index_A + 1 and index_B - 1 (inclusive) are white (0).
        - If they are all white, change the color of these pixels in the output grid (from column index_A + 1 to index_B - 1) to red (2).
  - output: modified grid
