Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is 'white' (0).
2.  **Base Layer:** In all examples, there's a solid row of 'azure' (8) pixels at the very bottom of the grid. This row remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Objects:** Above the 'azure' base, there are various objects composed of contiguous pixels of a single color (e.g., blue, red, green, etc.). These objects have different shapes and sizes.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the objects located above the 'azure' base. They seem to move towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
5.  **Settling/Stacking:** The objects settle against the right edge of the grid, stacking vertically upwards from the 'azure' base row. The relative vertical order of the objects in the final stack appears related to their original vertical positions, but specifically, they stack based on which object would land first if pulled towards the bottom-right. Objects originally higher up land later and thus higher in the final stack. The objects maintain their original shapes and colors.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white).
  dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30).

identified_elements:
  - element: base_platform
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
      - shape: horizontal line spanning grid width
      - location: bottom-most row
      - behavior: static, remains unchanged in output.
  - element: movable_objects
    properties:
      - color: any color except 0 (white) and 8 (azure)
      - shape: contiguous block(s) of a single color
      - location: initially positioned above the base_platform
      - behavior: dynamic, repositioned in the output.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: gravity_and_slide
    description: >-
      Movable objects are subject to a force pulling them downwards and
      towards the right edge of the grid.
    target: movable_objects
  - rule: settling
    description: >-
      Objects stop moving when they encounter the base_platform or another
      object that has already settled.
    target: movable_objects
  - rule: stacking_and_alignment
    description: >-
      Settled objects align their rightmost edge with the rightmost column
      of the grid. They stack vertically, with objects settling first forming
      the lower layers of the stack. The order of settling is determined by
      which object, under the influence of the down-right gravity, would
      reach a resting position first. Objects maintain their original shape.
    target: movable_objects
  - rule: preservation
    description: >-
      The base_platform remains in its original position. The shape and color
      of movable_objects are preserved. All areas not occupied by the
      base_platform or settled objects become the background color.
    target: all_elements

input_output_relationship:
  - The output grid shows the final state after all movable objects have settled
    against the right edge, stacked upon the base_platform according to the
    gravity, settling, and stacking rules.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or create a new grid of the same dimensions filled with the background color ('white', 0).
2.  Identify the 'azure' (8) base row in the input grid (typically the bottom-most row). Copy this row directly to the corresponding position in the output grid.
3.  Identify all distinct, contiguous objects in the input grid that are *not* 'white' (0) and *not* part of the 'azure' (8) base row. Record their shape, color, and original coordinates.
4.  Simulate a "gravity" process pulling all identified objects downwards and towards the right edge of the grid.
5.  Determine the settling order: Objects settle when they hit the 'azure' base or another already settled object. Objects that would hit a resting surface (base or another settled object) first, considering both downward and rightward movement, settle first.
6.  Place the objects into the output grid according to their settling order:
    *   For each object, position it so its rightmost pixel(s) are in the last column (grid width - 1).
    *   Vertically, position the object so its bottommost pixel(s) rest directly on top of the highest occupied pixel(s) below it in the columns it will occupy (this could be the 'azure' base or the top surface of previously settled objects).
    *   Ensure the object retains its original shape and color.
7.  Ensure all cells in the output grid not occupied by the 'azure' base or the settled objects are set to the background color ('white', 0).
8.  Return the completed output grid.
