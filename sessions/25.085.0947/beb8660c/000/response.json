            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The background is 'white' (0).\n2.  **Base Layer:** In all examples, there's a solid row of 'azure' (8) pixels at the very bottom of the grid. This row remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** Above the 'azure' base, there are various objects composed of contiguous pixels of a single color (e.g., blue, red, green, etc.). These objects have different shapes and sizes.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the objects located above the 'azure' base. They seem to move towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n5.  **Settling/Stacking:** The objects settle against the right edge of the grid, stacking vertically upwards from the 'azure' base row. The relative vertical order of the objects in the final stack appears related to their original vertical positions, but specifically, they stack based on which object would land first if pulled towards the bottom-right. Objects originally higher up land later and thus higher in the final stack. The objects maintain their original shapes and colors.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or create a new grid of the same dimensions filled with the background color ('white', 0).\n2.

Simulate a \"gravity\" process pulling all identified objects downwards and towards the right edge of the grid.\n5.  Determine the settling order: Objects settle when they hit the 'azure' base or another already settled object. Objects that would hit a resting surface (base or another settled object) first, considering both downward and rightward movement, settle first.\n6.  Place the objects into the output grid according to their settling order:\n    *   For each object, position it so its rightmost pixel(s) are in the last column (grid width - 1).\n    *   Vertically, position the object so its bottommost pixel(s) rest directly on top of the highest occupied pixel(s) below it in the columns it will occupy (this could be the 'azure' base or the top surface of previously settled objects).\n    *   Ensure the object retains its original shape and color.\n7.  Ensure all cells in the output grid not occupied by the 'azure' base or the settled objects are set to the background color ('white', 0).\n8.  Return the completed output grid."
