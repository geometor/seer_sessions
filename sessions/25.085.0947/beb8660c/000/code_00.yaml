task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  background_color: 0 (white).
  dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30).

identified_elements:
  - element: base_platform
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
      - shape: horizontal line spanning grid width
      - location: bottom-most row
      - behavior: static, remains unchanged in output.
  - element: movable_objects
    properties:
      - color: any color except 0 (white) and 8 (azure)
      - shape: contiguous block(s) of a single color
      - location: initially positioned above the base_platform
      - behavior: dynamic, repositioned in the output.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: gravity_and_slide
    description: >-
      Movable objects are subject to a force pulling them downwards and
      towards the right edge of the grid.
    target: movable_objects
  - rule: settling
    description: >-
      Objects stop moving when they encounter the base_platform or another
      object that has already settled.
    target: movable_objects
  - rule: stacking_and_alignment
    description: >-
      Settled objects align their rightmost edge with the rightmost column
      of the grid. They stack vertically, with objects settling first forming
      the lower layers of the stack. The order of settling is determined by
      which object, under the influence of the down-right gravity, would
      reach a resting position first. Objects maintain their original shape.
    target: movable_objects
  - rule: preservation
    description: >-
      The base_platform remains in its original position. The shape and color
      of movable_objects are preserved. All areas not occupied by the
      base_platform or settled objects become the background color.
    target: all_elements

input_output_relationship:
  - The output grid shows the final state after all movable objects have settled
    against the right edge, stacked upon the base_platform according to the
    gravity, settling, and stacking rules.
