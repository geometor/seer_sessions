The bottom row `[8, 1, 7, 7, 1]` of the input becomes the top row of the output. The middle row `[2, 7, 8, 7, 2]` remains in the middle. This suggests a vertical flip or reflection across the horizontal midline.\n    *   This pattern holds true for `train_2` and `train_3` as well. The order of the rows is completely reversed.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
