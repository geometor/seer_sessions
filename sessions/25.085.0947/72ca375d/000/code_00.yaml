task_type: object_selection_and_cropping
input_description: A grid containing a white background and multiple distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-white color).
output_description: A smaller grid representing the content of the bounding box of a single selected object from the input grid.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - shape: variable, contiguous block of pixels
      - area: number of pixels in the object
      - bounding_box: minimum rectangular region enclosing the object
      - bounding_box_area: width * height of the bounding box
      - density: area / bounding_box_area
relationships:
  - Multiple objects exist within each input grid.
  - The output grid corresponds to exactly one input object.
selection_rule:
  - primary_criterion: Select the object(s) with the maximum density.
  - tie_breaker: If multiple objects have the maximum density, select the one with the largest area among them.
output_generation:
  - action: Extract the subgrid from the input corresponding to the bounding box of the selected object.
