Find all distinct non-white objects using **8-connectivity**.\n2.  Calculate the density (area / bounding box area) for each object.\n3.  Select the object with the **maximum density**.\n4.  If there is a tie in maximum density, select the object with the **maximum area** among the tied objects.\n5.  If there is still a tie (same max density and same max area), select the object whose bounding box's **top-left corner** (minimum row, then minimum column) appears **first** in the grid (minimum row index, then minimum column index). (Need to check this tie-breaker rule properly). Let's re-check Ex 3 tie-break. Actually, there was no tie in Ex 3 using 8-connectivity. The Gray object uniquely had the max density of 0.75.\n6.  The output is the subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of the selected object.\n\nLet's verify this rule (8-conn, max density, max area tie-break):\n*   Example 1 (8-conn): Yellow(1.0), Azure(0.75), Red(0.7). Max density=1.0 (Yellow). Selected: Yellow. Output: Yellow BBox. **Correct.**\n*   Example 2 (8-conn): Red(0.625), Orange(0.667), Magenta(0.75). Max density=0.75 (Magenta). Selected: Magenta. Output: Magenta BBox. **Correct.**\n*   Example 3 (8-conn): Green(~0.667), Gray(0.75), Azure(~0.643). Max density=0.75 (Gray). Selected: Gray. Output: Gray BBox. **Correct.**\n\nThis rule seems consistent across all three examples. The key changes are using 8-connectivity for object finding and clarifying the selection criteria (max density, then max area). The previous code failed on Example 2 likely because it used 4-connectivity, which resulted in multiple orange objects, one of which had density 1.0 and was incorrectly selected over the magenta object (which had density 0.75).\n\nThe discrepancy between my initial manual trace for Ex 2 (where I thought Magenta had max density with 4-conn) and the tool output/revised analysis highlights the importance of precise object definition (connectivity) and careful calculation. The tool output showing `[[7]]` was correct *given the faulty 4-connectivity assumption in the code*.\n\nNow, structure the response.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code implements a transformation based on finding objects, calculating their density (area / bounding box area), and selecting the object with the highest density, using largest area as a tie-breaker. This logic successfully processed Example 1 and Example 3 but failed on Example 2, producing `[[7]]` instead of the expected magenta shape's bounding box.\n\nThe failure analysis suggests the core issue lies in how objects are identified (connectivity) and potentially how density is calculated or compared. My initial manual analysis incorrectly calculated densities or object boundaries for Example 2 under 4-connectivity. Running the code via `tool_code` revealed that under 4-connectivity (as implemented), the orange shape in Example 2 breaks into multiple objects, one of which achieves a density of 1.0, leading to its incorrect selection.\n\nRe-evaluating all examples using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) for object definition resolves the discrepancies:\n- Example 1: Yellow (density 1.0) is still selected.\n- Example 2: Objects become Red (0.625), Orange (0.667), Magenta (0.75). Magenta has the highest density and is correctly selected.\n- Example 3: Objects become Green (~0.667), Gray (0.75), Azure (~0.643). Gray has the highest density and is correctly selected.\n\nThe strategy is to update the object finding algorithm to use 8-connectivity and confirm the selection criteria (max density, then max area).\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nUsing `tool_code` to analyze the object properties with the correct (hypothesized) 8-connectivity rule:\n\n"
