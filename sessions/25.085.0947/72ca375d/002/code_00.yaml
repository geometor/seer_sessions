- task_description: Extract a subgrid corresponding to the bounding box of a specific object within the input grid.
- inputs: Grids containing multiple distinct, non-white objects.
- outputs: Subgrids representing the bounding box of the selected object.
- object_identification:
    - Objects are contiguous areas of the same non-white color.
    - Connectivity: 8-connectivity (including diagonals) must be used.
- object_properties:
    - color: The color of the object's pixels.
    - pixels: The set of coordinates {(r, c)} belonging to the object.
    - area: The number of pixels in the object.
    - bbox: The bounding box defined by (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
    - bbox_area: The area of the bounding box (height * width).
    - density: The ratio of the object's area to its bounding box area (area / bbox_area).
- selection_criteria:
    - primary: Select the object with the maximum density.
    - secondary_tie_breaker: If multiple objects share the maximum density, select the one with the maximum area.
    - tertiary_tie_breaker: If multiple objects still tie (max density and max area), select the one whose bounding box's top-left corner (min_row, min_col) appears first (minimum row index, then minimum column index). (Note: This rule wasn't required for the training examples but is added for completeness based on common ARC patterns).
- transformation_action: Extract the subgrid from the input grid defined by the bounding box of the selected object.
