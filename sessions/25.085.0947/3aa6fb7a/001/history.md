**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids consist of a `white` background (color 0) populated with several `azure` pixels (color 8). These `azure` pixels often form small clusters or shapes.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but with the addition of some `blue` pixels (color 1). These `blue` pixels appear in positions that were previously `white`.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies specific local patterns in the input grid and modifies them. By comparing the input and output grids, it appears that the `blue` pixels are strategically placed to 'complete' specific shapes formed by the `azure` pixels.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The key pattern involves 2x2 areas within the grid. When a 2x2 area contains exactly three `azure` pixels and one `white` pixel, the `white` pixel in that area is changed to `blue` in the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_elements:
          - type: pixels
            color: azure (8)
            arrangement: often form small clusters or shapes

transformation:
  - type: local pattern detection and modification
  - pattern:
      - scope: 2x2 subgrids
      - condition: exactly three azure (8) pixels and one white (0) pixel
  - action:
      - target: the white (0) pixel within the matched 2x2 pattern
      - change: color to blue (1)
  - default_action: keep original pixel color if no pattern is matched

input_output_relationship:
  - The output grid retains the structure and colors of the input grid, except where the specific 2x2 pattern is found.
  - The transformation adds blue (1) pixels based on the local configuration of azure (8) pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through every possible 2x2 square area within the input grid. A 2x2 area is defined by its top-left corner coordinates (row, col), covering cells (row, col), (row+1, col), (row, col+1), and (row+1, col+1). This iteration should cover all possible top-left corners from (0, 0) up to (height-2, width-2).
3.  For each 2x2 area:
    a.  Count the number of `azure` (8) pixels and `white` (0) pixels within that area.
    b.  Check if the count is exactly three `azure` pixels and one `white` pixel.
    c.  If the condition in step 3b is met:
        i.  Identify the coordinates (r, c) of the single `white` pixel within that 2x2 area.
        ii. Update the corresponding cell at coordinates (r, c) in the *output* grid to `blue` (1).
4.  After checking all possible 2x2 areas, return the modified output grid.
