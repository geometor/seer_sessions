task_elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_elements:
          - type: pixels
            color: azure (8)
            arrangement: often form small clusters or shapes

transformation:
  - type: local pattern detection and modification
  - pattern:
      - scope: 2x2 subgrids
      - condition: exactly three azure (8) pixels and one white (0) pixel
  - action:
      - target: the white (0) pixel within the matched 2x2 pattern
      - change: color to blue (1)
  - default_action: keep original pixel color if no pattern is matched

input_output_relationship:
  - The output grid retains the structure and colors of the input grid, except where the specific 2x2 pattern is found.
  - The transformation adds blue (1) pixels based on the local configuration of azure (8) pixels.
