These `azure` pixels often form small clusters or shapes.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are largely identical to the input grids, but with the addition of some `blue` pixels (color 1). These `blue` pixels appear in positions that were previously `white`.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies specific local patterns in the input grid and modifies them. By comparing the input and output grids, it appears that the `blue` pixels are strategically placed to 'complete' specific shapes formed by the `azure` pixels.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The key pattern involves 2x2 areas within the grid. When a 2x2 area contains exactly three `azure` pixels and one `white` pixel, the `white` pixel in that area is changed to `blue` in the output. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
