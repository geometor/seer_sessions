Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions (6x9 in all provided examples).
2.  **Colors Used:** The grids primarily use white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).
3.  **Object Identification:**
    *   There are consistently two distinct objects in the input grids: one composed of azure pixels and one composed of yellow pixels.
    *   The yellow object appears identical in the input and output grids across all examples, suggesting it remains unchanged.
    *   The azure object changes between the input and output. The output grid contains the original azure object plus additional azure pixels.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The additional azure pixels in the output appear to form a horizontal reflection of the original azure object.
5.  **Reflection Axis:** The axis of reflection is not fixed relative to the grid boundaries. It seems related to the bounding box of the azure object itself.
    *   In Example 1, the reflection occurs across the right edge of the azure object's bounding box.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the reflection occurs across the left edge of the azure object's bounding box.
6.  **Determining Reflection Side:** The choice between reflecting across the left or right edge appears to depend on the distribution of azure pixels within the object's bounding box. Specifically, comparing the count of azure pixels in the leftmost column versus the rightmost column of the bounding box seems key:
    *   If the counts are equal (Example 1), reflect across the right edge.
    *   If the counts are unequal (Examples 2 & 3), reflect across the left edge.
7.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is formed by taking the input grid and adding the newly generated reflected azure pixels. Existing pixels (including the original azure object and the yellow object) are preserved.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect an azure object horizontally adjacent to itself, preserving all original pixels. The reflection axis (left or right edge of the object's bounding box) depends on pixel distribution at the object's horizontal extremities.
objects:
  - id: azure_object
    color: 8 (azure)
    description: A contiguous shape made of azure pixels. Its form varies between examples.
  - id: yellow_object
    color: 4 (yellow)
    description: A contiguous shape made of yellow pixels. Appears static across examples.
properties:
  - object_id: azure_object
    property: bounding_box
    description: The smallest rectangle enclosing all azure pixels.
    attributes: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]
  - object_id: azure_object
    property: edge_pixel_counts
    description: Count of azure pixels on the leftmost (min_col) and rightmost (max_col) columns of the bounding box.
    attributes: [count_left, count_right]
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1_id: azure_object
    object2_id: yellow_object
    description: In the examples, the yellow object is located below the azure object. This relationship does not seem directly involved in the transformation logic itself, only the azure object matters for reflection.

          For each azure pixel (r, c) in azure_pixels:
          If reflection_axis is 'right':
            Calculate reflected column c' = 2 * bbox.max_col + 1 - c
          If reflection_axis is 'left':
            Calculate reflected column c' = 2 * bbox.min_col - 1 - c
          If the reflected coordinate (r, c') is within grid bounds:
            Set output_grid[r][c'] = 8 (azure)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Make a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Identify all pixels with the azure color (8) in the input grid.
3.  Determine the bounding box of these azure pixels, noting the minimum column index (`min_col`) and maximum column index (`max_col`).
4.  Count the number of azure pixels located in the column `min_col` (let this be `count_left`).
5.  Count the number of azure pixels located in the column `max_col` (let this be `count_right`).
6.  Check if `count_left` is equal to `count_right`.
    *   **If they are equal:** For each original azure pixel at `(row, col)`, calculate its reflected column position `reflected_col = (2 * max_col) + 1 - col`. If the coordinate `(row, reflected_col)` is within the grid boundaries, update the output grid at `(row, reflected_col)` to azure (8).
    *   **If they are not equal:** For each original azure pixel at `(row, col)`, calculate its reflected column position `reflected_col = (2 * min_col) - 1 - col`. If the coordinate `(row, reflected_col)` is within the grid boundaries, update the output grid at `(row, reflected_col)` to azure (8).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
