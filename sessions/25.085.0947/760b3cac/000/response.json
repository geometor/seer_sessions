            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example consists of an input grid and an output grid of the same dimensions (6x9 in all provided examples).\n2.  **Colors Used:** The grids primarily use white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).\n3.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   There are consistently two distinct objects in the input grids: one composed of azure pixels and one composed of yellow pixels.\n    *   The yellow object appears identical in the input and output grids across all examples, suggesting it remains unchanged.\n    *   The azure object changes between the input and output. The output grid contains the original azure object plus additional azure pixels.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The additional azure pixels in the output appear to form a horizontal reflection of the original azure object.\n5.  **Reflection Axis:** The axis of reflection is not fixed relative to the grid boundaries. It seems related to the bounding box of the azure object itself.\n    *   In Example 1, the reflection occurs across the right edge of the azure object's bounding box.\n    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the reflection occurs across the left edge of the azure object's bounding box.\n6.  **Determining Reflection Side:** The choice between reflecting across the left or right edge appears to depend on the distribution of azure pixels within the object's bounding box. Specifically, comparing the count of azure pixels in the leftmost column versus the rightmost column of the bounding box seems key:\n    *   If the counts are equal (Example 1), reflect across the right edge.\n    *   If the counts are unequal (Examples 2 & 3), reflect across the left edge.\n7.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is formed by taking the input grid and adding the newly generated reflected azure pixels. Existing pixels (including the original azure object and the yellow object) are preserved.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
