Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 14 columns. The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 7 columns. The output width is exactly half the input width.
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grid appears to be logically divided into two halves: a left half (columns 0-6) and a right half (columns 7-13). Each half has the same dimensions as the output grid (4x7).
3.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Inputs use white (0), green (3), and red (2). The green pixels seem primarily confined to the left half, and the red pixels seem primarily confined to the right half, although white pixels appear in both.
    *   Outputs use only white (0) and gray (5).
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be derived by comparing the left and right halves of the input grid positionally. A gray (5) pixel appears in the output at a specific coordinate (row, col) if, and only if, the pixels at that same coordinate (row, col) in *both* the left half *and* the right half of the input grid are white (0). If either corresponding input pixel (or both) is non-white (green or red), the output pixel at that coordinate is white (0).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the input grid horizontally into two equal halves: a left grid (columns 0-6) and a right grid (columns 7-13). Both halves will have the same dimensions (4x7).
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as one of the halves (4x7), initially filled with white pixels.
3.  Iterate through each pixel position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `6`.
4.  For each position (`r`, `c`):
    *   Check the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the left grid.
    *   Check the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the right grid.
    *   If *both* the pixel in the left grid and the pixel in the right grid are white (0), then set the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to gray (5).
    *   Otherwise (if at least one of the corresponding input pixels is not white), the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid remains white (0).
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
