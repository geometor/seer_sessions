task_context:
  input_grid:
    description: A grid representing two distinct patterns side-by-side.
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 14
      colors_present: [white, green, red]
      structure:
        type: bipartite_horizontal
        left_half:
          columns: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
          dominant_color: green (aside from white)
        right_half:
          columns: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
          dominant_color: red (aside from white)
  output_grid:
    description: A grid derived from comparing the two halves of the input grid.
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 7
      colors_present: [white, gray]
relationship:
  type: pixelwise_comparison
  input_source_1: left_half of input_grid
  input_source_2: right_half of input_grid
  output_target: output_grid
  condition:
    description: A specific condition must be met at corresponding pixel locations in both input halves.
    rule: If the pixel at (row, col) in input_source_1 is white AND the pixel at (row, col) in input_source_2 is white.
  action:
    description: Determine the color of the pixel at (row, col) in the output_target based on the condition.
    outcome_if_true: Set output_target pixel at (row, col) to gray.
    outcome_if_false: Set output_target pixel at (row, col) to white.
