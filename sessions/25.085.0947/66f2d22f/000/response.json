The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 7 columns. The output width is exactly half the input width.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The input grid appears to be logically divided into two halves: a left half (columns 0-6) and a right half (columns 7-13). Each half has the same dimensions as the output grid (4x7).\n3.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Inputs use white (0), green (3), and red (2). The green pixels seem primarily confined to the left half, and the red pixels seem primarily confined to the right half, although white pixels appear in both.\n    *   Outputs use only white (0) and gray (5).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be derived by comparing the left and right halves of the input grid positionally. A gray (5) pixel appears in the output at a specific coordinate (row, col) if, and only if, the pixels at that same coordinate (row, col) in *both* the left half *and* the right half of the input grid are white (0). If either corresponding input pixel (or both) is non-white (green or red), the output pixel at that coordinate is white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
