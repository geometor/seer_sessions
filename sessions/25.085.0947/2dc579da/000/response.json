There are two prominent lines: one perfectly horizontal and one perfectly vertical, spanning the entire width and height of the grid, respectively. These lines intersect at a single point. The lines are composed of a single color, which is different from the background color.\n2.  **Unique Pixel**: Besides the background and the line colors, there is exactly one pixel in each input grid with a unique color, different from both the background and the lines.\n3.  **Quadrants**: The horizontal and vertical lines divide the input grid into four distinct rectangular regions or quadrants (excluding the lines themselves).\n4.  **Target Quadrant**: The unique pixel identified in step 2 is located within one of these four quadrants.\n5.  **Output Grid**: The output grid is a copy of the content within the specific quadrant that contains the unique pixel. The dimensions of the output grid match the dimensions of that quadrant. The lines themselves are not part of the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify the horizontal line: Find the single row that consists entirely of a color different from the background color. Record its row index.\n3.  Identify the vertical line: Find the single column that consists entirely of a color different from the background color. Record its column index.\n4.  Identify the target pixel: Scan the grid to find the single pixel whose color is different from the background color *and* different from the color(s) of the horizontal and vertical lines. Record its row and column index.\n5.  Determine the target quadrant based on the target pixel's location relative to the lines:\n    *   If the target pixel's row index is less than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is less than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Top-Left region.\n    *   If the target pixel's row index is less than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is greater than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Top-Right region.\n    *   If the target pixel's row index is greater than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is less than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Bottom-Left region.\n    *   If the target pixel's row index is greater than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is greater than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Bottom-Right region.\n6.  Define the row and column ranges for the target quadrant:\n    *   Top-Left: Rows from 0 up to (but not including) the horizontal line index. Columns from 0 up to (but not including) the vertical line index.\n    *   Top-Right: Rows from 0 up to (but not including) the horizontal line index. Columns from (vertical line index + 1) to the end of the grid width.\n    *   Bottom-Left: Rows from (horizontal line index + 1) to the end of the grid height. Columns from 0 up to (but not including) the vertical line index.\n    *   Bottom-Right: Rows from (horizontal line index + 1) to the end of the grid height.
