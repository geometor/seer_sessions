task_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - contains a dominant background color
      - contains a single full-width horizontal line of a distinct color
      - contains a single full-height vertical line of a distinct color (can be same as horizontal)
      - contains exactly one pixel of a third unique color (target pixel)
      - lines divide the grid into four quadrants

objects:
  - name: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - single color
      - spans grid width
      - distinct from background color
  - name: vertical_line
    properties:
      - single color
      - spans grid height
      - distinct from background color
  - name: target_pixel
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - unique color (different from background and lines)
      - located in one of the four quadrants defined by the lines
  - name: background
    properties:
      - most frequent color in the grid
  - name: quadrants
    properties:
      - four rectangular regions defined by the lines (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)

actions:
  - name: identify_lines
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: horizontal_line, vertical_line
    description: Find the row index of the horizontal line and the column index of the vertical line.
  - name: identify_target_pixel
    inputs: input_grid, horizontal_line, vertical_line, background
    outputs: target_pixel_location, target_pixel_color
    description: Find the coordinates and color of the single pixel that is not the background color and not part of the lines.
  - name: determine_target_quadrant
    inputs: target_pixel_location, horizontal_line_index, vertical_line_index
    outputs: target_quadrant_definition (e.g., top-left, ranges of rows/columns)
    description: Determine which of the four quadrants contains the target pixel based on its location relative to the line indices.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    inputs: input_grid, target_quadrant_definition
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the pixels from the input grid within the row and column ranges defined by the target quadrant.

relationships:
  - The horizontal and vertical lines define the boundaries of the quadrants.
  - The target_pixel's location determines which quadrant is selected for the output.
  - The output_grid is a subgrid of the input_grid, specifically the content of the target_quadrant.
