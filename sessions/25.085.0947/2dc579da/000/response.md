Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: Each input grid contains a background color filling most cells. There are two prominent lines: one perfectly horizontal and one perfectly vertical, spanning the entire width and height of the grid, respectively. These lines intersect at a single point. The lines are composed of a single color, which is different from the background color.
2.  **Unique Pixel**: Besides the background and the line colors, there is exactly one pixel in each input grid with a unique color, different from both the background and the lines.
3.  **Quadrants**: The horizontal and vertical lines divide the input grid into four distinct rectangular regions or quadrants (excluding the lines themselves).
4.  **Target Quadrant**: The unique pixel identified in step 2 is located within one of these four quadrants.
5.  **Output Grid**: The output grid is a copy of the content within the specific quadrant that contains the unique pixel. The dimensions of the output grid match the dimensions of that quadrant. The lines themselves are not part of the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - contains a dominant background color
      - contains a single full-width horizontal line of a distinct color
      - contains a single full-height vertical line of a distinct color (can be same as horizontal)
      - contains exactly one pixel of a third unique color (target pixel)
      - lines divide the grid into four quadrants

objects:
  - name: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - single color
      - spans grid width
      - distinct from background color
  - name: vertical_line
    properties:
      - single color
      - spans grid height
      - distinct from background color
  - name: target_pixel
    properties:
      - single pixel
      - unique color (different from background and lines)
      - located in one of the four quadrants defined by the lines
  - name: background
    properties:
      - most frequent color in the grid
  - name: quadrants
    properties:
      - four rectangular regions defined by the lines (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)

actions:
  - name: identify_lines
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: horizontal_line, vertical_line
    description: Find the row index of the horizontal line and the column index of the vertical line.
  - name: identify_target_pixel
    inputs: input_grid, horizontal_line, vertical_line, background
    outputs: target_pixel_location, target_pixel_color
    description: Find the coordinates and color of the single pixel that is not the background color and not part of the lines.
  - name: determine_target_quadrant
    inputs: target_pixel_location, horizontal_line_index, vertical_line_index
    outputs: target_quadrant_definition (e.g., top-left, ranges of rows/columns)
    description: Determine which of the four quadrants contains the target pixel based on its location relative to the line indices.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    inputs: input_grid, target_quadrant_definition
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the pixels from the input grid within the row and column ranges defined by the target quadrant.

relationships:
  - The horizontal and vertical lines define the boundaries of the quadrants.
  - The target_pixel's location determines which quadrant is selected for the output.
  - The output_grid is a subgrid of the input_grid, specifically the content of the target_quadrant.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the primary background color of the input grid (the most frequent color).
2.  Identify the horizontal line: Find the single row that consists entirely of a color different from the background color. Record its row index.
3.  Identify the vertical line: Find the single column that consists entirely of a color different from the background color. Record its column index.
4.  Identify the target pixel: Scan the grid to find the single pixel whose color is different from the background color *and* different from the color(s) of the horizontal and vertical lines. Record its row and column index.
5.  Determine the target quadrant based on the target pixel's location relative to the lines:
    *   If the target pixel's row index is less than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is less than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Top-Left region.
    *   If the target pixel's row index is less than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is greater than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Top-Right region.
    *   If the target pixel's row index is greater than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is less than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Bottom-Left region.
    *   If the target pixel's row index is greater than the horizontal line's row index and its column index is greater than the vertical line's column index, the target quadrant is the Bottom-Right region.
6.  Define the row and column ranges for the target quadrant:
    *   Top-Left: Rows from 0 up to (but not including) the horizontal line index. Columns from 0 up to (but not including) the vertical line index.
    *   Top-Right: Rows from 0 up to (but not including) the horizontal line index. Columns from (vertical line index + 1) to the end of the grid width.
    *   Bottom-Left: Rows from (horizontal line index + 1) to the end of the grid height. Columns from 0 up to (but not including) the vertical line index.
    *   Bottom-Right: Rows from (horizontal line index + 1) to the end of the grid height. Columns from (vertical line index + 1) to the end of the grid width.
7.  Construct the output grid by copying the pixels from the input grid located within the determined row and column ranges of the target quadrant.
