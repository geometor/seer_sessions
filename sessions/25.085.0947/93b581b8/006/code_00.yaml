Grid Properties:
  - Input and Output grids are consistently 6x6.
  - The background color is white (0).

Input Objects:
  - Each input grid contains exactly one 2x2 block object composed of four non-white pixels.
  - Let the pixels of this block be:
    - A: Top-Left
    - B: Top-Right
    - C: Bottom-Left
    - D: Bottom-Right
  - The location of this 2x2 block varies across examples.

Output Objects:
  - The output grid contains four distinct 2x2 blocks, each filled with a single solid color.
  - These blocks are located at the four corners of the 6x6 grid:
    - Top-Left corner: rows 0-1, columns 0-1
    - Top-Right corner: rows 0-1, columns 4-5
    - Bottom-Left corner: rows 4-6, columns 0-1
    - Bottom-Right corner: rows 4-6, columns 4-5
  - The rest of the output grid is filled with the background color (white, 0).

Transformation Actions:
  - Find the unique 2x2 non-white block in the input grid.
  - Extract the color values of its four pixels (A, B, C, D).
  - Create a new 6x6 output grid initialized with white (0).
  - Fill the four 2x2 corner blocks in the output grid using the extracted colors according to the following mapping:
    - Top-Left output corner block uses color D (from input block's Bottom-Right pixel).
    - Top-Right output corner block uses color C (from input block's Bottom-Left pixel).
    - Bottom-Left output corner block uses color B (from input block's Top-Right pixel).
    - Bottom-Right output corner block uses color A (from input block's Top-Left pixel).
  - The original 2x2 block from the input is *not* copied to the output grid.
