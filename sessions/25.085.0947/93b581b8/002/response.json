            "text": "The code execution confirms the hypothesis:\n*   Example 1: Block at (1,1), colors (4, 6, 2, 1). Overlaps with corners: True. Original block preserved: False.\n*   Example 2: Block at (2,2), colors (9, 3, 7, 8). Overlaps with corners: False. Original block preserved: True.\n*   Example 3: Block at (2,2), colors (3, 6, 5, 2). Overlaps with corners: False. Original block preserved: True.\n\nThis strongly supports the revised understanding of the transformation. The initial code failed because it always tried to preserve the original block by initializing the output grid with the input grid, leading to incorrect results when the corner overwrites conflicted (as in Ex1, where pixel (1,1) was overwritten). The correct approach is to start with a blank (white) grid, fill the corners, and then *conditionally* add the original block back if it doesn't overlap with the newly placed corners.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully solved Examples 2 and 3 but failed on Example 1. The failure analysis revealed that the initial assumption about always preserving the original 2x2 block by copying the input grid was incorrect. In Example 1, the expected output *does not* contain the original 2x2 block, whereas in Examples 2 and 3, it does.\n\nThe key difference is the location of the initial 2x2 block. In Example 1, the block at `(1,1)` overlaps with the area designated for the top-left corner block `(0:2, 0:2)`. In Examples 2 and 3, the block at `(2,2)` does not overlap with any of the four corner areas `(0:2, 0:2)`, `(0:2, 4:6)`, `(4:6, 0:2)`, `(4:6, 4:6)`.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation rule:\n1.  Start with a blank (white) output grid.\n2.  Identify the input 2x2 block and its colors (A, B, C, D).\n3.  Fill the four 2x2 corner blocks in the output grid based on the derived colors (TL=D, TR=C, BL=B, BR=A).\n4.  Determine if the original location of the input 2x2 block overlaps with any of the four corner locations.\n5.  If there is *no* overlap, copy the original 2x2 block from the input to the output grid at its original location. If there *is* overlap, do not copy the original block, leaving only the corner blocks placed in step 3.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:\n\n"
