    pixels: non-white (copy of input block)
    properties:
      location: [original location of input block]
      condition: Present only if the original input block location does not overlap with any of the four corner block locations ([0:2, 0:2], [0:2, 4:6], [4:6, 0:2], [4:6, 4:6]).

transformation_rule:
  - Find the unique 2x2 non-white block in the input grid. Let its pixels be A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right), and its top-left coordinate be (r, c).
  - Create a new 6x6 output grid initialized with the background color (white, 0).
  - Define the four corner regions: TL=(rows 0-1, cols 0-1), TR=(rows 0-1, cols 4-5), BL=(rows 4-5, cols 0-1), BR=(rows 4-5, cols 4-5).
  - Fill the corner regions in the output grid: TL with color D, TR with color C, BL with color B, BR with color A.
  - Check if the input block's region (rows r to r+1, cols c to c+1) overlaps with any of the four corner regions.
  - If there is no overlap, copy the original 2x2 block (pixels A, B, C, D) from the input grid to the output grid at its original location (r, c).
  - If there is overlap, do not copy the original block; the output grid only contains the corner blocks on a white background.
