"""
Transforms a 6x6 input grid containing one 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the 2x2 non-white block in the input grid. Let its pixels be
   A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right), and its 
   top-left coordinate be (r, c).
2. Creating a new 6x6 output grid, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
3. Filling four 2x2 blocks in the corners of the output grid with colors
   derived from the input block's pixels:
   - Top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) gets color D.
   - Top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) gets color C.
   - Bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1) gets color B.
   - Bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) gets color A.
4. Checking if the original location of the input block (rows r to r+1, cols c to c+1) 
   overlaps with any of the four corner regions defined above.
5. If there is *no* overlap (i.e., the input block was located in the central 
   2x2 region of the grid, specifically at (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), or (3,3)), 
   copy the original 2x2 block from the input to the output grid at its 
   original location (r, c).
6. If there *is* overlap, the original block is not copied, and the output 
   grid only contains the four corner blocks on a white background.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

1.  **Assessment:** The previous code successfully identified the core transformation involving placing colored 2x2 blocks in the corners based on the pixels of the input 2x2 block. The corner placement logic (D->TL, C->TR, B->BL, A->BR) seems correct as it worked for all examples. However, the code failed on Example 1 because its logic for deciding whether to copy the original 2x2 block back into the output was flawed. Examples 2 and 3 succeeded because they coincidentally met the incorrect condition (the block being in the central 2x2 area).
2.  **Strategy:**
    *   Confirm the location and colors of the input block in each example.
    *   Compare the input block's location with its presence/absence in the expected output for all examples.
    *   Based on the comparison, revise the condition under which the original input block is preserved in the output. The evidence from Example 1 (where the block is *not* central but *is* preserved) strongly suggests the original block should *always* be copied back, regardless of its position.
    *   Update the natural language program to reflect this simpler rule.

**Metrics Gathering**

```
The metrics confirm:

*   The corner block colors consistently match the rule: D in Top-Left, C in Top-Right, B in Bottom-Left, A in Bottom-Right.
*   Crucially, the "Original Block Preserved in Output" is `True` for *all three* examples, including Example 1 where the block is at (1, 1) and Example 2/3 where it's at (2, 2).

This confirms the hypothesis that the original 2x2 block is *always* copied back to its original location in the output grid. The previous code's condition checking for overlap or central location was incorrect.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** the single 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the 6x6 input grid. Note its top-left coordinates (r, c) and the colors of its pixels: A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), and D (bottom-right).
2.  **Create** a new 6x6 output grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  **Fill** the four 2x2 corner regions of the output grid with colors derived from the identified input block:
    *   Top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) with color D.
    *   Top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) with color C.
    *   Bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1) with color B.
    *   Bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) with color A.
4.  **Copy** the original 2x2 block from the input grid (at location r, c) to the *same* location (r, c) in the output grid. This overwrites any background pixels or potentially parts of corner blocks if the original block was located in a corner.
