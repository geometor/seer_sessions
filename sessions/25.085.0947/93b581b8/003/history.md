```python
"""
Transforms a 6x6 input grid containing one 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the 2x2 non-white block in the input grid. Let its pixels be
   A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right).
2. Creating an output grid of the same size (6x6).
3. Copying the original 2x2 block from the input to the output grid at its
   original location.
4. Filling four new 2x2 blocks in the corners of the output grid with colors
   derived from the input block's pixels:
   - Top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) gets color D.
   - Top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) gets color C.
   - Bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1) gets color B.
   - Bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) gets color A.
5. The rest of the output grid retains the background color (white, 0) from the
   input, except where overwritten by the corner blocks or the original block.

The code execution confirms the hypothesis:
*   Example 1: Block at (1,1), colors (4, 6, 2, 1). Overlaps with corners: True. Original block preserved: False.
*   Example 2: Block at (2,2), colors (9, 3, 7, 8). Overlaps with corners: False. Original block preserved: True.
*   Example 3: Block at (2,2), colors (3, 6, 5, 2). Overlaps with corners: False. Original block preserved: True.

This strongly supports the revised understanding of the transformation. The initial code failed because it always tried to preserve the original block by initializing the output grid with the input grid, leading to incorrect results when the corner overwrites conflicted (as in Ex1, where pixel (1,1) was overwritten). The correct approach is to start with a blank (white) grid, fill the corners, and then *conditionally* add the original block back if it doesn't overlap with the newly placed corners.## General Assessment

The previous code successfully solved Examples 2 and 3 but failed on Example 1. The failure analysis revealed that the initial assumption about always preserving the original 2x2 block by copying the input grid was incorrect. In Example 1, the expected output *does not* contain the original 2x2 block, whereas in Examples 2 and 3, it does.

The key difference is the location of the initial 2x2 block. In Example 1, the block at `(1,1)` overlaps with the area designated for the top-left corner block `(0:2, 0:2)`. In Examples 2 and 3, the block at `(2,2)` does not overlap with any of the four corner areas `(0:2, 0:2)`, `(0:2, 4:6)`, `(4:6, 0:2)`, `(4:6, 4:6)`.

The strategy is to revise the transformation rule:
1.  Start with a blank (white) output grid.
2.  Identify the input 2x2 block and its colors (A, B, C, D).
3.  Fill the four 2x2 corner blocks in the output grid based on the derived colors (TL=D, TR=C, BL=B, BR=A).
4.  Determine if the original location of the input 2x2 block overlaps with any of the four corner locations.
5.  If there is *no* overlap, copy the original 2x2 block from the input to the output grid at its original location. If there *is* overlap, do not copy the original block, leaving only the corner blocks placed in step 3.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution:

    }
]
```


**Summary:**
*   All input and output grids are 6x6.
*   Each input contains exactly one 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
*   The location of this block varies.
*   The output grid always contains four 2x2 blocks in the corners.
*   The colors of these corner blocks are determined by the pixels of the input block in a specific rotated/mirrored pattern.
*   The original input block is preserved in the output *only if* its original location does not overlap with the locations of the four corner blocks.

transformation_rule:
  - Find the unique 2x2 non-white block in the input grid. Let its pixels be A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right), and its top-left coordinate be (r, c).
  - Create a new 6x6 output grid initialized with the background color (white, 0).
  - Define the four corner regions: TL=(rows 0-1, cols 0-1), TR=(rows 0-1, cols 4-5), BL=(rows 4-5, cols 0-1), BR=(rows 4-5, cols 4-5).
  - Fill the corner regions in the output grid: TL with color D, TR with color C, BL with color B, BR with color A.
  - Check if the input block's region (rows r to r+1, cols c to c+1) overlaps with any of the four corner regions.
  - If there is no overlap, copy the original 2x2 block (pixels A, B, C, D) from the input grid to the output grid at its original location (r, c).
  - If there is overlap, do not copy the original block; the output grid only contains the corner blocks on a white background.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the 6x6 input grid. Record the colors of its four pixels: A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right), and the row/column index `(r, c)` of its top-left pixel (A).
2.  Create a new 6x6 output grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Fill the top-left 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) of the output grid with color D.
4.  Fill the top-right 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) of the output grid with color C.
5.  Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) of the output grid with color B.
6.  Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) of the output grid with color A.
7.  Check if the region occupied by the original input block (rows `r` to `r+1`, columns `c` to `c+1`) overlaps with any of the four corner regions defined in steps 3-6.
8.  If there is *no* overlap, copy the original 2x2 block (pixels A, B, C, D) from the input grid to the output grid at its original location, starting at `(r, c)`.
9.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
