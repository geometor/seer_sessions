*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids are 6x6 and contain a single 2x2 block of colored pixels, surrounded by white pixels. The position of this 2x2 block varies slightly but is generally near the center.
    *   The output grids are also 6x6. They retain the original 2x2 colored block in its original position.
    *   Additionally, the output grids feature four new 2x2 blocks of solid color, one placed in each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
    *   The colors used in the corner blocks of the output are derived from the colors within the input's 2x2 block. There appears to be a specific mapping based on the position within the input block.

    relationships:
      - The output grid retains the central 2x2 block from the input grid.
      - The colors of the four corner 2x2 blocks in the output are determined by the colors of the four pixels in the input's 2x2 block following a specific mapping:
        - Top-left output corner color = Bottom-right input pixel color (D)
        - Top-right output corner color = Bottom-left input pixel color (C)
        - Bottom-left output corner color = Top-right input pixel color (B)
        - Bottom-right output corner color = Top-left input pixel color (A)
      - Each corner block in the output is a solid 2x2 square filled with the determined color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the location and colors of the unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input grid. Let the colors be A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), and D (bottom-right) within this 2x2 block. Record the row and column index `(r, c)` of the top-left pixel (A).
    2.  Create a new 6x6 output grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    3.  Copy the identified 2x2 block from the input to the output grid at its original location `(r, c)`, preserving the colors A, B, C, and D.
    4.  Fill the 2x2 area in the top-left corner of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) with color D.
    5.  Fill the 2x2 area in the top-right corner of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) with color C.
    6.  Fill the 2x2 area in the bottom-left corner of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) with color B.
    7.  Fill the 2x2 area in the bottom-right corner of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) with color A.
    8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
