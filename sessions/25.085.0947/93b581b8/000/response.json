The position of this 2x2 block varies slightly but is generally near the center.\n    *   The output grids are also 6x6. They retain the original 2x2 colored block in its original position.\n    *   Additionally, the output grids feature four new 2x2 blocks of solid color, one placed in each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n    *   The colors used in the corner blocks of the output are derived from the colors within the input's 2x2 block. There appears to be a specific mapping based on the position within the input block.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
