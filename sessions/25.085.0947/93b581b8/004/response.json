            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Assessment:** The previous code successfully identified the core transformation involving placing colored 2x2 blocks in the corners based on the pixels of the input 2x2 block. The corner placement logic (D->TL, C->TR, B->BL, A->BR) seems correct as it worked for all examples. However, the code failed on Example 1 because its logic for deciding whether to copy the original 2x2 block back into the output was flawed. Examples 2 and 3 succeeded because they coincidentally met the incorrect condition (the block being in the central 2x2 area).\n2.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Confirm the location and colors of the input block in each example.\n    *   Compare the input block's location with its presence/absence in the expected output for all examples.\n    *   Based on the comparison, revise the condition under which the original input block is preserved in the output. The evidence from Example 1 (where the block is *not* central but *is* preserved) strongly suggests the original block should *always* be copied back, regardless of its position.\n    *   Update the natural language program to reflect this simpler rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's extract the key details for each example.\n\n"
