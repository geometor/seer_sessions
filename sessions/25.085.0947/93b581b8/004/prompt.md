"""
Transforms a 6x6 input grid containing one 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
The transformation involves:
1. Identifying the 2x2 non-white block in the input grid. Let its pixels be
   A (top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right), and its 
   top-left coordinate be (r, c).
2. Creating a new 6x6 output grid, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
3. Filling four 2x2 blocks in the corners of the output grid with colors
   derived from the input block's pixels:
   - Top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) gets color D.
   - Top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) gets color C.
   - Bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1) gets color B.
   - Bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) gets color A.
4. Checking if the original location of the input block (rows r to r+1, cols c to c+1) 
   overlaps with any of the four corner regions defined above.
5. If there is *no* overlap (i.e., the input block was located in the central 
   2x2 region of the grid, specifically at (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), or (3,3)), 
   copy the original 2x2 block from the input to the output grid at its 
   original location (r, c).
6. If there *is* overlap, the original block is not copied, and the output 
   grid only contains the four corner blocks on a white background.
