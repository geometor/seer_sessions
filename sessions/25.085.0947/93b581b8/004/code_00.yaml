    description: A single 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      location: Varies across examples (e.g., top-left at (1,1) in Ex1, (2,2) in Ex2/Ex3).
      pixels:

        - name: B (top-right)
        - name: C (bottom-left)
        - name: D (bottom-right)
      colors: Can be any non-white color (1-9).
output_objects:
  - object: corner_block_TL
    description: A 2x2 block in the top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1).
    properties:
      color: Matches pixel D of the input source_block.
  - object: corner_block_TR
    description: A 2x2 block in the top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5).
    properties:
      color: Matches pixel C of the input source_block.
  - object: corner_block_BL
    description: A 2x2 block in the bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1).
    properties:
      color: Matches pixel B of the input source_block.
  - object: corner_block_BR
    description: A 2x2 block in the bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5).
    properties:
      color: Matches pixel A of the input source_block.
  - object: preserved_block
    description: A copy of the original input source_block.
    properties:
      location: Same coordinates (r, c) as the source_block in the input grid.
      pixels: Same as the source_block (A, B, C, D).
      present: Always present in the output.
transformation:
  actions:
    - action: find_source_block
      input: input_grid
      output: location (r, c) and pixel colors (A, B, C, D) of the 2x2 non-white block.
    - action: initialize_output
      input: input_grid_dimensions (6x6)
      output: output_grid (6x6) filled with background_color (white, 0).
    - action: create_corner_blocks
      description: Fill four 2x2 areas in the corners of the output_grid.
