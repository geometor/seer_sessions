            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the 'target' color and the concept of 'inside' vs 'outside' pixels separated by blue 'walls'. However, the logic used to determine the number of target pixels in the 3x3 output grid based on the counts of inside and outside pixels was incorrect, failing on all training examples. The output grids had the correct size and target color, but the quantity of the target color was wrong.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the relationship between `count_inside`, `count_outside`, and the expected number of target pixels in the output grid across all examples to find a consistent rule. We will use code execution to verify the counts for each example.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n"
