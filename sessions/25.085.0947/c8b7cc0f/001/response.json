Identify the 'target' color: This is the unique color in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor blue (1).\n2. Identify 'outside' target pixels: These are target color pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing any blue (1) pixels. This can be found using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Flood Fill starting from all non-blue border cells.\n3. Count 'outside' target pixels (`count_outside`).\n4. Count 'inside' target pixels: Find the total count of target pixels in the grid and subtract `count_outside` to get `count_inside`.\n5. Determine the number of target pixels (`num_output_pixels`) to place in the 3x3 output grid based on the comparison between `count_inside` and `count_outside`:\n    - If `count_inside > count_outside`: `num_output_pixels = count_outside * 2`\n    - If `count_inside == count_outside`: `num_output_pixels = count_outside`\n    - If `count_inside < count_outside`: `num_output_pixels = count_outside // 2`\n6. Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0).\n7. Fill the first `num_output_pixels` cells of the output grid (reading row by row, left to right) with the target color. Ensure the number does not exceed 9 (the size of the output grid).\n8. Return the 3x3 output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_outside_pixels(grid, target_color, wall_color=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds pixels of target_color reachable from the border without crossing wall_color.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        target_color (int): The color of the pixels to find.\n        wall_color (int): The color that acts as a barrier.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of coordinates (row, col) of the outside target pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    outside_target_pixels = set()\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Add all non-wall border cells to the queue\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if grid[r, 0] != wall_color:\n            queue.append((r, 0))\n            visited.add((r,0))\n        if grid[r, cols - 1] != wall_color:\n            queue.append((r, cols - 1))\n            visited.add((r, cols-1))\n    for c in range(cols): # Avoid double adding corners\n        if (0, c) not in visited and grid[0, c] != wall_color:\n             queue.append((0, c))\n             visited.add((0,c))\n        if (rows - 1, c) not in visited and grid[rows - 1, c] != wall_color:\n             queue.append((rows - 1, c))\n             visited.add((rows-1, c))\n             \n    # Check initial border cells for target color\n    initial_queue = list(queue) # iterate over a copy\n    for r,c in initial_queue:\n         if grid[r,c] == target_color:\n             outside_target_pixels.add((r,c))\n\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check neighbors\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n            # Check bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                # Check if visited or is a wall\n                if (nr, nc) not in visited and grid[nr, nc] != wall_color:\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    # Check if it's a target pixel\n                    if grid[nr, nc] == target_color:\n                        outside_target_pixels.add((nr, nc))\n\n    return outside_target_pixels\n\ndef count_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Counts the total number of pixels of a specific color.\"\"\"\n    return np.sum(grid == color)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n\n    # 1.
