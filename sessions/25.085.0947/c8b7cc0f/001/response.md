"""
Determine the transformation rule from input to output grids.

1. Identify the 'target' color: This is the unique color in the input grid that is neither white (0) nor blue (1).
2. Identify 'outside' target pixels: These are target color pixels reachable from the grid border without crossing any blue (1) pixels. This can be found using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Flood Fill starting from all non-blue border cells.
3. Count 'outside' target pixels (`count_outside`).
4. Count 'inside' target pixels: Find the total count of target pixels in the grid and subtract `count_outside` to get `count_inside`.
5. Determine the number of target pixels (`num_output_pixels`) to place in the 3x3 output grid based on the comparison between `count_inside` and `count_outside`:
    - If `count_inside > count_outside`: `num_output_pixels = count_outside * 2`
    - If `count_inside == count_outside`: `num_output_pixels = count_outside`
    - If `count_inside < count_outside`: `num_output_pixels = count_outside // 2`
6. Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0).
7. Fill the first `num_output_pixels` cells of the output grid (reading row by row, left to right) with the target color. Ensure the number does not exceed 9 (the size of the output grid).
8. Return the 3x3 output grid.
