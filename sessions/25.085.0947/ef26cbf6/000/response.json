These separators can be horizontal and vertical.\n2.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Structural element, defining boundaries. Unchanged in the output.\n    *   **White (0):** Background color. Unchanged in the output.\n    *   **Blue (1):** Target color. These pixels are subject to change based on context.\n    *   **Other Colors (Orange 7, Green 3, Azure 8 in train\\_1; Green 3, Red 2, Magenta 6 in train\\_2):** Source colors. These colors determine the replacement color for blue pixels. Unchanged in their original positions.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the blue pixels (1). The new color depends on the context provided by the \"source\" colors within the sections defined by the yellow lines.\n4.  **Contextual Rules:**\n    *   In `train_1`, the source color for replacing blue pixels within a section is found *within that same section*. Each section bounded by yellow lines contains blue pixels and exactly one pixel of another color (orange, green, or azure). The blue pixels adopt this color.\n    *   In `train_2`, some sections contain only blue pixels (besides white and yellow). The source color for these sections is found in the section *directly above* them, separated by a horizontal yellow line. The sections above contain a single non-yellow, non-white color (green, red, or magenta). The blue pixels in the sections below adopt the color from the section directly above.\n5.  **Generalization:** The rule seems to be: identify sections bordered by yellow. For each section containing blue pixels, find a 'source' color. First, look for a unique non-white, non-yellow, non-blue color *within* the section. If one exists, use that color. If not, look for a unique non-white, non-yellow color in the section *directly above* (sharing the same column span). If found, use that color. Replace all blue pixels in the original section with the identified source color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
