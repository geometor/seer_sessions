Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
      - dimensions vary
  - type: Separator
    properties:
      - composed of contiguous yellow (4) pixels
      - form horizontal or vertical lines
      - divide the grid into rectangular sections
  - type: Section
    properties:
      - rectangular area of the grid bounded by yellow separators or grid edges
      - contains pixels, including background (0), target (1), and potentially source colors
  - type: Target Pixel
    properties:
      - color is blue (1)
      - subject to color change
  - type: Source Pixel
    properties:
      - color is not white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4)
      - typically appears uniquely within a section or a related section
      - determines the replacement color for Target Pixels
      - remains unchanged in its original position

Relationships:
  - Separators define Sections.
  - Sections can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - A Section can be 'above' another Section if they share the same column range and are separated by a horizontal Separator.
  - Source Pixels provide color information for Target Pixels within specific Sections.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate Separators (yellow lines).
  - Segment: Divide the grid into Sections based on Separators.
  - Locate: Find Target Pixels (blue) within each Section.
  - Find Source (within): Search for a unique Source Pixel within the same Section as the Target Pixels.
  - Find Source (above): If no Source Pixel is found within, search for a unique Source Pixel in the Section directly above.
  - Replace: Change the color of all Target Pixels within a Section to the color of the identified Source Pixel for that Section.
  - Preserve: Keep all other pixels (Separators, Background, Source Pixels) unchanged.
