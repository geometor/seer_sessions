Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature yellow lines (color 4) acting as separators, dividing the grid into distinct rectangular sections or panes. These separators can be horizontal and vertical.
2.  **Color Roles:**
    *   **Yellow (4):** Structural element, defining boundaries. Unchanged in the output.
    *   **White (0):** Background color. Unchanged in the output.
    *   **Blue (1):** Target color. These pixels are subject to change based on context.
    *   **Other Colors (Orange 7, Green 3, Azure 8 in train\_1; Green 3, Red 2, Magenta 6 in train\_2):** Source colors. These colors determine the replacement color for blue pixels. Unchanged in their original positions.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the blue pixels (1). The new color depends on the context provided by the "source" colors within the sections defined by the yellow lines.
4.  **Contextual Rules:**
    *   In `train_1`, the source color for replacing blue pixels within a section is found *within that same section*. Each section bounded by yellow lines contains blue pixels and exactly one pixel of another color (orange, green, or azure). The blue pixels adopt this color.
    *   In `train_2`, some sections contain only blue pixels (besides white and yellow). The source color for these sections is found in the section *directly above* them, separated by a horizontal yellow line. The sections above contain a single non-yellow, non-white color (green, red, or magenta). The blue pixels in the sections below adopt the color from the section directly above.
5.  **Generalization:** The rule seems to be: identify sections bordered by yellow. For each section containing blue pixels, find a 'source' color. First, look for a unique non-white, non-yellow, non-blue color *within* the section. If one exists, use that color. If not, look for a unique non-white, non-yellow color in the section *directly above* (sharing the same column span). If found, use that color. Replace all blue pixels in the original section with the identified source color.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
      - dimensions vary
  - type: Separator
    properties:
      - composed of contiguous yellow (4) pixels
      - form horizontal or vertical lines
      - divide the grid into rectangular sections
  - type: Section
    properties:
      - rectangular area of the grid bounded by yellow separators or grid edges
      - contains pixels, including background (0), target (1), and potentially source colors
  - type: Target Pixel
    properties:
      - color is blue (1)
      - subject to color change
  - type: Source Pixel
    properties:
      - color is not white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4)
      - typically appears uniquely within a section or a related section
      - determines the replacement color for Target Pixels
      - remains unchanged in its original position

Relationships:
  - Separators define Sections.
  - Sections can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - A Section can be 'above' another Section if they share the same column range and are separated by a horizontal Separator.
  - Source Pixels provide color information for Target Pixels within specific Sections.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate Separators (yellow lines).
  - Segment: Divide the grid into Sections based on Separators.
  - Locate: Find Target Pixels (blue) within each Section.
  - Find Source (within): Search for a unique Source Pixel within the same Section as the Target Pixels.
  - Find Source (above): If no Source Pixel is found within, search for a unique Source Pixel in the Section directly above.
  - Replace: Change the color of all Target Pixels within a Section to the color of the identified Source Pixel for that Section.
  - Preserve: Keep all other pixels (Separators, Background, Source Pixels) unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all horizontal and vertical lines composed entirely of yellow pixels (4). These are the separators.
2.  Use the separators and the grid boundaries to define distinct rectangular sections.
3.  Iterate through each defined section.
4.  Within the current section, check if it contains any blue pixels (1).
5.  If the section contains blue pixels:
    a.  Search *within* this section for a single pixel whose color is not white (0), not blue (1), and not yellow (4).
    b.  If exactly one such 'source' pixel is found within the section, record its color as the 'replacement color' for this section.
    c.  If no such 'source' pixel is found *within* the section, identify the section located directly *above* the current section (sharing the same column boundaries and separated by a horizontal yellow line).
    d.  Search within that 'above' section for a single pixel whose color is not white (0) and not yellow (4).
    e.  If exactly one such 'source' pixel is found in the 'above' section, record its color as the 'replacement color' for the current section.
    f.  If a 'replacement color' was determined (either from within the section or from the section above), change the color of all blue pixels (1) *in the current section* to this 'replacement color'.
6.  Leave all pixels that are not blue (1), or blue pixels for which no replacement color could be determined, unchanged.
7.  The resulting grid is the output.
