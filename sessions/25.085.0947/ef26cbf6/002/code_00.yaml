task_description: Replace blue pixels within sections based on a hierarchy of source color locations.

grid_structure:
  - element: Grid
    properties: Can be divided into sections by horizontal and vertical lines of yellow pixels (4).
  - element: Section
    properties: A rectangular area bounded by yellow lines or grid edges. Contains pixels of various colors.
  - element: Row Band
    properties: A horizontal strip of the grid, spanning the full width, bounded by horizontal yellow lines or grid top/bottom edges. Contains one or more sections.

objects:
  - object: Blue Pixel
    properties: Color value 1. Target for transformation. Located within Sections.
  - object: Source Pixel
    properties:
      - A single pixel within a defined search area (section, row band, or section above).
      - Color is not white (0), yellow (4).
      - In some search contexts (within section, row band), color cannot be blue (1).
      - In other search contexts (section above), color can be blue (1).
      - Must be the *only* unique color meeting the criteria within its search area.
    relation: Provides the 'replacement color' for Blue Pixels in a corresponding Section.

actions:
  - action: Identify Sections
    actor: System
    input: Grid
    output: List of Sections (defined by row/column boundaries).
  - action: Identify Row Bands
    actor: System
    input: Grid
    output: Implicit definition via horizontal separators and grid edges.
  - action: Find Replacement Color
    actor: System
    input: Section containing Blue Pixels
    output: Replacement Color (or None)
    steps:
      1. Search within the Section for a unique pixel color C where C is not in {0, 1, 4}. If found, C is the Replacement Color.
      2. If not found, identify the Row Band containing the Section. Search within the entire Row Band for a unique pixel color C where C is not in {0, 1, 4}. If found, C is the Replacement Color.
      3. If not found, identify the Section directly Above (if one exists, separated by a horizontal yellow line). Search within the Above Section for a unique pixel color C where C is not in {0, 4}. If found, C is the Replacement Color.
  - action: Replace Pixels
    actor: System
    input: Section, Replacement Color
    condition: Replacement Color is not None.
    effect: All Blue Pixels (1) within the Section are changed to the Replacement Color.
