            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids consist primarily of a white background (color 0) with a single vertical line segment composed of orange pixels (color 7). The position and length of this orange line vary between examples.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs. They feature a pattern expanding from the original locations of the orange pixels. This pattern uses orange (7) and a new color, azure (8), replacing some of the original white background. The original orange pixels are also part of this new pattern, retaining their orange color or changing based on the pattern rules.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation seems to involve generating a 'field' or 'aura' around the initial orange pixels.\n    *   **Color Alternation**: The generated pattern alternates between orange (7) and azure (8). Observing the output grids, pixels seem colored based on their Manhattan distance from the *nearest* source (original orange) pixel. If the minimum Manhattan distance is even, the color is orange (7); if it's odd, the color is azure (8).\n    *   **Distance Limit**: The pattern does not expand indefinitely. The extent of the expansion from a specific source pixel appears constrained by its row index relative to the other source pixels. Specifically, if `max_r_source` is the maximum row index of any orange pixel in the input, then a source pixel at row `r_s` can only influence output pixels within a Manhattan distance `d` such that `d <= max_r_source - r_s`.\n    *   **Combination**: For any given pixel in the output grid, we need to consider its distance to *all* source pixels in the input. The minimum distance determines the potential color (orange or azure based on parity) and the closest source determines the maximum allowed distance for that pixel to be colored. If the minimum distance exceeds this maximum allowed distance, the pixel remains white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the coordinates (row `r_s`, column `c_s`) of all orange (7) pixels in the input grid. These are the \"source\" pixels. If no source pixels exist, return the initial white grid.\n3.  Find the maximum row index among all identified source pixels. Let this be `max_r_source`.\n4.  Iterate through each pixel location (target row `tr`, target column `tc`) in the grid dimensions.\n5.

Find the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_d`) calculated in the previous step. Also, identify the row index (`r_s_for_min_d`) of a source pixel that yields this minimum distance. (If multiple sources are equidistant and minimal, any of their row indices can be used consistently).\n7.  Calculate the maximum allowed distance for coloring based on the chosen source's row: `max_d_allowed = max_r_source - r_s_for_min_d`.\n8.
