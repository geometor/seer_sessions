Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids consist primarily of a white background (color 0) with a single vertical line segment composed of orange pixels (color 7). The position and length of this orange line vary between examples.
2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs. They feature a pattern expanding from the original locations of the orange pixels. This pattern uses orange (7) and a new color, azure (8), replacing some of the original white background. The original orange pixels are also part of this new pattern, retaining their orange color or changing based on the pattern rules.
3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation seems to involve generating a 'field' or 'aura' around the initial orange pixels.
    *   **Color Alternation**: The generated pattern alternates between orange (7) and azure (8). Observing the output grids, pixels seem colored based on their Manhattan distance from the *nearest* source (original orange) pixel. If the minimum Manhattan distance is even, the color is orange (7); if it's odd, the color is azure (8).
    *   **Distance Limit**: The pattern does not expand indefinitely. The extent of the expansion from a specific source pixel appears constrained by its row index relative to the other source pixels. Specifically, if `max_r_source` is the maximum row index of any orange pixel in the input, then a source pixel at row `r_s` can only influence output pixels within a Manhattan distance `d` such that `d <= max_r_source - r_s`.
    *   **Combination**: For any given pixel in the output grid, we need to consider its distance to *all* source pixels in the input. The minimum distance determines the potential color (orange or azure based on parity) and the closest source determines the maximum allowed distance for that pixel to be colored. If the minimum distance exceeds this maximum allowed distance, the pixel remains white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - pixels:
          - color: white (0) - background
          - color: orange (7) - source pixels, typically forming a vertical line segment

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      - width: same as input
      - height: same as input
      - pixels:
          - color: white (0) - background
          - color: orange (7) - part of the generated pattern
          - color: azure (8) - part of the generated pattern

Transformation:
  - name: Pattern Generation from Sources
  - steps:
      - identify_sources: Find all pixels with orange (7) color in the input grid.
      - calculate_max_row: Determine the maximum row index (`max_r_source`) among all source pixels.
      - process_pixels: For each pixel location (tr, tc) in the output grid:
          - calculate_distances: Compute the Manhattan distance `d = |tr - r_s| + |tc - c_s|` to every source pixel (r_s, c_s).
          - find_minimum: Find the minimum distance `min_d` and the corresponding source pixel(s) (min_r_s, min_c_s). If multiple sources give the same minimum distance, select one (e.g., the one with the lowest row index, though any should yield the same outcome based on the next step). Let the chosen source row be `r_s_for_min_d`.
          - determine_limit: Calculate the maximum allowed distance for this source: `max_d_allowed = max_r_source - r_s_for_min_d`.
          - apply_coloring_rule:
              - If `min_d <= max_d_allowed`:
                  - If `min_d` is even, set output pixel (tr, tc) to orange (7).
                  - If `min_d` is odd, set output pixel (tr, tc) to azure (8).
              - Else (`min_d > max_d_allowed`):
                  - Set output pixel (tr, tc) to white (0).

Definitions:
  - Manhattan distance: Between points (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, or as a blank grid of the same dimensions filled with white (0).
2.  Identify the coordinates (row `r_s`, column `c_s`) of all orange (7) pixels in the input grid. These are the "source" pixels. If no source pixels exist, return the initial white grid.
3.  Find the maximum row index among all identified source pixels. Let this be `max_r_source`.
4.  Iterate through each pixel location (target row `tr`, target column `tc`) in the grid dimensions.
5.  For the current pixel (tr, tc), calculate the Manhattan distance to every source pixel (r_s, c_s). The Manhattan distance is `|tr - r_s| + |tc - c_s|`.
6.  Find the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_d`) calculated in the previous step. Also, identify the row index (`r_s_for_min_d`) of a source pixel that yields this minimum distance. (If multiple sources are equidistant and minimal, any of their row indices can be used consistently).
7.  Calculate the maximum allowed distance for coloring based on the chosen source's row: `max_d_allowed = max_r_source - r_s_for_min_d`.
8.  Compare the minimum distance `min_d` with the maximum allowed distance `max_d_allowed`.
    *   If `min_d` is less than or equal to `max_d_allowed`:
        *   Check if `min_d` is even or odd.
        *   If `min_d` is even, set the color of the output pixel at (tr, tc) to orange (7).
        *   If `min_d` is odd, set the color of the output pixel at (tr, tc) to azure (8).
    *   If `min_d` is greater than `max_d_allowed`:
        *   Set the color of the output pixel at (tr, tc) to white (0).
9.  After processing all pixel locations, the resulting grid is the final output.
