"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify all orange (7) pixels in the input grid as "source" pixels.
2. Find the maximum row index (`max_r_source`) among all source pixels.
3. For each pixel location (tr, tc) in the output grid:
    a. Calculate the Manhattan distance `d = |tr - r_s| + |tc - c_s|` to every source pixel (r_s, c_s).
    b. Find the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_d`) and the row index (`r_s_for_min_d`) of a source pixel that yields this minimum distance. If multiple sources are equidistant and minimal, use the one encountered first.
    c. Calculate the maximum allowed distance for coloring: `max_d_allowed = max_r_source - r_s_for_min_d`.
    d. If `min_d` is less than or equal to `max_d_allowed`:
        - If `min_d` is even, set the output pixel at (tr, tc) to orange (7).
        - If `min_d` is odd, set the output pixel at (tr, tc) to azure (8).
    e. Otherwise (if `min_d > max_d_allowed`), set the output pixel at (tr, tc) to white (0).
4. The resulting grid is the final output.
