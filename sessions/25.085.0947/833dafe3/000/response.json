No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed (unless they weren't present in the input).\n3.  **Quadrant Structure**: The output grid appears to be composed of four quadrants, each the same size as the original input grid.\n4.  **Reflection Pattern**: Comparing the input grid to the four quadrants in the output grid suggests a pattern of reflections:\n    *   The **bottom-right** quadrant seems to be an identical copy of the input grid.\n    *   The **bottom-left** quadrant appears to be a horizontal reflection (flipped left-to-right) of the input grid.\n    *   The **top-right** quadrant appears to be a vertical reflection (flipped top-to-bottom) of the input grid.\n    *   The **top-left** quadrant appears to be both a horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) of the input grid.\n5.  **Consistency**: This reflection pattern holds true for both `train_1` and `train_2`.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Create a version of the input grid that is flipped both horizontally and vertically (reverse both column and row orders). Place this doubly flipped grid into the **top-left** quadrant of the output grid.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
