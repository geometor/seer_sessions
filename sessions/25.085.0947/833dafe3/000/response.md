Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size Relationship**: In both examples, the output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the input grid's dimensions.
    *   Example 1: Input 4x4 -> Output 8x8
    *   Example 2: Input 3x3 -> Output 6x6
2.  **Color Preservation**: The colors present in the input grid are the only colors present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed (unless they weren't present in the input).
3.  **Quadrant Structure**: The output grid appears to be composed of four quadrants, each the same size as the original input grid.
4.  **Reflection Pattern**: Comparing the input grid to the four quadrants in the output grid suggests a pattern of reflections:
    *   The **bottom-right** quadrant seems to be an identical copy of the input grid.
    *   The **bottom-left** quadrant appears to be a horizontal reflection (flipped left-to-right) of the input grid.
    *   The **top-right** quadrant appears to be a vertical reflection (flipped top-to-bottom) of the input grid.
    *   The **top-left** quadrant appears to be both a horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) of the input grid.
5.  **Consistency**: This reflection pattern holds true for both `train_1` and `train_2`.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W, initialized with a default color (e.g., white/0), although initialization might not be strictly necessary if all cells are overwritten.
4.  Define the four quadrants in the output grid based on H and W:
    *   Top-Left: Rows 0 to H-1, Columns 0 to W-1
    *   Top-Right: Rows 0 to H-1, Columns W to 2W-1
    *   Bottom-Left: Rows H to 2H-1, Columns 0 to W-1
    *   Bottom-Right: Rows H to 2H-1, Columns W to 2W-1
5.  Copy the original input grid directly into the **bottom-right** quadrant of the output grid.
6.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid (reverse the order of columns). Place this flipped grid into the **bottom-left** quadrant of the output grid.
7.  Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid (reverse the order of rows). Place this flipped grid into the **top-right** quadrant of the output grid.
8.  Create a version of the input grid that is flipped both horizontally and vertically (reverse both column and row orders). Place this doubly flipped grid into the **top-left** quadrant of the output grid.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
