The outputs are smaller 1x5 grids containing only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n2.  **Key Pattern:** The transformation seems focused on identifying and counting a specific pattern within the input grid: 2x2 squares composed entirely of blue pixels.\n3.  **Irrelevant Information:** The red pixels, the specific locations of the blue squares, and any blue shapes other than 2x2 squares do not appear to influence the output.\n4.  **Output Encoding:** The output grid acts as a summary. The number of blue pixels in the output corresponds directly to the count of the 2x2 blue squares found in the input. The output grid has a fixed width of 5, implying a maximum count of 5 is represented, or that 5 is simply the chosen fixed width for the output format. The blue pixels fill the output from the left, followed by white pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each possible top-left corner position `(row, col)` in the input grid, stopping `1` row and `1` column short of the grid boundaries (i.e., `row` from 0 to `height-2`, `col` from 0 to `width-2`).\n3.  For each position `(row, col)`, check if the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row+1, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row+1, col+1)` are all blue (value 1).\n4.  If all four pixels form a blue 2x2 square, increment `blue_square_count`.\n5.  After checking all positions, create a new 1x5 grid initialized with white (0).\n6.  Fill the first `blue_square_count` cells (from column 0 up to `blue_square_count - 1`) of the 1x5 grid with blue (1).\n7.  The resulting 1x5 grid is the final output."
