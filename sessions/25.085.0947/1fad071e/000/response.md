Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** The inputs are 9x9 grids containing white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. The outputs are smaller 1x5 grids containing only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Key Pattern:** The transformation seems focused on identifying and counting a specific pattern within the input grid: 2x2 squares composed entirely of blue pixels.
3.  **Irrelevant Information:** The red pixels, the specific locations of the blue squares, and any blue shapes other than 2x2 squares do not appear to influence the output.
4.  **Output Encoding:** The output grid acts as a summary. The number of blue pixels in the output corresponds directly to the count of the 2x2 blue squares found in the input. The output grid has a fixed width of 5, implying a maximum count of 5 is represented, or that 5 is simply the chosen fixed width for the output format. The blue pixels fill the output from the left, followed by white pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - role: input
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 9
      width: 9
      colors: [white, blue, red]
  - role: output
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 1
      width: 5
      colors: [white, blue]
objects:
  - type: pattern
    color: blue
    shape: 2x2 square
    role: target
  - type: pixel
    color: red
    role: distracter
  - type: pixel/object
    color: blue
    shape: not 2x2 square
    role: distracter
transformation:
  type: count_and_represent
  steps:
    - identify all instances of the target '2x2 blue square' pattern in the input grid.
    - count the total number (N) of identified patterns.
    - generate a 1x5 output grid.
    - fill the first N cells of the output grid with blue (1).
    - fill the remaining (5 - N) cells with white (0).
relationship:
  - The number of blue pixels in the output grid equals the count of 2x2 blue squares in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize a counter variable, `blue_square_count`, to zero.
2.  Iterate through each possible top-left corner position `(row, col)` in the input grid, stopping `1` row and `1` column short of the grid boundaries (i.e., `row` from 0 to `height-2`, `col` from 0 to `width-2`).
3.  For each position `(row, col)`, check if the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row+1, col)`, `(row, col+1)`, and `(row+1, col+1)` are all blue (value 1).
4.  If all four pixels form a blue 2x2 square, increment `blue_square_count`.
5.  After checking all positions, create a new 1x5 grid initialized with white (0).
6.  Fill the first `blue_square_count` cells (from column 0 up to `blue_square_count - 1`) of the 1x5 grid with blue (1).
7.  The resulting 1x5 grid is the final output.
