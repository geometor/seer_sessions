The size varies between examples.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are Orange (7), Red (2), and Gray (5). Orange appears to be the background or default color filling most of the grid initially below the first row. Red and Gray appear only in the first row of the input and are the colors generated in the subsequent rows of the output.\n3.  **Input Format:** The first row of the input contains a pattern of Red, Gray, and Orange pixels. All subsequent rows are filled entirely with Orange.\n4.  **Output Format:** The first row of the output is identical to the first row of the input. The subsequent rows contain patterns generated based on the row above, composed of Red, Gray, and Orange pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Locality:** The change in a cell's color seems to depend only on the colors of specific cells in the row directly above it. Specifically, a cell at `(row + 1, col)` seems influenced by cells `(row, col - 1)` and `(row, col + 1)`.\n6.  **Pattern Generation:** The patterns generated below the first row resemble the evolution of a 1-dimensional cellular automaton, where the first row acts as the initial state, and subsequent rows represent successive generations.\n\n**YAML Facts Block:**\n\n"
