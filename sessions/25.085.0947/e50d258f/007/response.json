Use 4-way adjacency.\n2. **Determine Bounding Boxes:** For each component, find its minimal rectangular bounding box.\n3. **Extract Subgrids:** Extract the subgrid defined by each bounding box from the input grid.\n4. **Filter for Density:** Keep only extracted subgrids that are \"dense\" (contain no white pixels, value 0).\n5. **Identify Smallest Area:** Among the dense subgrids, find the minimum area (height * width).\n6. **Select Final Subgrid:** Select the dense subgrid with the minimum area. If there's a tie, select based on the top-most (minimum row index) and then left-most (minimum column index) bounding box.\n7. **Output:** Return the selected dense subgrid. Return empty list if no dense subgrids are found.\n\nNote: This logic works for Examples 1 and 3, but selects a different output than expected for Example 2, suggesting a potential refinement might be needed for the selection criteria.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of non-zero pixels in the grid using 4-connectivity.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of components, where each component is a list of (row, col) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    components = []\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check if the pixel is non-zero and hasn't been visited yet\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:\n                # Start BFS to find all connected pixels in this component\n                component = []\n                q = deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r, c] = True\n\n                while q:\n                    row, col = q.popleft()\n                    component.append((row, col))\n\n                    # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        # Check bounds and if neighbor is non-zero and unvisited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] != 0 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n\n                # Add the found component to the list\n                components.append(component)\n\n    return components\n\ndef get_bounding_box(component):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) for a component.\n\n    Args:\n        component (list): A list of (row, col) tuples representing the component.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) or None if component is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not component:\n        return None\n    # Extract all row and column indices\n    rows = [r for r, c in component]\n    cols = [c for r, c in component]\n    # Find the min and max row and column indices\n    min_row, max_row = min(rows), max(rows)\n    min_col, max_col = min(cols), max(cols)\n    return min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation logic to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n\n    # Handle empty grid case\n    if grid.size == 0:\n        return [] # Return empty list for empty input\n\n    # 1.
