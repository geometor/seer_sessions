"""
Find all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-connectivity. 
For each component, determine its minimal bounding box. 
Extract the subgrid defined by each bounding box from the input grid.
Filter these subgrids to keep only those that are "dense" (contain no white/zero pixels).
Among the dense subgrids found, identify the one with the *minimum area* (height * width).
If there is a unique smallest dense subgrid (or if multiple exist with the same minimum area, pick one, e.g., the first encountered), that subgrid is the output.
If no dense subgrids are found, return an empty list.
