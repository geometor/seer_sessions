"""
Identify all contiguous blocks (components) of non-white (non-zero) pixels using 4-connectivity (horizontal/vertical adjacency). 
For each component, determine its minimal bounding box. 
Extract the subgrid defined by each bounding box.
Filter these subgrids to keep only those that are "fully dense" (contain no white pixels).
Among the fully dense subgrids found, identify the one with the *minimum area* (height * width).
If there is a unique smallest dense subgrid, that subgrid is the output.
