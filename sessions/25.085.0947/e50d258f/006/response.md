**Metrics Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Dense Subgrids:
        *   A: H=5, top_left=(0,0)
        *   B: H=7, top_left=(1,5)
        *   C: H=3, top_left=(7,1) -> Output
    *   Max Height = 7 (Grid B). My hypothesis predicted B, but the output is C.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Dense Subgrids:
        *   A: H=5, top_left=(0,6) -> Output
        *   B: H=4, top_left=(1,1)
        *   C: H=4, top_left=(6,3)
    *   Max Height = 5 (Grid A). Hypothesis predicts A. Expected output is A. Okay.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Dense Subgrids:
        *   A: H=6, top_left=(0,0) -> Output
        *   B: H=6, top_left=(3,6)
    *   Max Height = 6 (Tie: A, B). Tie-breaker: min top_row. A has top_row=0, B has top_row=3. Hypothesis selects A. Expected output is A. Okay.

**Hypothesis Failure:** The "tallest" hypothesis failed on Example 1. It predicted Grid B (H=7), but the output was Grid C (H=3).

**Rethinking:**

What is special about the correct grid C in Example 1?
*   Grid A: (5x4), H=5, top=(0,0)
*   Grid B: (7x5), H=7, top=(1,5)
*   Grid C: (3x3), H=3, top=(7,1) -> Output

It has the *smallest* height. Let's re-check the "smallest area" hypothesis, paying close attention to the density check.

**Previous Hypothesis (Smallest Area Dense *Subgrid*):**
1. Find components.
2. Get bounding boxes.
3. Extract subgrids from bounding boxes.
4. Filter subgrids for density (no zeros *within the subgrid*).
5. Select the dense subgrid with the minimum area. Tie-break: first found.

*   **Ex 1:** Dense subgrids found by code (areas): A(20), B(35), C(9). Smallest area = 9 (Grid C). Matches output.
*   **Ex 2:** Dense subgrids found by code (areas): A(20), B(16), C(24). Smallest area = 16 (Grid B). Expected output is A (area 20). **Mismatch.**
*   **Ex 3:** Dense subgrids found by code (areas): A(24), B(24). Smallest area = 24 (Tie: A, B). Code picked A (first found). Matches output.

Okay, the *original code* was actually implementing the "smallest area" hypothesis correctly, and it failed on Example 2. My manual check earlier was flawed, or the code output for Ex 2 was misleading. Let's re-read the failed output for Ex 2:

*   Expected Output 2: `[[8,8,8,8],[8,2,2,8],[8,8,8,8],[8,2,1,8],[8,8,8,8]]` (This is Grid A, Area 20, H=5, top=(0,6))
*   Code Output 2: `[[8,8,8,8],[8,1,8,8],[8,8,2,8],[8,8,8,8]]` (This is Grid B, Area 16, H=4, top=(1,1))

The code *did* select Grid B (Area 16) because it has the smallest area among the dense subgrids. The expected output is Grid A (Area 20).

**Why is Grid A chosen in Example 2?**
*   Grid A: Area 20, H=5, W=4, top=(0,6) -> Expected Output
*   Grid B: Area 16, H=4, W=4, top=(1,1)
*   Grid C: Area 24, H=4, W=6, top=(6,3)

Maybe it's the one with the minimum number of *unique* colors?
*   Grid A Colors: {8, 2, 1}. Count = 3.
*   Grid B Colors: {8, 1, 2}. Count = 3.
*   Grid C Colors: {8, 2, 1}. Count = 3.
No difference.

Maybe it's the one with the most dominant color (Azure/8)?

``` python
import numpy as np

grid_A = np.array([
    [8, 8, 8, 8],
    [8, 2, 2, 8],
    [8, 8, 8, 8],
    [8, 2, 1, 8],
    [8, 8, 8, 8]
])
grid_B = np.array([
    [8, 8, 8, 8],
    [8, 1, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 2, 8],
    [8, 8, 8, 8]
])
grid_C = np.array([
    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8],
    [8, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8],
    [8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8]
])

count_A = np.count_nonzero(grid_A == 8)
count_B = np.count_nonzero(grid_B == 8)
count_C = np.count_nonzero(grid_C == 8)

print(f"{count_A=} (Total: {grid_A.size})")
print(f"{count_B=} (Total: {grid_B.size})")
print(f"{count_C=} (Total: {grid_C.size})")
```
```
count_A=16 (Total: 20)
count_B=14 (Total: 16)
count_C=20 (Total: 24)

```
Grid C has the most Azure/8 pixels (20). Grid A has 16. Grid B has 14. This doesn't select A.

What if it's the highest ratio of the dominant color?
*   A: 16/20 = 0.8
*   B: 14/16 = 0.875
*   C: 20/24 = 0.833
This selects B. Still not A.

Let's re-examine the components and their bounding boxes *in the input*.
Maybe the selection criteria apply *before* extracting the subgrid?

1.  Find components.
2.  Get bounding boxes.
3.  Check if the *subgrid defined by the bounding box* is dense (no zeros).
4.  If dense, consider this component/bbox pair a candidate.
5.  Apply selection criteria to candidates.

Selection criteria:
*   Ex 1: Candidates A, B, C. Output is C (Area 9). Smallest area.
*   Ex 2: Candidates A, B, C. Output is A (Area 20). Neither smallest nor largest area. Tallest.
*   Ex 3: Candidates A, B. Output is A (Area 24). Tied for largest area. Tie-break top-left.

This looks inconsistent. "Smallest area" for Ex 1, "Tallest" for Ex 2, "Largest area (with tie-break)" for Ex 3? That doesn't seem right.

Is there something fundamentally different about Ex 1's component C?
*   Ex 1, C: `[[8, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 8]]`. Bbox (7,1) to (9,3).
*   Ex 1, A: `[[1, 1, 1, 8], [1, 8, 1, 1], [8, 2, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8, 8]]`. Bbox (0,0) to (4,3).
*   Ex 1, B: `[[1, 8, 8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 1], [8, 1, 2, 8, 2], [8, 8, 8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 1, 8, 2]]`. Bbox (1,5) to (7,9).

Aha! Looking at the metrics output again for Ex 1:

```json
"Example 1": [
    { "top_left": [0, 0], "shape": [5, 4], "height": 5, ... }, // A
    { "top_left": [1, 5], "shape": [7, 5], "height": 7, ... }, // B
    { "top_left": [7, 1], "shape": [3, 3], "height": 3, ... }  // C
]
```

The code checked if the SUBGRID was dense. Let's re-verify density for Ex 1.

Input 1:

```
1 1 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 8 1 1 0 1 8 8 1 8
8 2 8 1 0 8 1 8 2 8
1 1 1 8 0 8 8 8 8 1
8 1 8 8 0 8 1 2 8 2
0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 1 8
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 8 1 8
0 8 2 2 0 8 1 1 8 2
0 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

*   Subgrid A (0,0) to (4,3): Contains zeros at (0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4) - Wait, the bbox is (0,0) to (4,3). Subgrid is `grid[0:5, 0:4]`. Let's check that slice.
    
```
    1 1 1 8
    1 8 1 1
    8 2 8 1
    1 1 1 8
    8 1 8 8
    ```

    This subgrid *is* dense. Area = 5*4=20. H=5.
*   Subgrid B (1,5) to (7,9): `grid[1:8, 5:10]`.
    
```
    1 8 8 1 8
    8 1 8 2 8
    8 8 8 8 1
    8 1 2 8 2
    8 8 8 1 8
    1 1 8 1 8
    8 1 1 8 2
    ```

    This subgrid *is* dense. Area = 7*5=35. H=7.
*   Subgrid C (7,1) to (9,3): `grid[7:10, 1:4]`.
    
```
    8 2 2
    2 2 1
    2 1 8
    ```

    This subgrid *is* dense. Area = 3*3=9. H=3.

Okay, the previous code *correctly* identified A, B, and C as having dense bounding box subgrids in Example 1. Why did it choose C? Because it had the minimum area (9). This contradicts the result from Example 2, where the minimum area subgrid (B, area 16) was *not* chosen; instead, A (area 20) was chosen.

**There must be another filtering criterion or selection rule.**

What if the rule relates to the original component shape, not just the bounding box?
Let the "density" be defined differently?

Alternative definition: A component is "solid" if the number of pixels in the component equals the area of its bounding box.
*   Ex 1:
    *   Comp A: Pixels = ? Bbox Area = 20.
    *   Comp B: Pixels = ? Bbox Area = 35.
    *   Comp C: Pixels = 8. Bbox Area = 9. Not solid.
*   Ex 2:
    *   Comp A: Pixels = 20. Bbox Area = 20. Solid. -> Output
    *   Comp B: Pixels = 16. Bbox Area = 16. Solid.
    *   Comp C: Pixels = 24. Bbox Area = 24. Solid.
*   Ex 3:
    *   Comp A: Pixels = 24. Bbox Area = 24. Solid. -> Output
    *   Comp B: Pixels = 24. Bbox Area = 24. Solid.

**Revised Hypothesis 2:**

1.  Find all connected components of non-white pixels.
2.  For each component, determine its minimal bounding box and calculate the area of the bounding box (`bbox_area`).
3.  Count the number of pixels in the component (`component_pixels`).
4.  Filter the components, keeping only those that are "solid": `component_pixels == bbox_area`.
5.  If no solid components are found, handle error/return empty.
6.  Among the solid components, select the one with the *maximum height* (based on its bounding box).
7.  If there's a tie in height, select the one whose bounding box has the *minimum top row index*.
8.  If there's still a tie, select the one whose bounding box has the *minimum left column index*.
9.  The output is the subgrid defined by the bounding box of the selected solid component.

Let's test Revised Hypothesis 2:
*   Ex 1: No components are "solid" (Comp C has 8 pixels, bbox area 9). This hypothesis fails.

**Backtrack.** The initial code worked for Ex 1 and 3, failing only on Ex 2. The rule was: Find components, get bboxes, find bboxes whose subgrids are dense (no zeros), pick the one with minimum area.

Why did this fail Ex 2? It picked B (area 16) when A (area 20) was expected. What makes A special?
*   A: Area 20, H=5, W=4, top=(0,6) -> Expected
*   B: Area 16, H=4, W=4, top=(1,1)
*   C: Area 24, H=4, W=6, top=(6,3)

Is it position? A is the top-most (row 0). B is row 1, C is row 6.
Let's test "minimum top row index" among dense subgrids.
*   Ex 1: Dense subgrids A (top=0), B (top=1), C (top=7). Rule selects A. Output is C. **Fails.**
*   Ex 2: Dense subgrids A (top=0), B (top=1), C (top=6). Rule selects A. Output is A. **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Dense subgrids A (top=0), B (top=3). Rule selects A. Output is A. **Matches.**

This works for 2 out of 3.

What if it's "minimum left column index"?
*   Ex 1: Dense subgrids A (left=0), B (left=5), C (left=1). Rule selects A. Output is C. **Fails.**
*   Ex 2: Dense subgrids A (left=6), B (left=1), C (left=3). Rule selects B. Output is A. **Fails.**
*   Ex 3: Dense subgrids A (left=0), B (left=6). Rule selects A. Output is A. **Matches.**

This fails for 2 out of 3.

What is unique about C in Ex 1, A in Ex 2, A in Ex 3?

Ex 1: Output C (Area 9, H=3, W=3, top=7, left=1)
Candidates: A (Area 20, H=5, W=4, top=0, left=0), B (Area 35, H=7, W=5, top=1, left=5), C (Area 9, H=3, W=3, top=7, left=1)
Selection: Smallest Area.

Ex 2: Output A (Area 20, H=5, W=4, top=0, left=6)
Candidates: A (Area 20, H=5, W=4, top=0, left=6), B (Area 16, H=4, W=4, top=1, left=1), C (Area 24, H=4, W=6, top=6, left=3)
Selection: Tallest? (Max Height = 5). If tie, min top row. Unique tallest.

Ex 3: Output A (Area 24, H=6, W=4, top=0, left=0)
Candidates: A (Area 24, H=6, W=4, top=0, left=0), B (Area 24, H=6, W=4, top=3, left=6)
Selection: Largest Area? (Max Area = 24). Tie-break min top row (0 vs 3). Select A.

This suggests a complex selection priority:
1. Max Height? (Ex 2)
2. Smallest Area? (Ex 1)
3. Largest Area? (Ex 3)

This doesn't feel like a single consistent rule.

Let's reconsider the "dense" definition. Maybe "dense" means something else.
What if density refers to the component *relative* to its bounding box?
Density = `component_pixels / bbox_area`.
*   Ex 1:
    *   A: ?/20
    *   B: ?/35
    *   C: 8/9 = 0.889 -> Output
*   Ex 2:
    *   A: 20/20 = 1.0 -> Output
    *   B: 16/16 = 1.0
    *   C: 24/24 = 1.0
*   Ex 3:
    *   A: 24/24 = 1.0 -> Output
    *   B: 24/24 = 1.0

**Hypothesis 3: Maximize Density Ratio**

1.  Find components.
2.  Calculate bbox and `density_ratio = component_pixels / bbox_area` for each.
3.  Select the component(s) with the *maximum* density ratio.
4.  If tie: use Max Height.
5.  If tie: use Min Top Row.
6.  If tie: use Min Left Col.
7.  Output the bbox subgrid of the selected component.

Let's test Hypothesis 3:
*   Ex 1: Max density ratio is Component C (8/9). Select C. Output is C. **Matches.** (Assuming other ratios are lower, need pixel counts for A and B).
*   Ex 2: Max density ratio is 1.0 (tie: A, B, C). Tie-break Max Height: A (H=5), B (H=4), C (H=4). Select A. Output is A. **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Max density ratio is 1.0 (tie: A, B). Tie-break Max Height: A (H=6), B (H=6). Tie. Tie-break Min Top Row: A (top=0), B (top=3). Select A. Output is A. **Matches.**

This hypothesis seems promising! It relies on calculating the component pixel count, which the previous code didn't explicitly do but is available from `len(component)`.

Let's refine the plan:
1.  Find connected components (list of pixel coords).
2.  For each component:
    *   Calculate `component_pixels = len(component)`.
    *   Calculate bounding box `(min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)`.
    *   Calculate `bbox_height = max_r - min_r + 1`.
    *   Calculate `bbox_width = max_c - min_c + 1`.
    *   Calculate `bbox_area = bbox_height * bbox_width`.
    *   Calculate `density_ratio = component_pixels / bbox_area`.
    *   Store `(density_ratio, bbox_height, min_r, min_c, component)`.
3.  Sort the stored tuples in descending order of `density_ratio`, then descending order of `bbox_height`, then ascending order of `min_r`, then ascending order of `min_c`.
4.  Select the first component after sorting.
5.  Get the bounding box for the selected component.
6.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid using the selected bounding box.
7.  Return the subgrid.

This seems like a single, consistent rule that matches all examples.

Need to verify the pixel counts for Ex 1, Components A and B to confirm C has the highest ratio.
Component C: 8 pixels / Area 9 = 0.889
Need counts for A and B.

**Analysis of Ex 1 Density Ratios:**

Wait, the code output shows all components in Ex 1 have a density ratio of 1.0. Let's re-check component C's pixels vs bbox.
Bbox C: (7,1) to (9,3). Area = 3*3 = 9.
Subgrid C: `[[8, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 8]]`.
Component C pixels (from `find_connected_components`): Let's trace manually. Start at (7,1)=8. Neighbours (7,2)=2, (8,1)=2.
From (7,2)=2: Neighbours (7,1)=8(v), (7,3)=2, (8,2)=2.
From (8,1)=2: Neighbours (7,1)=8(v), (8,2)=2(v), (9,1)=2.
From (7,3)=2: Neighbours (7,2)=2(v), (8,3)=1.
From (8,2)=2: Neighbours (7,2)=2(v), (8,1)=2(v), (8,3)=1(v), (9,2)=1.
From (9,1)=2: Neighbours (8,1)=2(v), (9,2)=1(v).
From (8,3)=1: Neighbours (7,3)=2(v), (8,2)=2(v), (9,3)=8.
From (9,2)=1: Neighbours (8,2)=2(v), (9,1)=2(v), (9,3)=8(v).
From (9,3)=8: Neighbours (8,3)=1(v), (9,2)=1(v).
All pixels in the 3x3 bbox are visited and non-zero. The component pixel count IS 9. The previous manual count of 8 was wrong.

So, for Ex 1, all three components are "solid" (density ratio 1.0).
*   Ex 1: Ratios = 1.0 (A, B, C). Tie. Max Height: B (H=7), A (H=5), C (H=3). Select B. Output is C. **Hypothesis 3 Fails.**
*   Ex 2: Ratios = 1.0 (A, B, C). Tie. Max Height: A (H=5), B (H=4), C (H=4). Select A. Output is A. **Matches.**
*   Ex 3: Ratios = 1.0 (A, B). Tie. Max Height: A (H=6), B (H=6). Tie. Min Top Row: A (top=0), B (top=3). Select A. Output is A. **Matches.**

Hypothesis 3 based on maximizing density fails for Example 1.

**Final Attempt: Revisit Smallest Area**

The very first idea: "find the *smallest* dense subgrid" worked for Ex 1 and Ex 3, but failed for Ex 2.
*   Ex 1: Areas 20, 35, 9. Smallest is 9 (C). Output C. Matches.
*   Ex 2: Areas 20, 16, 24. Smallest is 16 (B). Output A. Fails.
*   Ex 3: Areas 24, 24. Smallest is 24 (Tie A, B). Tie-break: first found (A). Output A. Matches.

Is there a filter *before* selecting the smallest area?
What if we only consider components whose bounding box contains *at least one* pixel of a certain color? Or *doesn't* contain a pixel of a certain color?

Look at the colors *inside* the bounding boxes:
*   Ex 1:
    *   A (Area 20): {1, 8, 2}
    *   B (Area 35): {1, 8, 2}
    *   C (Area 9): {8, 2, 1} -> Output
*   Ex 2:
    *   A (Area 20): {8, 2, 1} -> Output
    *   B (Area 16): {8, 1, 2}
    *   C (Area 24): {8, 2, 1}
*   Ex 3:
    *   A (Area 24): {2, 8, 1} -> Output
    *   B (Area 24): {1, 8, 2}

This doesn't seem to help. All candidate bounding boxes contain colors 1, 2, and 8.

Could the definition of "component" be different? Using 8-connectivity? Unlikely to make such a difference here.

Could the definition of "bounding box" be different? Padded? Unlikely.

**Let's reconsider Ex 2 failure.** Code picked B (Area 16). Expected A (Area 20). Why A?
Maybe it's the bounding box that is *closest to the top edge*?
*   Ex 1: A (top=0), B (top=1), C (top=7). Select A. Output C. Fails.
*   Ex 2: A (top=0), B (top=1), C (top=6). Select A. Output A. Matches.
*   Ex 3: A (top=0), B (top=3). Select A. Output A. Matches.

This "minimum top row" rule works for Ex 2 and 3, but not 1.

What if we combine rules? Select based on "minimum area", BUT if there's a candidate touching the top edge (row 0), prioritize that?
*   Ex 1: Candidates A, B, C. A touches top edge (row 0). Select A. Output C. Fails.

What if we select based on "minimum area", BUT if there's a candidate touching the *bottom* edge, prioritize that?
*   Ex 1: Grid H=10. Candidates A(max_r=4), B(max_r=7), C(max_r=9). C touches bottom edge. Select C. Output C. Matches.
*   Ex 2: Grid H=10. Candidates A(max_r=4), B(max_r=4), C(max_r=9). C touches bottom edge. Select C. Output A. Fails.

This is really tricky. The simple "minimum area of dense subgrid" works for 2/3. The failure on Ex 2 is the key. Why ignore the smaller area=16 subgrid B?

Maybe the subgrid has to contain a specific color? All contain 1, 2, 8.
Maybe the component connectivity matters *within* the bbox? (e.g. are all pixels of color X connected *within* the bbox?)

Let's re-focus on the original successful code structure and the single failure point.
The code finds *all* subgrids derived from component bounding boxes that contain *no zero pixels*. From that set, it selects the one with the minimum area.

Why override minimum area in Ex 2?
Perhaps the number of components matters? Ex 1 has 3, Ex 2 has 3, Ex 3 has 2.
Perhaps the overall grid size matters? All 10x10.

Could it be related to symmetry? None look symmetric.
Could it be related to the colors on the border of the subgrid?
*   Ex 1 C border: {8, 2, 1}
*   Ex 2 A border: {8}
*   Ex 2 B border: {8}
*   Ex 2 C border: {8}
*   Ex 3 A border: {2, 8, 1}
*   Ex 3 B border: {1, 8}

In Ex 2, the chosen subgrid A has only Azure (8) on its border. The rejected subgrid B also only has Azure (8) on its border. The rejected subgrid C also only has Azure (8) on its border. This doesn't distinguish A.

What if we look at the number of *internal* pixels (not on the border of the bbox)?
*   Ex 1 C (3x3): 1 internal pixel (at center) -> color 2.
*   Ex 2 A (5x4): (5-2)*(4-2) = 3*2 = 6 internal pixels. Colors {2, 8, 1}.
*   Ex 2 B (4x4): (4-2)*(4-2) = 2*2 = 4 internal pixels. Colors {1, 8, 2}.
*   Ex 2 C (4x6): (4-2)*(6-2) = 2*4 = 8 internal pixels. Colors {8, 2, 1}.
*   Ex 3 A (6x4): (6-2)*(4-2) = 4*2 = 8 internal pixels. Colors {8, 1, 8, 8, 2, 8}. -> {1, 2, 8}.
*   Ex 3 B (6x4): (6-2)*(4-2) = 4*2 = 8 internal pixels. Colors {8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8}. -> {1, 2, 8}.

Still no obvious differentiator for selecting A in Ex 2 over B.

Let's assume the "Minimum Area of Dense Subgrid" rule is *mostly* correct. What's the exception for Ex 2?
Maybe there's a property that *disqualifies* subgrid B in Ex 2?
Grid B (4x4): `[[8,8,8,8],[8,1,8,8],[8,8,2,8],[8,8,8,8]]`
Grid A (5x4): `[[8,8,8,8],[8,2,2,8],[8,8,8,8],[8,2,1,8],[8,8,8,8]]`

Is it about the number of pixels of each color?
A: 16x(8), 3x(2), 1x(1)
B: 14x(8), 1x(2), 1x(1)
C: 20x(8), 2x(2), 2x(1)

Maybe the rule is: find all dense subgrids. Select the one with the minimum area, UNLESS there is another dense subgrid that has *strictly more* pixels of *every* non-Azure color?
Comparing A and B in Ex 2:
A has 3x(2), B has 1x(2). (A > B for color 2)
A has 1x(1), B has 1x(1). (A == B for color 1)
This doesn't fit the "strictly more of every" idea.

What if it's about the *sum* of non-Azure pixel counts?
A: 3+1=4
B: 1+1=2
C: 2+2=4
This suggests A or C over B. How to choose A over C? A has area 20, C has area 24. Min area selects A.

**Hypothesis 4: Maximize Sum of Minority Colors, then Minimize Area**

1.  Find components.
2.  Get bounding boxes.
3.  Extract subgrids. Filter for density (no zeros). Keep these dense subgrids.
4.  For each dense subgrid, calculate the sum of counts of all pixels *not* equal to Azure (8). Let this be `minority_sum`.
5.  Find the maximum `minority_sum` among all dense subgrids.
6.  Filter the dense subgrids, keeping only those with `minority_sum == max_minority_sum`.
7.  Among the remaining subgrids, select the one with the *minimum area*.
8.  (If tie in area, use Min Top Row, then Min Left Col).
9.  Return the selected subgrid.

Let's test Hypothesis 4:
*   Ex 1: Dense subgrids A, B, C.
    *   A: Area 20. Pixels {1, 8, 2}. Count(1)+Count(2) = ?
    *   B: Area 35. Pixels {1, 8, 2}. Count(1)+Count(2) = ?
    *   C: Area 9. Pixels {8, 2, 1}. Grid: `[[8,2,2],[2,2,1],[2,1,8]]`. Count(1)=2, Count(2)=4. Sum = 6.
    Need counts for A and B.
    A: `[[1,1,1,8],[1,8,1,1],[8,2,8,1],[1,1,1,8],[8,1,8,8]]`. Count(1)=8, Count(2)=1. Sum = 9.
    B: `[[1,8,8,1,8],[8,1,8,2,8],[8,8,8,8,1],[8,1,2,8,2],[8,8,8,1,8],[1,1,8,1,8],[8,1,1,8,2]]`. Count(1)=8, Count(2)=3. Sum = 11.
    Max `minority_sum` = 11 (Grid B). Rule selects B. Output is C. **Hypothesis 4 Fails.**

Maybe Azure (8) isn't special. What if it's the most frequent color *in that subgrid*?
* Ex 1, C: Most freq is 2 (4 times). Minority sum = Count(1)+Count(8) = 2+3=5.
* Ex 2, A: Most freq is 8 (16 times). Minority sum = Count(1)+Count(2) = 1+3=4.
* Ex 2, B: Most freq is 8 (14 times). Minority sum = Count(1)+Count(2) = 1+1=2.
* Ex 2, C: Most freq is 8 (20 times). Minority sum = Count(1)+Count(2) = 2+2=4.

**Hypothesis 5: Maximize Sum of Non-Dominant Colors, then Minimize Area**

1. Find components -> bboxes -> dense subgrids.
2. For each dense subgrid:
    a. Find the most frequent color (`dominant_color`). (If tie, pick lowest number?)
    b. Calculate `non_dominant_sum` = sum of counts of all colors != `dominant_color`.
3. Find `max_non_dominant_sum`.
4. Filter subgrids with `non_dominant_sum == max_non_dominant_sum`.
5. Select minimum area from remaining.
6. Tie-break: Min Top Row, Min Left Col.

Let's test Hypothesis 5:
*   Ex 1: Dense subgrids A, B, C.
    *   A: Area 20. Dominant=8 (11 times). Others: 1(8), 2(1). Sum=9.
    *   B: Area 35. Dominant=8 (24 times). Others: 1(8), 2(3). Sum=11.
    *   C: Area 9. Dominant=2 (4 times). Others: 1(2), 8(3). Sum=5.
    Max sum = 11 (Grid B). Rule selects B. Output is C. **Hypothesis 5 Fails.**

**Conclusion:** The simple rule "Minimum area of dense subgrid" works for Ex 1 and Ex 3. Something overrides this for Ex 2 to select Area 20 instead of Area 16. None of the secondary properties explored (height, position, color counts, density ratio) consistently explain all three examples. It's possible the definition of "component" or "dense" is different, or there's a geometric property missed.

Given the time constraint and difficulty, I will stick with the original hypothesis that led to the initial code, as it passed 2/3 examples. The failure in Ex 2 suggests a missing piece, but the rule seems the most plausible starting point. The natural language program should reflect this rule, acknowledging the discrepancy in Ex 2 might require further refinement.

**General Assessment:** The provided code implements the logic: "Find all connected components, get their bounding boxes, filter for bounding boxes that define a 'dense' subgrid (no white pixels), and select the dense subgrid with the minimum area." This logic works for Examples 1 and 3 but fails for Example 2, where it selects a subgrid with area 16, but the expected output corresponds to a subgrid with area 20. The reason for preferring the larger subgrid in Example 2 is unclear based on simple properties like height, position, color counts, or density ratios when trying to find a rule consistent across all examples.

**Strategy:** Document the "Minimum Area of Dense Subgrid" rule. Note the failure in Example 2 as an exception needing further investigation or a more complex selection criterion not yet identified. The YAML facts and natural language program will be based on this primary rule.

#   - Bbox subgrids for A, B, and C are all dense.
#   - Areas: Area(A)=20, Area(B)=35, Area(C)=9.

## Goal:
Identify a specific rectangular region within the input grid based on connected non-white pixels and output that region.

## Steps:
1.  **Find Components:** Locate all distinct groups of connected non-white (color 1-9) pixels in the input grid. Use 4-way adjacency (pixels sharing an edge are connected).
2.  **Determine Bounding Boxes:** For each identified component, find the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all pixels belonging to that component.
3.  **Extract Subgrids:** For each bounding box, extract the corresponding rectangular subgrid from the input grid.
4.  **Filter for Density:** Examine each extracted subgrid. Keep only those subgrids that are "dense," meaning they contain absolutely no white pixels (pixels with value 0).
5.  **Identify Smallest Area:** Among the dense subgrids identified in the previous step, find the one(s) that have the smallest area (area = height * width).
6.  **Select Final Subgrid:**
    *   If there is only one dense subgrid with the minimum area, select that subgrid.
    *   If there are multiple dense subgrids tied for the minimum area, select the one whose bounding box appears earliest in the grid (e.g., the one whose top-left corner has the smallest row index, and then the smallest column index in case of a further tie).
7.  **Output:** The selected dense subgrid is the final output. If no dense subgrids are found in step 4, the output might be considered empty or undefined based on task constraints (e.g., return an empty grid).

## Note:
This program accurately describes the transformation for Examples 1 and 3. However, for Example 2, this logic selects a subgrid (area 16) different from the expected output (area 20). This suggests an additional rule or a modification to the selection criteria (step 5 or 6) might be needed to fully capture the task's logic, but the exact modification is not yet clear from the provided examples.
