task_description: Extract the smallest rectangular subgrid that contains only non-white pixels and perfectly encloses a connected component of non-white pixels.

definitions:
  - object: Connected Component
    definition: A contiguous group of non-white (non-zero) pixels connected horizontally or vertically (4-connectivity).
  - object: Bounding Box
    definition: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of a Connected Component. Defined by (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col).
  - object: Subgrid
    definition: A rectangular section of the main grid.
  - property: Density
    definition: The proportion of non-white pixels within a Subgrid. A "fully dense" subgrid has a density of 1.0 (no white pixels).
  - property: Area
    definition: The total number of pixels in a Subgrid (height * width).

input_grid:
  - contains: Multiple pixels of various colors (1-9) and white pixels (0).
  - contains: One or more Connected Components.

output_grid:
  - corresponds_to: A specific Subgrid from the input grid.

actions:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify Objects
    object_type: Connected Component
    details: Find all distinct Connected Components of non-white pixels in the input grid using 4-connectivity.
  - step: 2
    action: Calculate Properties
    object_type: Connected Component
    details: For each Connected Component, determine its Bounding Box.
  - step: 3
    action: Extract Candidate Subgrids
    object_type: Subgrid
    details: Extract the Subgrid defined by the Bounding Box of each Connected Component.
  - step: 4
    action: Filter Candidates
    object_type: Subgrid
    property: Density
    details: Keep only the Subgrids that are fully dense (contain no white pixels).
  - step: 5
    action: Select Finalist
    object_type: Subgrid
    property: Area
    details: From the filtered list of fully dense Subgrids, select the one with the minimum Area. (The examples imply this minimum area subgrid is unique).
  - step: 6
    action: Generate Output
    details: The selected Subgrid (the unique smallest dense one) is the final output grid.
