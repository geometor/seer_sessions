            "text": "## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids have a distinct structure. They feature a rectangular frame made of blue (1) pixels. This frame encloses an inner area. The four corner pixels of the input grid have specific colors that differ in each example.\n2.  **Inner Content:** The area strictly inside the blue frame contains a pattern composed of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The size of this inner area varies (2x2 in the first example, 4x4 in the others).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the inner area extracted from the input grid.\n4.  **Color Transformation:** The output grid's colors are derived from the input grid's corner colors and the pattern within the inner area. Specifically, white pixels (0) in the inner area remain white (0) in the output. Azure pixels (8) in the inner area are replaced by one of the four corner colors from the input grid.\n5.  **Mapping Rule:** The choice of which corner color replaces an azure (8) pixel depends on the pixel's position within the inner grid. The inner grid is conceptually divided into four equal quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). An azure pixel's color in the output is determined by the corner color corresponding to the quadrant it falls into (e.g., an azure pixel in the top-left quadrant of the inner grid becomes the top-left corner color of the input grid).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
