task_context:
  description: Modify a single pixel in the input grid based on colors found above a horizontal gray line.
  input_features:
    - name: grid
      type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - name: middle_column
      description: The column at index floor(width / 2).
      calculation: width // 2
    - name: gray_line
      description: A single, solid horizontal line of gray pixels (color 5).
      properties:
        - row_index: The row where the gray line occurs. Denoted as `gray_row`.
    - name: pixel_above_gray
      description: The pixel located in the middle column, one row above the gray line.
      location: (gray_row - 1, mid_col)
      color: Denoted as C_above.
    - name: pixel_2_above_gray
      description: The pixel located in the middle column, two rows above the gray line. Only relevant if C_above is green.
      location: (gray_row - 2, mid_col)
      color: Denoted as C_above2.
  output_features:
    - name: output_grid
      type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      relationship_to_input: Identical to input grid except for one pixel modification.
  actions:
    - name: find_elements
      description: Identify grid dimensions (height, width), calculate mid_col, find gray_row.
    - name: determine_source_color
      description: Apply conditional logic based on the color C_above at (gray_row - 1, mid_col).
      logic:
        - If C_above is red (2), the source color is red (2).
        - If C_above is green (3), the source color is C_above2 (the color at (gray_row - 2, mid_col)).
        - If C_above is yellow (4), the source color is blue (1).
        - Other colors for C_above are not present in examples; assume they map to themselves or follow a default rule if encountered. (Safest assumption based on examples: if not 2, 3, or 4, maybe use C_above itself?) Let's stick to the observed rules for now.
    - name: modify_target_pixel
      description: Change the color of the pixel at the bottom of the middle column.
      location: (height - 1, mid_col)
      new_color: The determined source color.
