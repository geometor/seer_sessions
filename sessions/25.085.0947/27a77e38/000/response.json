Below this gray line, there are one or more rows consisting entirely of white pixels (value 0). The area above the gray line contains various colors.\n2.  **Transformation:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for a single pixel change. This change occurs in the white area below the gray line.\n3.  **Location of Change:** The modified pixel is always located in the *last row* of the grid and in the *middle column*. If the grid has an even width, the middle column appears to be the one slightly to the left of the exact center (index `floor(width / 2)`).\n4.  **Color of Change:** The color added to the bottom-middle pixel is determined by the color of the pixel in the *first row* (row index 0) of the *same middle column*.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
