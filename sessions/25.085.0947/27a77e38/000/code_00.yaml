task_description: Modify a single pixel in the input grid based on a color found in the top row.
elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      - Contains various colored pixels.
      - Features a horizontal line of gray pixels (5).
      - Has an area of white pixels (0) below the gray line.
  - name: output_grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      - Mostly identical to the input grid.
  - name: gray_line
    type: Object (Horizontal Line)
    properties:
      - Composed entirely of gray pixels (5).
      - Separates the upper colored area from the lower white area.
      - Its row index varies between examples.
  - name: target_pixel
    type: Pixel
    properties:
      - Location: In the last row and the middle column of the grid. (Column index = floor(width / 2))
      - Initial state: White (0) in the input grid.
      - Final state: Changed color in the output grid.
  - name: source_pixel
    type: Pixel
    properties:
      - Location: In the first row (row 0) and the middle column of the grid. (Column index = floor(width / 2))
      - Color: Determines the color of the target_pixel in the output grid.
relationship:
  - The color of the source_pixel is copied to the target_pixel's location in the output grid.
action:
  - Identify the width of the input grid.
  - Calculate the middle column index (floor(width / 2)).
  - Identify the height of the input grid.
  - Determine the last row index (height - 1).
  - Get the color of the pixel at (row 0, middle column).
  - Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - Set the pixel at (last row, middle column) in the output grid to the color obtained in the previous step.
