            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input grids consistently have dimensions of 4 rows by 9 columns. They appear visually divided into three sections: a left 4x4 area, a single vertical column of gray (color 5) pixels in the 5th column (index 4), and a right 4x4 area.\n2.  **Divider**: The gray vertical line acts as a distinct separator between the left and right 4x4 areas.\n3.  **Output Structure**: The output grids are always 4x4, matching the dimensions of the left area of the input grid.\n4.  **Color Roles**:\n    *   The gray color (5) serves solely as a separator and does not appear in the output.\n    *   The white color (0) in the left input area seems to act as a \"replaceable\" or \"background\" color.\n    *   Non-white colors in the left input area seem to be \"persistent\" or \"foreground\" colors.\n    *   Non-white colors in the right input area act as \"source\" colors for replacement.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern**: The output grid appears to be derived from the left 4x4 area of the input grid. The transformation involves selectively replacing the white pixels (0) in the left area with corresponding non-white pixels from the right 4x4 area. If a position in the left area already contains a non-white pixel, it remains unchanged, regardless of the color in the corresponding position in the right area.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
