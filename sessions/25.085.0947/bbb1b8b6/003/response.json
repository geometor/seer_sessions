Check for overlap: Determine if any non-white pixel in the right 4x4 grid \n   corresponds positionally to a non-white pixel in the left 4x4 grid.\n2. If overlap exists: The output grid is an exact copy of the left 4x4 grid.\n3. If no overlap exists: Create the output grid by starting with a copy of the left 4x4 grid. \n   Then, iterate through each cell (r, c). If the cell in the initial output grid \n   (copied from the left grid) is white (0) AND the corresponding cell in the right grid \n   is non-white (>0), update the output grid cell with the color from the right grid cell. \n   Otherwise, leave the output grid cell unchanged.\n4.
