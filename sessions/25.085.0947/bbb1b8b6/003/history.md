Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial code implemented a hypothesis based likely on the first example: "Overlay non-white pixels from the right grid onto the corresponding white pixels of the left grid". This worked for examples 1, 3, 5, and 7, but failed for 2, 4, and 6.

The failures occurred because the code performed the overlay even when the expected output indicated that the left grid should remain unchanged in those cases. Specifically, in examples 2, 4, and 6, the code incorrectly changed white pixels in the left grid to red (2) or green (3) based on the right grid, whereas the expected output kept those pixels white (or whatever color they originally were in the left grid).

The key difference seems to be a *condition* that determines whether the overlay operation happens at all. By comparing the successful transformations (1, 3, 5, 7) with the unsuccessful ones (2, 4, 6), a pattern emerges:

*   **Transformation Occurs (Overlay happens)** when the pixels in the *left* grid that correspond positionally to *all* non-white pixels in the *right* grid are themselves white (0).
*   **Transformation Does Not Occur (Left grid is copied directly to output)** when *any* pixel in the *left* grid corresponding positionally to a non-white pixel in the *right* grid is non-white.

The strategy is to verify this conditional logic against all examples and then update the natural language program to reflect it.

**Metrics & Verification**

Let's verify the condition: "Does any non-white pixel in the right grid correspond positionally to a non-white pixel in the left grid?" If YES, expect no transformation. If NO, expect transformation.

{'Ex1': {'overlap_found': False, 'should_transform': True}, 'Ex2': {'overlap_found': True, 'should_transform': False}, 'Ex3': {'overlap_found': False, 'should_transform': True}, 'Ex4': {'overlap_found': True, 'should_transform': False}, 'Ex5': {'overlap_found': False, 'should_transform': True}, 'Ex6': {'overlap_found': True, 'should_transform': False}, 'Ex7': {'overlap_found': False, 'should_transform': True}}

```
The code execution confirms the hypothesis:
*   Examples 1, 3, 5, 7: `overlap_found` is `False`, indicating transformation `should_transform` = `True`. This matches the successful examples where the output differed from the left grid.
*   Examples 2, 4, 6: `overlap_found` is `True`, indicating transformation `should_transform` = `False`. This matches the failed examples where the expected output was identical to the left grid, and the previous code incorrectly modified it.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
InputStructure:
  - description: A grid composed of two 4x4 sections separated by a single vertical gray divider column.
  - LeftGrid: The 4x4 grid to the left of the divider (columns 0-3). Contains various colors.
  - RightGrid: The 4x4 grid to the right of the divider (columns 5-8). Contains various colors.
  - Divider: A gray (5) column at index 4. Seems purely structural.
OutputStructure:
  - description: A single 4x4 grid.
TransformationCondition:
  - name: Check for Overlap
  - description: Determine if any non-white (color > 0) pixel in the RightGrid corresponds positionally to a non-white pixel in the LeftGrid.
  - outcome_if_overlap: No transformation occurs. OutputGrid is a copy of LeftGrid.
  - outcome_if_no_overlap: Transformation occurs as described below.
TransformationAction (if no overlap):
  - name: Conditional Overlay
  - description: Create the OutputGrid based on the LeftGrid and RightGrid.
  - rule: For each cell (r, c) in the 4x4 grid:
      - If LeftGrid[r, c] is white (0) AND RightGrid[r, c] is non-white (> 0), then OutputGrid[r, c] = RightGrid[r, c].
      - Otherwise, OutputGrid[r, c] = LeftGrid[r, c].
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the left 4x4 grid (columns 0-3) and the right 4x4 grid (columns 5-8) from the input grid.
2.  Check a condition: Iterate through all cell positions (r, c) from (0,0) to (3,3). If a cell in the right grid `RightGrid[r, c]` is non-white (not color 0), check the corresponding cell in the left grid `LeftGrid[r, c]`. If *any* such corresponding `LeftGrid[r, c]` cell is also non-white, then the condition is met (overlap exists).
3.  If the condition is met (overlap exists): The output grid is an exact copy of the left 4x4 grid.
4.  If the condition is *not* met (no overlap): Create the output grid by starting with a copy of the left 4x4 grid. Then, iterate through all cell positions (r, c) from (0,0) to (3,3). If the cell in the initial output grid (copied from the left grid) `OutputGrid[r, c]` is white (color 0) AND the corresponding cell in the right grid `RightGrid[r, c]` is non-white, update the output grid cell `OutputGrid[r, c]` to the color from `RightGrid[r, c]`. Otherwise, leave the `OutputGrid[r, c]` cell unchanged from its initial value (copied from the left grid).
5.  Return the final 4x4 output grid.
