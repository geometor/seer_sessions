"""
Transforms a 4x9 input grid based on a conditional overlay rule. 
The input consists of a left 4x4 grid, a gray divider column, and a right 4x4 grid.

1. Check for overlap: Determine if any non-white pixel in the right 4x4 grid 
   corresponds positionally to a non-white pixel in the left 4x4 grid.
2. If overlap exists: The output grid is an exact copy of the left 4x4 grid.
3. If no overlap exists: Create the output grid by starting with a copy of the left 4x4 grid. 
   Then, iterate through each cell (r, c). If the cell in the initial output grid 
   (copied from the left grid) is white (0) AND the corresponding cell in the right grid 
   is non-white (>0), update the output grid cell with the color from the right grid cell. 
   Otherwise, leave the output grid cell unchanged.
4. The final output is the resulting 4x4 grid.
