InputStructure:
  - description: A grid composed of two 4x4 sections separated by a single vertical gray divider column.
  - LeftGrid: The 4x4 grid to the left of the divider (columns 0-3). Contains various colors.
  - RightGrid: The 4x4 grid to the right of the divider (columns 5-8). Contains various colors.
  - Divider: A gray (5) column at index 4. Seems purely structural.
OutputStructure:
  - description: A single 4x4 grid.
TransformationCondition:
  - name: Check for Overlap
  - description: Determine if any non-white (color > 0) pixel in the RightGrid corresponds positionally to a non-white pixel in the LeftGrid.
  - outcome_if_overlap: No transformation occurs. OutputGrid is a copy of LeftGrid.
  - outcome_if_no_overlap: Transformation occurs as described below.
TransformationAction (if no overlap):
  - name: Conditional Overlay
  - description: Create the OutputGrid based on the LeftGrid and RightGrid.
  - rule: For each cell (r, c) in the 4x4 grid:
      - If LeftGrid[r, c] is white (0) AND RightGrid[r, c] is non-white (> 0), then OutputGrid[r, c] = RightGrid[r, c].
      - Otherwise, OutputGrid[r, c] = LeftGrid[r, c].
