            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implemented a hypothesis based likely on the first example: \"Overlay non-white pixels from the right grid onto the corresponding white pixels of the left grid\". This worked for examples 1, 3, 5, and 7, but failed for 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe failures occurred because the code performed the overlay even when the expected output indicated that the left grid should remain unchanged in those cases. Specifically, in examples 2, 4, and 6, the code incorrectly changed white pixels in the left grid to red (2) or green (3) based on the right grid, whereas the expected output kept those pixels white (or whatever color they originally were in the left grid).\n\nThe key difference seems to be a *condition* that determines whether the overlay operation happens at all. By comparing the successful transformations (1, 3, 5, 7) with the unsuccessful ones (2, 4, 6), a pattern emerges:\n\n*   **Transformation Occurs (Overlay happens)** when the pixels in the *left* grid that correspond positionally to *all* non-white pixels in the *right* grid are themselves white (0).\n*   **Transformation Does Not Occur (Left grid is copied directly to output)** when *any* pixel in the *left* grid corresponding positionally to a non-white pixel in the *right* grid is non-white.\n\nThe strategy is to verify this conditional logic against all examples and then update the natural language program to reflect it.\n\n**Metrics & Verification**\n\nLet's verify the condition: \"Does any non-white pixel in the right grid correspond positionally to a non-white pixel in the left grid?\" If YES, expect no transformation. If NO, expect transformation.\n\n"
