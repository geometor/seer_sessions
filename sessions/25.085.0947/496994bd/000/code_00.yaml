  description: "Mirror a block of non-white rows from the top of the grid to the bottom."
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_remain_constant: True
    - background_color: white (0)

input_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
  - name: top_block
    description: "A contiguous block of rows starting from the top (row 0) containing at least one non-white pixel."
    properties:
      - location: Top of the input_grid
      - content: Contains non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
      - height: Variable, determined by the extent of non-white rows from the top.

output_elements:
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: Same as input_grid
  - name: original_top_block
    description: "The top_block from the input, preserved in its original position."
    location: Top of the output_grid (rows 0 to height(top_block) - 1)
  - name: mirrored_bottom_block
    description: "The top_block from the input, with its rows reversed vertically."
    location: Bottom of the output_grid (rows height(grid) - height(top_block) to height(grid) - 1)
    relationship: Is the vertical mirror image (row order reversed) of the input top_block.
  - name: middle_section
    description: "The area between the original_top_block and the mirrored_bottom_block."
    location: Rows from height(top_block) to height(grid) - height(top_block) - 1
    content: Same as the corresponding rows in the input_grid (typically white in examples).

    details: "Find the contiguous sequence of rows starting from row 0 that contain any non-white pixels. Record the rows and their count (height)."

  - action: place_reversed_block
    input: output_grid, reversed_rows, top_block_height, grid_height
    output: modified output_grid
    details: "Overwrite the bottom 'top_block_height' rows of the output_grid with the 'reversed_rows'. The first row in 'reversed_rows' goes to row 'grid_height - top_block_height', the second to 'grid_height - top_block_height + 1', ..., and the last row in 'reversed_rows' goes to row 'grid_height - 1'."
