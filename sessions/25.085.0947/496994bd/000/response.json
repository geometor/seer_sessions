            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels (colors). The dimensions (height and width) remain the same between input and output in the provided examples.\n2.  **Key Feature:** The inputs have a distinct block of non-white rows starting from the very top row. The rest of the grid below this block is white (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve this top block of non-white rows. This block is preserved in its original position in the output, but it is also mirrored vertically (the order of the rows is reversed) and placed at the very bottom of the output grid. The white space between the original top block and the new bottom block remains white.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n*   Input has a red row (row 0) and an azure row (row 1) at the top. Height of this block is 2.\n*   Output keeps the red row (row 0) and azure row (row 1).\n*   The reversed block [azure row, red row] is placed at the bottom. Since the grid height is 10, the azure row goes to row 8 (10-2) and the red row goes to row 9 (10-1).\n\n**Example 2 Walkthrough:**\n*   Input has two red rows (rows 0, 1) and a green row (row 2) at the top. Height of this block is 3.\n*   Output keeps the two red rows (rows 0, 1) and the green row (row 2).\n*   The reversed block [green row, red row, red row] is placed at the bottom. Since the grid height is 10, the green row goes to row 7 (10-3), the first red row goes to row 8 (10-2), and the second red row goes to row 9 (10-1).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the block of non-white rows at the top of the input grid. Find the index of the first row that is entirely white (or reach the end of the grid). Let the number of non-white rows found starting from row 0 be `k`. These non-white rows constitute the \"top block\" (input rows 0 to `k-1`).\n3.  Create the output grid, initially making it an exact copy of the input grid.\n4.  Iterate through the rows of the identified top block from the input grid (index `i` from 0 to `k-1`).\n5.  For each input row `i`, copy its contents to the output grid at row index `H - 1 - i`. This effectively places the reversed top block at the bottom of the output grid."
