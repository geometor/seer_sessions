            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 5 and a width of 9. They contain pixels of colors white (0), azure (8), yellow (4), and gray (5).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have a height of 5 (same as input) and a width of 4. They contain only pixels of colors white (0) and red (2).\n3.  **Central Separator:** In every input grid, the 5th column (index 4) consists entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This column acts as a vertical separator, dividing the input grid into two main sections: a left section (columns 0-3) and a right section (columns 5-8). Both sections have dimensions 5x4.\n4.  **Ignoring the Separator:** The central yellow column itself does not seem to directly contribute to the pixel values in the output grid. Its primary role appears to be structural, defining the left and right comparison zones.\n5.  **Positional Correspondence:** The output grid's dimensions (5x4) match the dimensions of the left and right sections identified in the input. This suggests a cell-by-cell comparison between the left and right sections to determine the output cell's value.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** Let's analyze the relationship between corresponding pixels in the left (`L`) and right (`R`) sections and the resulting output (`O`) pixel at the same relative position `(row, col)` (where `col` is 0-3).\n    *   If `L(row, col)` is white (0) and `R(row, col)` is non-white (8 or 5), then `O(row, col)` is red (2).\n    *   If `L(row, col)` is non-white (8 or 5) and `R(row, col)` is white (0), then `O(row, col)` is red (2).\n    *   If both `L(row, col)` and `R(row, col)` are white (0), then `O(row, col)` is white (0).\n    *   If both `L(row, col)` and `R(row, col)` are non-white (i.e., both are 8, both are 5, or one is 8 and the other is 5), then `O(row, col)` is white (0).\n7.  **Summary of Logic:** The rule can be summarized as: an output pixel is red (2) if *exactly one* of the corresponding pixels in the left and right input sections is white (0). Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0). This is akin to an XOR operation based on the property of being white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Define the \"left subgrid\" as the first 4 columns (indices 0-3) of the input grid.\n3.  Define the \"right subgrid\" as the last 4 columns (indices 5-8) of the input grid.\n4.  Create a new output grid with the same height as the input grid (5 rows) and a width of 4 columns. Initialize all its pixels to white (0).\n5.  Iterate through each position `(row, col)` in the output grid (where `row` ranges from 0 to 4 and `col` ranges from 0 to 3).\n6.  For the current position `(row, col)`, examine the pixel value in the left subgrid at `(row, col)` and the pixel value in the right subgrid at `(row, col)`.\n7.  If exactly one of these two corresponding pixels (one from the left subgrid, one from the right subgrid) is white (0), set the pixel in the output grid at `(row, col)` to red (2).\n8.  If both corresponding pixels are white (0), or if both are non-white (any combination of 5 or 8), leave the pixel in the output grid at `(row, col)` as white (0).\n9.  The final state of the new grid is the result."
