The original color-source pixel is then removed (set to background color).\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 7x7. The background color is consistently white (0).\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   In each input, there's a primary shape composed of a non-white color (green in `train_1`, red in `train_2`).\n    *   There's a single pixel located at the fixed position (row 6, column 0) - the bottom-left corner. This pixel has a distinct color (magenta in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`).\n*   **Transformation:**\n    1.  The color of the pixel at the bottom-left corner (6,0) is identified. Let's call this the `SourceColor`.\n    2.  All pixels belonging to the primary shape in the input grid are changed to this `SourceColor` in the output grid.\n    3.  The pixel at the bottom-left corner (6,0) in the output grid is changed to the background color (white, 0).\n    4.  All other background pixels remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
