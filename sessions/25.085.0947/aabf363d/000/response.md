*   **Perception:** The task involves recoloring a main shape within a grid based on the color of a specific pixel located at the bottom-left corner. The original color-source pixel is then removed (set to background color).

*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids are 7x7. The background color is consistently white (0).
*   **Objects:**
    *   In each input, there's a primary shape composed of a non-white color (green in `train_1`, red in `train_2`).
    *   There's a single pixel located at the fixed position (row 6, column 0) - the bottom-left corner. This pixel has a distinct color (magenta in `train_1`, yellow in `train_2`).
*   **Transformation:**
    1.  The color of the pixel at the bottom-left corner (6,0) is identified. Let's call this the `SourceColor`.
    2.  All pixels belonging to the primary shape in the input grid are changed to this `SourceColor` in the output grid.
    3.  The pixel at the bottom-left corner (6,0) in the output grid is changed to the background color (white, 0).
    4.  All other background pixels remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_properties:
        size_constant: true
        height: 7
        width: 7
        background_color: 0 # white
      elements:
        - role: target_object
          description: A contiguous shape of non-background color, not located at the bottom-left corner.
          properties:
            initial_color: Variable (e.g., 3/green, 2/red)
            final_color: Determined by the color_source_pixel.
        - role: color_source_pixel
          description: A single pixel used to determine the final color of the target_object.
          properties:
            location: Fixed at (height - 1, 0), which is (6, 0) in these examples.
            initial_color: Variable (e.g., 6/magenta, 4/yellow)
            final_color: Becomes background_color (0/white) in the output.
      transformation:
        type: recoloring
        steps:
          - Identify the color (SourceColor) of the pixel at location (height - 1, 0).
          - Identify all pixels belonging to the target_object (non-background pixels not at (height - 1, 0)).
          - Change the color of all target_object pixels to SourceColor.
          - Change the color of the pixel at (height - 1, 0) to the background color (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (H) of the input grid.
    2.  Get the color (`SourceColor`) of the pixel located at coordinates (H-1, 0) in the input grid.
    3.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
    4.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid at row `R` and column `C`.
    5.  If the input pixel at (R, C) is *not* white (0) AND the coordinates (R, C) are *not* (H-1, 0), then set the corresponding pixel at (R, C) in the output grid to `SourceColor`.
    6.  Return the completed output grid.
