            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9x10. They contain blocks of colored pixels separated by white (0) rows and columns. Specifically, row 4 and columns 3 and 6 seem to act as separators. This divides the grid into roughly six rectangular regions containing non-white pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 4x5. They are mostly white, with a 2x3 block of colored pixels located at rows 1-2 and columns 1-3.\n3.  **Content Mapping:** Each colored cell in the output grid seems to correspond to one of the non-white regions (blocks) in the input grid. The spatial arrangement is preserved: the top-left block in the input corresponds to the top-left colored cell in the output, and so on.\n4.  **Color Transformation:** Within each non-white block in the input, there can be multiple colors. The corresponding output cell takes a single color. Observing the examples suggests this output color is the *most frequent* non-white color within the corresponding input block.\n5.  **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple colors share the highest frequency within an input block (e.g., train_1 block 1, train_2 block 1, 2, 4), a tie-breaking rule is needed. Comparing the tied colors and their positions to the output color suggests the rule is to choose the color that appears *first* when scanning the block top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.\n6.  **Block Definition:** The \"blocks\" in the input can be precisely defined as connected components of non-white pixels, where connectivity includes diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify all distinct connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way adjacency (pixels touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are considered connected).\n3.  Sort these components based on their position. The primary sorting key is the minimum row index (top-most pixel) of the component. The secondary sorting key is the minimum column index (left-most pixel) among those top-most pixels. This should result in 6 components ordered top-left, top-middle, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right relative to their positions in the input grid.\n4.
