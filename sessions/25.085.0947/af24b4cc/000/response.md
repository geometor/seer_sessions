Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9x10. They contain blocks of colored pixels separated by white (0) rows and columns. Specifically, row 4 and columns 3 and 6 seem to act as separators. This divides the grid into roughly six rectangular regions containing non-white pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 4x5. They are mostly white, with a 2x3 block of colored pixels located at rows 1-2 and columns 1-3.
3.  **Content Mapping:** Each colored cell in the output grid seems to correspond to one of the non-white regions (blocks) in the input grid. The spatial arrangement is preserved: the top-left block in the input corresponds to the top-left colored cell in the output, and so on.
4.  **Color Transformation:** Within each non-white block in the input, there can be multiple colors. The corresponding output cell takes a single color. Observing the examples suggests this output color is the *most frequent* non-white color within the corresponding input block.
5.  **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple colors share the highest frequency within an input block (e.g., train_1 block 1, train_2 block 1, 2, 4), a tie-breaking rule is needed. Comparing the tied colors and their positions to the output color suggests the rule is to choose the color that appears *first* when scanning the block top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.
6.  **Block Definition:** The "blocks" in the input can be precisely defined as connected components of non-white pixels, where connectivity includes diagonal adjacency (8-way connectivity).

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size_input: [9, 10]
  grid_size_output: [4, 5]
  input_structure: Contains 6 distinct connected components (objects) of non-white pixels, separated by white pixels. These components are spatially arranged in a 2x3 grid pattern.
  output_structure: Primarily white, with a 2x3 area of non-white pixels corresponding spatially to the input components.

objects:
  - id: input_component
    description: A connected component of non-white pixels in the input grid (using 8-way adjacency).
    properties:
      - colors: A list or set of colors present in the component.
      - pixel_coordinates: The set of (row, col) coordinates belonging to the component.
      - color_frequencies: A map of color values to their counts within the component.
      - spatial_order: Determined by the top-most, then left-most pixel coordinate.
  - id: output_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the 2x3 colored area of the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: The resulting color determined from the corresponding input component.
      - position: Coordinates (row, col) within the output grid, specifically (1,1) to (2,3).

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    from: input_component
    to: output_pixel
    rule: The N-th input component (when sorted spatially top-to-bottom, left-to-right) determines the color of the N-th output pixel (when read row by row).

  - action: sort_components
    input: list of input_component objects
    output: sorted list of input_component objects
    description: Sort components based on their top-most, then left-most pixel coordinate.

    description: |

      If one color, select it.
      If multiple colors (tie), select the one whose pixel appears first when scanning the component's pixels top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.
  - action: construct_output

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a 4x5 grid filled with white (0).
2.  Identify all distinct connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid. Use 8-way adjacency (pixels touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are considered connected).
3.  Sort these components based on their position. The primary sorting key is the minimum row index (top-most pixel) of the component. The secondary sorting key is the minimum column index (left-most pixel) among those top-most pixels. This should result in 6 components ordered top-left, top-middle, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right relative to their positions in the input grid.
4.  Create a list to store the resulting colors for the output grid, corresponding to the sorted components.
5.  For each component in the sorted list:
    a.  Count the frequency of each non-white color within that component.
    b.  Determine the highest frequency count among all colors in the component.
    c.  Identify all colors that occur with this highest frequency.
    d.  If only one color has the highest frequency, select this color.
    e.  If there is a tie (multiple colors share the highest frequency), iterate through the pixels of the component in order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right). Select the color of the first pixel encountered that belongs to the set of tied colors.
    f.  Add the selected color to the list of resulting colors.
6.  Populate the 2x3 region within the output grid (rows 1-2, columns 1-3) using the selected colors from the list, preserving the order derived from the sorted components:
    *   Place the 1st color at output[1][1].
    *   Place the 2nd color at output[1][2].
    *   Place the 3rd color at output[1][3].
    *   Place the 4th color at output[2][1].
    *   Place the 5th color at output[2][2].
    *   Place the 6th color at output[2][3].
7.  Return the final output grid.
