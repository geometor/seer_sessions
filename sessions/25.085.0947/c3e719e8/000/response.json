This suggests a scaling or tiling operation where the output is 3 times larger in both height and width than the input.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of nine 3x3 subgrids or \"tiles\".\n3.  **Tile Content:** Each 3x3 tile in the output grid is either an exact copy of the 3x3 input grid or a 3x3 grid filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).\n4.  **Pattern Determination:** The arrangement of input grid copies versus white tiles in the output seems to follow a pattern directly related to the input grid's content.\n5.  **Input-Pattern Correlation:** Observing the three examples, the placement of an input grid copy at a specific tile position `(R, C)` (where `R` and `C` are tile indices from 0 to 2) in the output corresponds to the properties of the pixel at the position `(r, c)` (where `r=R`, `c=C`) in the *input* grid.\n6.  **Most Frequent Color Rule:** By comparing the input pixels with the output tile pattern across all examples, a consistent rule emerges:\n    *   Identify the color that appears most frequently in the 3x3 input grid.\n    *   Create a 3x3 \"pattern grid\" representing the tiles in the output.\n    *   For each cell `(r, c)` in the input grid:\n        *   If the color `input[r][c]` is the most frequent color, the corresponding pattern cell `pattern[r][c]` indicates that the input grid should be placed at tile position `(r, c)`.\n        *   If the color `input[r][c]` is *not* the most frequent color, `pattern[r][c]` indicates that a white tile should be placed at tile position `(r, c)`.\n7.  **Construction:** The final output grid is constructed by placing the appropriate 3x3 tile (either the input grid copy or the white tile) into the 9x9 grid according to the derived pattern grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
