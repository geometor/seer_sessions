Input:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3
Output:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 9
    width: 9
Core Objects:
  - name: Input Grid (I)
    description: The 3x3 source grid.
  - name: Output Grid (O)
    description: The 9x9 target grid, composed of 3x3 tiles.
  - name: White Tile (W)
    description: A 3x3 grid filled with white pixels (color 0).
Derived Objects:
  - name: Pattern Grid (P)
    description: A conceptual 3x3 grid determining the tile type for each position in the output grid. P(r, c) corresponds to the tile at Output Grid position starting at (r*3, c*3).
Properties & Relationships:
  - name: Most Frequent Color (MFC)
    description: The color value that appears most often in the Input Grid (I).
    relation: Derived from Input Grid (I). (Assumption: If ties occur, a consistent rule like choosing the lowest color value might apply, though not demonstrated in examples).
  - name: Pattern Cell State
    description: Each cell P(r, c) in the Pattern Grid has a state ('Use I' or 'Use W').
    relation: State of P(r, c) is 'Use I' if I(r, c) == MFC, otherwise 'Use W'.
  - name: Output Tile Content
    description: The content of the 3x3 tile in the Output Grid starting at (r*3, c*3).
    relation: Determined by the state of P(r, c). If P(r, c) is 'Use I', the tile is a copy of I. If P(r, c) is 'Use W', the tile is W.
Actions:
  1: Analyze Input Grid (I) to determine the Most Frequent Color (MFC).
  2: Determine the state ('Use I' or 'Use W') for each cell P(r, c) based on whether I(r, c) equals MFC.
  3: Construct Output Grid (O) by assembling 3x3 tiles (either I or W) according to the states defined in the Pattern Grid (P).
