elements:
  - type: grid
    input: true
    description: Input grid containing pixels of white (0), red (2), and azure (8).
  - type: pixel
    output: true
    description: Output is a single pixel, either white (0) or azure (8).

objects:
  - type: square
    color: red (2)
    size: 2x2
    attributes:
      - location
      - adjacency_to_azure
    description: Contiguous 2x2 blocks of red pixels.
  - type: pixel_group
    color: azure (8)
    attributes:
      - location
    description: Individual or connected groups of azure pixels.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: red_square
    to: azure_pixel_group
    details: Checks if any pixel of an azure group is adjacent (8 neighbors, including diagonals) to any pixel of a red square.

actions:
  - action: find_objects
    target: input grid
    object_type: 2x2 red squares
    description: Identify all instances of 2x2 red squares in the input grid.
  - action: check_isolation
    target: each identified red square
    condition: No adjacent azure (8) pixels (including diagonals) around the 4 pixels of the square.
    result: Boolean (isolated or not_isolated)
  - action: determine_output
    based_on: isolation check results
    rule: If any red square is found to be isolated, the output is 8. Otherwise, the output is 0.

goal: Determine if any 2x2 red square is isolated from all azure pixels.
