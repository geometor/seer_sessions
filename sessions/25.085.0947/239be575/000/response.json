            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output:** The inputs are grids of varying dimensions containing pixels of white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The outputs are single pixels, either white (0) or azure (8).\n2.  **Key Objects:** The prominent objects in the input grids appear to be 2x2 squares made entirely of red (2) pixels and individual or grouped pixels of azure (8). The background is white (0).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to be a classification or decision problem. Based on some property or relationship between the red squares and the azure pixels within the input grid, a single output color (0 or 8) is determined.\n4.  **Observed Pattern:** By examining the examples where the output is 8 versus 0, a pattern emerges related to the proximity of azure pixels to the red squares. Specifically, it appears to depend on whether *any* of the 2x2 red squares are completely \"isolated\" from *all* azure pixels. Isolation here means having no azure pixels adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to any of the four pixels composing the red square.\n5.  **Hypothesis:** If at least one 2x2 red square exists in the input grid that has no adjacent (including diagonals) azure pixels, the output is 8. Otherwise (if all red squares are adjacent to at least one azure pixel, or if there are no 2x2 red squares), the output is 0.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through the input grid to find all occurrences of 2x2 squares composed entirely of red (2) pixels.\n3.  For each 2x2 red square found:\n    a.  Define the set of coordinates for the 4 pixels forming the square.\n    b.  Define the set of coordinates for all pixels adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to these 4 pixels, ensuring these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.\n    c.  Check the color of each adjacent pixel identified in step 3b.\n    d.  Determine if *any* of these adjacent pixels have the color azure (8).\n    e.  If *none* of the adjacent pixels are azure (8), this specific red square is considered \"isolated\". Set the output value to 8 (azure) and stop checking further red squares (as finding one isolated square is sufficient).\n4.  If the loop completes without finding any \"isolated\" red square (either because all red squares had adjacent azure pixels, or because no 2x2 red squares were found), the output value remains at its initialized value of 0 (white).\n5.  Return the final output value (0 or 8)."
