"""
Check if any 2x2 red (2) square in the input grid is isolated from all azure (8) pixels.
Isolation means no azure pixel is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any of the four pixels forming the red square.
If at least one isolated 2x2 red square exists, the output is 8 (azure).
Otherwise (if all red squares have adjacent azure pixels, or if no 2x2 red squares exist), the output is 0 (white).
The output is a single pixel value, not a grid.
