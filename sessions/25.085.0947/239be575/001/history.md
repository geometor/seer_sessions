Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output:** The inputs are grids of varying dimensions containing pixels of white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The outputs are single pixels, either white (0) or azure (8).
2.  **Key Objects:** The prominent objects in the input grids appear to be 2x2 squares made entirely of red (2) pixels and individual or grouped pixels of azure (8). The background is white (0).
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to be a classification or decision problem. Based on some property or relationship between the red squares and the azure pixels within the input grid, a single output color (0 or 8) is determined.
4.  **Observed Pattern:** By examining the examples where the output is 8 versus 0, a pattern emerges related to the proximity of azure pixels to the red squares. Specifically, it appears to depend on whether *any* of the 2x2 red squares are completely "isolated" from *all* azure pixels. Isolation here means having no azure pixels adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to any of the four pixels composing the red square.
5.  **Hypothesis:** If at least one 2x2 red square exists in the input grid that has no adjacent (including diagonals) azure pixels, the output is 8. Otherwise (if all red squares are adjacent to at least one azure pixel, or if there are no 2x2 red squares), the output is 0.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    input: true
    description: Input grid containing pixels of white (0), red (2), and azure (8).
  - type: pixel
    output: true
    description: Output is a single pixel, either white (0) or azure (8).

objects:
  - type: square
    color: red (2)
    size: 2x2
    attributes:
      - location
      - adjacency_to_azure
    description: Contiguous 2x2 blocks of red pixels.
  - type: pixel_group
    color: azure (8)
    attributes:
      - location
    description: Individual or connected groups of azure pixels.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: red_square
    to: azure_pixel_group
    details: Checks if any pixel of an azure group is adjacent (8 neighbors, including diagonals) to any pixel of a red square.

actions:
  - action: find_objects
    target: input grid
    object_type: 2x2 red squares
    description: Identify all instances of 2x2 red squares in the input grid.
  - action: check_isolation
    target: each identified red square
    condition: No adjacent azure (8) pixels (including diagonals) around the 4 pixels of the square.
    result: Boolean (isolated or not_isolated)
  - action: determine_output
    based_on: isolation check results
    rule: If any red square is found to be isolated, the output is 8. Otherwise, the output is 0.

goal: Determine if any 2x2 red square is isolated from all azure pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output value to 0 (white).
2.  Iterate through the input grid to find all occurrences of 2x2 squares composed entirely of red (2) pixels.
3.  For each 2x2 red square found:
    a.  Define the set of coordinates for the 4 pixels forming the square.
    b.  Define the set of coordinates for all pixels adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to these 4 pixels, ensuring these coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
    c.  Check the color of each adjacent pixel identified in step 3b.
    d.  Determine if *any* of these adjacent pixels have the color azure (8).
    e.  If *none* of the adjacent pixels are azure (8), this specific red square is considered "isolated". Set the output value to 8 (azure) and stop checking further red squares (as finding one isolated square is sufficient).
4.  If the loop completes without finding any "isolated" red square (either because all red squares had adjacent azure pixels, or because no 2x2 red squares were found), the output value remains at its initialized value of 0 (white).
5.  Return the final output value (0 or 8).
