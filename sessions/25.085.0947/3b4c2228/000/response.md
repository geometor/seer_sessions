Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid:** Contains pixels of white (0), green (3), and red (2). The dimensions vary across examples.
2.  **Output Grid:** Is always a 3x3 grid containing only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Key Input Objects:** The inputs feature distinct 2x2 squares made entirely of either green (3) or red (2) pixels.
4.  **Output Pattern:** The blue (1) pixels in the output grid appear along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). The number of blue pixels seems related to the number of green 2x2 squares in the input. Red 2x2 squares do not seem to influence the output.
5.  **Correlation:**
    *   Example 1: 1 green square -> 1 blue pixel at (0,0).
    *   Example 2: 2 green squares -> 2 blue pixels at (0,0) and (1,1).
    *   Example 3: 1 green square -> 1 blue pixel at (0,0).
    *   Example 4: 3 green squares -> 3 blue pixels at (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2).
    *   Example 5: 2 green squares -> 2 blue pixels at (0,0) and (1,1).
6.  **Inference:** The task appears to count the number of 2x2 green squares in the input grid. Based on this count (up to 3), it places blue pixels diagonally in the 3x3 output grid, starting from the top-left.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Identify 2x2 green squares in the input grid and represent their count diagonally in a 3x3 output grid.

input_elements:
  - element: grid

      - color: solid green (3) or solid red (2)
    identifier: 'green_square'
    selector: contiguous 2x2 block of color 3
    relation_to_output: The count of these determines the output pattern.

    value: 1 (blue)
    location:
      - determined by the count of input 'green_square' objects
      - Placed at (0,0) if count >= 1
      - Placed at (1,1) if count >= 2
      - Placed at (2,2) if count >= 3

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a 3x3 output grid and initialize all its pixels to white (0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find all occurrences of 2x2 squares composed entirely of green (3) pixels. Count how many such squares are found. Let this count be `N`.
3.  If `N` is 1 or greater, set the pixel at coordinate (0, 0) in the output grid to blue (1).
4.  If `N` is 2 or greater, set the pixel at coordinate (1, 1) in the output grid to blue (1).
5.  If `N` is 3 or greater, set the pixel at coordinate (2, 2) in the output grid to blue (1).
6.  Return the resulting 3x3 output grid.
