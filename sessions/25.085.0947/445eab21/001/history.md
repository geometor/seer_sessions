*   **Perception**:
    *   Each input grid contains two distinct, non-overlapping objects set against a white background (color 0).
    *   These objects appear to be rectangular "frames" or hollow rectangles, each made of a single, uniform color.
    *   The colors used for the frames in the examples are magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), yellow (4), and red (2).
    *   The output grid is always a 2x2 square.
    *   The color filling the output 2x2 square is determined by the colors of the two frames in the input grid.
    *   Observing the examples:
        *   `train_1`: Input colors are magenta (6) and orange (7). Output color is orange (7).
        *   `train_2`: Input colors are orange (7) and azure (8). Output color is azure (8).
        *   `train_3`: Input colors are yellow (4) and red (2). Output color is yellow (4).
    *   The pattern seems to be that the output color is the one corresponding to the numerically *larger* value between the two frame colors present in the input.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the colors of the two distinct frame objects in the input grid and generate a 2x2 output grid filled with the color that has the higher numerical value.
    input_features:
      - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          count: 2
          type: rectangular frame (hollow rectangle)
          properties:
            - uniform_color (non-white)
            - distinct_colors_between_objects
    output_features:
      - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - content: uniform color
      - color_determination_rule: The numerically higher value of the two object colors from the input grid.
    relationships:
      - The output grid's color is derived by comparing the numerical values of the colors of the two input objects.
      - The output grid's shape (2x2) is constant and independent of the input object shapes or positions.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid. There should be exactly two distinct colors.
    2.  Let these two colors be Color A and Color B, represented by their integer values.
    3.  Compare the integer values of Color A and Color B.
    4.  Select the color corresponding to the larger integer value.
    5.  Create a new 2x2 grid.
    6.  Fill all four cells of the new 2x2 grid with the selected color.
    7.  Output the resulting 2x2 grid.
