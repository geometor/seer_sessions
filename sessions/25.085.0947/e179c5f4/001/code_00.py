    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2. The output grid is filled with 'azure' (8) and 'blue' (1) pixels.
    3. For each row 'r', exactly one pixel is set to 'blue' (1), and the rest are 'azure' (8).
    4. The column index of the 'blue' pixel in row 'r' is determined by a zigzag pattern based on the grid width 'W' and a reversed row index 'k'.
    5. Calculate a reversed row index k = (Height - 1) - r.
    6. Define a sequence S = [0, 1, ..., W-1] + [W-2, ..., 1]. Let L be its length (L = 2*W - 2 for W > 1).
    7. The blue column index for row 'r' is S[k % L].
    8. Edge Case: If W=1, the sequence logic is invalid. In this case, the single column in the output grid is filled entirely with 'blue' (1).
