A single `blue` (1) pixel is consistently located at the bottom-left corner, specifically at coordinates `(height - 1, 0)`. The dimensions of the input grids vary across the examples, particularly the width.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They are filled entirely with `azure` (8) and `blue` (1) pixels. The `white` pixels from the input are completely replaced.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves replacing the `white` background. The position of the single `blue` pixel in the input seems irrelevant *except* that its own position `(height - 1, 0)` remains `blue` in the output. For all other rows, one pixel is colored `blue`, and the rest are `azure`. The column index of the `blue` pixel in each row follows a distinct, repeating zigzag pattern determined by the row index and the grid's width. This pattern moves from column 0 to `width - 1`, then back down to column 1, repeating this cycle.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
