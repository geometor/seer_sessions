## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids are primarily composed of `white` (0) pixels. A single `blue` (1) pixel is consistently located at the bottom-left corner, specifically at coordinates `(height - 1, 0)`. The dimensions of the input grids vary across the examples, particularly the width.
2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They are filled entirely with `azure` (8) and `blue` (1) pixels. The `white` pixels from the input are completely replaced.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves replacing the `white` background. The position of the single `blue` pixel in the input seems irrelevant *except* that its own position `(height - 1, 0)` remains `blue` in the output. For all other rows, one pixel is colored `blue`, and the rest are `azure`. The column index of the `blue` pixel in each row follows a distinct, repeating zigzag pattern determined by the row index and the grid's width. This pattern moves from column 0 to `width - 1`, then back down to column 1, repeating this cycle.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Replace background based on a row-dependent pattern.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Mostly 'white' (0) pixels.
      - Contains a single 'blue' (1) pixel object.
  - Objects:
      - Name: AnchorPixel
        Color: 'blue' (1)
        Position: Fixed at (height - 1, 0).
      - Name: Background
        Color: 'white' (0)
        Position: All other cells.
  - Dimensions:
      - Height: Variable (e.g., 10 in examples)
      - Width: Variable (e.g., 2, 3, 4 in examples)

Output_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Same dimensions as the input grid.
      - Contains only 'azure' (8) and 'blue' (1) pixels.
      - Exactly one 'blue' pixel per row.
  - Objects:
      - Name: PatternPixels
        Color: 'blue' (1)
        Position: One pixel per row, column determined by a pattern.
      - Name: FillPixels
        Color: 'azure' (8)
        Position: All cells not occupied by PatternPixels.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Action: Replace 'white' pixels and determine 'blue' positions.
  - Pattern:
      - Type: Zigzag column selection per row.
      - Dependency: Row index (r), Grid width (W).
      - Sequence: Define a sequence `S = [0, 1, ..., W-1] + [W-2, ..., 1]`. Length is `L = 2*W - 2`. (Assumes W >= 2).
      - Calculation: For each row `r` (from 0 to height-1):
          - Calculate reverse row index `k = (height - 1) - r`.
          - Calculate sequence index `idx = k % L`.
          - Determine the column for the 'blue' pixel: `blue_col = S[idx]`.
      - Output assignment:
          - Set pixel `(r, blue_col)` to 'blue' (1).
          - Set all other pixels in row `r` to 'azure' (8).
  - Edge Case:
      - If Width (W) is 1, the transformation rule based on the sequence is undefined. The examples provided only show W >= 2. Assuming W >= 2 is required for this pattern. (If W=1, perhaps the output mirrors the input or follows a simpler rule like keeping blue as blue and changing white to azure).

Relationships:
  - The position of the 'blue' pixel in each output row `r` is calculated based on `r`, the grid height `H`, and the grid width `W`.
  - The original 'blue' pixel's position `(H-1, 0)` consistently becomes 'blue' in the output according to the pattern calculation (`k=0`, `idx=0`, `S[0]=0`).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions `H` x `W`.
3.  **Handle Edge Case:** If the width `W` is 1, copy the input grid directly to the output grid and stop.
4.  **Generate Zigzag Sequence:** Construct a sequence of column indices `S` by concatenating the list `[0, 1, ..., W-1]` with the list `[W-2, W-3, ..., 1]`. The total length of this sequence `S` will be `L = 2*W - 2`.
5.  **Fill Output Grid:** Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1`:
    a.  Calculate a reversed row index `k = (H - 1) - r`.
    b.  Calculate the index within the zigzag sequence: `idx = k % L`.
    c.  Determine the target column for the `blue` pixel in the current row: `blue_col = S[idx]`.
    d.  Iterate through each column `c` from 0 to `W-1`:
        i.  If the current column `c` is equal to `blue_col`, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `blue` (1).
        ii. Otherwise, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `azure` (8).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
