## General Assessment

The provided code successfully implemented the scaling part of the transformation (each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output) for all examples. However, the rule for placing the blue (1) pixels, derived solely from Example 1, was incorrect for Examples 2 and 3.

The errors in Examples 2 and 3 show that the blue pixels are not simply placed along a diagonal shifted by the input dimensions. Instead, the placement of blue pixels seems related to the *original color* of the input pixels, specifically the white (0) pixels, and their corresponding positions in the scaled output grid.

The strategy is to analyze the locations of all blue pixels in the expected outputs across all examples, relate them back to the input grids, and formulate a revised rule for blue pixel placement that holds true for all cases. The analysis indicates that blue pixels replace the top-left and bottom-right corners of the 2x2 blocks that correspond to *white* pixels in the input grid.

## Metrics

Let's verify the number of differing pixels reported for the failed examples.


``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and returns the number of differing pixels."""
    arr1 = np.array(grid1)
    arr2 = np.array(grid2)
    if arr1.shape != arr2.shape:
        return "Shape mismatch"
    return np.sum(arr1 != arr2)

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 and modify specific corners based on the original pixel color.

grid_properties:
  - input_height: H
  - input_width: W
  - output_height: H * 2
  - output_width: W * 2

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Initialize output grid
    details: Create an output grid of size (H*2, W*2) filled with white (0) pixels.
  - step: 2
    action: Scale non-white pixels
    details: For each pixel at input coordinate (r, c) with a non-white color C:
      - Identify the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid starting at (2*r, 2*c).
      - Fill this 2x2 block with color C.
  - step: 3
    action: Place blue pixels for white input pixels
    details: For each pixel at input coordinate (r, c) with the color white (0):
      - Identify the corresponding 2x2 block corners in the output grid:
        - Top-left corner: (2*r, 2*c)
        - Bottom-right corner: (2*r + 1, 2*c + 1)
      - Set the color of these two corner pixels in the output grid to blue (1). This overwrites any color placed in step 2 (which would only be white anyway, since step 2 skips white input pixels).

color_mapping:
  - white: 0
  - blue: 1
  - red: 2
  - green: 3
  - yellow: 4
  - gray: 5
  # Other colors (6-9) are treated like 2-5 if they appear.

key_observations:
  - The output grid dimensions are always double the input grid dimensions.
  - Each input pixel conceptually maps to a 2x2 area in the output grid.
  - Input pixels that are *not* white (0) result in a solid 2x2 block of their color in the output.
  - Input pixels that *are* white (0) result in a 2x2 block that is mostly white, but the top-left and bottom-right corners are changed to blue (1).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height H, width W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (H * 2, W * 2), initially filled with white pixels (color 0).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `H-1` and `c=0` to `W-1`.
4.  Let `C` be the color of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
5.  If the input color `C` is *not* white (i.e., `C != 0`):
    *   Calculate the top-left coordinates of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid: `(output_r, output_c) = (r * 2, c * 2)`.
    *   Fill the 2x2 block in the output grid starting at `(output_r, output_c)` with the color `C`. Specifically, set pixels `(output_r, output_c)`, `(output_r+1, output_c)`, `(output_r, output_c+1)`, and `(output_r+1, output_c+1)` to `C`.
6.  If the input color `C` *is* white (i.e., `C == 0`):
    *   Calculate the coordinates of the top-left corner in the output grid: `(corner1_r, corner1_c) = (r * 2, c * 2)`.
    *   Calculate the coordinates of the bottom-right corner in the output grid: `(corner2_r, corner2_c) = (r * 2 + 1, c * 2 + 1)`.
    *   Set the pixel at `(corner1_r, corner1_c)` in the output grid to blue (color 1).
    *   Set the pixel at `(corner2_r, corner2_c)` in the output grid to blue (color 1).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
