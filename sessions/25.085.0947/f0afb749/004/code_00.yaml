task_description: Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 and replace each pixel with a 2x2 block based on its color.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers (colors 0-9).
  - Output grid dimensions are exactly double the input grid dimensions (height*2, width*2).
objects:
  - Pixels in the input grid.
  - 2x2 blocks in the output grid corresponding to each input pixel.
transformations:
  - scaling: The overall grid dimensions are doubled.
  - substitution: Each input pixel determines the content of a corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid.
mapping_rule:
  - rule_type: Per-pixel substitution into 2x2 blocks.
  - input_pixel_condition: Color is non-white (value != 0).
    output_block_content: A solid 2x2 block filled with the input pixel's color.
  - input_pixel_condition: Color is white (value == 0).
    output_block_content: A 2x2 block with blue (1) at the top-left and bottom-right corners, and white (0) elsewhere (`[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`).
process_order:
  - Initialize an output grid of double dimensions, filled with white (0).
  - Iterate through each pixel (r, c) of the input grid.
  - Determine the corresponding 2x2 block's top-left corner in the output grid (2*r, 2*c).
  - Apply the substitution rule based on the input pixel's color to fill the 2x2 block.
