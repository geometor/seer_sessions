This confirms the hypothesis: the first column is removed, and the remaining columns form the output grid.\n\n**Refined Perception:**\n\n*   The input grid has a specific structure in its first column, primarily containing magenta (`6`) pixels, with one cell potentially being red (`2`).\n*   The transformation involves removing the first column entirely.\n*   The remaining columns (from index 1 to the end) of the input grid constitute the output grid.\n*   The output grid's height is the same as the input grid's height.\n*   The output grid's width is one less than the input grid's width.\n\n**YAML Fact Generation:**\n\n*   Identify the key element: the first column of the input grid.\n*   Identify the action: remove the first column.\n*   Identify the result: the remaining columns form the output grid.\n*   Note the change in dimensions.\n\n**Natural Language Program Formulation:**\n\n1.  Identify the input grid.\n2.  Select all columns starting from the second column (index 1) to the last column.\n3.  Construct the output grid using these selected columns.\n\nThis seems straightforward and consistent across all examples.*   **Perception:**\n    *   Each input grid has a height of 6 and a width of 7.\n    *   Each output grid has a height of 6 and a width of 6.\n    *   The first column of the input grid contains primarily magenta (`6`) pixels, sometimes with one red (`2`) pixel.\n    *   Comparing the input and output grids, the content of the output grid exactly matches the content of the input grid starting from the second column (index 1) onwards.\n    *   The transformation appears to be the removal of the first column of the input grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
