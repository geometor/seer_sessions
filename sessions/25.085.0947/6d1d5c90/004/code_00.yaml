- task: General observation
  description: The transformation removes the first column and potentially reorders the rows of the remaining subgrid based on the content of the removed column.
- object: Input Grid
  properties:
    - shape: [height (N), width] (e.g., 6x7 in examples)
    - columns: First column acts as a control signal; remaining columns form the subgrid.
- object: Control Signal (First Column)
  properties:
    - contains: Exactly one red pixel (value 2). Other pixels are magenta (value 6).
    - critical_property: Row index `r` of the red pixel.
- object: Subgrid
  properties:
    - shape: [height (N), width - 1] (e.g., 6x6 in examples)
    - derivation: Input grid excluding the first column.
- action: Row Reordering (Conditional)
  condition: Occurs only if the red pixel index `r` in the first column is greater than 0.
  mechanism: Cyclic shift (roll) of the subgrid rows.
  parameter: The amount of shift is determined by `N - r`, where N is the grid height.
  result: Rows are permuted into a new order.
- action: No Reordering (Conditional)
  condition: Occurs if the red pixel index `r` in the first column is 0.
  result: The output grid is identical to the subgrid.
- object: Output Grid
  properties:
    - shape: Same as Subgrid [N, width - 1].
    - content: Either the subgrid itself (if r=0) or the cyclically shifted subgrid (if r>0).
