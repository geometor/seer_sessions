Initial logic was based on a fixed split point, but analysis of all examples revealed a cyclic shift determined by the red pixel's row index.\n    *   Metrics: Confirmed via tool use. Grid shapes are consistent (6x7 -> 6x6). Red pixel index `r` varies (0, 2, 3). The cyclic shift `s = N - r` correctly predicts the row permutation.\n    *   Facts (YAML).\n    *   Natural Language Program (revised).Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code, based only on the first example, correctly identified the removal of the first column and the conditional nature of the transformation based on the red pixel's position in that column. However, it failed on Example 2, indicating the specific rule for reordering rows when the red pixel was *not* in the first row (index 0) was incorrect. The assumption of a fixed split point (index 3) was flawed.\n\nBy analyzing all three examples, especially the discrepancy in Example 2, we can deduce a more general rule for row permutation. The failure in Example 2 (red pixel at index 2) and the success in Example 3 (red pixel at index 3) alongside the simple case in Example 1 (red pixel at index 0) suggest the permutation depends directly on the red pixel's row index `r` and the grid height `N`. The revised hypothesis involves a cyclic shift of the rows based on `N-r`.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
