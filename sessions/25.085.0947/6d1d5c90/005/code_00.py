Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the input grid and determine its height, `N`.
2. Separate the first column from the rest of the grid (the subgrid).
3. Locate the red pixel (value 2) within the first column and find its row index, `r`.
4. Calculate a shift amount based on the red pixel's index `r` and the grid height `N`. The shift amount for np.roll is `r - N`.
5. Generate a sequence of row indices from 0 to `N-1`.
6. Cyclically shift this sequence of indices using the calculated shift amount (`r - N`). This determines the new order of rows for the output.
7. Construct the output grid by rearranging the rows of the subgrid according to the cyclically shifted sequence of indices.
8. Return the reordered subgrid as the output. If r=0, the shift is -N, which results in no change to the row order (identity shift).
