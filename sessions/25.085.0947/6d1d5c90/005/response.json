Calculate a shift amount based on the red pixel's index `r` and the grid height `N`. The shift amount for np.roll is `r - N`.\n5. Generate a sequence of row indices from 0 to `N-1`.\n6. Cyclically shift this sequence of indices using the calculated shift amount (`r - N`). This determines the new order of rows for the output.\n7.
