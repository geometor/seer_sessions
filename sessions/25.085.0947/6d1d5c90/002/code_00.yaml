task_context:
  problem_description: Reorder rows of a grid based on a signal in the first column.
  grid_properties:
    - input_output_shape_relation: Output width is always input width - 1. Output height equals input height.
    - colors_present: Various colors (red, magenta, blue, green, yellow, gray, maroon, orange, azure) appear in the examples.

observations:
  - object: first_column
    description: The first column of the input grid is removed. It acts as a control signal.
    properties:
      - contains_signal_color: The color red (2) appears in the first column in all examples.
      - signal_position: The row index of the red pixel varies (0, 2, 3 in the examples).
  - object: subgrid
    description: The portion of the input grid excluding the first column.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Height matches input, width is input width - 1.
  - action: reorder_rows
    description: The rows of the subgrid are reordered to form the output grid.
    condition: Triggered if the red pixel in the original first column is NOT in the first row (index 0).
    rule:
      - if_condition_false: (Red pixel at index 0) Output grid is identical to the subgrid.
      - if_condition_true: (Red pixel not at index 0) The subgrid is split into two blocks at row index 3. The block starting from index 3 (rows 3, 4, 5...) is placed first in the output, followed by the block from index 0 up to index 3 (rows 0, 1, 2).
