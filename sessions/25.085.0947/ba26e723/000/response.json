The output grids introduce magenta (6) pixels, replacing some of the yellow pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to be based on the column position of the pixels. Specifically, yellow pixels located in columns whose index is a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, ...) are changed to magenta.\n4.  **Consistency:** This rule holds across all five training examples. Pixels that are not yellow, or yellow pixels not in a column index divisible by 3, remain unchanged. The grid dimensions are preserved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
