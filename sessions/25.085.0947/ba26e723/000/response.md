Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve grids that are 3 rows high, but the width varies across examples.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily consist of yellow (4) and white (0) pixels. The output grids introduce magenta (6) pixels, replacing some of the yellow pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to be based on the column position of the pixels. Specifically, yellow pixels located in columns whose index is a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, ...) are changed to magenta.
4.  **Consistency:** This rule holds across all five training examples. Pixels that are not yellow, or yellow pixels not in a column index divisible by 3, remain unchanged. The grid dimensions are preserved.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    height: 3
    width: variable
    input_colors: [yellow, white]
    output_colors: [yellow, white, magenta]
transformation:
  type: conditional_color_change
  condition:
    - property: pixel_color
      value: yellow (4)
    - property: column_index
      check: is_multiple_of_3 (index % 3 == 0)
  action:
    change_color: magenta (6)
  otherwise:
    action: keep_original_color
invariance:
  - grid_dimensions
  - pixel_values_not_meeting_condition
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid, using its row index `i` and column index `j`.
3.  Get the color value of the pixel at `(i, j)`.
4.  Check if the column index `j` is divisible by 3 (i.e., `j % 3 == 0`).
5.  Check if the color value at `(i, j)` is yellow (4).
6.  If both conditions (column index is divisible by 3 AND color is yellow) are true, set the color of the corresponding cell `(i, j)` in the output grid to magenta (6).
7.  Otherwise (if the column index is not divisible by 3 OR the color is not yellow), copy the original color from the input grid cell `(i, j)` to the output grid cell `(i, j)`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
