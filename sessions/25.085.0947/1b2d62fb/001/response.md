"""
Identifies a vertical blue separator line in the input grid. Extracts the subgrids 
to the left and right of the separator. Initializes an output grid of the same size 
as the left subgrid, filled with white (0). Compares the left and right subgrids 
cell by cell at corresponding positions. If a cell in the left subgrid and the 
corresponding cell in the right subgrid are both white (0), the corresponding cell 
in the output grid is set to azure (8). Otherwise, the output cell remains white (0).
