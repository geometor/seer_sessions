            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is a grid containing white pixels (0) and gray pixels (5). The gray pixels form one or more distinct shapes or \"objects\". These objects are contiguous blocks of gray pixels (using 8-way connectivity).\n2.  **Output:** The output is always a single column of white pixels (0). The width is always 1.\n3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation seems to relate the *number* of distinct gray objects in the input grid to the *height* of the output grid.\n4.  **Analysis of Examples:**\n    *   `train_1`: Input has 3 separate gray objects. Output height is 3. (Count = 3)\n    *   `train_2`: Input has 1 gray object. Output height is 2. (Count = 1)\n    *   `train_3`: Input has 5 separate gray objects. Output height is 5. (Count = 5)\n    *   `train_4`: Input has 4 separate gray objects. Output height is 4. (Count = 4)\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** In most cases (train\\_1, train\\_3, train\\_4), the output height directly matches the number of distinct gray objects found in the input. However, in `train_2`, there is only 1 object, but the output height is 2. This suggests a rule where the output height is the number of objects, but with a minimum value of 2.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The output height `H` is determined by the number of connected gray components `N` in the input grid, according to the rule `H = max(2, N)`. The output grid itself is simply an `H x 1` grid filled entirely with white pixels (0).\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
