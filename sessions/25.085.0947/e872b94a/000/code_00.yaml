task_description: Transforms an input grid with gray objects into a vertical white column whose height depends on the number of gray objects.

definitions:
  - object: A connected component of gray pixels (value 5). Connectivity is assumed to be 8-way (pixels touching sides or corners are connected).
  - background: White pixels (value 0).

input_characteristics:
  - grid: Contains white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
  - gray_pixels: Form one or more distinct 'objects'.

output_characteristics:
  - grid: A single column (width 1).
  - pixels: All white (0).
  - height: Determined by a calculation based on the input.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify all distinct connected components of gray pixels (objects) in the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Count the number of identified objects. Let this count be 'N'.
  - step: 3
    action: Calculate the required output height 'H' using the formula H = max(2, N).
  - step: 4
    action: Create an output grid with dimensions H rows by 1 column.
  - step: 5
    action: Fill the entire output grid with white pixels (value 0).

example_analysis:
  - example: train_1
    object_count (N): 3
    output_height (H): max(2, 3) = 3
  - example: train_2
    object_count (N): 1
    output_height (H): max(2, 1) = 2
  - example: train_3
    object_count (N): 5
    output_height (H): max(2, 5) = 5
  - example: train_4
    object_count (N): 4
    output_height (H): max(2, 4) = 4
