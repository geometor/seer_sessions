"""
Identify all distinct connected components (objects) of gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid, considering 8-way connectivity (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency). Count the number of these objects, let the count be 'N'. Calculate the output grid height 'H' as N + 1. Create an output grid with H rows and 1 column, filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).
