# Facts derived from the analysis of the previous code's logic and the assumed task structure.
# Validation pending review of all examples and successful execution without scipy.
task_type: transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - objects:
      - type: connected components
      - color: gray (5)
      - connectivity: 8-way (adjacent including diagonals)
output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - properties:
      - width: always 1 column
      - height: determined by a calculation based on input features
      - content: filled entirely with white (0)
transformation:
  - action: identify_objects
    target: gray pixels (5)
    connectivity: 8-way
    result: count of distinct gray objects (N)
  - action: calculate_dimension
    based_on: count of gray objects (N)
    formula: height = max(2, N)
    result: output grid height (H)
  - action: construct_grid
    dimensions: H rows, 1 column
    fill_value: white (0)
    result: output grid
constants:
  - target_color: gray (5)
  - output_fill_color: white (0)
  - minimum_output_height: 2
  - output_width: 1
  - connectivity_rule: 8 (Moore neighborhood)
uncertainties:
  - The core logic (count gray objects -> output height) is based on the initial analysis and needs verification across all training examples.
  - The implementation requires avoiding the `scipy` library.
