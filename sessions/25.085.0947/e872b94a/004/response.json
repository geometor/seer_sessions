            "text": "The code execution confirms the object counts (N=2, 1, 4, 3 for examples 1-4 respectively) and that the rule `Output Height = N + 1` holds true for all training examples.\n\nThe previous code failed because it implemented `Output Height = max(2, N)` instead of `Output Height = N + 1`.\n\nNow, I can proceed with generating the report.**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified that the task involves counting connected components (objects) of gray pixels (value 5) using 8-way connectivity. However, the rule derived for determining the output grid height based on this count (`max(2, N)`) was incorrect, leading to failures in 3 out of 4 training examples. The code implementation of the object counting (`_find_connected_components`) appears correct based on manual verification and tool execution.\n\nThe analysis of the mismatches between the predicted and expected outputs across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the expected height is always one greater than the number of gray objects counted (`N`). The strategy is to update the transformation rule to reflect this `N + 1` relationship.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n| Example | Input Grid Shape | Gray Object Count (N, 8-conn) | Expected Output Shape | Previous Code Output Shape (`max(2, N)` x 1) | Proposed Output Shape (`N + 1` x 1) |\n| :------ | :--------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 7x7              | 2                             | 3x1                   | 2x1                                        | 3x1                               |\n| 2       | 3x3              | 1                             | 2x1                   | 2x1                                        | 2x1                               |\n| 3       | 9x12             | 4                             | 5x1                   | 4x1                                        | 5x1                               |\n| 4       | 12x12            | 3                             | 4x1                   | 3x1                                        | 4x1                               |\n\n**Observations (YAML)**\n\n"
