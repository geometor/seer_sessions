task_elements:
  - item: Input Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9 columns x 5 rows
      - background_color: white (0)
      - pattern_color: gray (5)
      - pattern_location: Primarily within rows 1-3 and columns 1-8

  - item: Output Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3 columns x 3 rows
      - background_color: white (0)
      - pattern_color: Varies (blue (1), red (2), or green (3))

  - item: Color Key Block
    description: The 3x3 subgrid of the input located at top-left corner (1, 1).
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: Input grid rows 1-3, columns 1-3
      - content: A specific pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Determines the 'pattern_color' for the Output Grid based on its unique shape.

  - item: Pattern Block
    description: The 3x3 subgrid of the input located offset to the right.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - location: Input grid rows 1-3, columns 5-7
      - content: A specific pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Determines the spatial arrangement of the 'pattern_color' in the Output Grid.

relationships:
  - type: Mapping (Color Determination)
    from: Pattern of gray pixels in the Color Key Block
    to: Output Grid pattern_color
    details: Specific predefined shapes map to specific colors (e.g., Shape A -> blue, Shape B -> green, Shape C -> red).

  - type: Mapping (Pattern Transfer)
    from: Pattern Block
    to: Output Grid
    details:
      - Gray (5) pixels in the Pattern Block map to the determined 'pattern_color' at the corresponding position in the Output Grid.
      - White (0) pixels in the Pattern Block map to white (0) pixels at the corresponding position in the Output Grid.

actions:
  - 1: Extract the Color Key Block (input rows 1-3, cols 1-3).
  - 2: Identify the pattern in the Color Key Block.
  - 3: Determine the Output Color based on the identified pattern (using the predefined shape-to-color mapping).
  - 4: Extract the Pattern Block (input rows 1-3, cols 5-7).
  - 5: Create a new 3x3 Output Grid.
  - 6: Iterate through the Pattern Block: If a pixel is gray (5), place the determined Output Color in the corresponding Output Grid cell; otherwise, place white (0).
