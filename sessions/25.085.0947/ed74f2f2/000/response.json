            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 9 columns wide and 5 rows high. The output grids are always 3x3.\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids primarily use white (0) as the background and gray (5) to form patterns. The output grids use white (0) as the background and one other color (blue (1), red (2), or green (3)) for the pattern.\n3.  **Pattern Location:** The gray patterns in the input are always located within rows 1, 2, and 3 (using 0-based indexing) and columns 1 through 8. Rows 0 and 4, and column 0 are always white.\n4.  **Structure within Input:** The relevant area of the input (rows 1-3, columns 1-8) seems to contain two distinct 3x3 patterns made of gray pixels. One appears generally in columns 1-3, and the other in columns 5-7.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve two steps:\n    *   **Determining Output Color:** The 3x3 pattern located in the top-left region (specifically, the subgrid from row 1, col 1 to row 3, col 3) determines which color (blue, red, or green) will be used in the output grid. There seems to be a specific mapping between the *shape* of this first pattern and the output color.\n    *   **Determining Output Pattern:** The 3x3 pattern located slightly to the right (specifically, the subgrid from row 1, col 5 to row 3, col 7) dictates the structure of the 3x3 output grid. The gray pixels (5) in this second pattern map to the determined output color in the output grid, while the white pixels (0) map to white (0) in the output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
