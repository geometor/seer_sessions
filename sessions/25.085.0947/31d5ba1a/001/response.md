"""
Generates an output grid based on pixel-wise comparison between the top and bottom halves of the input grid.

1.  Assume the input grid has an even height, `H`, and width, `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid with height `H/2` and width `W`, initializing all its pixels to white (0).
3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 up to `(H/2) - 1`.
4.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 up to `W - 1`.
5.  For the current `(r, c)`:
    a.  Get the color of the pixel from the top half of the input grid: `top_color = Input[r][c]`.
    b.  Get the color of the pixel from the bottom half of the input grid: `bottom_color = Input[r + H/2][c]`.
    c.  Check if the condition for a magenta pixel is met: (`top_color` is maroon (9) AND `bottom_color` is white (0)) OR (`top_color` is white (0) AND `bottom_color` is yellow (4)).
    d.  If the condition is true, set the pixel in the output grid at `(r, c)` to magenta (6).
    e.  If the condition is false, the output pixel at `(r, c)` remains white (0) (as initialized).
6.  After iterating through all `(r, c)` positions, return the completed output grid.
