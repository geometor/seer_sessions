            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes an input grid and produces an output grid. All example inputs are 6x5, and all example outputs are 3x5.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   Input grids use white (0), maroon (9), and yellow (4).\n    *   Output grids use white (0) and magenta (6).\n3.  **Structure/Pattern:**\n    *   The input grid appears to be consistently divided horizontally. The top half (rows 0-2) contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The bottom half (rows 3-5) contains yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   The output grid's dimensions (3x5) match the dimensions of each half of the input grid.\n    *   The placement of magenta (6) pixels in the output seems dependent on the combination of pixels at the corresponding vertical positions in the input grid's top and bottom halves.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** It seems a pixel-wise comparison is happening between the top and bottom halves of the input grid to determine the output pixel color. Let H be the input height (assumed even). For a given coordinate `(r, c)` in the output grid (where `0 <= r < H/2`), the corresponding pixels in the input are `Input[r][c]` (top half) and `Input[r + H/2][c]` (bottom half).\n    *   Observing Example 1:\n        *   `Output[0][0]` is magenta (6). `Input[0][0]` is maroon (9), `Input[3][0]` is white (0).\n        *   `Output[0][1]` is white (0). `Input[0][1]` is white (0), `Input[3][1]` is white (0).\n        *   `Output[0][2]` is magenta (6). `Input[0][2]` is white (0), `Input[3][2]` is yellow (4).\n        *   `Output[0][3]` is white (0). `Input[0][3]` is maroon (9), `Input[3][3]` is yellow (4).\n    *   This suggests a specific rule: the output is magenta (6) only if *exactly one* of the corresponding input pixels (top half or bottom half) is non-white (maroon 9 or yellow 4, respectively), and the *other* corresponding pixel is white (0). Specifically, (maroon-top AND white-bottom) OR (white-top AND yellow-bottom) results in magenta. Otherwise, the output is white.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
