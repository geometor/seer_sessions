Okay, let's break down the transformation happening in these examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Size Change:** The output grid is always wider than the input grid, while the height remains the same. The increase in width seems related to the height of the input grid. Specifically, `output_width = input_width + input_height - 1`.
2.  **Content Preservation:** The original pattern of pixels from the input grid is preserved within the output grid. No colors are changed, added (other than padding), or removed.
3.  **Padding:** The extra space created by widening the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
4.  **Diagonal Shift:** The input grid appears to be embedded within the larger output grid, but shifted diagonally. Each row from the input is shifted horizontally to the right within the output grid.
5.  **Shift Pattern:** The amount of horizontal shift is not constant for all rows. The top row is shifted the most to the right, and each subsequent row is shifted one position less to the right than the row above it. The bottom row has zero horizontal shift relative to the leftmost position it could occupy.
6.  **Shift Calculation:** For a given row index `r` (starting from 0), the number of white padding pixels added to its *left* is `input_height - 1 - r`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the width of the output grid: `W_out = W + H - 1`. The height of the output grid is `H`.
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions `H` x `W_out`, and fill it entirely with white pixels (0).
4.  For each row `r` in the input grid (from row index 0 to `H-1`):
    a.  Calculate the horizontal starting position (column index) for this row in the output grid: `start_col = H - 1 - r`.
    b.  Copy the pixels from the input grid's row `r` into the output grid's row `r`, starting at column `start_col`.
