In train_1, it's gray (5); in train_2, it's green (3). This background color often fills complete rows, typically at the top of the grid.\n3.  **Pattern Block:** There is a distinct block of contiguous rows in the lower part of the input grid that contains colors other than the background color. This block constitutes the \"pattern\".\n    *   In train_1, the pattern rows are 5-9 (height 5), containing red (2) and azure (8) on a gray (5) background.\n    *   In train_2, the pattern rows are 6-9 (height 4), containing maroon (9) and red (2) on a green (3) background.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid is entirely filled by repeating content derived from the input's pattern block. The original background-only rows from the input are discarded.\n5.  **Tiling Mechanism:** The pattern block (or a modified version of it) is used as a tile. This tile is repeated vertically as many times as it fits entirely within the grid height. If there's remaining space at the bottom, it's filled with the top portion of the tile.\n6.  **Conditional Reordering:** The core logic seems to involve how the \"tile\" is derived from the identified pattern block.\n    *   In train_1, the pattern block's height (5) is exactly half the total grid height (10). The output is simply the pattern block repeated twice.\n    *   In train_2, the pattern block's height (4) is *not* half the total grid height (10). The output is formed by tiling a *reordered* version of the pattern block. This reordered block is created by taking the bottom half of the original pattern block and placing it *above* the top half. This reordered block (rows 8, 9, 6, 7 from input) is then tiled (repeated twice fully, then the first two rows are added to fill the 10 rows).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
