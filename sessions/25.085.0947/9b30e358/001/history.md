**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grid Size:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example (10x5 for train_1, 10x7 for train_2).
2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant color that appears to act as a background. In train_1, it's gray (5); in train_2, it's green (3). This background color often fills complete rows, typically at the top of the grid.
3.  **Pattern Block:** There is a distinct block of contiguous rows in the lower part of the input grid that contains colors other than the background color. This block constitutes the "pattern".
    *   In train_1, the pattern rows are 5-9 (height 5), containing red (2) and azure (8) on a gray (5) background.
    *   In train_2, the pattern rows are 6-9 (height 4), containing maroon (9) and red (2) on a green (3) background.
4.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid is entirely filled by repeating content derived from the input's pattern block. The original background-only rows from the input are discarded.
5.  **Tiling Mechanism:** The pattern block (or a modified version of it) is used as a tile. This tile is repeated vertically as many times as it fits entirely within the grid height. If there's remaining space at the bottom, it's filled with the top portion of the tile.
6.  **Conditional Reordering:** The core logic seems to involve how the "tile" is derived from the identified pattern block.
    *   In train_1, the pattern block's height (5) is exactly half the total grid height (10). The output is simply the pattern block repeated twice.
    *   In train_2, the pattern block's height (4) is *not* half the total grid height (10). The output is formed by tiling a *reordered* version of the pattern block. This reordered block is created by taking the bottom half of the original pattern block and placing it *above* the top half. This reordered block (rows 8, 9, 6, 7 from input) is then tiled (repeated twice fully, then the first two rows are added to fill the 10 rows).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_output_dimensions_match: true
  elements:
    - role: background
      identification: Dominant color, often filling entire rows contiguously, usually at the top.
      example_1: Gray (5)
      example_2: Green (3)
    - role: pattern_block
      identification: Contiguous block of rows containing non-background colors, typically found below the background rows.
      properties:
        - height: H_p
      example_1:
        rows: 5-9
        height: 5
      example_2:
        rows: 6-9
        height: 4
    - role: tile_block
      derivation: Based on pattern_block and grid height (H).
      conditional_logic:
        - condition: If pattern_block height (H_p) * 2 == total grid height (H)
          result: tile_block is identical to pattern_block.
        - condition: Otherwise
          result: tile_block is formed by splitting pattern_block at mid-height (H_p // 2), and concatenating the bottom half followed by the top half.
      example_1:
        condition_met: H_p * 2 == H (5 * 2 == 10)
        result: tile_block is rows 5-9 from input.
      example_2:
        condition_met: H_p * 2 != H (4 * 2 != 10)
        result: tile_block is rows (8, 9) + rows (6, 7) from input.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the input grid. The output grid will have the same dimensions.
2.  Identify the background color, which is the color filling the initial contiguous block of uniform-colored rows starting from the top row.
3.  Identify the `PatternBlock`: Find the contiguous block of rows below the background rows that contain at least one pixel not matching the background color. Note the height of this block as `H_p`.
4.  Determine the `TileBlock` to be used for constructing the output:
    a.  Check if the `PatternBlock` height `H_p` is exactly half the total grid height `H` (i.e., `H_p * 2 == H`).
    b.  If YES, the `TileBlock` is identical to the `PatternBlock`.
    c.  If NO, create the `TileBlock` by:
        i.  Finding the midpoint row index within the `PatternBlock`: `mid = H_p // 2`.
        ii. Splitting the `PatternBlock` into a `TopHalf` (rows 0 to `mid - 1`) and a `BottomHalf` (rows `mid` to `H_p - 1`).
        iii. Concatenating the `BottomHalf` vertically above the `TopHalf`. This combined block is the `TileBlock`.
5.  Construct the output grid:
    a.  Calculate the number of full repetitions: `N_repeats = H // H_p`.
    b.  Calculate the number of remaining rows needed: `N_remainder = H % H_p`.
    c.  Initialize the output grid.
    d.  Append the `TileBlock` vertically `N_repeats` times to the output grid.
    e.  Append the first `N_remainder` rows of the `TileBlock` vertically to the output grid.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
