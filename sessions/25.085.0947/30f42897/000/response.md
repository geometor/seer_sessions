Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: Each input grid consists primarily of a background color (azure - 8) and one or more contiguous "objects" made of a different color (red - 2, maroon - 9, yellow - 4).
2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grid retains the original background color and the original object(s) from the input. Additionally, new objects appear in the output grid. These new objects have the same color as the original object(s).
3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The new objects in the output grid appear to be reflections or symmetrical counterparts of the original input object(s). Specifically, the pattern suggests reflections across the grid's horizontal centerline, vertical centerline, and potentially the diagonal center (equivalent to reflecting across both horizontal and vertical axes).
4.  **Symmetry**: The overall effect is the creation of a pattern with 4-fold rotational symmetry (or point symmetry about the center of the grid) based on the initial object(s). Any pixel belonging to an object in the input results in up to four pixels in the output: the original pixel and its reflections across the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal center axes.
5.  **Background Preservation**: Pixels that are part of the background in the input generally remain background pixels in the output, unless they are overwritten by a reflected pixel from an object.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color (azure - 8) in the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels that are *not* the background color. These constitute the input object(s).
3.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the background color.
4.  For each non-background pixel found in the input grid at position (row, col) with color C:
    a.  Place a pixel of color C at the original position (row, col) in the new grid.
    b.  Calculate the position reflected across the horizontal centerline: (grid_height - 1 - row, col). Place a pixel of color C at this position in the new grid.
    c.  Calculate the position reflected across the vertical centerline: (row, grid_width - 1 - col). Place a pixel of color C at this position in the new grid.
    d.  Calculate the position reflected diagonally through the center (across both axes): (grid_height - 1 - row, grid_width - 1 - col). Place a pixel of color C at this position in the new grid.
5.  The resulting new grid is the output.
