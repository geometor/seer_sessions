Additionally, new objects appear in the output grid. These new objects have the same color as the original object(s).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern**: The new objects in the output grid appear to be reflections or symmetrical counterparts of the original input object(s). Specifically, the pattern suggests reflections across the grid's horizontal centerline, vertical centerline, and potentially the diagonal center (equivalent to reflecting across both horizontal and vertical axes).\n4.  **Symmetry**: The overall effect is the creation of a pattern with 4-fold rotational symmetry (or point symmetry about the center of the grid) based on the initial object(s). Any pixel belonging to an object in the input results in up to four pixels in the output: the original pixel and its reflections across the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal center axes.\n5.  **Background Preservation**: Pixels that are part of the background in the input generally remain background pixels in the output, unless they are overwritten by a reflected pixel from an object.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
