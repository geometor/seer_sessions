task_description: Construct a 9x9 grid by tiling transformed versions of the input 3x3 grid.
grid_properties:
  input_size: 3x3
  output_size: 9x9
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    description: The initial 3x3 grid.
  - id: output_grid
    description: The final 9x9 grid.
  - id: subgrid
    description: A 3x3 grid derived from the input_grid via transformation. The output_grid is composed of 9 subgrids.
relationships:
  - type: composition
    source: output_grid
    target: subgrid
    details: The output_grid is formed by arranging 9 subgrids in a 3x3 pattern.
transformations:
  - type: geometric
    applies_to: input_grid
    results_in: subgrid
    details: |
      Specific transformations are applied based on the subgrid's position within the 3x3 output arrangement:
      - Identity (no change)
      - Flip Vertically
      - Flip Horizontally
      - Rotate 180 degrees
transformation_pattern:
  description: A 3x3 meta-grid defining which transformation to apply for each subgrid position.
  pattern: |
    [[rot180, flip_v, rot180],
     [flip_h, identity, flip_h],
     [rot180, flip_v, rot180]]
