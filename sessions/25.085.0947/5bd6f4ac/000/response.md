Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grid Sizes:** All training examples have a 9x9 input grid and a 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Content Relationship:** Upon visual inspection, the content of the 3x3 output grid appears to be directly copied from a specific location within the 9x9 input grid.
3.  **Location Identification:**
    *   In `train_1`, the output `[[0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 1], [9, 4, 0]]` is found in the input grid at rows 0, 1, and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8.
    *   In `train_2`, the output `[[0, 6, 0], [0, 8, 1], [4, 4, 5]]` is found in the input grid at rows 0, 1, and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8.
    *   In `train_3`, the output `[[0, 0, 4], [3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3]]` is found in the input grid at rows 0, 1, and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8.
    *   In `train_4`, the output `[[9, 7, 0], [4, 8, 4], [4, 0, 0]]` is found in the input grid at rows 0, 1, and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8.
4.  **Consistent Pattern:** Across all examples, the output grid is consistently the 3x3 subgrid located at the top-right corner of the input grid. The extraction starts at row index 0, column index 6.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Extract a specific subgrid from the input.
Input:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 9x9 (consistent across examples)
  - content: various pixel colors (0-9)
Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 3x3 (consistent across examples)
  - content: derived from input
Transformation:
  - action: Cropping / Subgrid Extraction
  - source_region: Top-right corner of the input grid
  - coordinates:
      - rows: 0 through 2 (inclusive)
      - columns: 6 through 8 (inclusive)
  - relationship: The output grid is an exact copy of the pixels within the specified source_region of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Select the subgrid within the input grid defined by the row indices 0, 1, and 2, and the column indices 6, 7, and 8.
3.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of this selected 3x3 subgrid.
