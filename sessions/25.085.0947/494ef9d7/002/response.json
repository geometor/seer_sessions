It triggered the action on *any* row containing exactly two non-white pixels. The analysis of the failing examples reveals an additional condition: the transformation only occurs if the specific pair of colors involved matches one of four predefined pairs: (Blue, Azure), (Azure, Blue), (Yellow, Orange), or (Orange, Yellow). Rows with two non-white pixels that do *not* form one of these specific pairs remain unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation logic to include this color pair check as a prerequisite condition alongside the \"exactly two non-white pixels\" check.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe `tool_code` analysis confirms the discrepancies between the previous code's output and the expected output:\n\n*   **Example 1:** 10 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6. These rows contained two non-white pixels, but the color pairs were (azure, maroon), (magenta, orange), (red, yellow), (green, maroon), and (magenta, yellow) respectively, which are not among the target pairs. Rows 2, 4, 7, 8 were correctly modified as their color pairs (orange, yellow), (blue, azure), (yellow, orange), (azure, blue) matched the target pairs.\n*   **Example 2:** 4 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 1 and 2. The color pairs were (maroon, red) and (blue, yellow), neither of which is a target pair. Row 0 was correctly modified (yellow, orange).\n*   **Example 3:** 4 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 0 and 3. The color pairs were (azure, yellow) and (maroon, yellow), neither of which is a target pair. Rows 1 and 2 were correctly modified (yellow, orange) and (blue, azure).\n*   **Example 4:** 6 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 2, 4, and 5. The color pairs were (magenta, orange), (green, yellow), and (red, maroon), none of which are target pairs. Rows 1 and 3 were correctly modified (blue, azure) and (yellow, orange).\n\nThis data strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation is conditional on specific color pairings.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
