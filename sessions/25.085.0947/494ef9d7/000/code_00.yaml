task_type: object_manipulation
grid_properties:
  size: variable (observed up to 10x10, 3x5, 4x7, 7x8)
  background_color: white (0)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: any non-white color (1-9)
    shape: 1x1
    count_per_row: variable
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: horizontal adjacency
    description: Key interaction occurs between pixels in the same row.
  - type: spatial
    relation: relative position
    description: Distinguishes between the leftmost and rightmost colored pixel within a row.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: rows containing exactly two non-white pixels
  - action: locate
    target: the leftmost and rightmost non-white pixel within identified rows
  - action: copy_color
    source: the rightmost non-white pixel
    destination: the cell immediately to the right of the leftmost non-white pixel
  - action: change_color
    target: the original position of the rightmost non-white pixel
    new_color: white (0)
  - action: maintain_state
    target: all rows not containing exactly two non-white pixels
    description: These rows are copied directly from input to output.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions remain the same.
  - Rows with 0, 1, or 3+ non-white pixels are unchanged.
  - The leftmost non-white pixel in a modified row retains its position and color.
