Rows with zero, one, or more than two colored pixels seem unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Two-Pixel Interaction:** The core change happens in rows containing exactly two colored pixels.\n5.  **Movement/Copying:** In these specific rows, the rightmost colored pixel seems to \"move\" or have its color \"copied\" to the position immediately to the right of the leftmost colored pixel.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The original position of the rightmost pixel becomes white (0) in the output. The pixel originally to the right of the leftmost pixel (if any) is overwritten by the color of the rightmost pixel.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
