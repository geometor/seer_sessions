Processes a grid by examining each row independently.

The code execution confirms the number of pixels off and identifies the exact locations where the previous code's output differed from the expected output.

*   **Ex1:** 10 pixels off. Rows 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 were modified incorrectly by the code.
    *   Row 0: (8 azure, 9 maroon) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 1: (6 magenta, 7 orange) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 3: (2 red, 4 yellow) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 5: (3 green, 9 maroon) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 6: (6 magenta, 4 yellow) - Not a target pair.
*   **Ex2:** 4 pixels off. Rows 1, 2 were modified incorrectly.
    *   Row 1: (9 maroon, 2 red) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 2: (1 blue, 4 yellow) - Not a target pair.
*   **Ex3:** 4 pixels off. Rows 0, 3 were modified incorrectly.
    *   Row 0: (8 azure, 4 yellow) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 3: (9 maroon, 4 yellow) - Not a target pair.
*   **Ex4:** 6 pixels off. Rows 2, 4, 5 were modified incorrectly.
    *   Row 2: (6 magenta, 7 orange) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 4: (3 green, 4 yellow) - Not a target pair.
    *   Row 5: (2 red, 9 maroon) - Not a target pair.

The analysis confirms that the previous code failed because it applied the transformation to *any* row with exactly two non-white pixels, whereas the correct logic requires the two pixels to be one of the specific color pairs: (Blue=1, Azure=8), (Azure=8, Blue=1), (Yellow=4, Orange=7), or (Orange=7, Yellow=4).

Now, prepare the deliverables.## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the action (move right pixel's color next to left, erase original right pixel) but applied it too broadly. It triggered the action on *any* row containing exactly two non-white pixels. The analysis of the failing examples reveals an additional condition: the transformation only occurs if the specific pair of colors involved matches one of four predefined pairs: (Blue, Azure), (Azure, Blue), (Yellow, Orange), or (Orange, Yellow). Rows with two non-white pixels that do *not* form one of these specific pairs remain unchanged.

The strategy is to modify the transformation logic to include this color pair check as a prerequisite condition alongside the "exactly two non-white pixels" check.

## Metrics

The `tool_code` analysis confirms the discrepancies between the previous code's output and the expected output:

*   **Example 1:** 10 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6. These rows contained two non-white pixels, but the color pairs were (azure, maroon), (magenta, orange), (red, yellow), (green, maroon), and (magenta, yellow) respectively, which are not among the target pairs. Rows 2, 4, 7, 8 were correctly modified as their color pairs (orange, yellow), (blue, azure), (yellow, orange), (azure, blue) matched the target pairs.
*   **Example 2:** 4 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 1 and 2. The color pairs were (maroon, red) and (blue, yellow), neither of which is a target pair. Row 0 was correctly modified (yellow, orange).
*   **Example 3:** 4 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 0 and 3. The color pairs were (azure, yellow) and (maroon, yellow), neither of which is a target pair. Rows 1 and 2 were correctly modified (yellow, orange) and (blue, azure).
*   **Example 4:** 6 pixels differed. The code incorrectly modified rows 2, 4, and 5. The color pairs were (magenta, orange), (green, yellow), and (red, maroon), none of which are target pairs. Rows 1 and 3 were correctly modified (blue, azure) and (yellow, orange).

This data strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation is conditional on specific color pairings.

    - let the colors of these two pixels be C_left (leftmost) and C_right (rightmost).
    - the pair (C_left, C_right) must be one of the following:
      - (blue(1), azure(8))
      - (azure(8), blue(1))
      - (yellow(4), orange(7))
      - (orange(7), yellow(4))

    - if conditions are met:
      - identify the position of the leftmost pixel: (r, c_left)
      - identify the position of the rightmost pixel: (r, c_right)
      - identify the color of the rightmost pixel: C_right
      - change the color of the pixel at (r, c_left + 1) to C_right.
      - change the color of the pixel at (r, c_right) to white (0).
    - if conditions are not met:
      - the row remains unchanged.

output:

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
2.  For each row, count the number of non-white (color value > 0) pixels.
3.  If the count of non-white pixels is exactly two:
    a.  Identify the column index (`c_left`) and color (`C_left`) of the leftmost non-white pixel.
    b.  Identify the column index (`c_right`) and color (`C_right`) of the rightmost non-white pixel.
    c.  Check if the color pair (`C_left`, `C_right`) is one of the following specific pairs:
        *   (Blue=1, Azure=8)
        *   (Azure=8, Blue=1)
        *   (Yellow=4, Orange=7)
        *   (Orange=7, Yellow=4)
    d.  If the color pair matches one of the specific pairs:
        i.  Determine the target column index `c_target = c_left + 1`.
        ii. Copy the color `C_right` to the pixel at the current row and column `c_target` in the output grid.
        iii. Set the pixel at the original rightmost position (current row, `c_right`) to white (0) in the output grid.
    e.  If the color pair does *not* match one of the specific pairs, copy the row unchanged to the output grid.
4.  If the count of non-white pixels is *not* exactly two, copy the row unchanged to the output grid.
5.  Return the fully processed output grid.
