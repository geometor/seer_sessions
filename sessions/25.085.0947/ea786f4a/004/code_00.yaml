facts:
  - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.
  - background_color: Each input grid has exactly two colors: white (0) and one other color, designated as the background color (bg).
  - unique_pixel: Each input grid contains exactly one white (0) pixel, acting as a central point.
  - transformation_basis: The output color of a pixel depends on its Manhattan distance (d) from the unique white pixel in the input grid.
  - rule_d0: Pixels at distance d=0 (the location of the input white pixel) are always white (0) in the output.
  - rule_odd_d: Pixels at an odd Manhattan distance (d=1, 3, 5, ...) are always assigned the background color (bg) in the output.
  - rule_even_d: Pixels at a positive even Manhattan distance (d=2, 4, 6, ...) have a rule dependent on the background color:
      - If the background color is Green (3):
          - The output color alternates based on d/2:
              - If d/2 is odd (d=2, 6, 10...), the output color is the background color (Green, 3).
              - If d/2 is even (d=4, 8, 12...), the output color is white (0).
      - If the background color is *not* Green (3) (e.g., Blue (1), Red (2)):
          - The output color is always white (0).
