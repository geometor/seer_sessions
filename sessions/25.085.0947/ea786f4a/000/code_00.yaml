task_description: Change pixel colors based on their Manhattan distance from a single unique pixel.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - element: background_pixel
    description: Pixels making up the majority color of the input grid.
  - element: central_pixel
    description: A single pixel with a unique color (white, 0) in the input grid, serving as a reference point.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - unique: True

properties:
  - property: grid_dimensions
    description: Height and width of the grid. Remains constant between input and output.
  - property: pixel_color
    description: The integer value (0-9) representing the color of a pixel.
  - property: pixel_coordinates
    description: The (row, column) position of a pixel within the grid.
  - property: manhattan_distance
    description: The distance between two pixels (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), calculated as |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.

actions:
  - action: identify_central_pixel
    description: Find the coordinates (r0, c0) of the unique white (0) pixel in the input grid.
  - action: identify_background_color
    description: Determine the color of the pixels that are not the central_pixel.
  - action: calculate_distance
    description: For each pixel (r, c) in the grid, calculate its Manhattan distance to the central_pixel (r0, c0).
  - action: determine_output_color
    description: Based on the calculated Manhattan distance for a pixel (r, c).
    logic:
      - if distance is even: output color is white (0).
      - if distance is odd: output color is the original background color.
  - action: construct_output_grid
    description: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, populating it with the determined output colors for each pixel.

relationships:
  - relationship: centrality
    description: The central_pixel acts as the origin for distance calculations.
  - relationship: distance_parity_determines_color
    description: The even or odd nature (parity) of the Manhattan distance from the central_pixel determines the output color of each pixel. Pixels equidistant from the center form patterns (like squares rotated by 45 degrees).
