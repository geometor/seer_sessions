The grids vary in size (5x5, 3x3, 7x7).\n2.  **Output Grids**: The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The single white pixel from the input remains white in the output. Many of the background pixels in the input are changed to white in the output, while others retain the original background color.\n3.  **Pattern**: The pixels that change to white in the output, along with the original white pixel, form a pattern resembling a checkerboard or diamond shape centered on the original white pixel's location. Specifically, the color of a pixel in the output depends on its Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column coordinates) from the original white pixel. Pixels at an even Manhattan distance become white, and pixels at an odd Manhattan distance retain the original background color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
