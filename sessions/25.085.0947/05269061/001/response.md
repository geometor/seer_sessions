"""
The transformation identifies the three unique non-white colors present in the input grid. 
It determines a sequence of these three colors based on their positions in the input. 
Specifically, for each non-white pixel at position (r, c) with color C, it calculates an index `idx = (r + c) % 3`. 
Each of the three unique non-white colors is predominantly associated with one specific index (0, 1, or 2) across all its occurrences in the input. 
This mapping establishes the sequence S = [Color_for_idx_0, Color_for_idx_1, Color_for_idx_2].
The output grid, having the same dimensions as the input, is then filled by tiling this sequence diagonally. 
The color of the output cell at (r, c) is determined by the element at index (r + c) % 3 in the derived sequence S.
