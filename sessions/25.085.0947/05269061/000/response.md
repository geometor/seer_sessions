Okay, let's analyze the task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7 in all examples).
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist primarily of white pixels (0) and a few non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9). These non-white pixels often form diagonal lines or small clusters. Crucially, each input grid appears to contain exactly three unique non-white colors.
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are completely filled, with no white pixels. They exhibit a repeating diagonal pattern.
4.  **Color Relationship:** The colors used to fill the output grid are precisely the three unique non-white colors found in the input grid.
5.  **Pattern:** The output pattern is a diagonal wave or tiling based on three colors. Observing the coordinates `(r, c)` and the color at that position in the output, the color seems to depend on the sum of the row and column index, specifically `(r + c) % 3`. This creates a repeating 3-element sequence along diagonals.
6.  **Sequence Determination:** The core challenge is determining the specific sequence of the three colors `[C0, C1, C2]` used in the output pattern `Output(r, c) = Sequence[(r + c) % 3]`. This sequence must be derived from the input grid. By analyzing the non-white pixels in the input at locations `(r, c)`, we can associate each color `C` with an index `idx = (r + c) % 3`. For each index (0, 1, 2), the color that appears *most frequently* associated with that index in the input becomes the color for that position in the sequence `[C0, C1, C2]`.

transformation_logic:
  - step_1: Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and their locations (r, c) and colors C.
  - step_2: For each non-white pixel, calculate the index `idx = (r + c) % 3`.
  - step_3: Create mappings from each index (0, 1, 2) to the list of colors found at input pixels corresponding to that index.
  - step_4: For each index `i` in (0, 1, 2), determine the color `Ci` that appears most frequently in the list associated with index `i`.
  - step_5: Form the color sequence `S = [C0, C1, C2]`.
  - step_6: Create the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - step_7: Fill each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid with the color `S[(r + c) % 3]`.
