These non-white pixels often form diagonal lines or small clusters. Crucially, each input grid appears to contain exactly three unique non-white colors.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are completely filled, with no white pixels. They exhibit a repeating diagonal pattern.\n4.  **Color Relationship:** The colors used to fill the output grid are precisely the three unique non-white colors found in the input grid.\n5.  **Pattern:** The output pattern is a diagonal wave or tiling based on three colors. Observing the coordinates `(r, c)` and the color at that position in the output, the color seems to depend on the sum of the row and column index, specifically `(r + c) % 3`. This creates a repeating 3-element sequence along diagonals.\n6.  **Sequence Determination:** The core challenge is determining the specific sequence of the three colors `[C0, C1, C2]` used in the output pattern `Output(r, c) = Sequence[(r + c) % 3]`. This sequence must be derived from the input grid. By analyzing the non-white pixels in the input at locations `(r, c)`, we can associate each color `C` with an index `idx = (r + c) % 3`. For each index (0, 1, 2), the color that appears *most frequently* associated with that index in the input becomes the color for that position in the sequence `[C0, C1, C2]`.\n\n## Facts\n\n```"
