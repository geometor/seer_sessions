task_description: Tile the input grid 3 times within a 3x3 super-grid structure based on the location and orientation of a monochromatic line in the input.

definitions:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - grid_values: 2D array of integers 0-9

  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - height: 3 * H
      - width: 3 * W
      - grid_values: 2D array of integers 0-9, initialized to white (0)

  - object: MonochromaticLine
    properties:
      - type: row or column
      - index: integer (0-based index within InputGrid)
      - color: integer (1-9, the single color making up the line)
    identification:
      - The first row or column found in InputGrid where all cells have the same non-white color.

  - object: TileRegion
    properties:
      - base_grid: InputGrid
      - repeat_count: 3
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical (determined by MonochromaticLine type)
      - position_index: integer (determined by MonochromaticLine index)

actions:
  - action: IdentifyMonochromaticLine
    input: InputGrid
    output: MonochromaticLine properties (type, index, color)
    description: Scan rows, then columns of the InputGrid. Return the type (row/column) and index of the first line found where all cells contain the same color, and that color is not white (0).

  - action: ConstructOutputGrid
    input:
      - InputGrid (H x W)
      - MonochromaticLine (type, index)
    output: OutputGrid (3H x 3W)
    description: >
      Create an OutputGrid of size 3H x 3W, initialized with white (0).
      If MonochromaticLine type is 'row' with index 'i':
        Place copies of InputGrid into OutputGrid at block positions (i, 0), (i, 1), and (i, 2).
        (Block (r, c) corresponds to OutputGrid region from row r*H to (r+1)*H-1 and column c*W to (c+1)*W-1).
      If MonochromaticLine type is 'column' with index 'j':
        Place copies of InputGrid into OutputGrid at block positions (0, j), (1, j), and (2, j).

relationships:
  - OutputGrid dimensions are 3 times the InputGrid dimensions.
  - The placement of the repeated InputGrid tiles within the OutputGrid is determined solely by the identified MonochromaticLine from the InputGrid.
  - All areas of the OutputGrid not covered by the InputGrid tiles are filled with white (0).
