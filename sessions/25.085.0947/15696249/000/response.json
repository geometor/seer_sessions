            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are 3x3. The output grids are consistently 9x9, which is 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input.\n2.  **Tiling Structure:** The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging 3x3 blocks, where each block is the size of the original input grid (3x3).\n3.  **Content Replication:** The original input grid pattern is replicated three times within the output grid.\n4.  **Placement Pattern:** The three copies of the input grid are always placed adjacent to each other, either horizontally in a single row of the 3x3 block structure or vertically in a single column.\n5.  **Background Fill:** The remaining six 3x3 blocks in the 9x9 output grid are filled entirely with the white color (0).\n6.  **Determining Placement:** The placement (which row or column gets filled with the input pattern and whether it's horizontal or vertical) seems determined by a specific feature within the input grid. Observing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`, the top row (row 0) of the input is monochromatic (all blue, 1). The output tiles the input horizontally across the top row (row 0) of the 3x3 block structure.\n    *   In `train_2`, the left column (column 0) of the input is monochromatic (all red, 2). The output tiles the input vertically down the left column (column 0) of the 3x3 block structure.\n    *   In `train_3`, the left column (column 0) of the input is monochromatic (all green, 3). The output tiles the input vertically down the left column (column 0) of the 3x3 block structure.\n    *   In `train_4`, the middle row (row 1) of the input is monochromatic (all green, 3). The output tiles the input horizontally across the middle row (row 1) of the 3x3 block structure.\n7.  **Rule Inference:** The core rule involves identifying the first monochromatic (single non-white color) line (row or column) in the input grid. This line's orientation (horizontal/row or vertical/column) and index determine where the input pattern is tiled three times in the larger output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
