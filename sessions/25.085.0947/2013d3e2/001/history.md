Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are larger (10x10 in the examples), while the output grids are consistently smaller (3x3). This suggests an extraction or cropping operation.
2.  **Content:** The output grid's content (pixels/colors) seems to be directly copied from a portion of the input grid. No colors are changed, added (that weren't in the source region), or removed (within the source region).
3.  **Location:** The core challenge is determining *which* 3x3 portion of the input grid becomes the output.
4.  **Example 1 Analysis:**
    *   The input has blue pixels (1). The top-leftmost blue pixel is at coordinates (1, 1).
    *   The output grid `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 6], [0, 5, 2]]` corresponds exactly to the 3x3 subgrid of the input starting at (1, 1).
5.  **Example 2 Analysis:**
    *   The input has *no* blue pixels (1).
    *   The output grid `[[0, 0, 7], [0, 6, 8], [7, 8, 4]]` corresponds exactly to the 3x3 subgrid of the input starting at (2, 2).
    *   How is (2, 2) determined? Let's find the bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input. The non-white pixels span from row 2 to row 7, and from column 2 to column 7. The top-left corner of this bounding box is (2, 2).
6.  **Hypothesis:** The method for finding the top-left corner of the 3x3 extraction area depends on whether blue pixels (1) are present in the input.
    *   If blue is present, use the coordinates of the top-leftmost blue pixel.
    *   If blue is *not* present, use the coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box containing all non-white pixels.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_type: extraction
input_grid_size: variable (e.g., 10x10)
output_grid_size: fixed (3x3)
transformation: copy_subgrid
subgrid_origin_determination:
  conditional:
    condition_1:
      trigger: presence of blue pixels (color 1) in input
      action: find coordinates (r, c) of the top-leftmost blue pixel
    condition_2:
      trigger: absence of blue pixels (color 1) in input
      action:
        - find all non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
        - determine minimum row index (min_r) among them
        - determine minimum column index (min_c) among them
        - set coordinates (r, c) to (min_r, min_c)
output_generation:
  action: extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input starting at the determined coordinates (r, c)
pixel_mapping: identity (colors are copied directly)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Examine the input grid to determine if any pixel has the color blue (value 1).
2.  **If blue pixels are present:**
    a.  Find the location (row `r`, column `c`) of the blue pixel that has the smallest row index.
    b.  If there is a tie for the smallest row index, among those tied, select the one with the smallest column index.
    c.  Designate this location `(r, c)` as the starting point for extraction.
3.  **If blue pixels are *not* present:**
    a.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0).
    b.  Find the minimum row index (`min_r`) among all these non-white pixels.
    c.  Find the minimum column index (`min_c`) among all these non-white pixels.
    d.  Designate the location `(min_r, min_c)` as the starting point for extraction.
4.  Create the output grid by copying the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid, starting at the designated top-left corner `(r, c)` (or `(min_r, min_c)`). The pixel at the starting location becomes the top-left pixel of the output grid.
