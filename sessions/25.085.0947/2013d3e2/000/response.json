This suggests an extraction or cropping operation.\n2.  **Content:** The output grid's content (pixels/colors) seems to be directly copied from a portion of the input grid. No colors are changed, added (that weren't in the source region), or removed (within the source region).\n3.  **Location:** The core challenge is determining *which* 3x3 portion of the input grid becomes the output.\n4.  **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    *   The input has blue pixels (1). The top-leftmost blue pixel is at coordinates (1, 1).\n    *   The output grid `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 6], [0, 5, 2]]` corresponds exactly to the 3x3 subgrid of the input starting at (1, 1).\n5.  **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   The input has *no* blue pixels (1).\n    *   The output grid `[[0, 0, 7], [0, 6, 8], [7, 8, 4]]` corresponds exactly to the 3x3 subgrid of the input starting at (2, 2).\n    *   How is (2, 2) determined? Let's find the bounding box of all non-white pixels in the input. The non-white pixels span from row 2 to row 7, and from column 2 to column 7. The top-left corner of this bounding box is (2, 2).\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The method for finding the top-left corner of the 3x3 extraction area depends on whether blue pixels (1) are present in the input.\n    *   If blue is present, use the coordinates of the top-leftmost blue pixel.\n    *   If blue is *not* present, use the coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box containing all non-white pixels.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

Find the minimum row index (`min_r`) among all these non-white pixels.\n    c.  Find the minimum column index (`min_c`) among all these non-white pixels.\n    d.  Designate the location `(min_r, min_c)` as the starting point for extraction.\n4.  Create the output grid by copying the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid, starting at the designated top-left corner `(r, c)` (or `(min_r, min_c)`). The pixel at the starting location becomes the top-left pixel of the output grid."
