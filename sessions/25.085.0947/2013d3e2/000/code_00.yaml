task_type: extraction
input_grid_size: variable (e.g., 10x10)
output_grid_size: fixed (3x3)
transformation: copy_subgrid
subgrid_origin_determination:
  conditional:
    condition_1:
      trigger: presence of blue pixels (color 1) in input
      action: find coordinates (r, c) of the top-leftmost blue pixel
    condition_2:
      trigger: absence of blue pixels (color 1) in input
      action:
        - find all non-white pixels (colors 1-9)
        - determine minimum row index (min_r) among them
        - determine minimum column index (min_c) among them
        - set coordinates (r, c) to (min_r, min_c)
output_generation:
  action: extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input starting at the determined coordinates (r, c)
pixel_mapping: identity (colors are copied directly)
