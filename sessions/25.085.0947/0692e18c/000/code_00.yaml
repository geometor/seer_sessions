task_type: pattern_tiling_with_transformation
input_grid:
  properties:
    size: NxN (observed N=3)
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - one unique non-white color (C)
output_grid:
  properties:
    size: (N*N) x (N*N) (observed 9x9)
    structure: Composed of N*N blocks, each of size NxN
    colors: Same two colors as the input grid (white and C)
transformation:
  steps:
    - identify_dimensions: Determine N from the input grid (NxN).
    - identify_colors: Find the non-white color C in the input grid.
    - create_template: Generate an NxN template grid (T) by taking the input grid and swapping color 0 with color C.
    - initialize_output: Create an (N*N)x(N*N) grid filled with white (0).
    - map_and_place: Iterate through input grid cells (r, c):
        - if input[r][c] == C:
            action: Copy the template grid T into the output grid block starting at (r*N, c*N).
        - if input[r][c] == 0:
            action: Leave the output grid block starting at (r*N, c*N) as all white.
relationships:
  - output_size_depends_on_input_size: Output dimensions are N times input dimensions, where N is the input dimension. Output total size is input_size ^ 2.
  - block_content_depends_on_input_pixel: The content of each NxN block in the output depends on the color of the corresponding pixel in the input.
  - template_derivation: The non-white block pattern (template T) is derived from the input grid via color inversion (swapping 0 and C).
