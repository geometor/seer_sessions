            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 (since 9 = 3 * 3).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Each input grid uses white (0) as a background and exactly one other color (magenta, orange, yellow). The output grids use the same two colors.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.\n4.  **Block Content:**\n    *   Some blocks in the output are entirely white (0).\n    *   Other blocks contain a pattern using the two colors from the input.\n5.  **Pattern Relationship:** The pattern appearing in the non-white blocks of the output is related to the input grid pattern but isn't identical. In `train_1`, the input is `0 0 6 / 0 6 0 / 6 0 0`, and the pattern placed in the output is `6 6 0 / 6 0 6 / 0 6 6`. This looks like the input pattern with the colors 0 (white) and 6 (magenta) swapped. Let's call this the \"inverted color pattern\".\n6.  **Placement Logic:** Comparing the input grid pixels to the output grid blocks:\n    *   Where the input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output is all white.\n    *   Where the input pixel is non-white (color C), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output contains the \"inverted color pattern\" (the original input pattern with colors 0 and C swapped).\n7.  **Generalization:** The process seems to be: use the input grid as a map. For each pixel in the input map, if it's the specific color C, place a color-inverted version of the *entire* original input pattern into the corresponding block of the larger output grid. If the input pixel is white, place an all-white block. The scaling factor (3) seems derived directly from the dimensions of the input grid (3x3).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
