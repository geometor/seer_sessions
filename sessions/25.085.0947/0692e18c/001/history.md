Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 (since 9 = 3 * 3).
2.  **Color Palette:** Each input grid uses white (0) as a background and exactly one other color (magenta, orange, yellow). The output grids use the same two colors.
3.  **Output Structure:** The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.
4.  **Block Content:**
    *   Some blocks in the output are entirely white (0).
    *   Other blocks contain a pattern using the two colors from the input.
5.  **Pattern Relationship:** The pattern appearing in the non-white blocks of the output is related to the input grid pattern but isn't identical. In `train_1`, the input is `0 0 6 / 0 6 0 / 6 0 0`, and the pattern placed in the output is `6 6 0 / 6 0 6 / 0 6 6`. This looks like the input pattern with the colors 0 (white) and 6 (magenta) swapped. Let's call this the "inverted color pattern".
6.  **Placement Logic:** Comparing the input grid pixels to the output grid blocks:
    *   Where the input pixel is white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output is all white.
    *   Where the input pixel is non-white (color C), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output contains the "inverted color pattern" (the original input pattern with colors 0 and C swapped).
7.  **Generalization:** The process seems to be: use the input grid as a map. For each pixel in the input map, if it's the specific color C, place a color-inverted version of the *entire* original input pattern into the corresponding block of the larger output grid. If the input pixel is white, place an all-white block. The scaling factor (3) seems derived directly from the dimensions of the input grid (3x3).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_tiling_with_transformation
input_grid:
  properties:
    size: NxN (observed N=3)
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - one unique non-white color (C)
output_grid:
  properties:
    size: (N*N) x (N*N) (observed 9x9)
    structure: Composed of N*N blocks, each of size NxN
    colors: Same two colors as the input grid (white and C)
transformation:
  steps:
    - identify_dimensions: Determine N from the input grid (NxN).
    - identify_colors: Find the non-white color C in the input grid.
    - create_template: Generate an NxN template grid (T) by taking the input grid and swapping color 0 with color C.
    - initialize_output: Create an (N*N)x(N*N) grid filled with white (0).
    - map_and_place: Iterate through input grid cells (r, c):
        - if input[r][c] == C:
            action: Copy the template grid T into the output grid block starting at (r*N, c*N).
        - if input[r][c] == 0:
            action: Leave the output grid block starting at (r*N, c*N) as all white.
relationships:
  - output_size_depends_on_input_size: Output dimensions are N times input dimensions, where N is the input dimension. Output total size is input_size ^ 2.
  - block_content_depends_on_input_pixel: The content of each NxN block in the output depends on the color of the corresponding pixel in the input.
  - template_derivation: The non-white block pattern (template T) is derived from the input grid via color inversion (swapping 0 and C).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid and determine its dimensions, N x N (e.g., 3x3).
2.  Identify the single non-white color, C, present in the input grid.
3.  Create a "template" grid, T, of size N x N. Populate T by taking the original input grid and replacing every white pixel (0) with color C, and every pixel of color C with white (0).
4.  Create the output grid with dimensions (N * N) x (N * N), and initialize all its pixels to white (0).
5.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at row `r` and column `c` (where `r` and `c` range from 0 to N-1).
6.  Check the color of the input pixel `input[r][c]`:
    a.  If `input[r][c]` is equal to the non-white color C, then copy the entire template grid T into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at `output[r * N][c * N]`.
    b.  If `input[r][c]` is white (0), do nothing (the corresponding N x N block in the output grid remains white).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
