            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid. The output grid contains all the pixels from the input grid, plus some additional pixels.\n2.  **Key Pattern:** The core transformation seems triggered by a specific horizontal pattern found near the bottom of the input grid. This pattern consists of a central contiguous block of one color (let's call it the \"central color\") flanked on the left and right by pixels of a different color (the \"framing color\") within the same row.\n3.  **Added Pixels:** New pixels are added to the output grid.\n    *   The *color* of the added pixels is always the \"central color\" from the identified pattern row.\n    *   The *location* of the added pixels depends on the location of the \"framing color\" pixels in the pattern row.\n4.  **Location Logic:** For each pixel of the \"framing color\" in the pattern row (at `R_source, c_frame`), a new pixel is added.\n    *   The *column* of the new pixel is the same as the framing pixel's column (`c_frame`).\n    *   The *row* of the new pixel (`R_output`) is calculated based on the source row (`R_source`) and the horizontal distance (`dist`) between the framing pixel (`c_frame`) and the closest pixel of the central color segment in that same row. The formula appears to be `R_output = R_source - dist - 1`.\n5.  **Row Identification:** The relevant pattern row (`R_source`) seems to be the lowest row in the grid containing at least two different non-background colors adjacent horizontally, forming the structure described in point 2.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The added pixels appear in locations that were previously background (white, color 0) in all examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
