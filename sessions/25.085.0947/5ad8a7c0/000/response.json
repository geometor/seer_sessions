            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 4x6 grid.\n2.  **Colors:** Only two colors are present: red (2) and white (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some white pixels (0) to red (2). No red pixels change to white, and the grid size remains constant.\n4.  **Row-based Operation:** The changes seem to happen within individual rows. Specifically, it looks like horizontal segments between pairs of red pixels are being filled.\n5.  **Pair Identification:** The crucial element appears to be rows containing exactly two red pixels. Let's call these \"pair rows\".\n6.  **Types of Pairs:** There are two types of pairs observed:\n    *   **Edge Pairs:** The two red pixels are at the very ends of the row (column 0 and column 5).\n    *   **Internal Pairs:** The two red pixels are *not* at the ends of the row.\n7.  **Conditional Filling:** The filling doesn't always happen for every pair row. The decision to fill seems dependent on the overall configuration of edge pairs and internal pairs across the entire grid, and in one case, the content of the first row.\n    *   If the edge pairs are specifically in rows 0 and 3: filling occurs either on the edge pair rows themselves (if no internal pairs exist) or on the internal pair rows (if they do exist).\n    *   If the only edge pair is in row 2: filling occurs on the internal pair rows *only if* row 0 is entirely white.\n    *   If the only edge pair is in row 0: no filling occurs.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
