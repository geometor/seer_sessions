observations:
  - task: The transformation extends a pattern found at the left edge of the grid.
  - grid_structure:
      input_grid: Contains a colored pattern on the left, followed by white pixels.
      output_grid: The same dimensions as the input. Consists of three main parts horizontally:
        1. The original pattern.
        2. A filled area.
        3. An appended pattern.
  - pattern:
      location: Starts at column 0.
      definition: A contiguous block of columns from the left where at least one pixel in each column is non-white. It ends at the first column composed entirely of white pixels.
      properties:
        width: `pattern_width` (number of columns).
  - fill_area:
      location: Starts immediately after the pattern (column `pattern_width`). Extends horizontally.
      width: `width - 2 * pattern_width`.
      end_column_exclusive: `width - pattern_width`.
      color: Determined row by row; the color used for filling a given row is the color of the pixel in the *first* column (column 0) of that row in the *input* grid.
      condition: Filling only occurs if `fill_start_column < fill_end_column_exclusive`, which simplifies to `pattern_width < width - pattern_width` or `width > 2 * pattern_width`.
  - appended_pattern:
      location: Starts immediately after the fill area (column `width - pattern_width`). Extends to the right edge of the grid (column `width - 1`).
      width: `pattern_width`.
      content: A direct copy of the original pattern columns (from column 0 to `pattern_width - 1` of the input grid). The i-th column of the original pattern (where `i` ranges from 0 to `pattern_width - 1`) is copied to the output column `(width - pattern_width) + i`.
      condition: Appending occurs if `pattern_width >= 1`.

actions:
  - step: 1. Identify the initial pattern at the left of the input grid.
  - step: 2. Determine its width (`pattern_width`).
  - step: 3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: 4. Define the fill area columns: from `pattern_width` up to (but not including) `width - pattern_width`.
  - step: 5. For each row, fill the corresponding columns in the fill area with the color from the first column (index 0) of that row in the input grid. Perform this fill only if `pattern_width < width - pattern_width`.
  - step: 6. Define the appended pattern area columns: from `width - pattern_width` up to (but not including) `width`.
  - step: 7. Copy the columns of the initial pattern (input columns 0 to `pattern_width - 1`) to the appended pattern area columns (output columns `width - pattern_width` to `width - 1`). Perform this copy only if `pattern_width >= 1`.
