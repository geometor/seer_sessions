The width of the colored pattern varies across examples (3 columns in the first two, 4 columns in the third). The output grids have the same dimensions as the corresponding input grids. The transformation involves preserving the initial colored pattern, filling the white area based on a rule derived from the pattern, and appending specific columns from the original pattern to the rightmost edge of the grid.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
