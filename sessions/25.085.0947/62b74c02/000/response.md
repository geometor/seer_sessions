*   **Perception**
    The input grids consist of a pattern of colored pixels on the left side, followed by an area filled entirely with white pixels (`0`) extending to the right edge. The width of the colored pattern varies across examples (3 columns in the first two, 4 columns in the third). The output grids have the same dimensions as the corresponding input grids. The transformation involves preserving the initial colored pattern, filling the white area based on a rule derived from the pattern, and appending specific columns from the original pattern to the rightmost edge of the grid.

```yaml
    task_description: Fill the white area of the grid based on row-specific colors and append boundary columns from the original pattern.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with values 0-9 representing colors.
      - element: pattern
        description: A rectangular region of non-white pixels starting from the left edge (column 0) of the input grid. Its width is variable.
        properties:
          - location: Left side of the input grid.
          - content: Contains various colors (non-zero values).
          - columns:
            - index: 0 (first column)
            - index: 1 (second column)
            - index: 2 (third column)
            - index: n-1 (last column, where n is pattern width)
      - element: fill_area
        description: A rectangular region of white pixels (value 0) to the right of the pattern in the input grid.
        properties:
          - location: Right side of the input grid, adjacent to the pattern.
          - content: All pixels are white (0).
      - element: fill_color
        description: The color used to fill the 'fill_area' in the output grid. This color is determined per row.
        relationship: Determined by the color in the first column (index 0) of the pattern for that specific row.
    
    transformations:
      - action: identify_pattern_width
        description: Determine the width of the non-white pattern on the left by finding the first column containing only white pixels.
      - action: copy_pattern
        description: The original pattern from the input grid is copied to the same position in the output grid.
      - action: fill_white_area
        description: |
          Iterate through each row of the grid.
          For a given row, identify the 'fill_color' from the first pixel (column 0) of the input pattern in that row.
          Replace all white pixels (0) in the 'fill_area' of that row in the output grid with the identified 'fill_color'. This filling stops before the last two columns.
      - action: append_boundary_columns
        description: |
          Take the column at index 1 (second column) of the original input pattern.
          Place this column into the second-to-last column (index `width - 2`) of the output grid.
          Take the column at index 2 (third column) of the original input pattern.
          Place this column into the last column (index `width - 1`) of the output grid.
    
    output_grid:
      description: The final grid after applying all transformations.
      properties:
        - dimensions: Same as the input grid.
        - content: Composed of the copied pattern, the filled area, and the two appended columns.

*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Determine the width of the initial colored pattern (`pattern_width`) located at the left edge of the input grid by finding the first column index where all pixels are white (`0`). If no such column exists, the pattern width is the full grid width.
    2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    3.  Copy the initial pattern (from column 0 to `pattern_width - 1`) from the input grid to the corresponding columns in the output grid.
    4.  For each row `r` in the grid:
        a.  Identify the `fill_color` which is the color of the pixel at `input[r][0]` (the first column of the pattern in that row).
        b.  Fill the pixels in the output grid for row `r` from column `pattern_width` up to, but not including, the second-to-last column (`width - 2`) with this `fill_color`.
    5.  Extract the column at index 1 (the second column) from the input grid's pattern area.
    6.  Place this extracted column into the second-to-last column (index `width - 2`) of the output grid.
    7.  Extract the column at index 2 (the third column) from the input grid's pattern area.
    8.  Place this extracted column into the last column (index `width - 1`) of the output grid.
    9.  Return the modified output grid.
