            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The background is white (0).\n2.  **Key Elements:** The input grids contain one or more isolated, non-white pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grids show 'L' shapes originating from the positions of the non-white pixels in the input. Each 'L' shape has the same color as the originating pixel.\n4.  **Shape Formation:** Each 'L' shape consists of two segments:\n    *   A horizontal segment starting at the original pixel's position and extending straight right to the rightmost edge of the grid.\n    *   A vertical segment starting where the horizontal segment ends (at the rightmost column) and extending straight down to the bottommost edge of the grid.\n5.  **Overlapping Shapes:** When multiple non-white pixels are present in the input (Examples 1, 3, 4), multiple 'L' shapes are drawn. If these shapes overlap, the color of the pixel drawn later seems to overwrite the color of the pixel drawn earlier.\n6.  **Order of Drawing:** Observing the overlaps (e.g., Example 1, cell (4, 5) is azure, cell (5, 5) is gray; Example 3, cell (5, 4) is magenta), it suggests that the 'L' shapes are drawn in an order determined by the original pixel's position. The pixels are likely processed in standard reading order: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right within each row. The shape corresponding to the pixel encountered later in this scan overwrites any previous color in overlapping cells.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). Make a list containing the color and position (row, column) of each of these non-white pixels.\n3.  Sort this list of non-white pixels based on their position: first sort by row number from top to bottom (smallest row index first), and for pixels in the same row, sort by column number from left to right (smallest column index first).\n4.  Iterate through the sorted list of pixels. For each pixel:\n    a.  Get its color `C` and position `(R, COL)`.\n    b.  Get the grid dimensions: `height` and `width`.\n    c.  Draw the horizontal part of the 'L': For every column `c` from `COL` up to `width - 1`, set the color of the pixel at `(R, c)` in the output grid to `C`.\n    d.  Draw the vertical part of the 'L': For every row `r` from `R` up to `height - 1`, set the color of the pixel at `(r, width - 1)` in the output grid to `C`.\n5.  After processing all the sorted pixels in this way, the final state of the output grid is the result."
