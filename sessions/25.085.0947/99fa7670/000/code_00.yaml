task_description: Draw 'L' shapes originating from non-white pixels, extending to the right and bottom edges.
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - height
      - width
      - background_color: white (0)
  - element: source_pixel
    description: A single pixel in the input grid with a color other than white.
    properties:
      - color: (1-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - element: l_shape
    description: A shape drawn in the output grid corresponding to a source_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Same as the source_pixel.
      - segments:
          - type: horizontal
            start: source_pixel position (R, C)
            end: (R, grid_width - 1)
          - type: vertical
            start: (R, grid_width - 1)
            end: (grid_height - 1, grid_width - 1)
transformation:
  - action: identify
    target: source_pixels
    details: Find all non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - action: sort
    target: source_pixels
    details: Order the identified pixels first by row index (ascending), then by column index (ascending).
  - action: initialize_output
    details: Create an output grid identical to the input grid.
  - action: draw_l_shapes
    target: output_grid
    details: Iterate through the sorted source_pixels. For each pixel, draw its corresponding l_shape onto the output grid, overwriting existing pixels.
      - sub_action: draw_horizontal
        details: Fill cells from source (R, C) to (R, grid_width - 1) with source_pixel color.
      - sub_action: draw_vertical
        details: Fill cells from (R, grid_width - 1) down to (grid_height - 1, grid_width - 1) with source_pixel color.
relationships:
  - type: origin
    from: source_pixel
    to: l_shape
    details: Each source_pixel generates one l_shape of the same color.
  - type: boundary_constraint
    element: l_shape
    details: The shape extends to the rightmost and bottommost grid boundaries.
  - type: overwrite_priority
    element: l_shape
    details: Shapes drawn later (based on sorted source_pixel order) overwrite earlier shapes in overlapping cells.
