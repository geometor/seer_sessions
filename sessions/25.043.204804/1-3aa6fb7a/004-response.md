Okay, I understand. Here's my analysis of the transformation and a natural language program describing it:

**Analysis:**

The primary change observed between the input and output grids involves the introduction of the number '1'. It appears to be placed adjacent to '8's, specifically in locations where a '8' transitions from another number. Let's examine the given input and output example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Transitioning '8's:** Scan the input grid and identify all '8' pixels. For each '8', check its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors (up, down, left, and right). A transitioning '8' pixel exists in the input example.

2.  **Place '1':**
    *   Examine the four adjacent positions around the transitioning '8'.
    *   Find the '0' that is right before the '8'. Replace the '0' with a '1'.
    *   Find the '0' that is right after the last consecutive '8'. Replac the '0' with a '1'.

In essence, the rule identifies '8's that neighbour '0's, and those bordering '0's are changed into '1's.
