            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The transformation introduces a third color, blue (1). The core operation appears to be identifying specific regions of white pixels in the input grid and changing their color to blue in the output grid, while leaving gray pixels and other white pixels untouched.\n\nObserving the examples, the gray pixels (5) act as static background or boundary elements; their positions remain unchanged. The transformation focuses solely on the white pixels (0). Specifically, contiguous rectangular blocks of white pixels that are at least 2x2 in size (i.e., height >= 2 and width >= 2) are targeted. All white pixels forming such rectangular blocks are changed to blue (1) in the output. White pixels that are isolated, form lines (1xN or Nx1), or form non-rectangular shapes are not changed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
