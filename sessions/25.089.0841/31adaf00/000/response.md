**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The transformation introduces a third color, blue (1). The core operation appears to be identifying specific regions of white pixels in the input grid and changing their color to blue in the output grid, while leaving gray pixels and other white pixels untouched.

Observing the examples, the gray pixels (5) act as static background or boundary elements; their positions remain unchanged. The transformation focuses solely on the white pixels (0). Specifically, contiguous rectangular blocks of white pixels that are at least 2x2 in size (i.e., height >= 2 and width >= 2) are targeted. All white pixels forming such rectangular blocks are changed to blue (1) in the output. White pixels that are isolated, form lines (1xN or Nx1), or form non-rectangular shapes are not changed.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) identical to the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target Rectangles:** Scan the input grid to find all possible rectangular regions. For each potential rectangle defined by its top-left corner (row1, col1) and bottom-right corner (row2, col2):
    a.  Check if the height (row2 - row1 + 1) is at least 2.
    b.  Check if the width (col2 - col1 + 1) is at least 2.
    c.  Check if all pixels within this rectangular region in the input grid have the color white (0).
3.  **Mark Pixels for Change:** Keep track of all pixel coordinates (row, col) that belong to at least one rectangle satisfying the conditions in step 2.
4.  **Apply Color Change:** Iterate through the marked pixel coordinates. For each marked coordinate (row, col), change the color of the pixel at that position in the output grid to blue (1).
5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid is the final output.
