Transformation Rule:
1. Find the largest connected component (LCC) by area (using 8-way connectivity, including diagonals) in the input grid.
2. Identify the color of this LCC ('dominant_color').
3. Create a boolean mask identifying all pixels that do *not* have the 'dominant_color'.
4. Find all connected components (using 8-way connectivity) within this boolean mask (i.e., contiguous regions of non-dominant colors).
5. For each connected component (region) of non-dominant colors found in step 4, check if any pixel within that region touches the border of the grid (top, bottom, left, or right edge).
6. If a region of non-dominant colors does *not* touch the border, it is considered an enclosed "cavity".
7. Create a copy of the input grid. Fill all pixels within these identified cavities with the 'dominant_color'.
8. Return the modified grid. Pixels belonging to the LCC and non-dominant pixels in regions that touch the border retain their original colors.
