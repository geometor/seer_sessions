task_elements:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      properties:
        - height: 10
        - width: 10
  - objects:
      type: connected components of same-colored pixels
      properties:
        - color
        - size (pixel count)
        - location (set of coordinates)
        - connectivity (adjacency to other objects)
      identification:
        - LCC: Largest Connected Component (by pixel count). Let its color be 'dominant_color'.
  - relationships:
      - adjacency: pixels can be adjacent orthogonally or diagonally.
      - reachability: pixels can be reached from others via paths of adjacent pixels.
      - enclosure: some regions/components of non-dominant colors are not reachable from the grid border without crossing through a pixel with the 'dominant_color'. These are 'cavities'.
  - actions:
      - identify_LCC: Find the connected component with the maximum number of pixels. Determine its color ('dominant_color').
      - identify_cavities: Find all pixels that are NOT 'dominant_color' AND are NOT reachable from any border cell via a path consisting solely of non-'dominant_color' pixels.
      - fill_cavities: Change the color of all pixels identified as belonging to a cavity to 'dominant_color'.
