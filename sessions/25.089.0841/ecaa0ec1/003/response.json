Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n2.  Identify the 3x3 patch containing the blue (1) and azure (8) pixels (the target object). Record its 3x3 pixel data, its top-left corner coordinates (origin_row, origin_col), and calculate its center coordinates (center_row = origin_row + 1, center_col = origin_col + 1).\n3.  Find the coordinates (row, col) of all yellow (4) pixels (the markers).\n4.  Calculate the Euclidean distance between the target object's center coordinates and the coordinates of each marker. Store these distances along with their corresponding marker coordinates.\n5.  Sort the markers based on their calculated distance to the target center in ascending order.\n6.  Identify the marker with the minimum distance (the closest marker). Let its coordinates be (closest_row, closest_col).\n7.  Determine the relative direction quadrant of the closest marker with respect to the target center:\n    *   Top-Left (TL): closest_row < center_row and closest_col < center_col\n    *   Top-Right (TR): closest_row < center_row and closest_col >= center_col\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): closest_row >= center_row and closest_col < center_col\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): closest_row >= center_row and closest_col >= center_col\n8.  Select the counter-clockwise rotation parameter `k` for numpy.rot90 based on the relative direction:\n    *   If direction is TL or TR, set `k = 1` (90 degrees CCW).\n    *   If direction is BR, set `k = 2` (180 degrees CCW).\n    *   If direction is BL, set `k = 0` (0 degrees CCW).\n9.  Rotate the extracted 3x3 target object patch counter-clockwise `k` times.\n10. Place the rotated 3x3 target object patch onto the output grid at the original top-left coordinates (origin_row, origin_col).\n11. Identify all markers that share the second smallest unique distance to the target center. Find the smallest distance value in the sorted list that is strictly greater than the minimum distance; collect all markers matching this second distance value.\n12. Calculate the average row and average column of these second-closest markers. Round both averages to the nearest integer to get the output marker coordinates (output_marker_row, output_marker_col).\n    *   *Edge Case Handling:* If there are fewer than two unique distances among markers (e.g., only one marker exists, or all markers are equidistant), use the coordinates of the closest marker as the output marker coordinates.\n13. Place a single yellow (4) pixel on the output grid at the calculated (output_marker_row, output_marker_col), ensuring it's within bounds.\n14.
