Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0), several isolated yellow pixels (4), and a single complex object composed of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Blue/Azure Object:** This object appears to be the primary element being transformed. In all examples, it occupies a 3x3 area.
3.  **Yellow Pixels:** These seem to act as control signals or parameters for the transformation. They are scattered around the blue/azure object.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid contains the transformed blue/azure object, a single yellow pixel at a new location, and a white background. The original yellow pixels are gone.
5.  **Transformation:** The blue/azure object undergoes a rotation within its 3x3 space. The specific rotation seems dependent on the relative position of the *closest* yellow pixel in the input. The position of the *single* output yellow pixel seems related to the positions of the *second closest* yellow pixel(s) in the input.

**Analysis Summary:**

*   The core transformation is a rotation of the 3x3 blue/azure object.
*   The rotation type (90°, 180°, 270°, or 0°) is determined by the location of the *closest* input yellow pixel relative to the center of the blue/azure object.
    *   Closest Top-Left -> Rotate 270° clockwise (or 90° counter-clockwise)
    *   Closest Top-Right -> Rotate 90° clockwise
    *   Closest Bottom-Right -> Rotate 180° clockwise
    *   Closest Bottom-Left -> Rotate 0° (No rotation - inferred)
*   All input yellow pixels are removed.
*   A single new yellow pixel is placed in the output. Its location is the average position (row, column) of the input yellow pixel(s) that were *second closest* to the blue/azure object's center.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but set all non-white pixels to white (0).
2.  Find the connected component of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels (the target object). Determine its bounding box, which should be 3x3. Extract this 3x3 grid patch and note its top-left corner coordinates (origin\_row, origin\_col). Calculate the center coordinates of this 3x3 patch (center\_row, center\_col).
3.  Find the coordinates (row, col) of all yellow (4) pixels (the markers).
4.  For each marker, calculate the Euclidean distance between its coordinates (row, col) and the target object's center coordinates (center\_row, center\_col).
5.  Identify the marker(s) with the minimum distance. Assume there is a unique closest marker based on the examples. Let its coordinates be (closest\_row, closest\_col).
6.  Determine the relative direction of the closest marker from the target object's center:
    *   If `closest_row < center_row` and `closest_col < center_col`, direction is Top-Left (TL).
    *   If `closest_row < center_row` and `closest_col > center_col`, direction is Top-Right (TR).
    *   If `closest_row > center_row`
