elements:
  - object: background
    color: white
    value: 0
  - object: marker
    color: yellow
    value: 4
    role: control signal
    quantity: multiple in input, single in output
  - object: target
    color: [blue, azure]
    value: [1, 8]
    shape: 3x3 contiguous block
    role: transformed object
    quantity: single

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Yellow markers are located relative to the target object.
  - type: distance
    description: Euclidean distance is calculated between the target object's center and each yellow marker.
  - type: ranking
    description: Yellow markers are ranked based on their distance to the target object (closest, second closest, etc.).

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: target object (blue/azure)
