The active color is any color other than white (0) or gray (5).\nCreates an output grid initialized to white (0).\nCopies the gray (5) frame from the input grid to the output grid.\nIterates through each of the nine 3x3 subgrid locations defined by the frame.\nFor each location, it examines the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the input grid.\nIf the input subgrid contains at least one pixel of the active color, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid is filled entirely with that active color.\nIf the input subgrid does not contain any pixel of the active color, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid remains filled with white (0).\nThe gray frame is explicitly maintained in the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_active_color(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first non-white (0) and non-gray (5) color within the areas\n    not occupied by the gray frame (assumed at rows 3, 7 and cols 3, 7).\n    \n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int or None: The active color value, or None if no active color is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Skip pixels belonging to the gray frame\n            # Assumes frame is at fixed indices 3 and 7\n            if r == 3 or r == 7 or c == 3 or c == 7:\n                continue\n            \n            pixel = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if the pixel is neither white (0) nor gray (5)\n            if pixel != 0 and pixel != 5: \n                return pixel # Found the active color\n                \n    return None # No active color found in the designated subgrid areas\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the presence of an 'active color' \n    within 3x3 subgrids defined by a gray frame.
