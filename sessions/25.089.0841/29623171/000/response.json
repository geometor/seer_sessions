Horizontal gray lines are at rows 3 and 7 (0-indexed), and vertical gray lines are at columns 3 and 7. These lines divide the grid into nine distinct 3x3 subgrids or \"cells\". These gray lines remain unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Content Pixels:** Inside the 3x3 cells, pixels can be white (0) or other colors (red=2, blue=1, green=3 in the examples).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the 3x3 cells. In the output, some 3x3 cells become entirely filled with a single color (e.g., red, blue, or green), while others become entirely filled with white (0).\n5.  **Color Selection:** In each example pair, only one primary color (other than white or gray) seems active in the transformation.\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) pixels in the input lead to solid red blocks in the output.\n    *   Example 2: Blue (1) pixels in the input lead to solid blue blocks in the output.\n    *   Example "
