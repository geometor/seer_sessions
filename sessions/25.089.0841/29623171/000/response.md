Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 11x11.
2.  **Invariant Frame:** There's a persistent frame made of gray (5) pixels. Horizontal gray lines are at rows 3 and 7 (0-indexed), and vertical gray lines are at columns 3 and 7. These lines divide the grid into nine distinct 3x3 subgrids or "cells". These gray lines remain unchanged in the output.
3.  **Content Pixels:** Inside the 3x3 cells, pixels can be white (0) or other colors (red=2, blue=1, green=3 in the examples).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation happens within the 3x3 cells. In the output, some 3x3 cells become entirely filled with a single color (e.g., red, blue, or green), while others become entirely filled with white (0).
5.  **Color Selection:** In each example pair, only one primary color (other than white or gray) seems active in the transformation.
    *   Example 1: Red (2) pixels in the input lead to solid red blocks in the output.
    *   Example 2: Blue (1) pixels in the input lead to solid blue blocks in the output.
