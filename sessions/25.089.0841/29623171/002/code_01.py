# 1. **Identify Grid Structure:** Recognize the input grid is divided by a persistent gray (5) frame at rows 3 & 7 and columns 3 & 7, creating nine 3x3 cells.
# 2. **Determine Active Color:** Find the single non-white (0), non-gray (5) color present within the 3x3 cells across the entire input grid. Call this `active_color`. If no such color exists, the output is likely the input structure with all cells white (or handle as edge case).
# 3. **Calculate Fill Threshold:** Determine the minimum count required to fill a cell. This threshold is the maximum of 2 and the numerical value of the `active_color`. `threshold = max(2, active_color_value)`.
# 4. **Process Each Cell:** Iterate through each of the nine 3x3 cell locations defined by the frame.
#    a. **Count Active Pixels:** For the current 3x3 cell in the input grid, count how many pixels match the `active_color`. Let this be `pixel_count`.
#    b. **Apply Threshold:** Compare `pixel_count` to the calculated `threshold`.
#    c. **Generate Output Cell:**
#       i. If `pixel_count >= threshold`, fill the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid entirely with the `active_color`.
#       ii. If `pixel_count < threshold`, fill the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid entirely with white (0).
# 5. **Construct Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid (e.g., all white). Populate the 3x3 cell areas based on step 4c. Then, draw the gray (5) frame onto the output grid at rows 3 & 7 and columns 3 & 7, overwriting any cell content at those specific frame locations. Return the completed output grid.
