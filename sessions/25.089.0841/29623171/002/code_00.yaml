# YAML Facts Extraction
# Focus: Grid structure, active elements, transformation rule based on threshold.

grid_properties:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: frame
    color: gray (5)
    location: Fixed rows 3 and 7, columns 3 and 7 (0-indexed).
    function: Divides the grid into 9 independent 3x3 subgrids (cells).
    persistence: Unchanged between input and output.

cell_properties:
  - size: 3x3 pixels
  - location: Defined by the gray frame grid lines. Top-left corners at (0,0), (0,4), (0,8), (4,0), (4,4), (4,8), (8,0), (8,4), (8,8).
  - content: Can contain white (0) pixels and one other 'active' color per task instance.

active_color:
  - property: The single color within the cells (other than white or gray) present in the input grid.
  - examples: Red (2) in ex1, Blue (1) in ex2, Green (3) in ex3.
  - role: Determines the potential fill color for output cells and influences the fill condition.

transformation:
  - scope: Acts independently on each 3x3 cell defined by the frame.
  - input_analysis: For each 3x3 cell in the input grid:
      1. Identify the active color for the entire grid.
      2. Count the number of pixels matching the active color within that cell ('count').
      3. Determine the fill threshold: threshold = max(2, active_color_value).
  - output_generation: For the corresponding 3x3 cell location in the output grid:
      1. If 'count' >= 'threshold': Fill the 3x3 cell entirely with the active color.
      2. If 'count' < 'threshold': Fill the 3x3 cell entirely with white (0).
  - finalization: Ensure the gray frame is present in the output grid.
