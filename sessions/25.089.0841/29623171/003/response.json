The active color is the first color encountered that is neither white (0) nor gray (5).\nCalculates a fill threshold based on the active color: threshold = max(2, active_color_value).\nCreates an output grid, initially white (0).\nIterates through each of the nine 3x3 cell locations.\nFor each input cell, counts the number of pixels matching the active color.\nIf the count meets or exceeds the calculated threshold, the corresponding 3x3 cell in the output grid is filled entirely with the active color. Otherwise, it remains white (0).\nFinally, the gray frame (rows 3, 7 and columns 3, 7) is explicitly drawn onto the output grid, overwriting any cell content at the frame's location.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_active_color(grid: np.ndarray) -> int | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first non-white (0) and non-gray (5) color within the areas\n    not occupied by the assumed gray frame (rows 3, 7 and cols 3, 7).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        int or None: The active color value, or None if no active color is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Skip pixels assumed to be part of the gray frame\n            if r == 3 or r == 7 or c == 3 or c == 7:\n                continue\n            \n            pixel = grid[r, c]\n            # Check if the pixel is neither white (0) nor gray (5)\n            if pixel != 0 and pixel != 5: \n                return int(pixel) # Found the active color\n                \n    return None # No active color found\n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on a threshold count of an 'active color' \n    within 3x3 subgrids defined by a gray frame.
