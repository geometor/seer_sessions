            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (16x16) and contain a single, uniform background color (azure, red, or yellow in the examples). Scattered within this background are several distinct, smaller objects composed of contiguous pixels of other colors.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are much smaller and their dimensions vary between examples. They do not contain the background color from the input. The output grids seem to be composed of pixels from the objects found in the input.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The process appears to involve selecting one primary object from the input (let's call it the \"target object\") and using its bounding box to define the size and initial content of the output grid. Then, other objects (\"modifier objects\") from the input have their pixels \"overlaid\" or \"stamped\" onto this initial output grid, replacing the target object's pixels at the corresponding relative locations.\n4.  **Object Selection:**\n    *   The background color is ignored.\n    *   The target object seems to be determined based on color priority: if a blue (1) object exists, it's the target; otherwise, if a green (3) object exists, it's the target. (This holds for the provided examples).\n    *   All other non-background objects act as modifiers.\n5.  **Overlay Mechanism:** For each modifier object, its pixels are mapped onto the target object's bounding box canvas. If a modifier pixel's location (relative to the target object's top-left corner) falls within the output grid's boundaries, it replaces the pixel at that location in the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
