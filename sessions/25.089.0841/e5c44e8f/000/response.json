The red pixels act as static barriers. The green pixel(s) act as starting points for a spreading or filling process. The transformation involves filling white areas of the grid with green, starting from the initial green pixel(s). This fill process propagates to adjacent (up, down, left, right) white cells but is blocked by red cells and the grid boundaries. The original red and green pixels remain unchanged in the output grid. Essentially, it's a flood fill algorithm originating from green pixels, constrained by red pixels.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
