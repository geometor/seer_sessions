**Perception:**

The input grid consistently features a large, hollow rectangle made of gray (5) pixels, surrounded by a white (0) background. Additionally, there are exactly two other non-white, non-gray pixels located somewhere outside this gray rectangle. These two pixels act as "triggers" or "keys".

The output grid retains the gray rectangle and the background exactly as they were in the input. The transformation occurs *inside* the hollow area of the gray rectangle. This hollow area, which is initially white (0), is filled with a pattern determined by the colors and positions of the two trigger pixels found in the input.

The hollow area is always a 4x4 grid. This 4x4 area is divided into four 2x2 quadrants. The colors filling these quadrants are derived from the two trigger pixels. Specifically, one trigger pixel's color fills the top-left and bottom-right 2x2 quadrants, while the other trigger pixel's color fills the top-right and bottom-left 2x2 quadrants.

The assignment of which trigger pixel color goes to which pair of diagonal quadrants depends on the *location* of the trigger pixels relative to the center or the overall structure of the grid. The trigger pixel located in either the top-left or bottom-right region of the grid (relative to the center) determines the color for the top-left and bottom-right inner quadrants. The trigger pixel located in either the top-right or bottom-left region determines the color for the top-right and bottom-left inner quadrants.

```yaml
Objects:
  - name: background
    color: 0 (white)
    stasis: unchanged
  - name: gray_frame
    color: 5 (gray)
    shape: hollow rectangle (6x6 in examples)
    stasis: unchanged
    contains:
      - internal_area
  - name: internal_area
    location: inside gray_frame
    initial_state: filled with background color (0)
    final_state: filled with a pattern
    size: 4x4 (in examples)
    subdivision: four 2x2 quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
  - name: trigger_pixels
    count: 2
    color: varied (non-0, non-5)
    location: outside gray_frame
    role: determine the filling pattern for internal_area

Relationships:
  - The gray_frame defines the boundary for the transformation area (internal_area).
  - The trigger_pixels' colors and relative positions determine the output pattern within the internal_area.

Actions:
  - Identify the gray_frame and its internal_area.
  - Identify the two trigger_pixels and their colors (color1, color2) and locations (pos1, pos2).
  - Determine the relative quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of each trigger_pixel based on its position relative to the grid center or frame center.
  - Assign colors to the internal_area's quadrants:
    - If trigger_pixel_1 is in the Top-Left or Bottom-Right relative quadrant, its color fills the Top-Left and Bottom-Right 2x2 inner quadrants.
    - If trigger_pixel_2 is in the Top-Right or Bottom-Left relative quadrant, its color fills the Top-Right and Bottom-Left 2x2 inner quadrants.
    - (And vice-versa for the assignments).
  - Fill the internal_area according to these color assignments, leaving the gray_frame and background unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Components:**
    *   Locate the contiguous gray (5) object, which forms a hollow rectangular frame (`gray_frame`).
    *   Identify the rectangular region inside the `gray_frame` that is initially filled with the background color (0). This is the `internal_area`. Note its boundaries.
    *   Find the two pixels in the grid that are neither the background color (0) nor the frame color (5). These are the `trigger_pixels`. Record their colors (`color1`, `color2`) and grid coordinates (`pos1`, `pos2`).

2.  **Determine Relative Positions:**
    *   Establish a reference point, for example, the center of the `gray_frame` or the center of the grid.
    *   For each `trigger_pixel`, determine its general quadrant location (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) relative to the reference point.

3.  **Assign Colors to Inner Quadrants:**
    *   Divide the `internal_area` into four equal 2x2 quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
    *   Identify which `trigger_pixel` is located in a Top-Left or Bottom-Right relative quadrant. Let its color be `color_diag1`.
    *   Identify which `trigger_pixel` is located in a Top-Right or Bottom-Left relative quadrant. Let its color be `color_diag2`.

4.  **Fill the Internal Area:**
    *   Fill the TL 2x2 quadrant of the `internal_area` with `color_diag1`.
    *   Fill the BR 2x2 quadrant of the `internal_area` with `color_diag1`.
    *   Fill the TR 2x2 quadrant of the `internal_area` with `color_diag2`.
    *   Fill the BL 2x2 quadrant of the `internal_area` with `color_diag2`.

5.  **Construct Output:**
    *   Create the output grid by copying the input grid initially.
    *   Replace the pixels within the `internal_area` of the output grid with the colors determined in step 4. Ensure the `gray_frame` and surrounding background remain unchanged.
