Objects:
  - name: background
    color: 0 (white)
    stasis: unchanged
  - name: gray_frame
    color: 5 (gray)
    shape: hollow rectangle (6x6 in examples)
    stasis: unchanged
    contains:
      - internal_area
  - name: internal_area
    location: inside gray_frame
    initial_state: filled with background color (0)
    final_state: filled with a pattern
    size: 4x4 (in examples)
    subdivision: four 2x2 quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
  - name: trigger_pixels
    count: 2
    color: varied (non-0, non-5)
    location: outside gray_frame
    role: determine the filling pattern for internal_area

Relationships:
  - The gray_frame defines the boundary for the transformation area (internal_area).
  - The trigger_pixels' colors and relative positions determine the output pattern within the internal_area.

Actions:
  - Identify the gray_frame and its internal_area.
  - Identify the two trigger_pixels and their colors (color1, color2) and locations (pos1, pos2).
  - Determine the relative quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of each trigger_pixel based on its position relative to the grid center or frame center.
  - Assign colors to the internal_area's quadrants:
    - If trigger_pixel_1 is in the Top-Left or Bottom-Right relative quadrant, its color fills the Top-Left and Bottom-Right 2x2 inner quadrants.
    - If trigger_pixel_2 is in the Top-Right or Bottom-Left relative quadrant, its color fills the Top-Right and Bottom-Left 2x2 inner quadrants.
    - (And vice-versa for the assignments).
  - Fill the internal_area according to these color assignments, leaving the gray_frame and background unchanged.
