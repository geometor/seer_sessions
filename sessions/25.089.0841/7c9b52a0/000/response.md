Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (16x16) and feature a dominant background color (azure, blue, or maroon). Scattered within this background are several rectangular "regions" primarily composed of white pixels.
2.  **White Regions:** These white regions act as containers or frames. They are not necessarily filled entirely with white; they enclose smaller patterns or "objects" made of other colors (blue, red, green, yellow). All white regions within a single input grid appear to have the identical dimensions for their inner content area.
3.  **Colored Objects:** Inside the white regions, there are distinct objects/patterns composed of colors 1 through 4. These objects vary in shape (L-shapes, rectangles, squares, lines).
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. Their dimensions match the inner content dimensions of the white regions found in the input.
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting the contents of all the white regions from the input and overlaying them onto a single output grid. The background color of the input is discarded. The relative positions of the colored objects within their respective white regions are preserved in the overlay process. When multiple regions contribute a non-white color to the same position in the output grid, the color from the region processed later (likely based on top-to-bottom, left-to-right order of regions in the input) seems to take precedence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract content from multiple identical white rectangular regions and overlay them onto a single output grid.

elements:
  - element: background_grid
    description: The main input grid.
    properties:
      - size: 16x16 (in examples)
      - dominant_color: A single color filling most of the grid (azure, blue, maroon in examples), acting as a background distinct from white.

  - element: container_region
    description: Rectangular areas within the background_grid composed mainly of white pixels, acting as frames.
    properties:
      - border_color: white (0)
      - location: Scattered within the background_grid.
      - adjacency: Bounded by the dominant_color of the background_grid.
      - uniformity: All container_regions within a single input have the same inner content dimensions (height H, width W).
      - count: Multiple regions per input (e.g., 4, 3, 2 in examples).

  - element: content_object
    description: Colored patterns or shapes located inside the container_regions.
    properties:
      - color: Non-white, non-background colors (blue, red, green, yellow in examples).
      - shape: Variable (rectangles, L-shapes, lines).
      - relationship: Contained within a specific container_region.

  - element: output_grid
    description: The result of the transformation.
    properties:
      - size: HxW, matching the inner content dimensions of the container_regions.
      - background_color: white (0) initially.
      - content: An overlay of all content_objects from the input's container_regions.

actions:
  - action: identify_background_color
    input: background_grid
    output: dominant_color

  - action: locate_container_regions
    input: background_grid, dominant_color
    output: list_of_container_regions (coordinates and dimensions)

  - action: determine_output_dimensions
    input: list_of_container_regions
    output: height H, width W (inner dimensions)
    condition: All regions must have the same inner dimensions.

  - action: initialize_output_grid
    input: H, W
    output: output_grid (filled with white)

  - action: extract_and_overlay_content
    input: list_of_container_regions, output_grid
    process:
      - Iterate through container_regions (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
      - For each region, extract its inner content (HxW grid).
      - Iterate through the HxW content grid.
      - If a cell color is non-white, update the corresponding cell in the output_grid with that color.
    output: final_output_grid

relationships:
  - type: containment
    source: container_region
    target: content_object
  - type: adjacency
    source: container_region
    target: background_grid (dominant_color pixels)
  - type: transformation
    input: background_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: Overlaying extracted contents of container_regions.

constraints:
  - All container_regions within one input must share the same inner dimensions.
  - The overlay process overwrites previous non-white colors at a given cell with the non-white color from the currently processed region.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single dominant color that acts as the main background of the input grid (ignoring white).
2.  Find all distinct, contiguous regions composed of white pixels that are bordered by the identified background color. These are the "container regions".
3.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the content area *inside* one of these container regions (i.e., excluding the outermost layer of white pixels if they form a border). Verify that all other container regions have the same internal HxW dimensions.
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions HxW, and initialize all its cells to white (0).
5.  Process the container regions found in step 2, systematically (e.g., starting with the top-most, left-most region and proceeding downwards and rightwards).
6.  For each container region:
    a.  Extract the HxW grid representing its internal content.
    b.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of this extracted HxW content grid.
    c.  If the color of the cell `(row, col)` in the content grid is *not* white (0), update the cell at `(row, col)` in the output grid with this non-white color.
7.  After processing all container regions in this manner, the resulting output grid is the final answer.
