            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are relatively large (16x16) and feature a dominant background color (azure, blue, or maroon). Scattered within this background are several rectangular \"regions\" primarily composed of white pixels.\n2.  **White Regions:** These white regions act as containers or frames. They are not necessarily filled entirely with white; they enclose smaller patterns or \"objects\" made of other colors (blue, red, green, yellow). All white regions within a single input grid appear to have the identical dimensions for their inner content area.\n3.  **Colored Objects:** Inside the white regions, there are distinct objects/patterns composed of colors 1 through 4. These objects vary in shape (L-shapes, rectangles, squares, lines).\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. Their dimensions match the inner content dimensions of the white regions found in the input.\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting the contents of all the white regions from the input and overlaying them onto a single output grid. The background color of the input is discarded. The relative positions of the colored objects within their respective white regions are preserved in the overlay process. When multiple regions contribute a non-white color to the same position in the output grid, the color from the region processed later (likely based on top-to-bottom, left-to-right order of regions in the input) seems to take precedence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find all distinct, contiguous regions composed of white pixels that are bordered by the identified background color. These are the \"container regions\".\n3.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the content area *inside* one of these container regions (i.e., excluding the outermost layer of white pixels if they form a border). Verify that all other container regions have the same internal HxW dimensions.\n4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions HxW, and initialize all its cells to white (0).\n5.  Process the container regions found in step 2, systematically (e.g., starting with the top-most, left-most region and proceeding downwards and rightwards).\n6.  For each container region:\n    a.  Extract the HxW grid representing its internal content.\n    b.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of this extracted HxW content grid.\n    c.  If the color of the cell `(row, col)` in the content grid is *not* white (0), update the cell at `(row, col)` in the output grid with this non-white color.\n7.  After processing all container regions in this manner, the resulting output grid is the final answer."
