```python
import copy

"""
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel has a non-white color (not 0), 
paint a 4x4 square of that color onto the output grid, starting at the pixel's 
coordinates (top-left corner of the 4x4 square). 
Ensure painting stays within the grid boundaries. 
Paints occur in the order pixels are encountered (row by row, column by column), 
so later paints can overwrite earlier ones.
