These gray shapes often form containers or boundaries around areas of white pixels. The output grids modify the input by filling these enclosed white areas with red pixels (2). Additionally, a horizontal red line is drawn two rows above the topmost part of each filled red area. The extent and direction (starting from the left edge or starting from the filled area's left edge) of this horizontal line depend on whether the right side of the original enclosed white area is bounded by gray pixels.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
