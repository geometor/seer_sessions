This color differs between examples (blue-1, magenta-6, green-3). These lines act as axes of reflection.\n    *   In the input, non-background, non-axis colored pixels (\"content pixels\") are predominantly located in one of the four quadrants defined by the intersection of the axis lines.\n    *   The output grid retains the original axis lines and the content pixels in their original quadrant.\n    *   The output grid is completed by reflecting the content pixels from the original quadrant into the other three quadrants, using the axis lines as mirrors. The background color is ignored during reflection (i.e., reflected pixels overwrite the background color, but background color pixels do not overwrite existing content pixels in other quadrants if reflection were done naively).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Identify the color that forms both a single continuous horizontal line and a single continuous vertical line within the grid; this is the 'axis color', and the lines are the 'axis lines'. Determine the row index of the horizontal axis line and the column index of the vertical axis line. Their intersection point defines the center.\n    3.  Define the four quadrants of the grid based on the axis lines.\n    4.  Identify the 'source quadrant' in the input grid, which is the quadrant containing pixels that are neither the background color nor the axis color ('content pixels'). Assume there is only one such source quadrant.\n    5.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.\n    6.  For each content pixel located at `(row, col)` within the source quadrant:\n        a.  Calculate the horizontally reflected position across the vertical axis line. Place the content pixel's color at this reflected position in the output grid.\n        b.  Calculate the vertically reflected position across the horizontal axis line. Place the content pixel's color at this reflected position in the output grid.\n        c.  Calculate the diagonally reflected position (across both axes). Place the content pixel's color at this reflected position in the output grid.\n    7.  Ensure the original axis lines and the content pixels within the source quadrant remain unchanged in the output grid. The reflections should only overwrite the background color in the target quadrants."
