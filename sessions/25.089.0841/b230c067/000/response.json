The output grid maintains the white background and the exact shapes and positions of the input objects, but the objects are recolored. Each input azure object is replaced by an object of the same shape, colored either blue (1) or red (2). The core task is to determine the rule for assigning either blue or red to each distinct azure object from the input. Analysis suggests that exactly one object is colored red, and all others are colored blue. The object chosen to be red is the one with the smallest area (fewest pixels). If multiple objects share the smallest area, the tie is broken by choosing the object whose top-most pixel has the lowest row index. If there is still a tie, it's broken by choosing the object whose top-most, left-most pixel has the lowest column index.\n\n*   **YAML:**\n    "
