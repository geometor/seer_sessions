These markers tend to be located towards the general corners relative to the gray rectangle.\n    *   The rest of the input grid is typically filled with the background color (white, 0).\n    *   The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    *   The transformation replaces the gray rectangle area in the output grid.\n    *   The area corresponding to the input gray rectangle is divided into four equal quadrants in the output grid.\n    *   Each quadrant is filled with the color of one of the four marker pixels from the input. The mapping is consistent: the top-left marker colors the top-left quadrant, the top-right marker colors the top-right quadrant, the bottom-left marker colors the bottom-left quadrant, and the bottom-right marker colors the bottom-right quadrant.\n    *   The marker pixels themselves and the original gray pixels are removed (replaced by background or the quadrant fill color) in the output.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n    2.  Identify the contiguous rectangular block of gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid. Determine its top-left corner coordinates (row\\_start, col\\_start) and its dimensions (height H, width W).\n    3.  Identify the four corner marker pixels in the input grid. These are the non-background (non-0), non-gray (non-5) pixels located as follows:\n        *   Top-Left Marker (C\\_TL): The marker pixel with the minimum row index. If there's a tie, the one with the minimum column index among those.\n        *   Top-Right Marker (C\\_TR): The marker pixel with the minimum row index. If there's a tie, the one with the maximum column index among those.\n        *   Bottom-Left Marker (C\\_BL): The marker pixel with the maximum row index. If there's a tie, the one with the minimum column index among those.\n        *   Bottom-Right Marker (C\\_BR): The marker pixel with the maximum row index. If there's a tie, the one with the maximum column index among those.\n    4.  Divide the area in the output grid corresponding to the input gray rectangle (from `row_start` to `row_start + H - 1` and `col_start` to `col_start + W - 1`) into four equal quadrants, each of size (H/2) by (W/2).\n    5.  Fill the pixels in the top-left quadrant (rows `row_start` to `row_start + H/2 - 1`, columns `col_start` to `col_start + W/2 - 1`) with the color of the Top-Left Marker (C\\_TL).\n    6.  Fill the pixels in the top-right quadrant (rows `row_start` to `row_start + H/2 - 1`, columns `col_start + W/2` to `col_start + W - 1`) with the color of the Top-Right Marker (C\\_TR).\n    7.  Fill the pixels in the bottom-left quadrant (rows `row_start + H/2` to `row_start + H - 1`, columns `col_start` to `col_start + W/2 - 1`) with the color of the Bottom-Left Marker (C\\_BL).\n    8.  Fill the pixels in the bottom-right quadrant (rows `row_start + H/2` to `row_start + H - 1`, columns `col_start + W/2` to `col_start + W - 1`) with the color of the Bottom-Right Marker (C\\_BR).\n    9.
