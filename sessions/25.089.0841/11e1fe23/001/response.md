  Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
  1. Identify all non-background (non-zero color) pixels.
  2. Calculate the center coordinates (row, col) of the bounding box enclosing these pixels. 
     The center is determined using floor division: center_row = floor((min_row + max_row) / 2), center_col = floor((min_col + max_col) / 2).
  3. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  4. For each original non-background pixel (r, c) with color 'clr':
     a. Determine the direction vector from the center to the pixel (or pixel to center, consistently). Let's use pixel to center: dr = center_row - r, dc = center_col - c.
     b. Calculate the sign of this direction vector: sign_r = sign(dr), sign_c = sign(dc).
     c. Determine the location of a new pixel: new_r = center_row - sign_r, new_c = center_col - sign_c. This location is one step away from the center, in the direction back towards the original pixel.
     d. Place a pixel with the original color 'clr' at (new_r, new_c) in the output grid, provided it's within bounds.
  5. Place a gray pixel (color 5) at the calculated center coordinates (center_row, center_col) in the output grid. This gray pixel takes precedence if any new colored pixel calculation results in the same coordinates.
