The colors of the frame, the main inner area, and the internal structures play roles in defining the context and identifying the target objects. The output grid seems to capture the essence of the target objects' layout, discarding the exact shapes, sizes, and the surrounding context from the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
