task_context:
  description: Recolor gray objects based on their scan order and relative positions.
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True
    - background_color: white (0)
    - background_preserved: True
input_elements:
  - element_type: objects
    color: gray (5)
    count: 3 (in all examples)
    shape: varies (lines, L-shapes)
    properties:
      - connectedness: pixels are adjacent (including diagonals likely count based on standard object finding)
      - location: scattered within the grid
output_elements:
  - element_type: objects
    color: blue (1), red (2), yellow (4)
    count: 3 (same as input)
    shape: same as corresponding input object
    location: same as corresponding input object
transformation_rules:
  - rule: Identify distinct gray (5) objects.
  - rule: Determine the scan order of objects (based on top-most, then left-most pixel).
  - rule: Recolor objects based on order and relative position:
      - 1st object: becomes blue (1).
      - 2nd and 3rd objects:
          - Condition: Check if the bounding box of the 2nd object is entirely above the bounding box of the 3rd object (max_row(obj2) < min_row(obj3)).
          - If Condition True: 2nd object becomes red (2), 3rd object becomes yellow (4).
          - If Condition False: 2nd object becomes yellow (4), 3rd object becomes red (2).
relationships:
  - type: spatial_order
    description: Objects are ordered based on top-to-bottom, left-to-right scanning.
  - type: relative_position
    description: The vertical positioning of the 2nd and 3rd objects in the scan order determines their final color assignment (red or yellow).
  - type: color_mapping
    description: Gray objects map to blue, red, or yellow based on derived rules.
