The output grids use white (0) for the background and blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) for objects.\n3.  **Object Identification:** The gray pixels in the input form distinct connected components (objects). These objects appear to be lines or simple L-shapes.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the gray objects. The background remains unchanged. The shape and position of each object are preserved.\n5.  **Color Assignment Logic:** The color assigned to each object in the output depends on the order in which the objects are encountered when scanning the grid (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n    *   The first gray object encountered is always changed to blue (1).\n    *   There are always exactly three gray objects in the examples.\n    *   The assignment of red (2) and yellow (4) to the second and third objects depends on their relative vertical positions.\n        *   Typically, the second object becomes yellow (4) and the third becomes red (2).\n        *   However, if the second object is located entirely above the third object (its maximum row index is less than the minimum row index of the third object), the colors are swapped: the second object becomes red (2) and the third becomes yellow (4). This occurs in `train_3`.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Determine the order of these objects by finding the top-most, then left-most pixel belonging to each object.

Identify the first, second, and third objects according to this scan order.\n5.  Recolor the pixels belonging to the first object to blue (1) in the output grid.\n6.  Determine the bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column) for the second object and the third object.\n7.  Compare the maximum row index of the second object's bounding box with the minimum row index of the third object's bounding box.\n8.  If the maximum row of the second object is less than the minimum row of the third object (meaning the second object is entirely above the third):\n    a.
