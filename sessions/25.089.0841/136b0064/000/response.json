The background is white (0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller in width than the input grids. They contain the shapes that were originally to the left of the yellow line in the input, plus the single gray pixel repositioned. The yellow line itself is absent in the output.\n3.  **Key Transformation Elements:**\n    *   **Partitioning:** The yellow line divides the input grid into a left section, the line itself, and a right section.\n    *   **Cropping/Selection:** The transformation focuses on the left section and the single gray pixel from the right section. The rest of the right section and the yellow line are discarded.\n    *   **Copying:** The left section of the input grid (up to the yellow line) appears to be directly copied to the output grid.\n    *   **Repositioning:** The gray pixel's position changes. Its row remains the same, but its column in the output depends on its original column relative to the yellow line's column in the input.\n4.  **Dimensionality:** The height of the output grid is the same as the input grid. The width of the output grid is determined by the column index of the yellow line in the input.\n5.  **Gray Pixel Rule:** The gray pixel is found in the input grid to the right of the yellow line. Its row index is preserved in the output. Its column index in the output is calculated as its original column index minus the yellow line's column index, minus one.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Create a new grid of these dimensions, filled initially with the background color (white, 0).\n5.  Copy the rectangular region of the input grid defined by all rows and columns from 0 up to (but not including) `yellow_col` into the corresponding top-left region of the new output grid.\n6.
