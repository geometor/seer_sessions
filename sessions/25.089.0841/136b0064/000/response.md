**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain various colored shapes (objects) primarily on the left side, a single vertical yellow (4) line acting as a separator, and a single gray (5) pixel somewhere to the right of the yellow line. The background is white (0).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller in width than the input grids. They contain the shapes that were originally to the left of the yellow line in the input, plus the single gray pixel repositioned. The yellow line itself is absent in the output.
3.  **Key Transformation Elements:**
    *   **Partitioning:** The yellow line divides the input grid into a left section, the line itself, and a right section.
    *   **Cropping/Selection:** The transformation focuses on the left section and the single gray pixel from the right section. The rest of the right section and the yellow line are discarded.
    *   **Copying:** The left section of the input grid (up to the yellow line) appears to be directly copied to the output grid.
    *   **Repositioning:** The gray pixel's position changes. Its row remains the same, but its column in the output depends on its original column relative to the yellow line's column in the input.
4.  **Dimensionality:** The height of the output grid is the same as the input grid. The width of the output grid is determined by the column index of the yellow line in the input.
5.  **Gray Pixel Rule:** The gray pixel is found in the input grid to the right of the yellow line. Its row index is preserved in the output. Its column index in the output is calculated as its original column index minus the yellow line's column index, minus one.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Copy the portion of the input grid left of a vertical yellow line, discard the line and the rest of the right side, then reposition a single gray pixel (found right of the yellow line) into the output grid based on its original row and its horizontal distance from the yellow line.

input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - contains multiple colored objects (contiguous non-white pixels)
      - contains a single vertical line of yellow (4) pixels
      - contains a single gray (5) pixel located to the right of the yellow line
      - uses white (0) as background

output_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - height matches input grid height
      - width equals the column index of the yellow line in the input grid
      - contains the objects originally left of the yellow line
      - contains the single gray pixel repositioned
      - does not contain the yellow line

actions:
  - action: Find
    target: Vertical yellow (4) line
    result: Column index `yellow_col`
  - action: Find
    target: Single gray (5) pixel
    condition: Must be right of `yellow_col`
    result: Coordinates (`gray_row`, `gray_col`)
  - action: Determine Output Dimensions
    inputs:
      - Input grid height `H`
      - `yellow_col`
    outputs:
      - Output grid height `H`
      - Output grid width `W = yellow_col`
  - action: Create Grid
    properties:
      - height `H`
      - width `W`
      - initialized with white (0)
    result: Output grid
  - action: Copy Subgrid
    source: Input grid
    source_region: rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to `yellow_col - 1`
    destination: Output grid
    destination_region: rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to `W - 1`
  - action: Calculate Position
    inputs:
      - `gray_row`
      - `gray_col`
      - `yellow_col`
    calculation: `output_gray_col = gray_col - yellow_col - 1`
    result: `output_gray_col`
  - action: Place Pixel
    target: Output grid
    position: (`gray_row`, `output_gray_col`)
    value: Gray (5)

relationships:
  - The output grid's width is determined by the horizontal position (column index) of the yellow line in the input.
  - The objects left of the yellow line in the input maintain their relative positions and colors in the output.
  - The gray pixel's vertical position (row) is preserved from input to output.
  - The gray pixel's horizontal position (column) in the output is its horizontal distance from the yellow line in the input (specifically, `input_col - yellow_line_col - 1`).

assumptions:
  - There is always exactly one vertical yellow line.
  - There is always exactly one gray pixel, and it's always located to the right of the yellow line.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the column index (`yellow_col`) where the vertical yellow (color 4) line is located in the input grid.
2.  Identify the row and column indices (`gray_row`, `gray_col`) of the single gray (color 5) pixel in the input grid. (This pixel will be located in a column greater than `yellow_col`).
3.  Determine the dimensions for the output grid: the height will be the same as the input grid's height, and the width will be equal to `yellow_col`.
4.  Create a new grid of these dimensions, filled initially with the background color (white, 0).
5.  Copy the rectangular region of the input grid defined by all rows and columns from 0 up to (but not including) `yellow_col` into the corresponding top-left region of the new output grid.
6.  Calculate the target column for the gray pixel in the output grid using the formula: `output_gray_col = gray_col - yellow_col - 1`.
7.  Place the gray pixel (color 5) into the output grid at the coordinates (`gray_row`, `output_gray_col`).
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
