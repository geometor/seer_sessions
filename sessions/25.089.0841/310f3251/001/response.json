Create a modified grid, initially a copy of the input grid.\n    2. For each non-white pixel (color != 0) at position (r, c) in the input grid:\n       a. If c == 0, calculate the target position (tr, tc) = (r-1, W-1), where W is the width of the input grid.\n       b. If c > 0, calculate the target position (tr, tc) = (r-1, c-1).\n       c. If the target row `tr` is within the grid bounds (tr >= 0) AND the pixel at the target position (tr, tc) in the *original* input grid is white (0), then change the color of the pixel at (tr, tc) in the *modified* grid to red (2). Note: Multiple non-white pixels might target the same white pixel; the last one processed would determine the change if that were allowed, but since the target is always red (2), overlaps don't change the outcome.\n    3.
