    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    1. Create a modified grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
    2. For each non-white pixel (color != 0) at position (r, c) in the input grid:
       a. If c == 0, calculate the target position (tr, tc) = (r-1, W-1), where W is the width of the input grid.
       b. If c > 0, calculate the target position (tr, tc) = (r-1, c-1).
       c. If the target row `tr` is within the grid bounds (tr >= 0) AND the pixel at the target position (tr, tc) in the *original* input grid is white (0), then change the color of the pixel at (tr, tc) in the *modified* grid to red (2). Note: Multiple non-white pixels might target the same white pixel; the last one processed would determine the change if that were allowed, but since the target is always red (2), overlaps don't change the outcome.
    3. Create the final output grid by tiling the modified grid 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically (creating a 3x3 arrangement of the modified grid).
