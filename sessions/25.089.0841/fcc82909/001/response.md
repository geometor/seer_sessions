Identifies all 2x2 blocks composed entirely of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. 
For each identified 2x2 block, a corresponding 2x2 block filled with green (3) pixels is added to the output grid, positioned two rows directly below the original block. The original blocks and the rest of the grid remain unchanged.
