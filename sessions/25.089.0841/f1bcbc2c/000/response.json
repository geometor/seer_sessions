All other pixels retain their original color, unless they meet the specific conditions for changing to azure.\n    *   The change to azure (8) occurs in areas horizontally bounded by orange (7) pixels within the same row.\n    *   White (0) pixels are changed to azure (8) if there is an orange (7) pixel somewhere to their left and somewhere to their right in the same row.\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels have a stricter condition: they are changed to azure (8) only if their immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right) are both orange (7).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Iterate through each row `r` of the grid.\n    3.  For each row `r`, find the column indices of all orange (7) pixels. Let these be `orange_cols`.\n    4.  Iterate through each column `c` in the current row `r`.\n    5.  Get the color of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.\n    6.  **If the input pixel color is white (0):**\n        a.  Check if there exists an orange column index `c_left` in `orange_cols` such that `c_left < c`.\n        b.  Check if there exists an orange column index `c_right` in `orange_cols` such that `c_right > c`.\n        c.  If both checks (a and b) are true, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).\n    7.  **If the input pixel color is maroon (9):**\n        a.  Check if the pixel to the immediate left, `(r, c-1)`, exists and its color in the input grid is orange (7).\n        b.  Check if the pixel to the immediate right, `(r, c+1)`, exists and its color in the input grid is orange (7).\n        c.  If both checks (a and b) are true, change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).\n    8.  If neither of the above conditions (steps 6 or 7) caused a change, the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid.\n    9.
