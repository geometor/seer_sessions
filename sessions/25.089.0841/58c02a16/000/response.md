*   **Perception:** Each input grid contains a distinct pattern located in the top-left corner, surrounded by a background color (predominantly orange, color 7). The remaining area of the input grid is filled with this background color. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid but is entirely filled by repeating (tiling) the pattern found in the top-left corner of the input. The key is to identify the extent of this pattern and then use it to fill the output grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    background_color:
      description: The color that fills most of the input grid, typically surrounding a core pattern. It appears to be the most frequent color in the grid. In the examples, this is orange (7).
      value: 7 (based on examples)
    pattern:
      description: A rectangular subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid. It contains all the non-background colors.
      properties:
        location: Top-left corner (origin 0,0) of the input grid.
        content: Contains a mix of colors, including those different from the background color.
        extent: Defined by the smallest bounding box containing all non-background colors, anchored at the top-left. Specifically, its height (pattern_h) is (max_row_index_of_non_background + 1) and its width (pattern_w) is (max_col_index_of_non_background + 1).
    input_grid:
      properties:
        dimensions: Height (H) and Width (W).
        content: Contains the pattern in the top-left and the background color elsewhere.
    output_grid:
      properties:
        dimensions: Same Height (H) and Width (W) as the input grid.
        content: Filled entirely by repeating the identified pattern.
      relationship_to_input: The output grid is generated by tiling the pattern extracted from the input grid.
    transformation:
      action: Tiling
      input_object: Pattern extracted from the input grid.
      output_object: The entire output grid.
      rule: The color of a cell at position (r, c) in the output grid is determined by the color of the cell at position (r % pattern_h, c % pattern_w) in the pattern.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.
    3.  Find the maximum row index (`max_r`) and maximum column index (`max_c`) of any cell in the input grid that does not contain the background color. If all cells contain the background color, treat the top-left cell as a 1x1 pattern (`max_r=0`, `max_c=0`).
    4.  Define the pattern height `pattern_h = max_r + 1` and pattern width `pattern_w = max_c + 1`.
    5.  Extract the pattern, which is the subgrid from the input grid spanning rows 0 to `max_r` and columns 0 to `max_c`.
    6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W) as the input grid.
    7.  For each cell in the output grid at row `r` (from 0 to H-1) and column `c` (from 0 to W-1), set its color to be the same as the color in the pattern at row `r % pattern_h` and column `c % pattern_w`.
    8.  Return the generated output grid.
