The remaining area of the input grid is filled with this background color. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid but is entirely filled by repeating (tiling) the pattern found in the top-left corner of the input. The key is to identify the extent of this pattern and then use it to fill the output grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Find the maximum row index (`max_r`) and maximum column index (`max_c`) of any cell in the input grid that does not contain the background color.
