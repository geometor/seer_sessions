The transformation logic centers around the interaction between three specific colors: white (0), gray (5), and orange (7). The core rule depends on whether a pixel has *both* a gray neighbor and an orange neighbor within its 3x3 Moore neighborhood (including diagonals). The pixel's own color determines the outcome of the transformation when this neighborhood condition is met. Other colors and pixels not meeting the neighborhood condition remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
