task_description: Transforms a grid by changing the background color and filling 'marker' colored areas within shapes with the shape's primary color.

grid_properties:
  - size: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: Input background is white (0). Output background is green (3).

objects:
  - id: background
    description: The area of the grid with the background color (white 0 in input).
    properties:
      - color: white (0) in input, green (3) in output.
  - id: composite_shape
    description: A single contiguous or non-contiguous shape composed of two non-background colors.
    properties:
      - colors: Always includes red (2) and one other 'primary' color (e.g., orange, magenta, azure, yellow).
    components:
      - id: marker_part
        description: The portion of the composite shape colored red (2).
        properties:
          - color: red (2) in input.
      - id: primary_part
        description: The portion of the composite shape with the non-red color.
        properties:
          - color: Varies per example (e.g., orange 7, magenta 6, azure 8, yellow 4) - referred to as 'primary_color'.

actions:
  - name: change_background
    input: background pixels (white 0)
    output: green (3) pixels
  - name: identify_colors
    input: input grid
    output: Identification of the background color (0), the marker color (2), and the primary color (the other non-zero color).
  - name: fill_marker_area
    input: pixels with marker color (red 2)
    output: pixels changed to the identified primary color for that grid.
    condition: This action applies to all red (2) pixels.

relationships:
  - type: color_correspondence
    description: Red (2) pixels in the input become the 'primary_color' in the output. The 'primary_color' pixels remain the same. White (0) pixels become green (3).
  - type: object_structure
    description: The red (2) and primary color pixels form a combined shape in the input. The transformation modifies the color composition of this shape.
