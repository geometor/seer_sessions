            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples). The transformation primarily affects the colors of the pixels.\n\n1.  **Background Transformation**: The background color, consistently white (0) in the inputs, is uniformly changed to green (3) in the outputs.\n2.  **Object Identification**: Each input grid contains a single composite object made of two distinct non-background colors. One of these colors is always red (2). The other color varies across examples (orange (7), magenta (6), azure (8), yellow (4)). Let's call the non-red color the \"primary\" color.\n3.  **Color Replacement**: The core transformation happens within the composite object. The pixels originally colored red (2) are replaced with the primary color identified in that specific input grid. The pixels that were originally the primary color remain unchanged.\n4.  **Shape Preservation/Modification**: The overall shape occupied by the non-background colors is preserved, but the internal color distribution changes. Effectively, the primary color \"fills\" the areas previously occupied by the red color within the same composite object. The red color acts like a marker indicating areas to be filled by the adjacent primary color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
