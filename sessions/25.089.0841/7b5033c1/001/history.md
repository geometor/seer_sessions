*   **Perception:** The input is a 2D grid containing a background color and several distinct "objects" made of contiguous pixels of other colors. The output is a 1D column vector. The colors in the output correspond to the colors of the objects in the input, excluding the background color. The number of times each color appears in the output matches the total number of pixels making up the objects of that color in the input. The order of colors in the output depends on the order in which the objects are encountered when scanning the input grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    background_color:
      description: The color that fills most of the grid and surrounds the objects. It can be identified as the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0).
      example_1: azure (8)
      example_2: blue (1)
    objects:
      description: Contiguous blocks of pixels having the same color, which is different from the background color.
      properties:
        - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
        - pixel_count: The number of pixels in the object.
        - start_coordinate: The coordinate (row, column) of the top-most, left-most pixel belonging to the object.
      example_1:
        - color: blue (1), pixel_count: 5, start_coordinate: (1, 6)
        - color: green (3), pixel_count: 4, start_coordinate: (5, 5)
        - color: red (2), pixel_count: 5, start_coordinate: (7, 7)
        - color: yellow (4), pixel_count: 5, start_coordinate: (10, 6)
        - color: magenta (6), pixel_count: 3, start_coordinate: (12, 6)
      example_2:
        - color: azure (8), pixel_count: 7, start_coordinate: (1, 1)
        - color: red (2), pixel_count: 8, start_coordinate: (5, 4)
        - color: green (3), pixel_count: 9, start_coordinate: (10, 7)
    transformation:
      action: Identify and extract object pixels.
      input: 2D grid.
      output: 1D column grid.
      steps:
        - Determine the background color (color at grid[0,0]).
        - Find all distinct objects (contiguous non-background pixels).
        - For each object, record its color, pixel count, and starting coordinate (top-most, left-most pixel).
        - Sort the objects based on their starting coordinates (first by row, then by column).
        - Create a 1D list by concatenating lists for each sorted object, where each list contains the object's color repeated 'pixel_count' times.
        - Reshape the 1D list into a column vector (Nx1 grid).
    output_grid:
      description: A column vector (Nx1 grid) where N is the total number of non-background pixels in the input grid.
      content: Contains the colors of the input objects, ordered according to the object sort order, with each color repeated according to the object's pixel count.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color by taking the color of the pixel in the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right.
    3.  Keep track of visited pixels to avoid processing parts of the same object multiple times.
    4.  When an unvisited pixel is found whose color is different from the background color, identify the complete contiguous object it belongs to (all connected pixels of the same color). Mark all pixels of this object as visited.
    5.  Record the object's color, the total count of pixels belonging to the object, and the coordinates (row, column) of its top-most, left-most pixel (this defines the object's starting point). Store this information for all found objects.
    6.  Sort the identified objects based on their starting point coordinates, primarily by row index (ascending) and secondarily by column index (ascending).
    7.  Initialize an empty list for the output pixels.
    8.  Iterate through the sorted objects. For each object, append its color to the output list, repeating the color as many times as its pixel count.
    9.  Construct the final output grid as a single column (Nx1 grid) containing the sequence of pixels from the generated list.
