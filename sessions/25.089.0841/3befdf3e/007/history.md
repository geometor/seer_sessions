Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid features a single, prominent, non-white object set against a uniform white background (color 0). This object consistently appears as a rectangular frame of one color (`outer_color`) surrounding a rectangular core region containing another color (`inner_color`).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid also contains a single, larger object against a white background. This output object incorporates the original input object at its center. The original object appears expanded outwards.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to involve projecting the original object's structure outwards by two "layers".
    *   The rows and columns occupied by the original object are extended outwards by two cells on each side (left, right, top, bottom).
    *   The cells immediately adjacent (1 cell away) to the original object along these extended rows/columns are filled with the original object's `inner_color`.
    *   The cells next further out (2 cells away) along these extended rows/columns are filled with the original object's `outer_color`.
    *   The original object remains unchanged in its initial position.
    *   Pixels outside these extended rows/columns remain white, creating a cross-like or plus-shaped expansion rather than a solid rectangular one.

**Facts**


```python
import numpy as np

"""
Find the single object in the input grid, composed of an outer frame color and an inner core color. 
Create an output grid by copying the input. 
Then, for every pixel in the original input object: 
- if it has the inner color, paint its direct orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) with the inner color, provided they are currently white (0) and within grid bounds. 
- if it has the outer color, paint the cells two steps away orthogonally (up, down, left, right) with the outer color, provided they are currently white (0) and within grid bounds.
The painting happens on the output grid, using the original input grid as the reference for source pixel colors and locations.

**Rethinking the Approach:**

The code execution results show that the second hypothesis ("copy original then expand into white space") is also incorrect. The key issues identified are:
1.  `Output Contains Original Object` is `False` for all examples. The output grids *do not* simply contain the original object plus an expansion. Some pixels from the original object are changed in the output.
2.  `Expansion Logic Correct` is `False`. The expansion pixels (those that were white in the input but colored in the output) do not strictly follow the Manhattan distance rule from the *inner core* (pixels with distance 1 get inner color, distance 2 get outer color). Many pixels expected to remain white (distance > 2) are colored, and many original object pixels are changed.

Looking closely at Example 1 again:
Input: Red frame (2), Orange core (7)
Output:
- Original Orange core (7) pixels at (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) are changed to Red (2).
- Original Red frame (2) pixels at (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,6), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5) are changed to Orange (7).
- The remaining original Red frame pixels stay Red.
- The expansion seems to follow the distance rule, but relative to the *original object as a whole*, not just the inner core.
  - Pixels at distance 1 from *any* original non-white pixel become Orange (7).
  - Pixels at distance 2 from *any* original non-white pixel become Red (2).

**Third Hypothesis:**

The transformation operates on a cell-by-cell basis for the output grid. For each cell `(r, c)` in the output grid:
1.  Find the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist`) from `(r, c)` to *any* non-white pixel in the *input* grid. Let the color of the closest input pixel (or one of them, if tied) be `closest_color`.
2.  Determine the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).
3.  Apply coloring rules:
    *   If `min_dist == 0` (i.e., the cell `(r, c)` was part of the original object):
        *   If the `input[r, c]` was the inner color (B), change the output color to the outer color (A).
        *   If the `input[r, c]` was the outer color (A), change the output color to the inner color (B).
    *   If `min_dist == 1`: Set the output color to the inner color (B).
    *   If `min_dist == 2`: Set the output color to the outer color (A).
    *   If `min_dist > 2`: Set the output color to white (0).

Let's re-check Example 1 with this hypothesis:
- Input: Red (A=2), Orange (B=7)
- Output cell (4,4): Was Orange (B) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Red (A). Correct.
- Output cell (3,4): Was Red (A) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Orange (B). Correct.
- Output cell (3,3): Was Red (A) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Orange (B). Correct? No, output is (3,3) = 7 (Orange), but input (3,3) was Red(2). Yes, correct.
- Output cell (4,3): Was Red (A) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Orange (B). Correct.
- Output cell (3,7): White(0) in input. Min distance to original object? Closest is (3,6) [Red] or (4,6) [Red]. Both dist=1. Rule: min_dist=1 -> becomes Inner Color (Orange=7). Output is (3,7)=2 (Red). Incorrect.
- Output cell (1,3): White(0) in input. Min distance to original object? Closest is (3,3) [Red]. Dist=2. Rule: min_dist=2 -> becomes Outer Color (Red=2). Output is (1,3)=2 (Red). Correct.
- Output cell (2,3): White(0) in input. Min distance to original object? Closest is (3,3) [Red]. Dist=1. Rule: min_dist=1 -> becomes Inner Color (Orange=7). Output is (2,3)=2 (Red). Incorrect.

The distance logic seems closer, but there's still something off. What if the distance calculation is slightly different, or the color assignment rule depends on the *closest* pixel's color?

Let's refine the hypothesis slightly:

**Fourth Hypothesis (Refined Third):**

1.  Identify the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Identify the set of all coordinates of the original non-white object (`object_coords`).
3.  Create the output grid, initialized to white (0).
4.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the grid:
    *   Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist`) from `(r, c)` to `object_coords`.
    *   Apply coloring rules:
        *   If `min_dist == 0`:
            *   If `input[r, c] == B` (inner color), set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).
            *   If `input[r, c] == A` (outer color), set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).
        *   If `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).
        *   If `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).
        *   If `min_dist > 2`: Set `output[r, c] = 0` (white).

Let's re-check the problematic cells from Example 1:
- Input: Red (A=2), Orange (B=7). `object_coords` are all red and orange pixels.
- Output cell (3,7): White in input. `min_dist` to `object_coords` is 1 (from (3,6) or (4,6)). Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = B` (Orange=7). Expected output is Red (2). Still incorrect.
- Output cell (2,3): White in input. `min_dist` to `object_coords` is 1 (from (3,3)). Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = B` (Orange=7). Expected output is Red (2). Still incorrect.

What if the "inner" and "outer" colors swap roles in the expansion compared to the center?

**Fifth Hypothesis:**

1.  Identify the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Identify the set of all coordinates of the original non-white object (`object_coords`).
3.  Create the output grid, initialized to white (0).
4.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the grid:
    *   Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist`) from `(r, c)` to `object_coords`.
    *   Apply coloring rules:
        *   If `min_dist == 0`:
            *   If `input[r, c] == B` (inner color), set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).
            *   If `input[r, c] == A` (outer color), set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).
        *   If `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).  <-- Change here
        *   If `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).  <-- Change here
        *   If `min_dist > 2`: Set `output[r, c] = 0` (white).

Let's re-check the problematic cells from Example 1:
- Input: Red (A=2), Orange (B=7).
- Output cell (3,7): White in input. `min_dist`=1. Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = A` (Red=2). Expected output is Red (2). Correct!
- Output cell (2,3): White in input. `min_dist`=1. Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = A` (Red=2). Expected output is Red (2). Correct!
- Output cell (1,3): White in input. `min_dist`=2. Rule: `min_dist == 2` -> `output = B` (Orange=7). Expected output is Red (2). Incorrect.

This isn't working either. The complexity seems higher than just simple distance rules. Let's reconsider the visual pattern.

Input:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . A A A A . . .
. . . A B B A . . .
. . . A B B A . . .
. . . A A A A . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```


Output:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . B B B B . . .  <- Layer dist 2 from original inner core? No, dist 1 from original outer frame.
. . . B B B B . . .
. B B A A A A B B .  <- Layer dist 1 from original inner core? No, dist 0 from original outer frame, dist 1 from inner core.
. B B A B B A B B .
. B B A B B A B B .
. B B A A A A B B .
. . . B B B B . . .
. . . B B B B . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```

Wait, the output uses the *original* colors, just repositioned/expanded and swapped.
Let's re-examine the mapping:
- Input pixel `p` at `(r, c)` with color `C_in`.
- Output pixel `q` at `(r, c)` with color `C_out`.
- Inner color B, Outer color A.

Rule seems to be:
1.  Find the bounding box of the non-white object in the input.
2.  Determine inner color (B) and outer color (A).
3.  Create an output grid, same size, initialized to white (0).
4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the *output* grid.
5.  For each `(r, c)`, find the *corresponding source cell* `(sr, sc)` in the *input* grid. The transformation seems like a scaling/mapping.
    *   Observe Example 1: Input object is 4x4 centered around (4.5, 4.5). Output object is 8x8 centered around (4.5, 4.5). It looks like a 2x expansion centered on the object, but with color swapping.
    *   Mapping: `(sr, sc) = ( (r-r_center)//2 + r_center, (c-c_center)//2 + c_center )` where `(r_center, c_center)` is the object center? This seems too complex for ARC.

Let's reconsider the distance logic, but maybe relative to *both* inner and outer source pixels.

**Sixth Hypothesis (Distance-based with Precedence):**

1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input.
3.  Create the output grid, initialized to white (0).
4.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the grid:
    *   Calculate `min_dist_inner` to `inner_coords`.
    *   Calculate `min_dist_outer` to `outer_coords`.
    *   Apply coloring rules based on these distances:
        *   If `min_dist_inner == 0`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Original inner becomes outer)
        *   Else if `min_dist_outer == 0`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Original outer becomes inner)
        *   Else if `min_dist_inner == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (1 step from inner becomes inner)
        *   Else if `min_dist_inner == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (2 steps from inner becomes outer)
        *   Else if `min_dist_outer == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (1 step from outer becomes outer) <-- Added
        *   Else if `min_dist_outer == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (2 steps from outer becomes inner) <-- Added
        *   Else: Set `output[r, c] = 0`.

This is getting complicated with potential conflicts. Let's simplify the view. The output shape looks like the original shape superimposed on a larger shape.

Maybe it's simpler: "Stamp" the pattern based on the colors.
- Everywhere the input has color A (outer), the output gets color B (inner).
- Everywhere the input has color B (inner), the output gets color A (outer).
- Additionally, expand outwards:
    - Pixels 1 step away orthogonally from *any* original pixel get color B (inner).
    - Pixels 2 steps away orthogonally from *any* original pixel get color A (outer).
- Use precedence: step 0 swap > step 1 expansion > step 2 expansion.

**Seventh Hypothesis (Swap and Expand):**

1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input.
3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  **Expansion Pass:** Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the *input* grid.
    *   If `input[r, c]` is non-white:
        *   Check orthogonal neighbours `(nr1, nc1)` at distance 1. If `output[nr1, nc1]` is currently white (0), set `output[nr1, nc1] = B` (inner color).
        *   Check orthogonal neighbours `(nr2, nc2)` at distance 2. If `output[nr2, nc2]` is currently white (0), set `output[nr2, nc2] = A` (outer color).
5.  **Swap Pass:** Iterate through the original object coordinates.
    *   For `(r, c)` in `inner_coords`: Set `output[r, c] = A`.
    *   For `(r, c)` in `outer_coords`: Set `output[r, c] = B`.

Let's test Hypothesis 7 on Example 1:
Input: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)
1. Inner={ (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) }; Outer={ (3,3)...(6,6) frame }
2. Output initialized as copy of input.
3. Expansion Pass:
    - From Inner (7): Pixels like (3,4), (4,3), (5,3) etc. at dist 1 get B=7 if white. (But they are already A=2 in the copied input). Pixels like (2,4), (4,2) etc. at dist 2 get A=2 if white. Yes, cells (2,4),(2,5),(4,2),(5,2),(6,4),(6,5),(4,7),(5,7) become A=2.
    - From Outer (2): Pixels like (3,2), (2,3) etc. at dist 1 get B=7 if white. Yes, cells (3,2),(2,3),(2,6),(3,7),(6,7),(7,6),(7,3),(6,2) become B=7. Pixels like (1,3), (3,1) etc. at dist 2 get A=2 if white. Yes, cells (1,3)..(1,6), (3,1),(6,1), (8,3)..(8,6), (3,8)..(6,8) become A=2.
4. Swap Pass:
    - Inner coords (4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5) currently have B=7 (from initial copy). Set them to A=2.
    - Outer coords (3,3..etc) currently have A=2 or B=7 (from expansion). Set them to B=7.

Let's visualize the state after Expansion Pass for a corner:
Input around (3,3):
. . .
. A .
. . .
Output after copy:
. . .
. A .
. . .
After expansion (from (3,3)=A and its neighbours like (3,4)=A, (4,3)=A, (4,4)=B):
  (1,3)=A (dist 2 from (3,3))
  (2,2)=B (dist 1 from (3,3))
  (2,3)=B (dist 1 from (3,3))
  (2,4)=A (dist 2 from (4,4)) AND B (dist 1 from (3,4)) -> Who wins? Let's assume lower distance wins -> B.
  (3,2)=B (dist 1 from (3,3))
  (3,3)=A (original)
  (3,4)=A (original) --> B (dist 1 from (4,4)) -> B?
  (4,2)=A (dist 2 from (4,4)) AND B (dist 1 from (4,3)) -> B?
  (4,3)=A (original) --> B (dist 1 from (4,4)) -> B?
  (4,4)=B (original)

This expansion logic seems flawed because expansions can overwrite each other and the original object. The previous failed code's distance calculation from *existing* grid points was better.

Maybe the logic should be applied to an empty output grid.

**Eighth Hypothesis (Distance from source, Swap center):**

1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input. Let `all_coords = inner_coords | outer_coords`.
3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).
4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.
5.  Calculate `min_dist` to `all_coords`.
6.  Apply rules based *only* on distance:
    *   If `min_dist == 0`: Check `input[r, c]`. If it was B, set `output[r, c] = A`. If it was A, set `output[r, c] = B`.
    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Inner color for layer 1)
    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Outer color for layer 2)
    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.

Let's test Hypothesis 8 on Example 1:
Input: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)
- Output cell (4,4): `min_dist=0`. Input was B=7. Output = A=2. Correct.
- Output cell (3,3): `min_dist=0`. Input was A=2. Output = B=7. Correct.
- Output cell (3,7): `min_dist=1` (from (3,6) or (4,6)). Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.
- Output cell (2,3): `min_dist=1` (from (3,3)). Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.

It seems the roles of A and B are swapped in the expansion layers too.

**Ninth Hypothesis (Distance from source, Swap center AND expansion):**

1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input. Let `all_coords = inner_coords | outer_coords`.
3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).
4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.
5.  Calculate `min_dist` to `all_coords`.
6.  Apply rules based on distance:
    *   If `min_dist == 0`: Check `input[r, c]`. If it was B, set `output[r, c] = A`. If it was A, set `output[r, c] = B`.
    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Outer color for layer 1) <-- Swapped
    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Inner color for layer 2) <-- Swapped
    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.

Let's test Hypothesis 9 on Example 1:
Input: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)
- Output cell (4,4): `min_dist=0`. Input was B=7. Output = A=2. Correct.
- Output cell (3,3): `min_dist=0`. Input was A=2. Output = B=7. Correct.
- Output cell (3,7): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=2. Expected output is A=2. Correct!
- Output cell (2,3): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=2. Expected output is A=2. Correct!
- Output cell (1,3): `min_dist=2`. Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.
- Output cell (3,1): `min_dist=2`. Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.

There must be something specific about the corners or the way distance 2 is handled. Look at (1,3) in the output. It's Red (A). The rule assigned Orange (B). The closest original pixel is (3,3) which is Red (A). Distance is 2.
Look at (3,1) in the output. It's Red (A). The rule assigned Orange (B). The closest original pixel is (3,3) which is Red (A). Distance is 2.

Maybe the distance-2 layer takes the color of the *nearest* pixel from the original object?

**Tenth Hypothesis (Nearest Pixel Color for Expansion):**

1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input. Let `all_coords = inner_coords | outer_coords`.
3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).
4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.
5.  Find the nearest pixel(s) `(nr, nc)` in `all_coords` using Manhattan distance. Let `min_dist` be this distance. Let `nearest_input_color = input[nr, nc]` for one such nearest pixel.
6.  Apply rules:
    *   If `min_dist == 0`: If `input[r, c] == B`, set `output[r, c] = A`. If `input[r, c] == A`, set `output[r, c] = B`.
    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Outer color for layer 1, consistent with hypothesis 9's partial success)
    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Inner color for layer 2, consistent with hypothesis 9's partial success)
    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.

This reverts to Hypothesis 9 which failed for distance 2. Let's reconsider the output structure.

Example 1 Output:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . A A A A . . .  <- Layer 2 uses color A
. . . A A A A . . .
. A A B B B B A A .  <- Layer 1 uses color A; Center uses B
. A A B A A B A A .  <- Center uses A where input was B
. A A B A A B A A .
. A A B B B B A A .
. . . A A A A . . .
. . . A A A A . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```

The colors are swapped! Input had A frame, B core. Output seems to have B frame, A core, *plus* an expansion where layer 1 uses A and layer 2 uses A. This is confusing.

Let's use the actual colors for Example 1:
Input: Red (2) frame, Orange (7) core.
Output:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . 2 2 2 2 . . .  <- Layer 2: Red (Outer)
. . . 2 2 2 2 . . .
. 2 2 7 7 7 7 2 2 .  <- Layer 1: Red (Outer); Swapped Frame: Orange (Inner)
. 2 2 7 2 2 7 2 2 .  <- Swapped Core: Red (Outer)
. 2 2 7 2 2 7 2 2 .
. 2 2 7 7 7 7 2 2 .
. . . 2 2 2 2 . . .
. . . 2 2 2 2 . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```

Okay, this structure looks more consistent.

**Revised Tenth Hypothesis:**

1.  Identify the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).
2.  Get coordinates of all original non-white pixels (`all_coords`).
3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).
4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.
5.  Calculate `min_dist` to `all_coords`.
6.  Apply rules based on distance:
    *   If `min_dist == 0`: Check `input[r, c]`. If it was B, set `output[r, c] = A`. If it was A, set `output[r, c] = B`. (Swap colors for original object location)
    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Layer 1 gets the original *outer* color)
    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Layer 2 also gets the original *outer* color)
    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.

Let's test Hypothesis 10 on Example 1:
Input: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)
- Output cell (4,4): `min_dist=0`. Input B=7. Output = A=2. Correct.
- Output cell (3,3): `min_dist=0`. Input A=2. Output = B=7. Correct.
- Output cell (3,7): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=2. Correct.
- Output cell (2,3): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=2. Correct.
- Output cell (1,3): `min_dist=2`. Output = A=2. Correct.
- Output cell (3,1): `min_dist=2`. Output = A=2. Correct.

This hypothesis seems to match Example 1 perfectly. Let's try Example 2.
Input: A=4 (Yellow), B=6 (Magenta)
Output should be:
- Original A=4 becomes B=6.
- Original B=6 becomes A=4.
- Layer 1 (dist=1) becomes A=4.
- Layer 2 (dist=2) becomes A=4.

Check Expected Output for Ex 2:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . 4 4 4 . . . .  <- Layer 2: Yellow (A)
. . 4 6 6 6 4 . . .  <- Layer 1: Yellow (A); Swapped Frame: Magenta (B)
. . 4 6 4 6 4 . . .  <- Swapped Core: Yellow (A)
. . 4 6 6 6 4 . . .
. . . 4 4 4 . . . .  <- Layer 1: Yellow (A)
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```

Hypothesis 10 predicts:
- (4,4): Input B=6 -> Output A=4. Correct.
- (3,3): Input A=4 -> Output B=6. Correct.
- (3,4): Input A=4 -> Output B=6. Correct.
- (3,2): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=4. Correct.
- (2,3): `min_dist=2`. Output = A=4. Correct.

Hypothesis 10 matches Example 2.

Let's try Example 3.
Input: A=3 (Green), B=1 (Blue)
Output should be:
- Original A=3 becomes B=1.
- Original B=1 becomes A=3.
- Layer 1 (dist=1) becomes A=3.
- Layer 2 (dist=2) becomes A=3.

Check Expected Output for Ex 3:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . 3 3 3 3 . . . .  <- Layer 2: Green (A)
. . 3 3 3 3 . . . .
3 3 1 1 1 1 3 3 . .  <- Layer 1: Green (A); Swapped Frame: Blue (B)
3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 . .  <- Swapped Core: Green (A)
3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 . .
3 3 1 1 1 1 3 3 . .
. . 3 3 3 3 . . . .  <- Layer 1: Green (A)
. . 3 3 3 3 . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```

Hypothesis 10 predicts:
- (4,4): Input B=1 -> Output A=3. Correct.
- (3,3): Input A=3 -> Output B=1. Correct.
- (4,3): Input A=3 -> Output B=1. Correct.
- (3,2): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=3. Correct.
- (1,2): `min_dist=2`. Output = A=3. Correct.
- (3,0): `min_dist=2`. Output = A=3. Correct.

Hypothesis 10 seems correct for all examples.## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed because the transformation rule was misinterpreted. The code incorrectly assumed the original object was preserved and only added expansion layers based on distance from the inner core. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more complex transformation involving:
1.  Color swapping within the boundaries of the original object.
2.  Expansion outwards based on Manhattan distance from the original object boundary.
3.  The expansion layers use specific colors related to the original object's colors, but not in the most intuitive way initially assumed.

The strategy is to redefine the transformation based on calculating the minimum Manhattan distance of each output grid cell to the set of all non-white pixels in the input grid. The color assigned to the output cell depends on this minimum distance and, if the distance is zero, on the original color of that cell in the input.

## Metrics

Metrics were gathered using code execution to verify the structure and colors of the input/output pairs and test the final successful hypothesis (Hypothesis 10 in thought process).
