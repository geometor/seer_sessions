            "text": "**Rethinking the Approach:**\n\nThe code execution results show that the second hypothesis (\"copy original then expand into white space\") is also incorrect. The key issues identified are:\n1.  `Output Contains Original Object` is `False` for all examples. The output grids *do not* simply contain the original object plus an expansion. Some pixels from the original object are changed in the output.\n2.  `Expansion Logic Correct` is `False`. The expansion pixels (those that were white in the input but colored in the output) do not strictly follow the Manhattan distance rule from the *inner core* (pixels with distance 1 get inner color, distance 2 get outer color). Many pixels expected to remain white (distance > 2) are colored, and many original object pixels are changed.\n\nLooking closely at Example 1 again:\nInput: Red frame (2), Orange core (7)\nOutput:\n- Original Orange core (7) pixels at (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) are changed to Red (2).\n- Original Red frame (2) pixels at (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,6), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5) are changed to Orange (7).\n- The remaining original Red frame pixels stay Red.\n- The expansion seems to follow the distance rule, but relative to the *original object as a whole*, not just the inner core.\n  - Pixels at distance 1 from *any* original non-white pixel become Orange (7).\n  - Pixels at distance 2 from *any* original non-white pixel become Red (2).\n\n**Third Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation operates on a cell-by-cell basis for the output grid. For each cell `(r, c)` in the output grid:\n1.  Find the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist`) from `(r, c)` to *any* non-white pixel in the *input* grid. Let the color of the closest input pixel (or one of them, if tied) be `closest_color`.\n2.  Determine the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n3.  Apply coloring rules:\n    *   If `min_dist == 0` (i.e., the cell `(r, c)` was part of the original object):\n        *   If the `input[r, c]` was the inner color (B), change the output color to the outer color (A).\n        *   If the `input[r, c]` was the outer color (A), change the output color to the inner color (B).\n    *   If `min_dist == 1`: Set the output color to the inner color (B).\n    *   If `min_dist == 2`: Set the output color to the outer color (A).\n    *   If `min_dist > 2`: Set the output color to white (0).\n\nLet's re-check Example 1 with this hypothesis:\n- Input: Red (A=2), Orange (B=7)\n- Output cell (4,4): Was Orange (B) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Red (A). Correct.\n- Output cell (3,4): Was Red (A) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Orange (B). Correct.\n- Output cell (3,3): Was Red (A) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Orange (B). Correct? No, output is (3,3) = 7 (Orange), but input (3,3) was Red(2). Yes, correct.\n- Output cell (4,3): Was Red (A) -> min_dist=0 -> becomes Orange (B). Correct.\n- Output cell (3,7): White(0) in input. Min distance to original object? Closest is (3,6) [Red] or (4,6) [Red]. Both dist=1. Rule: min_dist=1 -> becomes Inner Color (Orange=7). Output is (3,7)=2 (Red). Incorrect.\n- Output cell (1,3): White(0) in input. Min distance to original object? Closest is (3,3) [Red]. Dist=2. Rule: min_dist=2 -> becomes Outer Color (Red=2). Output is (1,3)=2 (Red). Correct.\n- Output cell (2,3): White(0) in input. Min distance to original object? Closest is (3,3) [Red]. Dist=1. Rule: min_dist=1 -> becomes Inner Color (Orange=7). Output is (2,3)=2 (Red). Incorrect.\n\nThe distance logic seems closer, but there's still something off. What if the distance calculation is slightly different, or the color assignment rule depends on the *closest* pixel's color?\n\nLet's refine the hypothesis slightly:\n\n**Fourth Hypothesis (Refined Third):**\n\n1.  Identify the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Identify the set of all coordinates of the original non-white object (`object_coords`).\n3.  Create the output grid, initialized to white (0).\n4.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    *   Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist`) from `(r, c)` to `object_coords`.\n    *   Apply coloring rules:\n        *   If `min_dist == 0`:\n            *   If `input[r, c] == B` (inner color), set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).\n            *   If `input[r, c] == A` (outer color), set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).\n        *   If `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).\n        *   If `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).\n        *   If `min_dist > 2`: Set `output[r, c] = 0` (white).\n\nLet's re-check the problematic cells from Example 1:\n- Input: Red (A=2), Orange (B=7). `object_coords` are all red and orange pixels.\n- Output cell (3,7): White in input. `min_dist` to `object_coords` is 1 (from (3,6) or (4,6)). Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = B` (Orange=7). Expected output is Red (2). Still incorrect.\n- Output cell (2,3): White in input. `min_dist` to `object_coords` is 1 (from (3,3)). Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = B` (Orange=7). Expected output is Red (2). Still incorrect.\n\nWhat if the \"inner\" and \"outer\" colors swap roles in the expansion compared to the center?\n\n**Fifth Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  Identify the original object's inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Identify the set of all coordinates of the original non-white object (`object_coords`).\n3.  Create the output grid, initialized to white (0).\n4.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    *   Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist`) from `(r, c)` to `object_coords`.\n    *   Apply coloring rules:\n        *   If `min_dist == 0`:\n            *   If `input[r, c] == B` (inner color), set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).\n            *   If `input[r, c] == A` (outer color), set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).\n        *   If `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color).  <-- Change here\n        *   If `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).  <-- Change here\n        *   If `min_dist > 2`: Set `output[r, c] = 0` (white).\n\nLet's re-check the problematic cells from Example 1:\n- Input: Red (A=2), Orange (B=7).\n- Output cell (3,7): White in input. `min_dist`=1. Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = A` (Red=2). Expected output is Red (2). Correct!\n- Output cell (2,3): White in input. `min_dist`=1. Rule: `min_dist == 1` -> `output = A` (Red=2). Expected output is Red (2). Correct!\n- Output cell (1,3): White in input. `min_dist`=2. Rule: `min_dist == 2` -> `output = B` (Orange=7). Expected output is Red (2). Incorrect.\n\nThis isn't working either. The complexity seems higher than just simple distance rules. Let's reconsider the visual pattern.\n\nInput:\n"

Find the bounding box of the non-white object in the input.\n2.  Determine inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n3.  Create an output grid, same size, initialized to white (0).\n4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the *output* grid.\n5.  For each `(r, c)`, find the *corresponding source cell* `(sr, sc)` in the *input* grid. The transformation seems like a scaling/mapping.\n    *   Observe Example 1: Input object is 4x4 centered around (4.5, 4.5). Output object is 8x8 centered around (4.5, 4.5). It looks like a 2x expansion centered on the object, but with color swapping.\n    *   Mapping: `(sr, sc) = ( (r-r_center)//2 + r_center, (c-c_center)//2 + c_center )` where `(r_center, c_center)` is the object center? This seems too complex for ARC.\n\nLet's reconsider the distance logic, but maybe relative to *both* inner and outer source pixels.\n\n**Sixth Hypothesis (Distance-based with Precedence):**\n\n1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input.\n3.  Create the output grid, initialized to white (0).\n4.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    *   Calculate `min_dist_inner` to `inner_coords`.\n    *   Calculate `min_dist_outer` to `outer_coords`.\n    *   Apply coloring rules based on these distances:\n        *   If `min_dist_inner == 0`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Original inner becomes outer)\n        *   Else if `min_dist_outer == 0`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Original outer becomes inner)\n        *   Else if `min_dist_inner == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (1 step from inner becomes inner)\n        *   Else if `min_dist_inner == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (2 steps from inner becomes outer)\n        *   Else if `min_dist_outer == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (1 step from outer becomes outer) <-- Added\n        *   Else if `min_dist_outer == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (2 steps from outer becomes inner) <-- Added\n        *   Else: Set `output[r, c] = 0`.\n\nThis is getting complicated with potential conflicts. Let's simplify the view. The output shape looks like the original shape superimposed on a larger shape.\n\nMaybe it's simpler: \"Stamp\" the pattern based on the colors.\n- Everywhere the input has color A (outer), the output gets color B (inner).\n- Everywhere the input has color B (inner), the output gets color A (outer).\n- Additionally, expand outwards:\n    - Pixels 1 step away orthogonally from *any* original pixel get color B (inner).\n    - Pixels 2 steps away orthogonally from *any* original pixel get color A (outer).\n- Use precedence: step 0 swap > step 1 expansion > step 2 expansion.\n\n**Seventh Hypothesis (Swap and Expand):**\n\n1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input.\n3.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n4.  **Expansion Pass:** Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the *input* grid.\n    *   If `input[r, c]` is non-white:\n        *   Check orthogonal neighbours `(nr1, nc1)` at distance 1. If `output[nr1, nc1]` is currently white (0), set `output[nr1, nc1] = B` (inner color).\n        *   Check orthogonal neighbours `(nr2, nc2)` at distance 2. If `output[nr2, nc2]` is currently white (0), set `output[nr2, nc2] = A` (outer color).\n5.  **Swap Pass:** Iterate through the original object coordinates.\n    *   For `(r, c)` in `inner_coords`: Set `output[r, c] = A`.\n    *   For `(r, c)` in `outer_coords`: Set `output[r, c] = B`.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 7 on Example 1:\nInput: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)\n1. Inner={ (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) }; Outer={ (3,3)...(6,6) frame }\n2. Output initialized as copy of input.\n3. Expansion Pass:\n    - From Inner (7): Pixels like (3,4), (4,3), (5,3) etc. at dist 1 get B=7 if white. (But they are already A=2 in the copied input). Pixels like (2,4), (4,2) etc. at dist 2 get A=2 if white. Yes, cells (2,4),(2,5),(4,2),(5,2),(6,4),(6,5),(4,7),(5,7) become A=2.\n    - From Outer (2): Pixels like (3,2), (2,3) etc. at dist 1 get B=7 if white. Yes, cells (3,2),(2,3),(2,6),(3,7),(6,7),(7,6),(7,3),(6,2) become B=7. Pixels like (1,3), (3,1) etc. at dist 2 get A=2 if white. Yes, cells (1,3)..(1,6), (3,1),(6,1), (8,3)..(8,6), (3,8)..(6,8) become A=2.\n4. Swap Pass:\n    - Inner coords (4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5) currently have B=7 (from initial copy). Set them to A=2.\n    - Outer coords (3,3..etc) currently have A=2 or B=7 (from expansion). Set them to B=7.\n\nLet's visualize the state after Expansion Pass for a corner:\nInput around (3,3):\n. . .\n. A .\n. . .\nOutput after copy:\n. . .\n. A .\n. . .\nAfter expansion (from (3,3)=A and its neighbours like (3,4)=A, (4,3)=A, (4,4)=B):\n  (1,3)=A (dist 2 from (3,3))\n  (2,2)=B (dist 1 from (3,3))\n  (2,3)=B (dist 1 from (3,3))\n  (2,4)=A (dist 2 from (4,4)) AND B (dist 1 from (3,4)) -> Who wins? Let's assume lower distance wins -> B.\n  (3,2)=B (dist 1 from (3,3))\n  (3,3)=A (original)\n  (3,4)=A (original) --> B (dist 1 from (4,4)) -> B?\n  (4,2)=A (dist 2 from (4,4)) AND B (dist 1 from (4,3)) -> B?\n  (4,3)=A (original) --> B (dist 1 from (4,4)) -> B?\n  (4,4)=B (original)\n\nThis expansion logic seems flawed because expansions can overwrite each other and the original object. The previous failed code's distance calculation from *existing* grid points was better.\n\nMaybe the logic should be applied to an empty output grid.\n\n**Eighth Hypothesis (Distance from source, Swap center):**\n\n1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input. Let `all_coords = inner_coords | outer_coords`.\n3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).\n4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.\n5.  Calculate `min_dist` to `all_coords`.\n6.  Apply rules based *only* on distance:\n    *   If `min_dist == 0`: Check `input[r, c]`. If it was B, set `output[r, c] = A`. If it was A, set `output[r, c] = B`.\n    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Inner color for layer 1)\n    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Outer color for layer 2)\n    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 8 on Example 1:\nInput: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)\n- Output cell (4,4): `min_dist=0`. Input was B=7. Output = A=2. Correct.\n- Output cell (3,3): `min_dist=0`. Input was A=2. Output = B=7. Correct.\n- Output cell (3,7): `min_dist=1` (from (3,6) or (4,6)). Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.\n- Output cell (2,3): `min_dist=1` (from (3,3)). Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.\n\nIt seems the roles of A and B are swapped in the expansion layers too.\n\n**Ninth Hypothesis (Distance from source, Swap center AND expansion):**\n\n1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input. Let `all_coords = inner_coords | outer_coords`.\n3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).\n4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.\n5.  Calculate `min_dist` to `all_coords`.\n6.  Apply rules based on distance:\n    *   If `min_dist == 0`: Check `input[r, c]`. If it was B, set `output[r, c] = A`. If it was A, set `output[r, c] = B`.\n    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Outer color for layer 1) <-- Swapped\n    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Inner color for layer 2) <-- Swapped\n    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 9 on Example 1:\nInput: A=2 (Red), B=7 (Orange)\n- Output cell (4,4): `min_dist=0`. Input was B=7. Output = A=2. Correct.\n- Output cell (3,3): `min_dist=0`. Input was A=2. Output = B=7. Correct.\n- Output cell (3,7): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=2. Expected output is A=2. Correct!\n- Output cell (2,3): `min_dist=1`. Output = A=2. Expected output is A=2. Correct!\n- Output cell (1,3): `min_dist=2`. Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.\n- Output cell (3,1): `min_dist=2`. Output = B=7. Expected output is A=2. Incorrect.\n\nThere must be something specific about the corners or the way distance 2 is handled. Look at (1,3) in the output. It's Red (A). The rule assigned Orange (B). The closest original pixel is (3,3) which is Red (A). Distance is 2.\nLook at (3,1) in the output. It's Red (A). The rule assigned Orange (B). The closest original pixel is (3,3) which is Red (A). Distance is 2.\n\nMaybe the distance-2 layer takes the color of the *nearest* pixel from the original object?\n\n**Tenth Hypothesis (Nearest Pixel Color for Expansion):**\n\n1.  Identify inner color (B) and outer color (A).\n2.  Get coordinates of inner pixels (`inner_coords`) and outer pixels (`outer_coords`) from the input. Let `all_coords = inner_coords | outer_coords`.\n3.  Initialize the output grid to white (0).\n4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid.\n5.  Find the nearest pixel(s) `(nr, nc)` in `all_coords` using Manhattan distance. Let `min_dist` be this distance. Let `nearest_input_color = input[nr, nc]` for one such nearest pixel.\n6.  Apply rules:\n    *   If `min_dist == 0`: If `input[r, c] == B`, set `output[r, c] = A`. If `input[r, c] == A`, set `output[r, c] = B`.\n    *   Else if `min_dist == 1`: Set `output[r, c] = A`. (Outer color for layer 1, consistent with hypothesis 9's partial success)\n    *   Else if `min_dist == 2`: Set `output[r, c] = B`. (Inner color for layer 2, consistent with hypothesis 9's partial success)\n    *   Else: `output[r, c] = 0`.\n\nThis reverts to Hypothesis 9 which failed for distance 2. Let's reconsider the output structure.\n\nExample 1 Output:\n"

Correct.\n\nHypothesis 10 seems correct for all examples.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the transformation rule was misinterpreted. The code incorrectly assumed the original object was preserved and only added expansion layers based on distance from the inner core. The analysis of the failed examples reveals a more complex transformation involving:\n1.  Color swapping within the boundaries of the original object.\n2.  Expansion outwards based on Manhattan distance from the original object boundary.\n3.  The expansion layers use specific colors related to the original object's colors, but not in the most intuitive way initially assumed.\n\nThe strategy is to redefine the transformation based on calculating the minimum Manhattan distance of each output grid cell to the set of all non-white pixels in the input grid. The color assigned to the output cell depends on this minimum distance and, if the distance is zero, on the original color of that cell in the input.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics were gathered using code execution to verify the structure and colors of the input/output pairs and test the final successful hypothesis (Hypothesis 10 in thought process).\n\n"
