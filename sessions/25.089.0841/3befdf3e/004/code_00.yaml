- description: Input grid analysis
  facts:
    - Each input grid contains a single rectangular object against a white background (0).
    - The object consists of two non-white colors: an outer frame color (A) and an inner core color (B).
    - The object is always centered, although its exact position varies.
    - The shape of the inner core can vary (e.g., solid rectangle in ex 1 & 3, single pixel in ex 2).

- description: Output grid analysis
  facts:
    - Each output grid contains a single, larger object against a white background (0).
    - The output object uses the same two colors (A and B) as the input object.
    - The output object has a cross-like shape, centered around the position of the original input object.
    - The overall size of the output object is determined by expanding the original object's bounding box by 2 cells in each orthogonal direction (top, bottom, left, right).

- description: Transformation analysis
  facts:
    - The transformation expands the original object outwards.
    - The core concept appears related to Manhattan distance from the original object's pixels.
    - Pixels exactly 1 Manhattan distance away from *any* original inner color (B) pixel become color B in the output. This rule takes precedence and overwrites original outer frame pixels if necessary.
    - Pixels exactly 2 Manhattan distance away from *any* original inner color (B) pixel become color A (outer color) in the output, *provided* they are not distance 1 from an inner pixel.
    - Pixels that were originally part of the outer frame (color A) remain color A *unless* they are exactly 1 Manhattan distance away from an original inner color (B) pixel.
    - All other pixels remain white (0).
    - No pixels are deleted (changed from non-white to white).
