            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code, based on a simple distance calculation from *all* original object pixels, failed because it created filled diamond shapes instead of the observed cross shapes. The transformed outputs in the failed attempt had incorrect pixel placements compared to the expected outputs.\n\nThe key insight missed was that the expansion seems constrained to the rows and columns occupied by the original object. Furthermore, the analysis of the expected outputs reveals that parts of the *original outer frame* are overwritten by the *inner color* during the expansion. This contradicts the idea that the original object is simply copied and pixels are added around it.\n\nThe metrics calculated confirm several points:\n*   Shapes and colors remain consistent between input and output (aside from the expansion).\n*   The output bounding box is always larger than the input bounding box, expanded by 2 units in each direction (min_r-2, min_c-2, max_r+2, max_c+2).\n*   Crucially, `pixels_overwritten_count` is non-zero in all examples (16, 9, 16). This confirms that the transformation *does* change some pixels that were part of the original object. Specifically, it seems the original outer frame pixels that are 1 Manhattan distance away from the inner core pixels are changed to the inner color.\n*   `pixels_added_count` is also significant, representing the new pixels added outside the original object's bounding box.\n*   `pixels_deleted_count` is 0, meaning no non-white pixels become white.\n\n**Revised Strategy:** The second refined hypothesis seems most plausible. The transformation involves calculating distances, but the application rule needs refinement:\n\n1.  **Identify:** Find the input object's bounding box, inner color (B), and outer color (A).\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  **Iterate and Color:** Go through each cell (r, c) of the grid.\n    *   Find the minimum Manhattan distance `d` from (r, c) to any cell *originally containing the inner color (B)* in the input grid.\n    *   Find the minimum Manhattan distance `d_outer` from (r, c) to any cell *originally containing the outer color (A)* in the input grid. Note: `d` and `d_outer` might come from different source cells.\n    *   Apply coloring rules based on these distances:\n        *   If `d == 1`, set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).\n        *   Else if `d_outer == 0` (meaning the current cell (r, c) was originally part of the outer frame) AND `d > 1` (it's not adjacent to an inner cell), set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color). This preserves the parts of the outer frame not overwritten by the inner color expansion.\n        *   Else if `d == 2`, set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color). This creates the outer layer of the expansion cross.\n        *   Otherwise, leave `output[r, c] = 0` (white).\n\nThis revised strategy accounts for overwriting the outer frame pixels adjacent to the inner core and correctly places the expanded layers.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Determine which is the outer frame color (A) and which is the inner core color (B). Identify the coordinates of all pixels containing color A (`outer_coords`) and all pixels containing color B (`inner_coords`).\n2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n3.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the output grid.\n4.  For the current cell (r, c), calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist_inner`) to any coordinate in `inner_coords`.\n5.  Also, check if the coordinate (r, c) exists in the original `outer_coords`.\n6.  Apply the following rules in order of precedence to determine the color of the output cell (r, c):\n    a.  If `min_dist_inner` is 1, set the output cell color to B (inner color).\n    b.  Else if `min_dist_inner` is 2, set the output cell color to A (outer color).\n    c.  Else if the coordinate (r, c) was originally part of the outer frame (i.e., `(r, c)` is in `outer_coords`), set the output cell color to A (outer color).\n    d.  Otherwise, leave the output cell color as the initialized background color (white, 0).\n7.  Return the completed output grid.**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt failed because the transformation logic based purely on distance from *any* part of the object resulted in filled diamond/square expansions rather than the observed cross/plus shapes. The key errors were:\n1.  Incorrect shape generation (diamond vs. cross).\n2.  Incorrect handling of pixel overwrites: The analysis of the expected outputs shows that some pixels belonging to the original outer frame are overwritten by the inner color in the output. The previous code did not account for this.\n\nThe calculated metrics confirm the expansion pattern (+2 cells around the bounding box) and, critically, the presence of overwritten pixels (`pixels_overwritten_count` > 0). This overwrite happens specifically where the inner color expands into the original outer frame. No pixels are ever deleted (changed to white).\n\nThe revised strategy focuses on calculating distances specifically from the *inner core* pixels and the *outer frame* pixels separately and applying rules with precedence:\n1.  The expansion of the inner color (distance 1) takes highest priority and can overwrite original outer frame pixels.\n2.  The expansion creating the new outer layer (distance 2 from inner core) is applied next to empty cells.\n3.  Remaining original outer frame pixels (those not overwritten by step 1) are preserved.\n4.  This naturally restricts the expansion to the cross shape observed, as cells diagonal to the corners are further than distance 2 from the inner core and were not part of the original outer frame.\n\n**Metrics**\n"
