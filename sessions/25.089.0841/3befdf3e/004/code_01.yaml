- description: Grid Properties
  facts:
    - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Background color is white (0).

- description: Input Object Properties
  facts:
    - Contains a single, centered, rectangular object.
    - Object composed of exactly two non-white colors.
    - One color forms an outer frame (Color A).
    - The other color forms an inner core (Color B).
    - The inner core can be a single pixel (ex 2) or a filled rectangle (ex 1, 3).
    - Let 'inner_coords' be the set of (row, col) for pixels with Color B in the input.
    - Let 'outer_coords' be the set of (row, col) for pixels with Color A in the input.

- description: Output Object Properties
  facts:
    - Contains a single, centered object using only Color A and Color B.
    - The object has a cross-like shape (extends horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally from the corners).
    - The bounding box of the output object is expanded by 2 units in each direction (top, bottom, left, right) compared to the input object's bounding box.

- description: Transformation Rules
  facts:
    - The transformation generates the output based on proximity to the original inner core and outer frame pixels.
    - Rule 1 (Inner Expansion): Any pixel (output grid) that is exactly 1 Manhattan distance away from *any* coordinate in 'inner_coords' becomes Color B. This rule has the highest precedence.
    - Rule 2 (Outer Expansion): Any pixel (output grid) that is exactly 2 Manhattan distance away from *any* coordinate in 'inner_coords' becomes Color A, *unless* Rule 1 already applied to it.
    - Rule 3 (Frame Preservation): Any pixel (output grid) whose coordinate (r, c) is in the original 'outer_coords' becomes Color A, *unless* Rule 1 already applied to it.
    - Rule 4 (Background): All other pixels remain white (0).
    - Pixels originally having Color A can be overwritten to Color B if they satisfy Rule 1.
    - No non-white pixels are ever changed to white.
