            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the presence of a central object with an inner and outer color and an expansion mechanism. However, the code implementing this logic failed, producing outputs with missing colored pixels compared to the expected outputs. The transformed outputs consistently show white pixels (0) where the expected outputs have the inner color in the first expansion layer, and sometimes also show unexpected white pixels within the second expansion layer.\n\nThe core error seems to lie in how the expansion is applied. The previous logic attempted to paint pixels based *solely* on the color of the *source* pixel in the original input (inner paints 1 step away, outer paints 2 steps away). This doesn't capture the full structure of the output.\n\nThe correct approach appears to be treating the original object as a whole template. The transformation expands this template outwards in two distinct layers:\n1.  The layer immediately adjacent (orthogonally) to the original object should be filled with the `inner_color`.\n2.  The layer adjacent to that (two steps orthogonally from the original object) should be filled with the `outer_color`.\n3.  The original object remains in the center.\n4.  Only cells that are initially white (0) should be colored during the expansion.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program to reflect this layered expansion based on the whole object structure, rather than individual pixel colors. We will then update the code logic accordingly in the coder phase.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze the differences for each example.\n\n"

They might be the outer color or white (0).\n    *   Pixels that *should* be the outer color (2 in ex1, 4 in ex2, 3 in ex3) are sometimes incorrect, appearing as white (0) or the inner color.\n    *   There are also cases where pixels that should be white (0) were incorrectly colored (e.g., (0, 4) in ex2).\n\nThis confirms the previous assessment: the pixel-by-pixel expansion logic based only on the source pixel's color is flawed. The transformation needs to consider the overall shape and the relative positions to the original object boundary to correctly apply the inner and outer colors in the expanded layers.
