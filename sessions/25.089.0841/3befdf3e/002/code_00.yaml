task_description: Expands a central rectangular object outwards by two layers, using the object's inner and outer colors.
objects:
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    location: Fills the grid initially.
  - name: central_object
    description: A rectangular structure composed of two non-white colors.
    properties:
      shape: Rectangle (potentially hollow)
      colors: Contains exactly two non-white colors.
      structure:
        - outer_color: Forms the border frame of the rectangle.
        - inner_color: Fills the area inside the border frame.
      location: Centered within a region of the input grid, surrounded by the background color.
actions:
  - name: identify_object_properties
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs:
      - central_object location (bounding box)
      - outer_color value
      - inner_color value
  - name: expand_object
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - central_object location
      - outer_color
      - inner_color
    outputs: output_grid
    processing:
      1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      2. Iterate through all grid cells (r, c).
      3. For each cell, determine its minimum orthogonal distance (Manhattan distance) to any cell belonging to the original `central_object`.
      4. If the distance is 1 and the cell (r, c) is currently background (white, 0) in the output grid:
         - Change the color of cell (r, c) to `inner_color`.
      5. If the distance is 2 and the cell (r, c) is currently background (white, 0) in the output grid:
         - Change the color of cell (r, c) to `outer_color`.
      6. Cells with distance 0 (part of the original object) or distance > 2 remain unchanged from the initial copy.
constraints:
  - Input grid contains exactly one `central_object`.
  - `central_object` uses exactly two non-white colors.
  - The expansion only colors cells that were originally background (white).
