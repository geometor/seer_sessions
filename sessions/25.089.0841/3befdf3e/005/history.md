Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid features a single, prominent, non-white object set against a uniform white background (color 0). This object consistently appears as a rectangular frame of one color (`outer_color`) surrounding a rectangular core region containing another color (`inner_color`).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid also contains a single, larger object against a white background. This output object incorporates the original input object at its center. The original object appears expanded outwards.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to involve projecting the original object's structure outwards by two "layers".
    *   The rows and columns occupied by the original object are extended outwards by two cells on each side (left, right, top, bottom).
    *   The cells immediately adjacent (1 cell away) to the original object along these extended rows/columns are filled with the original object's `inner_color`.
    *   The cells next further out (2 cells away) along these extended rows/columns are filled with the original object's `outer_color`.
    *   The original object remains unchanged in its initial position.
    *   Pixels outside these extended rows/columns remain white, creating a cross-like or plus-shaped expansion rather than a solid rectangular one.

**Facts**


```python
import numpy as np

"""
Find the single object in the input grid, composed of an outer frame color and an inner core color. 
Create an output grid by copying the input. 
Then, for every pixel in the original input object: 
- if it has the inner color, paint its direct orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) with the inner color, provided they are currently white (0) and within grid bounds. 
- if it has the outer color, paint the cells two steps away orthogonally (up, down, left, right) with the outer color, provided they are currently white (0) and within grid bounds.
The painting happens on the output grid, using the original input grid as the reference for source pixel colors and locations.

**Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, based on a simple distance calculation from *all* original object pixels, failed because it created filled diamond shapes instead of the observed cross shapes. The transformed outputs in the failed attempt had incorrect pixel placements compared to the expected outputs.

The key insight missed was that the expansion seems constrained to the rows and columns occupied by the original object. Furthermore, the analysis of the expected outputs reveals that parts of the *original outer frame* are overwritten by the *inner color* during the expansion. This contradicts the idea that the original object is simply copied and pixels are added around it.

The metrics calculated confirm several points:
*   Shapes and colors remain consistent between input and output (aside from the expansion).
*   The output bounding box is always larger than the input bounding box, expanded by 2 units in each direction (min_r-2, min_c-2, max_r+2, max_c+2).
*   Crucially, `pixels_overwritten_count` is non-zero in all examples (16, 9, 16). This confirms that the transformation *does* change some pixels that were part of the original object. Specifically, it seems the original outer frame pixels that are 1 Manhattan distance away from the inner core pixels are changed to the inner color.
*   `pixels_added_count` is also significant, representing the new pixels added outside the original object's bounding box.
*   `pixels_deleted_count` is 0, meaning no non-white pixels become white.

**Revised Strategy:** The second refined hypothesis seems most plausible. The transformation involves calculating distances, but the application rule needs refinement:

1.  **Identify:** Find the input object's bounding box, inner color (B), and outer color (A).
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid of the same size, filled with the background color (white, 0).
3.  **Iterate and Color:** Go through each cell (r, c) of the grid.
    *   Find the minimum Manhattan distance `d` from (r, c) to any cell *originally containing the inner color (B)* in the input grid.
    *   Find the minimum Manhattan distance `d_outer` from (r, c) to any cell *originally containing the outer color (A)* in the input grid. Note: `d` and `d_outer` might come from different source cells.
    *   Apply coloring rules based on these distances:
        *   If `d == 1`, set `output[r, c] = B` (inner color).
        *   Else if `d_outer == 0` (meaning the current cell (r, c) was originally part of the outer frame) AND `d > 1` (it's not adjacent to an inner cell), set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color). This preserves the parts of the outer frame not overwritten by the inner color expansion.
        *   Else if `d == 2`, set `output[r, c] = A` (outer color). This creates the outer layer of the expansion cross.
        *   Otherwise, leave `output[r, c] = 0` (white).

This revised strategy accounts for overwriting the outer frame pixels adjacent to the inner core and correctly places the expanded layers.

**Facts**


```yaml
- description: Input grid analysis
  facts:
    - Each input grid contains a single rectangular object against a white background (0).
    - The object consists of two non-white colors: an outer frame color (A) and an inner core color (B).
    - The object is always centered, although its exact position varies.
    - The shape of the inner core can vary (e.g., solid rectangle in ex 1 & 3, single pixel in ex 2).

- description: Output grid analysis
  facts:
    - Each output grid contains a single, larger object against a white background (0).
    - The output object uses the same two colors (A and B) as the input object.
    - The output object has a cross-like shape, centered around the position of the original input object.
    - The overall size of the output object is determined by expanding the original object's bounding box by 2 cells in each orthogonal direction (top, bottom, left, right).

- description: Transformation analysis
  facts:
    - The transformation expands the original object outwards.
    - The core concept appears related to Manhattan distance from the original object's pixels.
    - Pixels exactly 1 Manhattan distance away from *any* original inner color (B) pixel become color B in the output. This rule takes precedence and overwrites original outer frame pixels if necessary.
    - Pixels exactly 2 Manhattan distance away from *any* original inner color (B) pixel become color A (outer color) in the output, *provided* they are not distance 1 from an inner pixel.
    - Pixels that were originally part of the outer frame (color A) remain color A *unless* they are exactly 1 Manhattan distance away from an original inner color (B) pixel.
    - All other pixels remain white (0).
    - No pixels are deleted (changed from non-white to white).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the unique non-white colors in the input grid. Determine which is the outer frame color (A) and which is the inner core color (B). Identify the coordinates of all pixels containing color A (`outer_coords`) and all pixels containing color B (`inner_coords`).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
3.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the output grid.
4.  For the current cell (r, c), calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist_inner`) to any coordinate in `inner_coords`.
5.  Also, check if the coordinate (r, c) exists in the original `outer_coords`.
6.  Apply the following rules in order of precedence to determine the color of the output cell (r, c):
    a.  If `min_dist_inner` is 1, set the output cell color to B (inner color).
    b.  Else if `min_dist_inner` is 2, set the output cell color to A (outer color).
    c.  Else if the coordinate (r, c) was originally part of the outer frame (i.e., `(r, c)` is in `outer_coords`), set the output cell color to A (outer color).
    d.  Otherwise, leave the output cell color as the initialized background color (white, 0).
7.  Return the completed output grid.**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt failed because the transformation logic based purely on distance from *any* part of the object resulted in filled diamond/square expansions rather than the observed cross/plus shapes. The key errors were:
1.  Incorrect shape generation (diamond vs. cross).
2.  Incorrect handling of pixel overwrites: The analysis of the expected outputs shows that some pixels belonging to the original outer frame are overwritten by the inner color in the output. The previous code did not account for this.

The calculated metrics confirm the expansion pattern (+2 cells around the bounding box) and, critically, the presence of overwritten pixels (`pixels_overwritten_count` > 0). This overwrite happens specifically where the inner color expands into the original outer frame. No pixels are ever deleted (changed to white).

The revised strategy focuses on calculating distances specifically from the *inner core* pixels and the *outer frame* pixels separately and applying rules with precedence:
1.  The expansion of the inner color (distance 1) takes highest priority and can overwrite original outer frame pixels.
2.  The expansion creating the new outer layer (distance 2 from inner core) is applied next to empty cells.
3.  Remaining original outer frame pixels (those not overwritten by step 1) are preserved.
4.  This naturally restricts the expansion to the cross shape observed, as cells diagonal to the corners are further than distance 2 from the inner core and were not part of the original outer frame.

**Facts**


```yaml
- description: Grid Properties
  facts:
    - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - Background color is white (0).

- description: Input Object Properties
  facts:
    - Contains a single, centered, rectangular object.
    - Object composed of exactly two non-white colors.
    - One color forms an outer frame (Color A).
    - The other color forms an inner core (Color B).
    - The inner core can be a single pixel (ex 2) or a filled rectangle (ex 1, 3).
    - Let 'inner_coords' be the set of (row, col) for pixels with Color B in the input.
    - Let 'outer_coords' be the set of (row, col) for pixels with Color A in the input.

- description: Output Object Properties
  facts:
    - Contains a single, centered object using only Color A and Color B.
    - The object has a cross-like shape (extends horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally from the corners).
    - The bounding box of the output object is expanded by 2 units in each direction (top, bottom, left, right) compared to the input object's bounding box.

- description: Transformation Rules
  facts:
    - The transformation generates the output based on proximity to the original inner core and outer frame pixels.
    - Rule 1 (Inner Expansion): Any pixel (output grid) that is exactly 1 Manhattan distance away from *any* coordinate in 'inner_coords' becomes Color B. This rule has the highest precedence.
    - Rule 2 (Outer Expansion): Any pixel (output grid) that is exactly 2 Manhattan distance away from *any* coordinate in 'inner_coords' becomes Color A, *unless* Rule 1 already applied to it.
    - Rule 3 (Frame Preservation): Any pixel (output grid) whose coordinate (r, c) is in the original 'outer_coords' becomes Color A, *unless* Rule 1 already applied to it.
    - Rule 4 (Background): All other pixels remain white (0).
    - Pixels originally having Color A can be overwritten to Color B if they satisfy Rule 1.
    - No non-white pixels are ever changed to white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the coordinates of pixels for the inner color (B) (`inner_coords`) and the outer color (A) (`outer_coords`) in the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
3.  For each cell (r, c) in the grid:
    a.  Calculate the minimum Manhattan distance (`min_dist_inner`) from (r, c) to any coordinate in `inner_coords`. If `inner_coords` is empty, this distance is infinity.
    b.  Check if the coordinate (r, c) exists in the set `outer_coords` (`is_original_outer`).
    c.  Apply coloring rules based on precedence:
        i.  If `min_dist_inner == 1`: Set the output cell `(r, c)` to color B.
        ii. Else if `min_dist_inner == 2`: Set the output cell `(r, c)` to color A.
        iii. Else if `is_original_outer` is true: Set the output cell `(r, c)` to color A.
        iv. Otherwise: Leave the output cell `(r, c)` as white (0).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
