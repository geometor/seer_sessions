Their colors determine the 'fill' and 'outline' colors for a shape to be drawn in the output.\n    *   A single blue pixel (color 1) is located elsewhere in the input grid. Its position serves as an 'anchor' point for drawing the shape in the output grid.\n    *   The output grid is initially white (all 0s).\n    *   A specific shape template is selected based on the combination of the fill color (from input[0,0]) and outline color (from input[0,1]). Each training example demonstrates a different shape corresponding to a different color pair.\n    *   This selected shape is drawn onto the output grid using the identified fill and outline colors.\n    *   The drawing is positioned relative to the anchor point found in the input.\n    *   The pixel at the anchor location in the output grid retains the blue color (1), overriding any fill or outline color that the template might specify for that relative position.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
