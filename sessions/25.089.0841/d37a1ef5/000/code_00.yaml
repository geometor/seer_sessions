Observations:
  - Grid Structure:
      - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - The background color is consistently white (0).
  - Objects:
      - A primary object is a rectangular frame composed of red (2) pixels.
      - Inside this frame, there are other pixels:
          - Some are white (0).
          - Some are gray (5). These appear as distinct single pixels or small groups.
  - Transformation:
      - The transformation acts specifically on the area *enclosed* by the red frame.
      - Pixels within the enclosed area that were originally white (0) are changed to red (2).
  - Invariants:
      - The red (2) frame pixels remain unchanged.
      - The gray (5) pixels inside the frame remain unchanged.
      - The white (0) pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.
  - Relationships:
      - The transformation depends on identifying the boundary defined by the red frame.
      - The color change (white to red) uses the same color as the frame.
      - The transformation distinguishes between the background color (white) and other non-frame colors (gray) within the enclosed area.
