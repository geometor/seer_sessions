This frame is always hollow.\n3.  **Internal Pixels:** Inside the red frame, there are pixels that are either white (0) or gray (5).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of some pixels *inside* the red frame. Specifically, the white (0) pixels within the boundaries of the red frame are changed to red (2) in the output.\n5.  **Preservation:** The red frame itself, the gray (5) pixels inside the frame, and the white (0) background *outside* the frame remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

These appear as distinct single pixels or small groups.\n  - Transformation:\n      - The transformation acts specifically on the area *enclosed* by the red frame.\n      - Pixels within the enclosed area that were originally white (0) are changed to red (2).\n  - Invariants:\n      - The red (2) frame pixels remain unchanged.\n      - The gray (5) pixels inside the frame remain unchanged.\n      - The white (0) pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.\n  - Relationships:\n      - The transformation depends on identifying the boundary defined by the red frame.\n      - The color change (white to red) uses the same color as the frame.\n      - The transformation distinguishes between the background color (white) and other non-frame colors (gray) within the enclosed area.\n```"
