Observations:
  - Grid Structure:
      - Input and output grids maintain identical dimensions.
      - The background color is consistently white (0).
  - Objects:
      - A primary object is a rectangular frame composed of red (2) pixels, enclosing an inner region.
      - Inside the frame, there are other pixels:
          - Some are white (0).
          - Some are gray (5), appearing as distinct single pixels.
  - Transformation (Refined):
      - The transformation modifies only the pixels *strictly inside* the red frame.
      - It targets white (0) pixels within this enclosed region.
      - A white (0) pixel inside the frame is changed to red (2) *if and only if* it is NOT adjacent (including diagonals, 8-connectivity) to any gray (5) pixel.
      - White (0) pixels inside the frame that *are* adjacent to a gray (5) pixel remain white (0).
  - Invariants:
      - The red (2) frame pixels remain unchanged.
      - The gray (5) pixels inside the frame remain unchanged.
      - All white (0) pixels outside the frame remain unchanged.
      - White (0) pixels inside the frame adjacent to gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.
  - Relationships:
      - The transformation depends on identifying the boundary defined by the red frame.
      - The fill color (red) matches the frame color.
      - The decision to fill a specific white pixel depends on its 8 neighbors: the presence of a gray (5) neighbor inhibits the fill.
