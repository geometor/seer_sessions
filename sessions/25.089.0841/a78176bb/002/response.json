This part of the code, intended for importing helper functions, was not actually necessary as the core logic was self-contained within the `transform` function and its helper `find_shape_color`. The core transformation logic implemented appears consistent with the first example, but needs verification against all provided examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Remove the problematic path manipulation and unnecessary import attempts.\n2.  Analyze all training examples to confirm or refine the transformation rule.\n3.  Use code execution to gather specific metrics about the grids (dimensions, colors, object locations).\n4.  Update the facts and natural language program based on the complete set of examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

Perhaps it's not filling *all* cells below, but projecting *until* it hits another pixel of the *same* color in that column? No, that doesn't explain Example 1 output either.\n\nOkay, back to basics.\nInput object: Pixels of a specific color (non-gray, non-background). Let's call this the 'active' color.\nInput also contains gray pixels, acting as obstacles? Or just ignored? The metrics show gray is present in all inputs but absent in all outputs. So, gray is ignored/removed.\nOutput grid: Same dimensions. Contains only background and the active color.\n\nCompare Input/Output positions for the active color.\nExample 1 (Color 9):\nInput: {(0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9)}\nOutput: {(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8)}\n\nIs there a relationship between `(r, c)` in input and output points `(r', c')`?\nLet `(r, c)` be an input point.\nOutput points include `(r, c)`. This seems true for all original points: (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9) are all in the output.\nWhat about the other output points?\n(1,0): Related to (0,1)? No input there. Related to (0,5)? r'=r+1, c'=c-5 ?\n(2,1): Related to (1,6)? r'=r+1, c'=c-5 ?\n(3,2): Related to (2,7)? r'=r+1, c'=c-5 ?\n(4,3): Related to (3,8)? r'=r+1, c'=c-5 ?\n(5,4): Related to (4,9)? r'=r+1, c'=c-5 ?\nThis looks like a transformation: `T1(r, c) = (r+1, c-5)` applied to the input points. But why `c-5`? 5 is the column of the first input point.\n\nLet's test this idea `(r', c') = (r+k, c-k)`?\nInput (0,5): k=1 -> (1,4), k=2 -> (2,3), k=3 -> (3,2), k=4 -> (4,1), k=5 -> (5,0). Output has (3,2) but not the others. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's related to reflection and *then* a transformation?\nReflect (r,c) -> (c,r).\n(0,5) -> (5,0). Output has (1,0), (6,0). How are (5,0) and {(1,0), (6,0)} related?\n(1,6) -> (6,1). Output has (2,1), (7,1). How are (6,1) and {(2,1), (7,1)} related? r'=c+1? c'=r ? (6+1, 1)? No.\n(2,7) -> (7,2). Output has (3,2), (8,2).

(9+1, 4) = (10, 4) -> Off grid.\n\nSo, for an input point `(r, c)`, the output contains:\n1.  The original point `(r, c)`.\n2.  The point `(c+1, r)`, if it's within the grid boundaries.\n\nLet's recheck Example 1 with this rule:\nInput: (0,5) -> Output: (0,5) and (5+1, 0) = (6,0). Both are in the output.\nInput: (1,6) -> Output: (1,6) and (6+1, 1) = (7,1). Both are in the output.\nInput: (2,7) -> Output: (2,7) and (7+1, 2) = (8,2). Both are in the output.\nInput: (3,8) -> Output: (3,8) and (8+1, 3) = (9,3). Both are in the output.\nInput: (4,9) -> Output: (4,9) and (9+1, 4) = (10,4) (off-grid). Only (4,9) is added.\n\nThis generates the set: {(0,5), (6,0), (1,6), (7,1), (2,7), (8,2), (3,8), (9,3), (4,9)}.\nCompare with actual output set: {(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8)}\n\nMy generated set is a *subset* of the output set. What's missing?\nMissing: (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,8).\nLook at the missing points: `(r, c)` where `r = c + 1`. This is the line just below the main diagonal. Where could *these* points come from?\n\nIs there a third transformation?\nMaybe reflect across the *anti*-diagonal? For a 10x10 grid, the anti-diagonal passes through (0,9), (1,8), ..., (9,0). Reflection maps `(r, c)` to `(9-c, 9-r)`.\nInput (0,5) -> (9-5, 9-0) = (4,9). This *is* an input point!\nInput (1,6) -> (9-6, 9-1) = (3,8). Also an input point.\nInput (2,7) -> (9-7, 9-2) = (2,7). Same point (it's on a diagonal).\nInput (3,8) -> (9-8, 9-3) = (1,6). Input point.\nInput (4,9) -> (9-9, 9-4) = (0,5). Input point.\nThe input points themselves have anti-diagonal symmetry (relative to the center of the grid). This doesn't help generate new points.\n\nLet's look at the output grid again.

These look like `(r+1, c)` based on the *reflected* points `(c,r)`?\nReflection of (0,5) is (5,0). Apply `(r+1, c)` -> (5+1, 0) = (6,0). Already have this.\nReflection of (1,6) is (6,1). Apply `(r+1, c)` -> (6+1, 1) = (7,1). Already have this.\nReflection of (2,7) is (7,2). Apply `(r+1, c)` -> (7+1, 2) = (8,2). Already have this.\nReflection of (3,8) is (8,3).

These look like `(r, c+1)` based on the *reflected* points?\nReflection (5,0) -> (5, 0+1) = (5,1). Not in output.\nReflection (6,1) -> (6, 1+1) = (6,2).

Not in output.\n\nThis is not working. Let's abandon reflections for a moment.\n\nLook at the structure in Example 1 output grid.\nColumn 0: 9s at rows 1, 6\nColumn 1: 9s at rows 2, 7\nColumn 2: 9s at rows 3, 8\nColumn 3: 9s at rows 4, 9\nColumn 4: 9s at row 5\nColumn 5: 9s at rows 0, 6\nColumn 6: 9s at rows 1, 7\nColumn 7: 9s at rows 2, 8\nColumn 8: 9s at rows 3, 9\nColumn 9: 9s at row 4\n\nNotice pairs: (1,0) & (6,0); (2,1) & (7,1); (3,2) & (8,2); (4,3) & (9,3).

Let me re-verify the output grid points.\n\nOutput points again: {(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8)}\nPairs with difference 5 in row index:\n(1,0) & (6,0) -> diff 5\n(2,1) & (7,1) -> diff 5\n(3,2) & (8,2) -> diff 5\n(4,3) & (9,3) -> diff 5\n(0,5) & (?,5) -> (6,5) -> diff 6? No, wait.\n\nLet's assume the transformation is: For each input pixel `(r, c)` of the active color, draw two 'rays' in the output grid using the active color.\nRay 1: Starts at `(r, c)` and goes down-right diagonally `(r+k, c+k)`.\nRay 2: Starts at `(r, c)` and goes down-left diagonally `(r+k, c-k)`.\nStop rays if they go off-grid.\n\nTest on Example 1: Input (0, 5)\nRay 1 (down-right): (0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9).\nRay 2 (down-left): (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0).\nCombined for (0,5): {(0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0)}.\n\nTest on Example 1: Input (1, 6)\nRay 1: (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9).\nRay 2: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), (7,0).\nCombined for (1,6): {(1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), (7,0)}.\n\nTest on Example 1: Input (2, 7)\nRay 1: (2,7), (3,8), (4,9).\nRay 2: (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0).\nCombined for (2,7): {(2,7), (3,8), (4,9), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0)}.\n\nTest on Example 1: Input (3, 8)\nRay 1: (3,8), (4,9).\nRay 2: (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2).\nCombined for (3,8): {(3,8), (4,9), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2)}.\n\nTest on Example 1: Input (4, 9)\nRay 1: (4,9).\nRay 2: (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4).\nCombined for (4,9): {(4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4)}.\n\nNow, take the *union* of all these sets:\n{(0,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9),  <- Ray 1 from (0,5)\n (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0),  <- Ray 2 from (0,5)\n (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), (7,0), <- Ray 2 from (1,6) (Ray 1 already included)\n (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0), <- Ray 2 from (2,7)\n (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), <- Ray 2 from (3,8)\n (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4) } <- Ray 2 from (4,9)\n\nCompare this combined set with the actual output set:\nActual Output: {(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8)}\nMy generated set: Contains points like (1,4), (2,3), (4,1), (5,0) etc. which are *not* in the output. This hypothesis is also wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure in the output grid. The \"V\" shape or reflection idea seems plausible.\nWhat if it reflects across the column of the input pixel?\nInput (0,5). Reflect across col 5. (0,5) stays (0,5).\nInput (1,6). Reflect across col 6. (1,6) stays (1,6).\n\nMaybe reflect across the row?\nInput (0,5). Reflect across row 0. Stays (0,5).\nInput (1,6). Reflect across row 1. Stays (1,6).\n\nThis isn't helping. Let's assume the previous interpretation of the code was correct about the *general* idea: identify shape color, ignore gray, project shape color somehow. The failure was in the *projection* rule.\n\nThe actual projection seems complex. Let's re-test the `(r, c)` -> `(r, c)` and `(c+1, r)` hypothesis, but carefully check the output coordinates again.\n\nExample 1 Output Grid:\n"
