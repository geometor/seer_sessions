Transformation Rule Description:

1.  Identify the primary 'shape' color in the input grid. This is the single color present that is not background (0) or gray (5). If no such color exists, return an empty grid.
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with the background color (0).
3.  Define an offset K = 4 (potentially related to grid width // 2 - 1, but fixed at 4 for these examples).
4.  Define offsets R1 = 1 and R2 = 6 (potentially related to grid height // 2 +/- 1, but fixed for these examples).
5.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.
6.  If the pixel `input_grid[r, c]` contains the shape color:
    a.  Mark the corresponding pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid with the shape color.
    b.  Check the relationship between the row `r` and column `c`:
        i.  If `c <= r`: Calculate the target coordinate `(tr, tc) = (r, c + K)`. If this coordinate is within the grid bounds, mark `output_grid[tr, tc]` with the shape color.
        ii. If `c > r`: Calculate the difference `d = c - r`. Calculate three target coordinates:
            - Target 1: `(tr1, tc1) = (r + R1, c - d)` which simplifies to `(r + 1, r)`.
            - Target 2: `(tr2, tc2) = (r + R2, c - d)` which simplifies to `(r + 6, r)`.
            - Target 3: `(tr3, tc3) = (r + R2, c)` which simplifies to `(r + 6, c)`.
            For each target coordinate, if it is within the grid bounds, mark the corresponding pixel in the output grid with the shape color.
7.  Return the final output grid. Gray pixels (5) in the input are ignored and do not appear in the output unless overwritten by the shape color based on the rules above.
