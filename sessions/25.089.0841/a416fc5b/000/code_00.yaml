Grid:
  Properties:
    Size: 11x11
    Structure: Divided by lines of magenta (6) pixels into 9 subgrids.
    Dividers: Horizontal at rows 3 and 7, Vertical at columns 3 and 7.
    Background_Color: orange (7)
Subgrids:
  Count: 9
  Arrangement: 3x3 grid of areas.
  Size: 3x3 pixels each.
  Possible_States:
    - All_Orange: Filled entirely with orange (7).
    - Patterned: Contains a specific pattern shape.
Pattern:
  Shape: 3x3 grid
  Structure:

  Pattern_Colors_Used:
    - red (2)

Transformation_Rules:
  - Rule_Type: Conditional Pattern Replacement
    Conditions:
      - Condition_1:
          Input_State: Area 5 has red(2) pattern, Area 8 has red(2) pattern, all other areas are All_Orange.
          Action: Modify output grid - Area 2 becomes gray(5) pattern, Area 3 becomes azure(8) pattern. Other areas remain unchanged from input.
      - Condition_2:
          Input_State: Area 3 has red(2) pattern, Area 8 has red(2) pattern, all other areas are All_Orange.
          Action: Modify output grid - Area 7 becomes gray(5) pattern, Area 8 changes from red(2) pattern to azure(8) pattern. Other areas remain unchanged from input.
      - Default_Condition:
          Input_State: Any configuration not matching Condition_1 or Condition_2.
          Action: Replace the entire output grid with orange (7) pixels, maintaining the original 11x11 size. (Note: Example 3 shows a size change, but this seems anomalous for ARC; assuming size preservation is intended).
