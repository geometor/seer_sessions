            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are 11x11. They are consistently divided by magenta (6) lines into a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 subgrids. The magenta lines are at row 3, row 7, column 3, and column 7 (0-indexed).\n2.  **Subgrids/Areas:** There are 9 distinct 3x3 areas separated by the magenta lines. Let's number them 1-9 like a keypad:\n    *   1: rows 0-2, cols 0-2 (Top-Left)\n    *   2: rows 0-2, cols 4-6 (Top-Center)\n    *   3: rows 0-2, cols 8-10 (Top-Right)\n    *   4: rows 4-6, cols 0-2 (Mid-Left)\n    *   5: rows 4-6, cols 4-6 (Mid-Center)\n    *   6: rows 4-6, cols 8-10 (Mid-Right)\n    *   7: rows 8-10, cols 0-2 (Bottom-Left)\n    *   8: rows 8-10, cols 4-6 (Bottom-Center)\n    *   9: rows 8-10, cols 8-10 (Bottom-Right)\n3.  **Background Color:** The predominant color within the 3x3 areas (when not part of a specific pattern) is orange (7).\n4.  **Pattern:** A specific 3x3 pattern appears in some areas. It consists of orange (7) at the corners and center, and a different color (C) at the middle of the edges:\n    "

          {
            "text": "\n    The colors observed in these patterns are red (2), gray (5), and azure (8).\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation depends entirely on the configuration of patterns within the 9 areas in the input grid. Specifically, it looks for two particular arrangements involving two red (2) patterns. If neither of these arrangements is present, a default transformation occurs.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
