## Perception

The input grid consists of a white background (0) and two colored shapes: one oriented vertically and one oriented horizontally. These shapes can be lines (1 pixel thick) or rectangles (multiple pixels thick). The two shapes always intersect.

The transformation involves changing the color of the pixels at the intersection of the two shapes. In the input grid, the pixels at the intersection have the color of the vertical shape. In the output grid, these intersection pixels are changed to the color of the horizontal shape. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
observations:
  - object_1:
      description: A vertical line or rectangle of a single color (not white).
      properties:
        - color: varies (blue, magenta, green, azure in examples)
        - orientation: vertical
        - shape: line or rectangle
  - object_2:
      description: A horizontal line or rectangle of a single color (not white).
      properties:
        - color: varies (orange, blue, red, green in examples)
        - orientation: horizontal
        - shape: line or rectangle
  - background:
      description: The background color.
      properties:
        - color: white (0)
  - relationship:
      description: object_1 and object_2 intersect.
      properties:
        - intersection_points: pixels where object_1 and object_2 overlap.
  - transformation:
      action: color_change
      target: intersection_points
      details: >
        The pixels located at the intersection of the vertical object (object_1)
        and the horizontal object (object_2) change color.
        In the input, these pixels have the color of object_1.
        In the output, these pixels adopt the color of object_2.
        All other pixels retain their original color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the vertical colored object (object_1) and its color (color_1).
2.  Identify the horizontal colored object (object_2) and its color (color_2).
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
4.  For each pixel, check if it belongs to both object_1 (i.e., has color_1 and is part of the vertical structure) and object_2 (i.e., lies within the horizontal extent of object_2). This identifies the intersection pixels.
5.  Create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
6.  For each identified intersection pixel in the output grid, change its color from color_1 to color_2.
7.  Leave all other pixels in the output grid unchanged from the input grid.
