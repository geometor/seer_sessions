observations:
  - object_1:
      description: A vertical line or rectangle of a single color (not white).
      properties:
        - color: varies (blue, magenta, green, azure in examples)
        - orientation: vertical
        - shape: line or rectangle
  - object_2:
      description: A horizontal line or rectangle of a single color (not white).
      properties:
        - color: varies (orange, blue, red, green in examples)
        - orientation: horizontal
        - shape: line or rectangle
  - background:
      description: The background color.
      properties:
        - color: white (0)
  - relationship:
      description: object_1 and object_2 intersect.
      properties:
        - intersection_points: pixels where object_1 and object_2 overlap.
  - transformation:
      action: color_change
      target: intersection_points
      details: >
        The pixels located at the intersection of the vertical object (object_1)
        and the horizontal object (object_2) change color.
        In the input, these pixels have the color of object_1.
        In the output, these pixels adopt the color of object_2.
        All other pixels retain their original color.
