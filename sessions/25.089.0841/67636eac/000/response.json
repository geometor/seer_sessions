These shapes are always 3x3, with a white center and four adjacent pixels of the shape's color. The task involves identifying these plus-sign shapes, extracting them, and arranging them into a new grid. The arrangement in the output can be either a vertical stack or a horizontal row, preserving the relative order of the shapes from the input (top-to-bottom for vertical stacking, left-to-right for horizontal arrangement).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
