grid_properties:
  size_preservation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  immutable_color: Gray (5) pixels remain unchanged and act as boundaries.
  mutable_color: White (0) pixels are subject to change.
  influencer_colors: Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels influence the change but remain unchanged themselves.

regions:
  definition: Areas of contiguous non-Gray (5) pixels, bounded by Gray (5) pixels or the grid edges.
  independence: Each region's transformation is determined independently.

transformation_rule:
  target: White (0) pixels within a region.
  condition_priority_1:
    trigger: Presence of at least one Red (2) pixel within the region in the input.
    action: Change all White (0) pixels in that region to Red (2) in the output.
  condition_priority_2:
    trigger: No Red (2) pixels are present, but at least one Blue (1) pixel is present within the region in the input.
    action: Change all White (0) pixels in that region to Blue (1) in the output.
  condition_priority_3:
    trigger: No Red (2) or Blue (1) pixels are present within the region in the input.
    action: White (0) pixels remain White (0). (Inferred, not explicitly shown in examples).
  source_pixel_preservation: Original Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels within the region remain unchanged in the output.
