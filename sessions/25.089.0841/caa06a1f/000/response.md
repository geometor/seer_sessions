Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid consists of two main parts:
    *   A rectangular region, typically starting from the top-left corner, filled with a checkerboard pattern using two distinct colors (e.g., magenta/green, magenta/orange, gray/yellow).
    *   A border or padding region, usually along the bottom edge and/or right edge, filled uniformly with a third distinct color (e.g., blue, green, magenta).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as its corresponding input grid. The entire output grid is filled with a checkerboard pattern using the *same two colors* found in the input's main pattern area.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The key transformation involves the two colors forming the checkerboard pattern. If the input pattern uses Color A and Color B, the output pattern also uses Color A and Color B. However, their positions are swapped relative to the input. For instance, if the top-left cell (0,0) in the input's pattern area is Color A, the top-left cell (0,0) in the output grid is Color B. This swap propagates across the entire grid according to the checkerboard logic.
4.  **Border/Padding Role:** The third color (border/padding) in the input seems to serve only to delimit the primary pattern area. It does not appear in the output grid and is effectively replaced by the extended and color-swapped checkerboard pattern.
5.  **Checkerboard Logic:** The checkerboard pattern means that adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically) always have different colors from the two primary colors identified. The color of a cell at `(row, col)` depends on the parity of `row + col`.

**YAML Facts:**

Task: Color-Swapped Checkerboard Extension

Input_Features:
  - Grid:
      - Contains a primary pattern area and a border/padding area.
  - Primary_Pattern_Area:
      - Location: Typically top-left region.
      - Content: Checkerboard pattern using two distinct colors (Color1, Color2).
      - Example_Colors_Pairs: [(magenta, green), (magenta, orange), (gray, yellow)]
  - Border_Padding_Area:
      - Location: Bottom row(s) and/or right column(s).
      - Content: Uniformly filled with a third distinct color (Color3).
      - Example_Colors: [blue, green, magenta]
      - Role: Delimits the primary pattern; ignored in output generation.
  - Grid_Dimensions:
      - Variable height and width (H x W).

Output_Features:
  - Grid:
      - Same dimensions (H x W) as the input grid.
  - Content:
      - Full checkerboard pattern covering the entire grid.
      - Uses the same two colors (Color1, Color2) as the input's primary pattern.
  - Color_Relationship:
      - The output checkerboard pattern is the color-swapped version of the input's primary pattern.
      - If input(0,0) is Color1, output(0,0) is Color2.
      - If input(0,1) is Color2, output(0,1) is Color1.
      - The color at output(r, c) is determined by the parity of (r + c) and the swapped starting colors.

Transformation_Rule:
  - Identify the two primary checkerboard colors (Color1, Color2) from the input, typically by looking at cells like (0,0) and (0,1) or (1,0).
  - Determine the grid dimensions (H, W) from the input.
  - Create an output grid of size H x W.
  - Fill the output grid with a checkerboard pattern using Color1 and Color2, ensuring that the color at (0,0) in the output is the *opposite* of the color at (0,0) in the input's primary pattern.
  - Specifically:
    - Let Input_Color_at_00 = input[0][0]
    - Let Other_Primary_Color = the other color in the input's checkerboard pattern (e.g., input[0][1] or input[1][0] if different from input[0][0]).
    - Set Output_Color_at_00 = Other_Primary_Color
    - Set Output_Color_Adjacent_to_00 = Input_Color_at_00
    - For each cell (r, c) in the output grid:
      - If (r + c) is even, assign Output_Color_at_00.
      - If (r + c) is odd, assign Output_Color_Adjacent_to_00.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the dimensions (Height H, Width W) of the input grid.
2.  Examine the top-left corner of the input grid (e.g., cells at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)) to identify the two distinct colors (Color1, Color2) that form the primary checkerboard pattern, ignoring any uniform border color found later in the grid. Let Color1 be the color at input cell (0,0). Let Color2 be the adjacent different color (e.g., at input cell (0,1) or (1,0)).
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W).
4.  Determine the starting color for the output grid's top-left cell (0,0): this color should be Color2 (the color that was *not* at the input's (0,0) cell).
5.  Iterate through each cell of the output grid, from row `r = 0` to `H-1` and column `c = 0` to `W-1`.
6.  For each cell `(r, c)`, calculate the sum `s = r + c`.
7.  If `s` is even, assign Color2 (the determined starting color for output(0,0)) to the output cell `(r, c)`.
8.  If `s` is odd, assign Color1 (the color that was originally at input(0,0)) to the output cell `(r, c)`.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
