Iterate diagonally upwards and rightwards, tracking the iteration step with 'i' starting from 0.\n       b. Calculate the top-left corner of a potential 2x2 block for this step: (dr, dc) = (r - i, c + i).\n       c. If the row 'dr' goes above the top edge of the grid (dr < 0), stop the diagonal iteration for this starting red pixel.\n       d.
