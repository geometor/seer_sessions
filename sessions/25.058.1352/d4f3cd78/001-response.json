This grey region appears designed to create a boundary, potentially fully enclosing an internal area, or presents some other specific, identifiable shape.\n\n2.  **Determine the Interior:** Based on the identified grey shape, identify the region that it encloses or the inside of the shape.\n\n3.  **Fill the Interior:** Change the color of all pixels within the determined \"interior\" region to azure (8).\n\n4.  **Add Extra Azure:** From the now azure filled interior, in a consistent manner based on the original shape and its filled form, add extra azure (8) pixels. In the examples shown, this seems to occur by extending from the bottom of the filled shape. In the first case, a vertical line 2 blocks down from the lowest and furthest-right azure-colored pixel of the filled square. In the second example, there is an azure pixel added at the top of the upper horizontal line of the '5' shape, in the middle.\n\nThe key differences between the first and second pair is how the extra azure pixel is applied. The shape of the grey area is different, resulting in a slightly different rule.\n"
