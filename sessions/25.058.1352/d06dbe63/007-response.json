Most cells are white (0), except for a single azure (8) cell near the center.\n*   **Output:** A 13x13 grid. The azure (8) cell remains in the same position. There are grey (5) cells forming a kind of \"inverted-L\" or \"mirrored-L\" shape, extending upwards, leftwards, and upwards-leftwards from the azure cell. The grey shapes include the original coordinates and expands until any non zero cell is found.\n* **Transformation:** It appears the azure cell acts as a seed, and the grey color \"grows\" or \"floods\" from it in specific directions, filling in the original shape.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
