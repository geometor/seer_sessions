Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 13x13 grid, predominantly filled with '0' (white). A single '8' (azure) pixel is located near the center. The output grid retains the '8' in the same location. However, '5' (gray) pixels appear, seemingly radiating outwards from the '8' in all eight directions (including diagonals), forming a sort of "jagged plus sign" and also taking on an "X" shape, that is not perfectly symmetrical. The gray pixels occupy what previously were white pixels. There's likely a rule determining which white pixels are replaced by the gray color, relative to the starting azure pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 13x13
    elements: pixels
    default_color: white (0)

  - type: pixel
    id: start_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: (7,7)  # (row, column), 0-indexed

  - type: pixel
    color: gray (5)
    relationship: "radiates from start_pixel"

actions:
    - name: radiate
      agent: start_pixel
      target_color: gray(5)
      pattern: "jagged plus sign and X"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the starting pixel:** Locate the single azure (8) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Radiate gray pixels:** From the location of the azure pixel, extend gray (5) pixels outwards in all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3. **Determine the shape**: The gray pixels create a combination of X and + shapes, they do not stop until the borders.

Essentially, the transformation involves identifying a special "source" pixel (color 8) and then "flooding" or "growing" a new color (5) outwards from it in a cross and X shaped pattern until the color 5 pixels reach the grid borders.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
