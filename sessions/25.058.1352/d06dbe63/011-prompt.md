Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Seed:** Find the azure (8) cell within the input grid. This cell is the "seed" for the transformation.
2.  **Preserve the Seed:**  The seed cell's position and color (azure) are unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Expand Grey Fill:** From the seed cell's location, fill all adjacent cells with grey (5).
4.  **Iterate Expansion:** Continue expanding the grey fill outwards in all directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) from every grey cell.
5.  **Boundary Condition:** Stop the expansion of grey at the edges of the grid.  The expansion does *not* wrap around.
6. All other cells remain their original color.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
