A single '8' (azure) pixel is located near the center. The output grid retains the '8' in the same location. However, '5' (gray) pixels appear, seemingly radiating outwards from the '8' in all eight directions (including diagonals), forming a sort of \"jagged plus sign\" and also taking on an \"X\" shape, that is not perfectly symmetrical. The gray pixels occupy what previously were white pixels. There's likely a rule determining which white pixels are replaced by the gray color, relative to the starting azure pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
