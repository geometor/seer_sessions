facts:
  - observation: "Each input grid contains exactly one azure pixel (value 8)."
  - observation: "Each output grid contains an 'L'-shaped structure composed of gray pixels (value 5)."
  - observation: "The 'L' shape originates from the location of the azure pixel in the input grid."
  - observation: "The 'L' shape consists of two perpendicular line segments."
  - observation: "The dimensions and orientation of the 'L' shape vary across examples."
  - observation: "The length of 'L' segments is determined by the edges of a black rectangle in the input"
  - action: "Replace the azure pixel in the input grid with a gray pixel to form part of the 'L'."
  - action: "Extend gray pixels from the initial gray pixel to form the 'L' shape."
  - constraint: "The 'L' shape segments extend to meet the edge of a rectangle, constructed of black pixels"
