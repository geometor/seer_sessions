It appears that the \"L\" path extends by adding three additional pixels that do not form a square.\n4. All other pixels remain 0.\n\nEssentially, the azure pixel acts as a starting point for an \"L\"-shaped gray path. The orientation and length of the \"L\" changes in the two examples, but the general concept remains consistent.\n"
