Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Seed:** Find the azure (8) cell within the input grid. This cell is the "seed" for the transformation.
2.  **Preserve the Seed:**  The seed cell's position and color (azure) are unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Expand Grey Fill:** From the seed cell's location, fill all adjacent cells with grey (5).
4.  **Iterate Expansion:** Continue expanding the grey fill outwards in all directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) from every grey cell.
5.  **Boundary Condition:** Stop the expansion of grey at the edges of the grid.  The expansion does *not* wrap around.
6. All other cells remain their original color.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were a good first attempt, capturing the core concept of expanding a grey fill from an azure seed. However, the test results on the full training set reveal a crucial flaw: the expansion isn't limited to only replacing white, but should replace *any* color other than azure. The current code only changes white (0) pixels to grey (5).

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each input/output/predicted output triplet. Quantify the errors (e.g., number of mismatched pixels) to understand the extent of the problem.  Use code execution to get precise measurements.
2.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Modify the program to clearly state that the grey fill replaces *all* colors except the azure seed.
3.  **Modify Code:** Update the `transform` function to reflect the revised rule. The primary change will be in the conditional check within the expansion loop.
4.  **Retest:**  After code modification, run the tests again on all training examples to ensure the errors are corrected.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where applicable):**

I will use the given `transform` function and compare its output to provided examples, to confirm my observations about its accuracy.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
