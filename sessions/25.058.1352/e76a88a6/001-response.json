The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). There are distinct colored regions or \"objects\" within each grid. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colored objects with others, maintaining the shape but changing the color. The background color is consistently 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are the \"objects\".\n\n2.  **Conditional Replacement:**\n    *   In the first example, Locate the object made of color '5' (gray). Replace its color with the colors from the top-left object.  The top-left red(2)/yellow(4) object transforms to the top left and is used to recolor the grey(5) object.\n    *   In the second example. Locate the object of color '5'(grey). Replace its color with colors from the top-left object. The top-left magenta(6)/blue(8) object transforms to the top left and is used to recolor the grey(5) object.\n\n3. **Output:** reproduce the input exactly, except apply the color replacement. The key is that replacement color depends on the color in the object in the upper left.\n\nEssentially, the transformation identifies the grey (color 5) colored object and changes it to the color(s) of the object in the upper-left.\n"
