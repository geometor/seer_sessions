Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. There are distinct "objects" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The colors involved are white (0), red (2), yellow (4), and gray (5). The transformation seems to involve a substitution of gray objects by colored ones of the same shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: object_1
    color: red (2)
    shape: L-shape
    initial_position: top-left
  - name: object_2
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: L-shape
    initial_position: adjacent to red, below
  - name: object_3
    color: gray (5)
    shape: square
    initial_position: right side
  - name: object_4
    color: gray(5)
    shape: square
    initial_position: bottom-left

actions:
  - type: substitution
    target: object_3
    replacement: combined colors red (2) and yellow(4), 3x3 square
  - type: substitution
    target: object_4
    replacement: combined colors red(2) and yellow(4), 3x3 square
relationships:
  - object_1 and object_2 are adjacent.
  - object_3 is mirrored in the x axis and its pixels colors are replaced.
  - object_4 is mirrored in the x axis and its pixels colors are replaced.
  - object_3 and object_4 are separate and their shape is 3x3 squares.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. These are the objects.
2.  **Gray Object Focus**: Within the objects, find the grey colored objects (value 5).
3.  **Shape Matching:** Gray objects will have the same size and shapes.
4.  **Replacement:** The gray objects are going to be replaced by 3x3 squares, maintaining relative position to each other.
5. **Color Substitution**: the color gray(5) is replaced by red(2) and yellow(4) in an L shape. The top right pixel is red, the pixel to the left is red. The pixel below this one is yellow.
6. **Mirror**: gray objects are mirrored along x axis.

In summary, gray objects will be replaced by a certain color configuration while maintaining relative position and mirroring along the x axis.
