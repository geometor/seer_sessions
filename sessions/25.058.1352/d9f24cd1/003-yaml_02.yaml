facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid always has a base pattern of vertical red lines.  Every
      other column, starting with the second column (index 1), is red (2).
  - object_identification: |
      Input grids contain pixels of various colors, including gray (5),
      orange (7), blue(1), and others.
  - object_properties:
      - color: The color of a pixel (0-9).
      - position: The (row, column) coordinates of a pixel.
  - action_1: Create a base red line pattern on the output grid.
  - action_2: Preserve certain input pixels on top of the red pattern based on a rule that must be determined. The simple rule based on color 5 does not correctly preserve the orange pixels.
  - preservation_rule_hypothesis: |
     Pixels in odd columns are overwritten with red (value 2). Pixels from the
     input in the even columns are preserved in the output.
