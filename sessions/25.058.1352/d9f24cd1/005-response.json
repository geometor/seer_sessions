Most of the grid is 0 (white), with a few cells of 2 (red) and 5 (gray).\n*   The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid.\n*   The locations of the gray (5) pixels seem to influence, or seed, the placement of red (2) pixels in the output.\n*    There are 2's (red) at the bottom of the input\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If there is space on either side of it, Fill the whole column with 2 (red).\n5. If a column has both red and gray, fill every empty (0) cell to the left of the gray with red.\n\nEssentially, the red pixels from the bottom row get copied to the rest of its respective column.\nAnd the gray pixels cause the propagation of red, from their own position, towards the beginning of rows and to their adjacent columns.\n"
