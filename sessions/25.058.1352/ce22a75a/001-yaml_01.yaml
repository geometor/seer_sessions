    description: A square block replacing the gray pixel in the output.

actions:
  - name: locate
    agent: SEER
    target: gray_pixel
    description: Find the coordinates of each gray pixel in the input grid.
  - name: replace
    agent: SEER
    target: gray_pixel
    replacement: blue_block
    description: Replace each gray pixel with a 3x3 blue block centered on the gray pixel's location.

relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid is derived from the input grid by replacing gray pixels.
  - spatial: The blue block is centered on the original gray pixel's coordinates.
  - size: Input and output have the same dimensions
