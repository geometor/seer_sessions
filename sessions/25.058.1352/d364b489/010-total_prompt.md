Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid containing mostly '0' (white) pixels, with a few '1' (blue) pixels scattered seemingly randomly.
*   **Output:** A 10x10 grid with the same dimensions as the input. It contains a wider variety of colors, including '1' (blue), '2' (red), '6' (magenta), '7' (orange), and '8' (azure). The blue pixels ('1') from the input seem to maintain their positions, but other colors have appeared around them, forming small clusters.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    description: Input and Output grids of same size

  - type: pixel
    values:
      input: [0, 1]
      output: [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8]
    description: Individual cells within the grid, represented by integers.

actions:
  - name: preserve_blue
    input_value: 1
    output_value: 1
    description: Blue pixels in the input remain blue in the output.

  - name: color_expansion
    input_value: 1 #Trigger
    output_value: [2,6,7,8]
    description: Generate colored pixels in proximity to original blue pixels
    details: New colors appear directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to existing blue pixels.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Output colors appear in locations adjacent to the input blue pixels, creating colored clusters.
    details: The position of blue pixels in input is same as the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Blue Pixel Preservation:** Identify all pixels with a value of '1' (blue) in the input grid. Maintain these pixels with a value '1' in the output grid at the identical positions.
3.  **Color Expansion:** For each blue pixel ('1') found in the original input:
    *   Iterate through each of its four directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *  If an adjacent neighbor is white in the output, the value is changed to a new color from the set [2, 6, 7, 8]. The colors are filled in some deterministic order.
4. Ensure the color expansion is determistic, by selecting colors in row major order of blue pixel, top to bottom, left to right, and the same colors in order (2, 6, 7, 8), for all of the adjacent cells.

In essence, the transformation rule keeps the blue pixels and "grows" colored regions around them, filling the adjacent white spaces with new colors in a specific deterministic way.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
