Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The 1s appear to be sparsely placed.
*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), 2s (red), 6s (magenta), 7s (orange), and 8s (azure).
*   The positions of the 1s (blue) in the input seem to correspond to positions of a 3x3 block of non-zero pixels in output, in a specific layout
* The output includes colors that were not present at all in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    input_colors: [0, 1]
    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: transform_pixel
    input: single pixel (color 1)
    output: 3x3 block of pixels
    transformation_rule: >
        Input blue pixel at (r, c) becomes a 3x3 block centered at (r, c)
        in the output grid.
        The 3x3 block has a specific color pattern:
          - Top Left: 2
          - Top Middle:7
          - Top Right: 6
          - Middle Left:8
          - Center: 1
          - Middle Right: (empty - see next point)
          - Bottom Left: (empty - see next point)
          - Bottom Middle: (empty - see next point)
          - Bottom Right: (empty - see next point)
    constraints: >
      Some cells in the 3x3 block created can be overwriten by
      later applications of this rule
      Only cells with values from the input grid can have the rule applied, others are
      left as their original value.

relationships:
    -  input pixel position (r, c) maps to the center of a 3x3 block in the output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is blue (value 1), create a 3x3 block of pixels centered on that pixel's location in the output grid.
3. Apply this rule to each blue pixel:
   *   The pixel at the center of the 3x3 block remains blue (1).
   *   The pixel immediately to the left of center becomes gray(8)
   *   The pixel immediately above and to the left of the center becomes red (2).
   *   The pixel directly above the center becomes orange(7)
   *   The pixel directly above and to the right of center becomes magenta (6).
4.  Pixels in the output grid that are not part of any 3x3 block created by a blue pixel in step 2, retain their input value, implicitly zero
5.  If two or more 3x3 block overlap, pixels are re-written according to the final overlapping transformation.
