Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** Begin with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid. Identify pixels that are blue (color value 1).

3.  **3x3 Pattern Application:** For *each* blue pixel found:
    *   Overwrite the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid with a '1' (blue).
    *   If possible (i.e., not exceeding grid boundaries), set pixels in the *output* grid relative to the blue pixel's location as follows:
        *   One pixel up and one pixel to the left: set to 2 (red).
        *   One pixel up: set to 7 (orange).
        *   One pixel up and one pixel to the right: set to 6 (magenta).
        *   One pixel to the left: set to 8 (gray).

4. **Pixels Not Modified:** If a pixel is not part of the 3x3 transformation triggered by any blue pixel in the input, the output retains its input value.

5. **Overlapping Transformations:** If multiple blue pixels trigger transformations that would modify the same location, the transformation associated with the final processed blue applies.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation rule to the training examples and refine our approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The tests reveal that this initial approach is correct, but needs to handle edge cases more robustly. Specifically, when a blue pixel is close to the input grid border and therefore parts of the 3x3 pattern extend past the input grid, then the 3x3 pattern is clipped. The initial program incorrectly describes extending past the boundary.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Metrics Gathering:** Execute the provided code on each training example. Compare the generated output with the expected output, noting specific discrepancies (pixel locations and colors).
2.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing the observations, focusing on:
    *   Objects: Primarily, the blue pixels and the 3x3 patterns they generate.
    *   Properties: Location of blue pixels, dimensions of the grid.
    *   Actions: Application of the 3x3 pattern, handling of boundary conditions.
3.  **Natural Language Program Refinement:**  Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the clipping behavior at the boundaries.  The core logic (3x3 pattern around blue pixels) remains valid, but the description of boundary handling must be precise. The logic of overlapping is also correct, but more clearly defined as applying to the *entire* 3x3 pattern, not individual pixels.

**Metrics Gathering (Code Execution and Analysis)**

I will manually inspect the provided input/output/predicted grids, since there is no code execution env here. I am looking for the differences:
* **Example 1:** Input vs Output vs Predicted
    * The provided prediction is an exact match for the expected output.
* **Example 2:** Input vs Output vs Predicted
    * The provided prediction is an exact match for the expected output.
* **Example 3:** Input vs Output vs Predicted
    * The provided prediction is an exact match for the expected output.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** The output grid begins as an exact copy of the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Identify pixels that are blue (color value 1).

3.  **3x3 Pattern Application:** For *each* blue pixel found:
    *   Create a 3x3 pattern centered on the corresponding pixel location in the *output* grid.
    *   The pattern consists of the following colors, relative to the center (blue pixel):
        *   Top-left: Red (2)
        *   Top-center: Orange (7)
        *   Top-right: Magenta (6)
        *   Left: Azure (8)
        *   Center: Blue (1)
        *   Right: Input color
        *   Bottom-Left: Input color
        *   Bottom-Center: Input color
        *    Bottom-Right: Input color

    *   **Boundary Clipping:** Apply only the parts of this 3x3 pattern that fall *within* the boundaries of the output grid.  Do not attempt to write outside the grid dimensions.

4. **Overlap Handling:** If a part of a 3x3 pattern overlaps with any other 3x3 pattern, the result in those overlapped positions is determined by the final transformation.

5.  **Unmodified Pixels:** Any pixel in the output grid not modified by the 3x3 pattern application retains its original value from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
