Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterates through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is blue (value 1),
a 3x3 block of pixels centered on that pixel's location in the output grid is
created.

The pixel at the center of the 3x3 block remains blue (1).
The pixel immediately to the left of center becomes gray(8)
The pixel immediately above and to the left of the center becomes red (2).
The pixel directly above the center becomes orange(7)
The pixel directly above and to the right of center becomes magenta (6).

Pixels in the output grid that are not part of any 3x3 block created
retain their input value, implicitly zero.
If two or more 3x3 block overlap, pixels are re-written according to the final
overlapping transformation.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the core concept of expanding blue pixels into a 3x3 pattern. However, it failed to generalize to other cases. A critical issue in the initial approach is the assumption that the output grid is initialized with zeros. This is incorrect; the output grid should start as a copy of the input grid, and only modified where the blue pixel expansion rule applies. The initial approach also only handles grids with values of 0 or 1.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Verify Initial Assumptions:** Double-check the input/output pairs to confirm my understanding of the transformations.
2.  **Gather Specific Feedback:**  I'll analyze the results to pinpoint exactly how the output differs.
3.  **Object, Property, and Action Identification:** Develop a clear YAML-formatted description of the objects, properties, and transformation rule.
4.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Refine the description for increased clarity and accuracy.

**Metrics and Analysis of Examples**

Here is the data I am working with (input, expected, output):

*Example 1*

```
input:
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
expected:
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 2 7 6 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
output:
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 2. 7. 6. 0.]
 [0. 8. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

*Example 2*

```
input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
expected:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [2 7 6 0 0 0]
 [8 1 0 0 2 7]
 [0 0 0 0 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
output:
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [2. 7. 6. 0. 0. 0.]
 [8. 1. 0. 0. 2. 7.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 8. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

*Example 3*

```
input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
expected:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 2 7 6 0 0]
 [0 0 8 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 2 7 6 0 0 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
output:
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 2. 7. 6. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 8. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 2. 7. 6. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 8. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

The generated code works as expected. The issue appears to be that the provided code documentation implies that the output grid is initialized with zeros. The expected outputs are identical to the outputs.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # All possible colors
  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 1 # Blue

actions:
  - name: expand
    input: blue_pixel
    output: 3x3 pattern
    description: >
      A blue pixel triggers the creation of a 3x3 pattern around its
      original location.  The output grid starts as an identical copy of
      the input. The transformation overwrites pixels.
    pattern:
      center: 1      # Blue
      top_left: 2    # Red
      top_center: 7  # Orange
      top_right: 6   # Magenta
      left_center: 8 # Gray
      
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Begin with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid. Identify pixels that are blue (color value 1).

3.  **3x3 Pattern Application:** For *each* blue pixel found:
    *   Overwrite the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid with a '1' (blue).
    *   If possible (i.e., not exceeding grid boundaries), set pixels in the *output* grid relative to the blue pixel's location as follows:
        *   One pixel up and one pixel to the left: set to 2 (red).
        *   One pixel up: set to 7 (orange).
        *   One pixel up and one pixel to the right: set to 6 (magenta).
        *   One pixel to the left: set to 8 (gray).

4. **Pixels Not Modified:** If a pixel is not part of the 3x3 transformation triggered by any blue pixel in the input, the output retains its input value.

5. **Overlapping Transformations:** If multiple blue pixels trigger transformations that would modify the same location, the transformation associated with the final processed blue applies.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
