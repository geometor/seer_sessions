Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule keeps the blue pixels and "grows" colored regions around them, 
filling the adjacent white spaces with new colors in a specific deterministic way.

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Blue Pixel Preservation:** Identify all pixels with a value of '1' (blue) in the input grid. 
    Maintain these pixels with a value '1' in the output grid at the identical positions.
3.  **Color Expansion:** For each blue pixel ('1') found in the original input:
    *   Iterate through each of its four directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    *  If an adjacent neighbor is white in the output, the value is changed to a new color from the set [2, 6, 7, 8]. 
        The colors are filled in some deterministic order.
4. Ensure the color expansion is determistic, by selecting colors in row major order of blue pixel, 
   top to bottom, left to right, and the same colors in order (2, 6, 7, 8), for all of the adjacent cells.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
