"""
1.  **Initialization:** The output grid begins as an exact copy of the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Identify pixels that are blue (color value 1).

3.  **3x3 Pattern Application:** For *each* blue pixel found:
    *   Create a 3x3 pattern centered on the corresponding pixel location in the *output* grid.
    *   The pattern consists of the following colors, relative to the center (blue pixel):
        *   Top-left: Red (2)
        *   Top-center: Orange (7)
        *   Top-right: Magenta (6)
        *   Left: Azure (8)
        *   Center: Blue (1)
        *   Right: Input color
        *   Bottom-Left: Input color
        *   Bottom-Center: Input color
        *    Bottom-Right: Input color

    *   **Boundary Clipping:** Apply only the parts of this 3x3 pattern that fall *within* the boundaries of the output grid.  Do not attempt to write outside the grid dimensions.

4. **Overlap Handling:** If a part of a 3x3 pattern overlaps with any other 3x3 pattern, the result in those overlapped positions is determined by the final transformation.

5.  **Unmodified Pixels:** Any pixel in the output grid not modified by the 3x3 pattern application retains its original value from the input grid.
