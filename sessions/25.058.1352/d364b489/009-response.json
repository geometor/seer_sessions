It contains a wider variety of colors, including '1' (blue), '2' (red), '6' (magenta), '7' (orange), and '8' (azure). The blue pixels ('1') from the input seem to maintain their positions, but other colors have appeared around them, forming small clusters.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Maintain these pixels with a value '1' in the output grid at the identical positions.\n3.  **Color Expansion:** For each blue pixel ('1') found in the original input:\n    *   Iterate through each of its four directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *  If an adjacent neighbor is white in the output, the value is changed to a new color from the set [2, 6, 7, 8]. The colors are filled in some deterministic order.\n4. Ensure the color expansion is determistic, by selecting colors in row major order of blue pixel, top to bottom, left to right, and the same colors in order (2, 6, 7, 8), for all of the adjacent cells.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule keeps the blue pixels and \"grows\" colored regions around them, filling the adjacent white spaces with new colors in a specific deterministic way.\n"
