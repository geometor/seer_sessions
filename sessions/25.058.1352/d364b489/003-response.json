The 1s appear to be sparsely placed.\n*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), 2s (red), 6s (magenta), 7s (orange), and 8s (azure).\n*   The positions of the 1s (blue) in the input seem to correspond to positions of a 3x3 block of non-zero pixels in output, in a specific layout\n* The output includes colors that were not present at all in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
