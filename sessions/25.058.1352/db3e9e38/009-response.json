The input grid contains a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The output grid seems to be derived from the input by a more complex pattern involving the original orange line and adding azure (8) pixels, along with changes in the position of the orange line and changes in the length.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Change the values in this new column to azure(8).\n3.  **Repeat and Alternate**: Repeat Step 2, such that you make one orange and one azure column.\n4. **Adjust length and position**. Shorten the line to length 3, move some of the original orange line to the left. Adjust the overall shape based on new length.\n\nIn summary, the core concept appears to be identifying a vertical line, creating patterned copies to its right, and reducing the overall shape in a specific way.\n"
