Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grid contains a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The output grid seems to be derived from the input by a more complex pattern involving the original orange line and adding azure (8) pixels, along with changes in the position of the orange line and changes in the length.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [7, 8] # 7 rows, 8 columns
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: line
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      orientation: vertical
      start_position: [0, 2] # row 0, column 2
      length: input 5, output 3
      
actions:
    - type: elongation_and_fill
      description: The line creates copies to its right.
      details: original line, copy, alternate colors
      
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: New pixels are added adjacent to existing pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the vertical orange (7) line**: Locate the contiguous vertical line of '7's in the input grid.
2.  **Replicate with changes**: Make a copy of the orange line one column to the right. Change the values in this new column to azure(8).
3.  **Repeat and Alternate**: Repeat Step 2, such that you make one orange and one azure column.
4. **Adjust length and position**. Shorten the line to length 3, move some of the original orange line to the left. Adjust the overall shape based on new length.

In summary, the core concept appears to be identifying a vertical line, creating patterned copies to its right, and reducing the overall shape in a specific way.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
