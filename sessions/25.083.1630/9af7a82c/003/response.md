1.  **Identify Input Rows:** Treat each row of the input grid as a separate sequence of colored pixels.

2.  **Create "L" Shapes:** For each input row:
    *   Take the *first* color in the input row. In the output grid, place this color in the corresponding row and in the first column. This starts building the vertical part of the "L".
    *   Place the first color downwards in the first column until the bottom of the output grid.
    *   Reverse the remaining colors from the input row (excluding the first color).
    *   Place these reversed colors in the corresponding output row, starting from the second column, creating the horizontal part of the "L" adjacent to the vertical element.
    *   extend the horizontal elements

3.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same number of columns as the input grid. The number of output rows is always 5 or 6, whichever most closely matches but exceeds the number of input rows.

4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with 0 (white).
