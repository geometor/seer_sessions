observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids.

    description: Cells have colors represented by digits.
  - type: object
    description: Input contains horizontal lines of single colors as objects.
  - type: transformation
    description: A transformation rule changes rows and adds 0(white) cells.
  - type: dimensions
    description: output grid has same number of columns as input and a constant 5 rows
