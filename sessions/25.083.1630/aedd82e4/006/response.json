            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results, error analysis, and updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs reasonably well, correctly transforming examples 2 and 3. However, it fails on examples 1 and 4. The primary issue seems to be handling multiple red pixels in the bottom-most row and selecting the *leftmost* in that set. The secondary problem is the order of processing. It appears to be correctly identifying, and prioritizing, however example 4 shows the second pixel replacement is misplaced.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Bottom-Most Red Logic:** Specifically address the case where multiple red pixels exist in the bottom-most row. Ensure the *leftmost* of these is selected.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Priority Order:** Example 4 indicates that the pixel above should have been transformed and not the pixel to the side. We need to ensure correct selection of the 2nd pixel after step one is complete.\n3. Document, using YAML, the objects, properties and actions.\n\n**Metrics and Error Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Error:** The bottom-right red pixel is incorrectly changed to blue (1).\n        The next choice is incorrect also.\n    *   **Root Cause:** The code identifies `(4, 3)` which is the most bottom, then\n        the most right, correctly. However, the 2nd replacement should not be\n        the most bottom-right, but the next using the correct priority.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Success:** Correct transformation.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Success:** Correct transformation.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Error:** The code changes two pixels, but changes `(1,2)` before `(2,0)`.\n    *   **Root Cause**: The secondary selection is incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
