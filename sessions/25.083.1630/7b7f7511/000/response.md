Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The output grids appear to be vertically truncated versions of the input grids. The number of rows removed seems to be consistent within each example, but varies across different examples. The horizontal dimension (width) remains unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - width: constant between input and output
      - height: reduced in output compared to input
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - type: transformation
    description: Vertical truncation
    details:
      - operation: Remove rows from the bottom of the input grid.
      - rows_removed:
        - example_1: 3
        - example_2: 4
        - example_3: 3
      - width_change: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a vertical truncation. The output grid is created by removing a fixed number of rows from the *bottom* of the input grid. The number of rows to remove appears to be a property of input. The width of the grid remains constant. The core operation is determining the correct number of rows to remove, which is task specific.
