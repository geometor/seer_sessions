Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels and attempts to replace them with red (2) pixels. However, it fails to accurately replicate the *shape* and *position* of the original azure blocks. The current implementation only places a single red pixel at the top-left corner of where each azure object was located. The core issue is that the `find_center` function only returns the top, left point and the placing of the red blocks does not maintain the shape of the original object.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Representation:** Instead of just storing the top-left corner, we should store the full shape of the azure object.
2.  **Correct Placement:** calculate the correct position where the shape must be replicated to
3.  **Shape Replication:** The code needs to accurately copy the shape of the azure object using red pixels.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, highlighting key observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3, single azure pixel.
    *   Expected: Single red pixel, vertically and horizontally centered.
    *   Actual: Single red pixel at the azure pixel's original location (top left of this object).
    *   Issue: Incorrect placement

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5, 2x2 azure square.
    *   Expected: 2x2 red square, vertically and horizontally centered in the output grid.
    *   Actual: Single red pixel top left corner of original object.
    *   Issue: Incorrect placement, shape not replicated.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5, 1x3 horizontal azure line.
    *   Expected: 1x3 red line, horizontally centered.
    *   Actual: Single red pixel,
    *   Issue: incorrect placement, shape not replicated.

**YAML Fact Extraction:**


```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: single pixel
        position: (0, 1)
    output_objects:
      - color: red (2)
        shape: single pixel
        position: centered
    transformation: replace azure object with red object of the same shape, centered

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: 2x2 square
        position: top-left (0,0)
    output_objects:
      - color: red (2)
        shape: 2x2 square
        position:  centered
    transformation: replace azure object with red object of the same shape, centered

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: 1x3 horizontal line
        position: top row, centered
    output_objects:
      - color: red (2)
        shape: 1x3 horizontal line
        position: centered row
    transformation: replace azure object with red object of the same shape, centered
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Each block is considered a separate object.
2.  **Replicate Shape:** For each identified azure object, create a new object with the exact same shape and size.
3.  **Change Color:** The new object's color should be red (2).
4. **Center placement:** Find the center point (row,col) of the *output* grid, calculate the dimensions (height, width) of each source object and find the placement (top, left) coordinates to correctly place the replicated, red object so it is centered.
5. **Replace and remove:** Remove the original object (set to 0), place to the calculated center coordinates.
6. **Output grid:** Create the output grid by replicating the red object at the center coordinates.
