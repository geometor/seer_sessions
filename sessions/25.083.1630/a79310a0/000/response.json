The azure pixels appear to form contiguous shapes (objects).\n*   **Output:** Grids of the same size as the input, with '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The red pixels seem to mirror the shape and location of the azure objects in the input, but shifted.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve identifying azure objects, and creating red objects of the same shape in a different, specific position relative to the original.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
