Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid. The input grids seem to have a pattern where one color is prominent, and the others are mostly black (0). The output grids also exhibit a pattern, related to the input, but with different colors. The transformation seems to swap the colors, with particular rules of replacing and positioning.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If there are two non-zero colors that appear with equal frequency and not in the center, favor the top left one.\n2.  **Zero the Center:** the center cell of the output grid is always 0.\n3.  **Map Colors**: transform the dominant color to its mapped pair:\n    *   5 (gray) becomes 4 (yellow)\n    *   8 (light blue) becomes 2 (red)\n    *   3 (green) becomes 1 (blue)\n4.  **Rotate Counter-Clockwise:** Place the transformed color in the output grid by rotating the positions of the input color 90 degrees counter-clockwise. For instance, if the color was in the top-left of the *input*, it will be in the top-center in the *output* grid; if on the top-right it goes on the left-center, etc. All positions of the input color are transformed.\n5. **Fill remaining cells**: fill all the other positions with 0\n\n"
