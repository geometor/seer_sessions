"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid to a 3x3 output grid based on these rules:

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 input grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Dominant Color:** Identify the most frequent non-zero color in the *input* grid. Resolve ties by prioritizing the color that appears first, starting from the top-left.
3.  **Rotation:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise to create a *rotated* grid.
4.  **Color Mapping:** Determine the `transformed_color` based on the *original* `dominant_color` using this mapping:
    *   5 (gray) becomes 4 (yellow)
    *   8 (azure) becomes 2 (red)
    *   3 (green) becomes 1 (blue)
5.  **Color Replacement:** In the *rotated* grid, replace the color of cells with the `transformed_color` *only* if the corresponding cell in the *original input* grid had the `dominant_color`.
6.  **Center Zeroing:** Set the center cell (index 1,1) of the *rotated* grid to 0.
7.  **Output:** Return the modified rotated grid as the output.
