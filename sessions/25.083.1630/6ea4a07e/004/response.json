            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the results, analysis, and proposed changes to the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example and, while conceptually on the right track (identifying a dominant color, mapping it, and rotating), it clearly doesn't generalize well to all cases. The primary issue seems to be in the *placement* of the transformed color after rotation. The original code applies the rotation transformation to *each instance* of the dominant color. However, examining the expected outputs, it becomes evident that the transformation isn't about moving individual pixels of the dominant color. Instead, the entire input grid, *as a whole*, appears to be conceptually rotated, and only *then* is the color of the originally-dominant shape replaced by its mapped color. The center is zeroed _after_ the rotation and replacement.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Verify the Dominant Color Logic:** Ensure `get_dominant_color` works correctly in all cases, including ties.\n2.  **Correct the Rotation and Replacement Logic:** Re-conceptualize the transformation. The input grid should be conceptually rotated first. Then the color of dominant object in the _original_ grid should be changed to the mapped value in the _rotated_ grid.\n3. Zero the center.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere, I'll summarize key observations from each example, noting discrepancies between expected and actual outputs.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Dominant Color: 5 (gray)\n    *   Mapped Color: 4 (yellow)\n    *   Issue: Incorrect placement of the yellow pixels. The rotation logic applies to each '5' individually, instead of treating the connected '5's as a single rotated object.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Dominant Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Mapped Color: 2 (red)\n    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the '2's are misplaced due to the incorrect per-pixel rotation.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Dominant Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Mapped Color: 2 (red)\n    *   Issue: Same as above.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Dominant Color: 3 (green)\n    *   Mapped Color: 1 (blue)\n    *   Issue: Same as above.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Dominant Color: 5 (gray)\n    *   Mapped Color: 4 (yellow)\n    *   Issue: Same as above.\n\n*   **Example 6:**\n    *   Input Dominant Color: 8 (azure)\n    *   Mapped Color: 2 (red)\n    *    Issue: Same as above.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
