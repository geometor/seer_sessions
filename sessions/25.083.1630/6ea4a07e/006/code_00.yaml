task: color_rotation_replacement
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 3x3 grid
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - dominant_color: most frequent non-zero color (tie to top-left)

  - name: rotated_grid
    type: 3x3 grid
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - derived_from: input_grid (90-degree counter-clockwise rotation)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 3x3 grid
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - derived_from: rotated_grid
actions:
  - name: find_dominant_color
    input: input_grid
    output: dominant_color
    description: Determine the most frequent non-zero color in the input grid.

  - name: rotate
    input: input_grid
    output: rotated_grid
    description: Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

  - name: map_color
    input: dominant_color
    output: transformed_color
    description: |
      Map the dominant color based on these rules:
        5 -> 4
        8 -> 2
        3 -> 1
      Other colors remain unchanged (although based on the current examples, no change might be more accurate and this requires expansion)

  - name: replace_color
    input:
      - rotated_grid
      - input_grid # needed to know the positions of the dom color
      - dominant_color
      - transformed_color
    output: modified_rotated_grid
    description:  Replace cells in rotated_grid with transformed_color where the corresponding cell in input_grid matched dominant_color.

  - name: zero_center
    input: modified_rotated_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Set the center cell (1,1) of the rotated grid to 0.
