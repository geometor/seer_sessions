    input: grid
    output: color
    rule: >
      Identify the most frequent non-zero color in the input grid.
      If there is a tie, choose the color that appears first, reading
      from top left to bottom right.

  - name: rotation
    input: input_grid, dominant_color, transformed_color
    output: output_grid
    rule: >
       For each cell in the input grid containing the dominant color,
       rotate its position 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the center.
       Place the transformed color in the new position in the output grid.
       The new coordinates (new_r, new_c) for a cell at (r, c) after a 90-degree
       counter-clockwise rotation about the center is defined as new_r = c,
       new_c = 2-r

    input: output_grid
    output: output_grid, center = 0
    rule: the value of the output grid center is always 0
