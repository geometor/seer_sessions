The output grids are consistently 3x3.\n*   **Colors:** Based on the provided color map, 0 represents white, 1 represents blue, and 9 represents maroon. The output grids' 2 represents red.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The input grids seem to have a top section (composed of 0s and 9s) and a bottom section (composed of 0s and 1s). The output appears to be derived *only* from the top section of the input. The bottom section seems irrelevant for the transformation.\n* There is always one and only one 2 in each row, and one and only one 2 in each column of the outputs.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore the bottom section of the grid, which contains 0's and 1's.\n2.  **Reduce Dimensions:** Create output of 3x3\n3.  **Transform Maroon to Red:** Within the top section, Identify the cells where the value is 9 (maroon). In the corresponding position of the output grid, change the value to 2 (red).\n4. **Fill Remainder with white:** All other values in the output grid should be 0 (white)\n5. Make sure the result has one and only one red cell in each row, and one and only one in each column.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies '9's in the top section of the input and maps them to '2's in the output, forming a smaller 3x3 output grid, and disregarding any information from the bottom section of the original input grid.\n"
