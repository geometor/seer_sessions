    description: >
      The position of maroon pixels in the top section of the input grid determines the
      position of red pixels in the output grid. The bottom section (defined by the
      presence of blue pixels) of the input grid is ignored. If a row contains only
      0's after any 9's are accounted for, that row should be all 0 in the output.
      The output grid is filled top to bottom, left to right, based on encountering maroon
      pixels in the input grid from top to bottom, left to right.
  - observation:
      description: >
          The output grid is filled with Red(2) based on the following rule: 
          The first three distinct columns of the input that contain a Maroon(9) 
          define the columns of the output.
          The first three distinct rows of the input that contain a Maroon(9)
          define the rows of the output.
          The output grid is 3x3.
