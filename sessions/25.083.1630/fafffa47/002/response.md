Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code has several issues, primarily stemming from how it maps the maroon (9) pixels in the input to the red (2) pixels in the output. It seems to be attempting a modulo-based mapping, and includes a mechanism to prevent duplicate assignments to output grid, but this approach is not consistently aligning with the expected outputs. The core problem is not identifying the correct *presence* of red pixels, but their correct *position* within the 3x3 output grid.

The strategy should shift to accurately determining the row and column index of the red pixels in the output based on the input. It also does not need to consider a resize or reduce.

**Gather Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the pattern, let's analyze the input and output grids, focusing on the position of the maroon (9) pixels and their corresponding red (2) pixels.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_positions(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)

    maroon_positions = np.where(input_grid == 9)
    red_positions = np.where(output_grid == 2)

    print("Maroon (9) Pixel Positions (Input):")
    for r, c in zip(maroon_positions[0], maroon_positions[1]):
        print(f"  Row: {r}, Col: {c}")

    print("\nRed (2) Pixel Positions (Output):")
    for r, c in zip(red_positions[0], red_positions[1]):
        print(f"  Row: {r}, Col: {c}")
    print("-" * 30)

    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_colors: [0, 1, 9] # white, blue, maroon
      - variable_size: True
  - object: output_grid

    description: >
      The position of maroon pixels in the top section of the input grid determines the
      position of red pixels in the output grid. The bottom section (defined by the
      presence of blue pixels) of the input grid is ignored. If a row contains only
      0's after any 9's are accounted for, that row should be all 0 in the output.
      The output grid is filled top to bottom, left to right, based on encountering maroon
      pixels in the input grid from top to bottom, left to right.
  - observation:
      description: >
          The output grid is filled with Red(2) based on the following rule: 
          The first three distinct columns of the input that contain a Maroon(9) 
          define the columns of the output.
          The first three distinct rows of the input that contain a Maroon(9)
          define the rows of the output.
          The output grid is 3x3.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Top Section:** Examine the input grid from the top row down. Stop at the first row that contains a blue (1) pixel. The section above this row is the "top section".

2.  **Determine the Output Grid:**
    *   Examine the top section of the input, searching for Maroon (9) pixels.
    *   Maintain two lists, one of the first three distinct columns and another of the first three distinct rows that contain a Maroon (9)
    *   Iterate across the identified top section from top to bottom and left to right.
    *   Iterate across each maroon cell: place a red pixel at the output using the row and column indices from the lists maintained above.

3. **All other output pixels are white**
