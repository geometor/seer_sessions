The transformation involves identifying a specific set of diagonals within the grid and shifting the cell values along those diagonals. The set of diagonals to shift includes every other diagonal that runs parallel to the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). Consider the main diagonal as 'diagonal 0', and number subsequent parallel diagonals above and below, increasing outwards. The rule shifts elements along only the *odd-numbered* diagonals. The shift is downwards and to the right, and it *wraps* around the grid boundaries. For each odd-numbered diagonal, each cell's value moves to the cell below and to the right. If this move takes it off the bottom of the grid, wrap to the top row; if the move takes it off the right side, wrap it to the left-most column.
