objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: diagonal
    type: list
    properties:
      offset: integer (positive, negative, or zero)
      elements: integers (from grid cells)
      row_indices: list of integers
      col_indices: list of integers
  - name: shifted_diagonal
      type: list
      properties:
          elements: integer (from grid cells)

actions:
  - name: get_diagonal
    input: grid, offset
    output: diagonal, row_indices, col_indices
    description: Extracts elements along a diagonal with wrapping.
  - name: shift_diagonal
    input: diagonal
    output: shifted_diagonal
    description: Cyclically shifts elements of a diagonal down by one position.
  - name: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Iterates through diagonals, shifts odd-offset diagonals, and updates the output grid.

rules:
  - Diagonals are defined by an offset from the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
  - Positive offsets represent diagonals below the main diagonal.
  - Negative offsets represent diagonals above the main diagonal.
  - Offset 0 is the main diagonal.
  - Odd-offset diagonals are cyclically shifted down by one position.
  - Even-offset diagonals remain unchanged.
  - Wrapping occurs at grid boundaries.
