Diagonals parallel to the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are considered. The main diagonal has an offset of 0, diagonals below have positive offsets, and those above have negative offsets. Odd-offset diagonals have their elements cyclically shifted down by one position, *without* wrapping at this stage. Even-offset diagonals remain unchanged. The crucial change is that the wrapping, which was previously implicit in the diagonal extraction, is now handled *explicitly* when placing elements back into the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_diagonal(input_grid, offset):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the elements along a specified diagonal, *without* wrapping.\n    Returns the elements, and unwrapped row/col indices.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The 2D numpy array.\n        offset: The offset from the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    diagonal = []\n    row_indices = []\n    col_indices = []\n    for i in range(max(rows, cols)):\n        row = i - max(0, offset)\n        col = i + max(0, -offset)\n        if 0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols:\n            diagonal.append(input_grid[row, col])\n            row_indices.append(row)\n            col_indices.append(col)\n    return diagonal, row_indices, col_indices\n\ndef shift_diagonal(diagonal):\n    \"\"\"Shifts a list (representing a diagonal) by one position down, wrapping.\"\"\"\n    return [diagonal[-1]] + diagonal[:-1]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through all possible diagonal offsets\n    for offset in range(-rows + 1, cols):\n        # Get the original diagonal and its indices *without* wrapping\n        original_diagonal, row_indices, col_indices = get_diagonal(input_grid, offset)\n\n        # Shift the diagonal values based on offset parity\n        if offset % 2 != 0:\n            shifted_diagonal = shift_diagonal(original_diagonal)\n        else:\n            shifted_diagonal = original_diagonal\n\n        # Update the output_grid with the shifted values, *now* applying wrapping\n        for i in range(len(row_indices)):\n            output_grid[row_indices[i] % rows, col_indices[i] % cols] = shifted_diagonal[i]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
