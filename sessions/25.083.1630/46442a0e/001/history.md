## train_1

**input:**
```
7 7 8

**output:**
```

## train_2

**input:**
```
8 6
6 8
```


**output:**
```
8 6 6 8

6 8 8 6
8 6 6 8
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
6 9 9
6 4 4
6 4 4
```


**output:**
```
6 9 9 6 6 6
6 4 4 4 4 9

6 6 6 9 9 6
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The input grids appear to be smaller than the output grids.
*   The output grids seem to be a patterned expansion of the input grids. It looks like a form of mirroring and possibly repeating the original input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [variable height and width]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [larger than input_grid]

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Increase the size of the grid.
  - name: mirror_reflect
    description: Create a symmetrical reflection of elements.
  - name: repeat
    description: Duplicate elements.

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The output_grid is a transformed version of the input_grid, created by expansion, reflection, and repetition.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Input:** Duplicate the input grid horizontally, placing the duplicate to the immediate right of the original.
2.  **Double (again):** Duplicate the *result* from Step 1, this time *vertically*, placing the duplicate immediately below the result from step one.
3.  **Double, Mirror, Flip Colors** From the original input create a grid that has the columns of the input grid, doubled and mirrored, and flip the colors to complete the border

Let's break this down a little more and relate it to specific actions in terms of rows and columns:

*   The output grid's width is twice the input grid's width *plus* the input grid's width, mirrored.
*   The output grid's height is twice the input grid's height.
*   The top-left quadrant of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
*    The top-right quadrant contains the same colored pixes, mirrored horizontally.
*    The original input pixels appear in the top left and bottom right.
*   The rest of the pixels will appear mirrored.

I believe this program accurately captures the transformation. It involves reflecting across both horizontal and vertical axes.
