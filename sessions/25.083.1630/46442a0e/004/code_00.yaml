facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      shape: variable (rows x cols)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      shape: derived from input_grid ( (2*rows) + (rows==1) x (2*cols) + (cols==1))
  - action: double_input
    description: The input grid is doubled horizontally and vertically.
    input: input_grid
    output: intermediate_grid
  - action: mirror_edges
    description: The edges of the input grid are mirrored.
    input: input_grid
    output: frame_edges

  - relation: output contains core
    description: The output grid is built by adding a mirrored frame to the original grid
  - relation: output_dimensions
    description: The output dimensions relate to the input dims by rows_out = 2*rows_in if rows_in > 1 else 3 and cols_out = 2*cols_in if cols_in > 1 else 3
