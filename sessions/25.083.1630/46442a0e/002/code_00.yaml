  example_3:
    input_object:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [6, 9, 4]
    output_object:

    transformation:
      type: mirroring with edge reflection
      description: >
        The input grid is doubled horizontally and vertically to create a core.
        The edges of the core are then reflected to form an outer frame.
      details:
          - the central section is doubled horizontally, then the result is
            doubled vertically
          - the "frame" section is created by mirroring each edge.
