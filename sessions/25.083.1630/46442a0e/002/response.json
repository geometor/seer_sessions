            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs a basic mirroring operation, doubling the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This approach works perfectly for the first two examples but fails on the third. The third example reveals a more complex transformation where the mirrored reflection does not perfectly match a simple doubling. There is an issue of positional misalignment of some of the values in the mirroring.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** We need to pinpoint exactly *where* the output of example 3 deviates from the expected output. Visual inspection (which I'll simulate with code) is crucial.\n2.  **Object Identification:** We need to re-evaluate if there is a simple object being manipulated. The initial assumption might be that the entire grid is being mirrored as is. We'll look for different object types and actions.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the error analysis and a refined understanding of the objects, the natural language description of the transformation needs a major update to reflect the true logic.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Example 3:**\n\n"
