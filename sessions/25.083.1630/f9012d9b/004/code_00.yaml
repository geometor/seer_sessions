example1:
  input:
    rows: 4
    cols: 4
    grid_pattern: "Alternating rows and columns of mixed 8s, 6s, and a single 0."
    repeating_unit: "single element [8]"
    repeating_unit_size: [1,1]
  output:
     rows: 1
     cols: 1

example2:
  input:
    rows: 5
    cols: 5
    grid_pattern: "A 2x2 repeating sub-grid with some variations in the bottom rows."
    repeating_unit: "2x2 subgrid"
    repeating_unit_size: [2,2]
  output:
    rows: 2
    cols: 2

example3:
  input:
    rows: 7
    cols: 7
    grid_pattern: "A complex pattern with a potential 2x2 repeating sub-grid"
    repeating_unit: "2x2 subgrid"
    repeating_unit_size: [2,2]
  output:
