## train_1

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6

8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```


**output:**
```
8
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```


**output:**
```
1 1

## train_3

**input:**
```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2

**output:**
```

5 2

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perceiving the transformation logic and documenting the process:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** The input consists of rectangular grids of varying dimensions. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, which can be interpreted as a color. The grids feature various colors and patterns, sometimes with repeating elements.
*   **Output:** The output is also a rectangular grid, but significantly smaller than the input. It also consists of single-digit integers (colors) that appear in the input, and appears to be a very reduced, minimal selection of the input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting a specific, smaller rectangular portion or specific values of the input grid. It is not immediately obvious what the selection rule is, but it seems based on relative position, or some kind of minimal pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and of varying dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular and smaller than input grids.
  - observation: All colors in the output grid are present in the input grid.
  - observation: The input often contains repeated color patterns/stripes/other.
  - hypothesis: The transformation might involve identifying and extracting a recurring sub-pattern.
  - hypothesis: In train_2, 1 is central to the repeating stripe.
  - hypothesis: In train_3, 5 is the largest area of a single color (excluding borders).
  - hypothesis: The output might represent the most prominent or centrally located color/pattern.
  - observation: There are horizontal and vertical elements and also possible diagonals.
  - question: How is the size and position of the output grid determined?
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all the distinct colors present.
2.  Identify the most prominent or most frequent colored rectangle that repeats, or,
    alternatively, is in the center of the grid.
3.  If multiple colors are equally prominent, consider those that form the largest connected area.
4.  Extract a section that minimally represents the pattern.
5.  Return the extracted section as the output grid.

**Refinements/Assumptions:**

*   The concept of "prominence" or "central" needs further clarification. It might involve frequency, area, position, or a combination of these factors.
*   In train\_1, the simplest explanation is that it is selecting the top-left value, or alternatively the most frequent value (not unique in train\_2 or train\_3.

Let's refine the interpretation with a little more focus on frequency and centrality, and combining different approaches to handle each example:

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid, noting all colors and their arrangement.
2. **Find most Frequent:** Find the single value that is most frequent. If the most frequent is not unique, proceed.
3.  **Identify Central Pattern:** Look for a repeating color pattern, particularly around the center of the grid, or extending out from the center.
4.  **Extract Representative Sub-grid:** Select the smallest sub-grid that captures this central pattern. If no clear central pattern is present:
5.  **Largest Area (Fallback):** Identify the color that occupies the largest contiguous area within the grid (excluding the "background" or border color if there is an obvious one).
6. **Minimal Output:** extract a minimal pattern representation.
7.  **Return:** Create an output grid containing this sub-grid or minimal representation.
