Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and outlining a natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both rectangular grids of digits (representing colors).
*   **Dimensions:** The output grid is consistently smaller than the input grid, specifically in terms of columns. The number of rows appears related to a subset of rows in the input.
*   **Digit Preservation:** Some digits from the input grid are present in the output grid, suggesting a selection or filtering process rather than generation of new digits.
*   **Column Reduction:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific columns from the input.
*   **Row Selection:** It seems like only the rows that contained the columns that made it into the output grid appear in the output

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of digits.
  - property: dimensions
    description: Output grid has fewer columns than input grid.
  - property: row_selection
    description: Output rows appear to be a subset of the original input rows.
  - property: column_selection
    description: Output columns appear to be a subset of the original input columns.
  - action: selection
    description: The transformation selects a subset of columns from the input.
  - relationship: input_output
    description: Digits in output grid exist within the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the input grid and determine which columns will be included in the output grid. It seems the program will select the leftmost two columns.
2. **Select Columns**: Copy the identified two columns from input to the output.
3. **Select Rows**: Select only the rows that had data selected.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts a fixed-width subgrid from the leftmost area of the input grid.
