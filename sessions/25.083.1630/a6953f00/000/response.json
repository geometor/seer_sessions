The number of rows appears related to a subset of rows in the input.\n*   **Digit Preservation:** Some digits from the input grid are present in the output grid, suggesting a selection or filtering process rather than generation of new digits.\n*   **Column Reduction:** The transformation seems to involve selecting specific columns from the input.\n*   **Row Selection:** It seems like only the rows that contained the columns that made it into the output grid appear in the output\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
