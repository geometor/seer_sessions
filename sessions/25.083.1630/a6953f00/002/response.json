            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to refine the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic, only extracting the first two columns without considering the actual transformation logic present in all examples. The results clearly show the generated outputs don't match the expected outputs in size or content across all examples. The strategy needs to shift from simply selecting columns to identifying a pattern in how the input relates to the output, focusing on the first two *output* rows, not the first two *input* columns.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs to discern a consistent relationship. The current code works based on the assumption from a single case and fails to capture other complexities.\n2.  **Focus on Output:** It will likely be easier to find rules to create the correct output\n3.  **Identify Objects and Actions:** Deconstruct the grids into constituent objects (contiguous blocks of color) and analyze how their properties (position, color) change from input to output.\n4. **Iterative Refinement:** Successive applications of proposed code to all provided examples, with detailed reports on why it fails, will help to refine the accuracy of the solution.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (without code execution yet, as it's a visual pattern problem):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 4x4 grid\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 grid (first two columns of input, *but only the first two rows*)\n    *   Observed Error: Output includes all rows of the first two input columns.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Expected Output: 3x2 grid (first two columns of input, *but only the first two rows*)\n    *   Observed Error: Output includes all rows of the first two input columns.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid\n    *   Expected Output: 5x2 grid (first two columns of input, *but only the first two rows*)\n    *   Observed Error: Output includes all rows of the first two input columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
