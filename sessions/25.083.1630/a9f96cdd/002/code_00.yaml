facts:
  - observation: "Each input grid contains at most one red pixel (value 2)."
  - object: "Red pixel"
    property: "Serves as a marker for transformation."
  - observation: "The output grid's dimensions are always the same as input grid."
  - observation: |
      When a red pixel is in the input grid, three new colored pixels are inserted somewhere in the output.
  - observation: |
    The three new colored pixels are horizontally adjacent.
  - pattern: |
      [3, 0, 6] appears above [8, 0, 7] when the red pixel is in the second input row
      [8, 0, 7] appears in output row index=1 when red pixel is row index 0 of the input grid
      [0,0,0,3,0] apperas in output row index 1 when red pixel is in row index 2 of the input
  - action: "If the input contains one red pixel, insert a pattern based on relative position of the red pixel."
  - condition: "Input grid has a single red pixel."
