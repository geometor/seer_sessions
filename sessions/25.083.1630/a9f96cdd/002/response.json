While it correctly handled examples 1, 3, and 4, it failed on example 2. The primary issue is that the code is too specific about *where* it inserts the pre-defined pattern or parts of the pattern, and when, depending on the row in which the red pixel appears. It seems to be trying to predict the row and column positioning of the output pattern rather than generalizing the transformation rule. The strategy should be to focus on a more general rule that applies to all cases, based on the common elements of the examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n1.  **Identify Common Elements:** Analyze all examples to determine a pattern not based on row position, but some other aspect.\n2.  **Generalize Rule:** Formulate a rule that describes the transformation.\n3. **Rewrite Natural Language Program:** State the new rule clearly.\n4. **Facts:** Describe the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**\n\n"
