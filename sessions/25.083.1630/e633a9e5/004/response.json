            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of doubling the size of the grid and replicating elements. However, the code has an error in how it handles the expansion. It's creating a 2x2 block for *each* element, but the placement of these blocks is slightly off, causing an incorrect final output size and misaligned elements. Essentially, the output is not the 2x2 block, rather than tiling, the blocks overlap.\n\nThe provided results show a consistent pattern: the output grid is always *larger* than the expected output, and the elements are repeated, but not in the precise arrangement expected. The core issue seems to be with the indexing when placing the 2x2 blocks in the output grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Understand Expected vs. Actual:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Focus on the *precise* mapping of input cells to output cells.\n2.  **Correct Indexing:** The key is to fix the indexing in the code so that each input element `input_grid[i, j]` correctly maps to the top-left corner of its corresponding 2x2 block in `output_grid`.\n3.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code to confirm the dimensions and check specific cell discrepancies in addition to the initial attempt.\n4.  **Fact YAML:** Represent the input, expected output, and program in YAML form.\n5. **Update Natural Language Program:** Precisely describe the correct transformation.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Code Execution):**\n\n"
