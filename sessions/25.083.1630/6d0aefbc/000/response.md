Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are different but related. The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid.
*    The transformation involves some form of mirroring or reflection of the input grid's elements, both horizontally and vertically.
*   The core structure/shape of the input seems to be preserved and duplicated in the output.

**YAML Block - Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: variable, derived from input_grid (e.g., 3x6)
      - elements: integers (0-9), a transformation of input_grid elements
actions:
  - name: reflection
    description: Mirroring of the input grid's elements.
    types:
      - horizontal
      - vertical
relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: output_grid is a transformed version of input_grid.
  - type: dimensional
    description: output_grid dimensions are double, width is double the input width, and height is the same as the input height.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input:** Receive a grid of integers (input\_grid).
2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Create a mirrored copy of the input\_grid by reversing the order of elements within each row.
3.  **Concatenate:** Combine the original input\_grid and its horizontally mirrored copy, placing the mirrored copy to the right of the original. The width of the new grid is twice the width of the input.
4. **Output:** The resulting concatenated grid is the output\_grid.

In simple terms, the program takes each input row, reverses the order, and sticks the reversed row next to the original.
