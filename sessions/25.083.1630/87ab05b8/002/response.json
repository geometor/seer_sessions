            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the first code iteration and refine our natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it's clear that the rule, as implemented, doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that it's changing the wrong pixels, specifically, the 2x2 square is positioned wrong and also, its content does not consider the color already present. The initial rule was \"Locate the bottom-right pixel of a color other than 6. Then change a 2x2 area including, and up and to the left of, the pixel found. All other pixels stay the same.\" It is close but too naive.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully look at all input/output pairs to identify the *consistent* transformation rule. The initial assumption about the bottom-right non-6 pixel was a good starting point, but we need adjust what it means for the current task.\n2.  **Refine Pixel Selection:** Determine the precise logic for selecting which pixels to modify and what their final color is.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the refined rule.\n4.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Think about any potential edge cases (e.g., grids with all background color) and how the rule should handle them. Since ARC task always have solution, there should be none.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's use a more structured approach to record observations. Here is a YAML block of information from each example, followed by observations derived with the aid of code execution.\n\n"
