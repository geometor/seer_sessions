objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - dimensions: (rows, cols)  # Same for input and output
        - background_color: 6 # Magenta
  - target_object:
      type: single_pixel
      properties:
        - original_color: varies  # Color of the pixel that changes
        - row: varies
        - col: varies
  - modified_object:
      type: rectangle
      properties:
        - color: varies # Color from the lower right corner.
        - dimensions: (2, 2)  # Always a 2x2 square
        - top_left_row: varies
        - top_left_col: varies

actions:
  - identify_target:
      description: Find the bottom-right pixel that IS NOT the background color
      constraints:
        - color != 6

  - modify_grid:
      description: Replace a 2x2 region with single color
      parameters:
        - top_left_row:  row of pixel above and to the left of bottom right pixel.
        - top_left_col:  col of pixel above and to the left of bottom right pixel.
        - color: the original value/color of the target

relationships:
  - spatial:
      - target_object is within grid
      - modified_object is within grid
      - modified_object replaces area including target, and 1 row and 1 col up and left of it.
  - transformation:
      - grid transforms input to output
      - target_object color determines modified_object color
