## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x79ABB1305F90>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x64 at 0x79ABB1305D50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another, smaller grid. The input grid contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, consisting only of red (2) pixels. The dimensions change from 3x3 in the input to 1x3 in the output. The key element seems to be the presence and count of the red pixels, irrespective of their position in the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 1x3 grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of color white (0) and red (2).
  - observation: Output grid contains only red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The number of red pixels in the output matches the number of red pixels in the input.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 1x3
      colors: [2]
  - relationship: output_grid represents a compressed form of the input_grid, retaining only the red pixels
  - action: count_red_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: number of red pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Construct:** Create a new 1 x N grid, where N is the count of red pixels obtained in step 1.
3.  **Populate:** Fill all cells of the new grid with the value 2 (red).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
