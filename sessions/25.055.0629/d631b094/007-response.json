The input grid contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, consisting only of red (2) pixels. The dimensions change from 3x3 in the input to 1x3 in the output. The key element seems to be the presence and count of the red pixels, irrespective of their position in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
