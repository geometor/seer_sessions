Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array)

    # Convert the rotated array back to a list.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (90-degree counter-clockwise rotation) was too simplistic. While it might have worked for the first example, it's clearly not the general rule applicable to all examples. The consistent failures suggest a different, likely more complex, transformation is at play. My strategy will be to:

1.  **Visually inspect** each input-output pair to identify potential patterns, object manipulations, or relationships that the rotation missed.
2.  **Focus on discrepancies:** Analyze where the `np.rot90` function's output differs from the expected output. This will highlight the aspects of the transformation that are *not* simple rotations.
3. **Consider alternative geometric transformations:**. Reflections, translations, and potentially even combinations of operations might be involved. The shapes may alter.
4. **Object interaction** there may be interaction between objects and their environment.
5.  **Re-evaluate Priors**: Ensure that the solution aligns with the ARC priors (objectness, goal-directedness, numbers, geometry).

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution for Verification):**

I'll use Python code to generate reports on sizes, unique colors, and differences, but I'll present them in a human-readable way. I will refer to each example with this dict:

```python
examples = {
    'example_1': train_examples[0],
    'example_2': train_examples[1],
    'example_3': train_examples[2]
}
```

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def grid_differences(grid1, grid2):
    """Counts the number of differing pixels between two grids."""
    if len(grid1) != len(grid2) or len(grid1[0]) != len(grid2[0]):
        return -1 # Indicate incompatible sizes.
    return sum(1 for i in range(len(grid1)) for j in range(len(grid1[0])) if grid1[i][j] != grid2[i][j])


def analyze_examples(examples, transform_function):
    results = {}
    for example_name, example in examples.items():
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output_grid = example['output']
        predicted_output_grid = transform_function(input_grid)

        results[example_name] = {
            'input_shape': (len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0])),
            'output_shape': (len(expected_output_grid), len(expected_output_grid[0])),
            'predicted_output_shape': (len(predicted_output_grid), len(predicted_output_grid[0])),
            'input_colors': sorted(list(set(pixel for row in input_grid for pixel in row))),
            'output_colors': sorted(list(set(pixel for row in expected_output_grid for pixel in row))),
            'predicted_output_colors': sorted(list(set(pixel for row in predicted_output_grid for pixel in row))),
            'differences_expected_predicted': grid_differences(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid)
        }
    return results

# Assuming 'train_examples' is defined in the context as shown in the problem
examples = {
    'example_1': train_examples[0],
    'example_2': train_examples[1],
    'example_3': train_examples[2]
}

analysis = analyze_examples(examples, transform)

for example_name, metrics in analysis.items():
    print(f"--- {example_name} ---")
    for key, value in metrics.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
