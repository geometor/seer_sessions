## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x79ABB1668520>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x79ABB1669A50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation of the entire grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers 0-9
  - transformation:
      type: rotation
      direction: counter-clockwise
      angle: 90 degrees
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. This means the top row of the input becomes the left column of the output, the middle row of the input becomes the middle column of the output, and the bottom row of the input becomes the right column of the output. The individual pixel values (colors) remain unchanged during the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
