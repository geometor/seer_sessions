The output is a much smaller grid, also with colored pixels. The colors in the input are white, blue, and red, while the colors in the output are blue and white. The output seems related to a specific feature within the input, specifically blue regions. The output width appears to be determined by the number of discrete blue colored regions along a single axis.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

For each distinct blue area found, place a blue(1) block in the output.\n5.  If no blue regions are present fill the last column with white(0).\n\nIn simpler terms: The transformation counts the number of horizontally separated blue regions in the input grid and creates a single-row output grid where each cell corresponds to one of these regions. The presence of any blue region creates a blue pixel; otherwise, the result will be a white pixel.\n"
