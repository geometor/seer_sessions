The output is a 1x5 grid, also containing single-digit integers (0 and 1). The colors in the input seem to be primarily blue (1), white (0), and red (2). The output is mostly blue, with one white pixel at the end. There's a significant reduction in size and complexity from input to output. It appears we are extracting and simplifying specific information from the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
