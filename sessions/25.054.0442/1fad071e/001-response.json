The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid only contains white (0) and blue (1). The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (9x9 input vs. 1x5 output). The reduction in size suggests a summarizing or aggregating operation, not a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping. The colors present in the output suggest we're looking for the presence/absence of those colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Fill out all other unassigned output with white.\n\nEssentially, the program appears to perform a presence and quantity check for the color blue, resulting in the output showing the number of distinct areas, up to a maximum of at least 2, and padding the rest of a 5-width grid with white.\n"
