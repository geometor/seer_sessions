## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 0 0 7 0 0 9 7 0
8 4 0 6 6 0 4 8 4
1 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
1 1 0 9 1 0 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0
8 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 0
0 7 0 9 9 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 2 4 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7AA3AFB7E800>

**output:**
```
9 7 0
4 8 4
4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFBB93C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a different color. The transformation appears to be a selection or extraction of a specific region within the input grid, rather than a manipulation of the pixel values themselves. The output grid seems to maintain the relative positions of the pixels from the input grid. The critical challenge is to determine the rule governing which part of the input grid is selected to form the output. The colors used in the input not present in the output are: green, blue, gray, magenta.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 9x9
  data_type: integer (0-9)
  colors: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
output:
  type: 2D grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  data_type: integer (0-9)
  colors: [white, orange, azure, maroon, yellow]
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      elements: pixels with color values
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels with color values
actions:
  - type: selection/extraction
    description: A sub-grid is selected from the input_grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of pixels in the output_grid are preserved from the input_grid.
  - type: subset
    description: output grid pixels are a subset of the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Sub-Grid:** Locate a 3x3 sub-grid within the 9x9 input grid. The top-left corner is at row 0, column 6.
2.  **Extract the output:** The output grid are the values inside the sub-grid.

In essence, the program extracts a 3x3 region from the top-right corner of the input grid to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
