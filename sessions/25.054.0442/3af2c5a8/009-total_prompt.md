Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid's dimensions (height and width) are doubled to determine the output grid's dimensions. The input grid is then replicated four times, creating a 2x2 grid of the original pattern, to form the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get input grid dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate output grid dimensions
    output_height = 2 * input_height
    output_width = 2 * input_width

    # Initialize output grid with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Replicate the input grid to fill the output grid
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            output_grid[i * input_height:(i + 1) * input_height, j * input_width:(j + 1) * input_width] = input_grid
    
    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
