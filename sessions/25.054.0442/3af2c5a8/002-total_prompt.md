## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0
0 8 0 8
0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7AA3AFB37D90>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7AA3AFB35150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid. The input grid appears to be smaller (3x4) than the output grid (6x8). The primary color involved seems to be '8' (azure), with '0' (white) as the background. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or replication of the original pattern. The key operation seems to be duplicating both rows and columns and shifting the elements.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    shape: 3x4
    dominant_color: 8 (azure)
    background_color: 0 (white)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    shape: 6x8
    dominant_color: 8 (azure)
    background_color: 0 (white)

  - relation: output_grid_dimensions
    description: Output grid is double the size of the input grid in both dimensions.

  - action: replication
    description: The input grid pattern is replicated and expanded.

  - observation: row_duplication
    description: "each row in input becomes two rows in output"

  - observation: column_duplication_and_shifting
    description: each column is duplicated, azure values are moved to the next column over

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Rows:** Duplicate each row of the input grid. This transforms a 3x4 grid into a 6x4 grid.
2.  **Double, and shift Columns:** For the 6x4 grid, duplicate each column. However, in the duplicated column, shift any non-zero values to the position of value to it's right in the input. If there is no value to its right, the values are not placed.

In essence, the transformation takes each row, duplicates it, and each
column, duplicates and shifts.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
