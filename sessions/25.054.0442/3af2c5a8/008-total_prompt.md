## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 3 3
0 3 0 3
3 3 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7AA3AFB35150>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0
0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0
3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3
3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3
0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0
0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7AA3AFE5FA90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The grids contain two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid appears to be a scaled-up and somewhat mirrored version of the input grid. The core pattern seems to be a replication of the input, with an added mirroring effect.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 3]
      dimensions: [3, 4]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 3]
      dimensions: [6, 8]
  - observation: output_grid_height: 2 * input_grid_height
  - observation: output_grid_width: 2 * input_grid_width
  - observation: pattern_replication: input grid is replicated and mirrored to form the output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The input grid's dimensions (height and width) are doubled to determine the output grid's dimensions.

2.  **Replicate and Mirror:**
    *   The original input grid forms the top-left quadrant.
    *    Bottom-left quadrant: a copy of the top-left quadrant.
    *   Top-right quadrant: a copy of the top-left quadrant.
    *   Bottom-right quadrant: a copy of the top-left quadrant.

In effect, the input is replicated four times and combine to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
