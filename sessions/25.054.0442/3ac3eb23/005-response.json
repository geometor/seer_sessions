            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of replicating non-zero pixels downwards, alternating with zeros. However, the results show this isn't quite right. The generated outputs consistently replicate the non-zero color *only on odd rows beneath the original*, and always fill with zero on the even rows. The actual outputs show an alternating pattern of the original color and zero *centered on the original pixel location* - spreading both up and down. The original color alternates both up and down the columns of the grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine the provided input/expected output/transformed output triples, paying close attention to the differences.\n2.  **Identify the True Pattern:** Determine the *precise* rule governing the transformation, focusing on how each non-zero pixel affects its column. It seems like it will be a vertical, centered, alternating expansion.\n3. **Refine Program Description:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the corrected transformation logic.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI need to determine the precise transformation rule to accurately describe the changes. It's clear that the transformation is column-based and involves an alternating pattern centered on original, colored pixels.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two non-zero pixels: (0,1) = 2 (red), (0,5) = 8 (azure)\n    *   Expected Output shows an alternating pattern of red/white and azure/white in those columns.\n    *    Actual output incorrectly replicates.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has one non-zero pixels: (0,1) = 4 (yellow)\n    *   Expected Output shows an alternating pattern of yellow/white in that column.\n    *    Actual output incorrectly replicates\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid initiate an alternating pattern in their respective columns.\n  - observation: The pattern consists of the original pixel's color alternating with white (0).\n  - observation: The original pixel is the center of the alternating pattern in that column.\n  - observation: The pattern extends upwards and downwards from the original pixel's row.\n  - object: column_pattern\n    properties:\n      original_color: color of the non-zero pixel\n      alternating_color: white (0)\n      center_row: row index of the original non-zero pixel\n      extends: bidirectionally in the same column\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Trigger Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color.\n2.  **Column-Based Transformation:** For each trigger pixel:\n    *   Locate the column containing the trigger pixel.\n    * The original pixel's location is the center of the pattern.\n    *   Alternate the pixel's color and white (0) both upwards and downwards from this center, down the column.\n    *    For example if the original color is at row r.\n        row r + 1 = 0, row r + 2 = color\n        row r - 1 = 0, row r - 2 = color, and so on.\n3.  **Output:** The transformed grid contains these alternating patterns in the columns where trigger pixels were found, and retains the original zeros elsewhere.\n"
