Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grid appears to have a sparse arrangement of non-zero values (2 and 8, corresponding to red and azure), while the output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, with a pattern involving the repetition of the non-zero values. The dimensions of the grids are the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
