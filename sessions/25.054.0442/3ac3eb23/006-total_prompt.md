Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of replicating non-zero pixels downwards, alternating with zeros. However, the results show this isn't quite right. The generated outputs consistently replicate the non-zero color *only on odd rows beneath the original*, and always fill with zero on the even rows. The actual outputs show an alternating pattern of the original color and zero *centered on the original pixel location* - spreading both up and down. The original color alternates both up and down the columns of the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine the provided input/expected output/transformed output triples, paying close attention to the differences.
2.  **Identify the True Pattern:** Determine the *precise* rule governing the transformation, focusing on how each non-zero pixel affects its column. It seems like it will be a vertical, centered, alternating expansion.
3. **Refine Program Description:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the corrected transformation logic.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

I need to determine the precise transformation rule to accurately describe the changes. It's clear that the transformation is column-based and involves an alternating pattern centered on original, colored pixels.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two non-zero pixels: (0,1) = 2 (red), (0,5) = 8 (azure)
    *   Expected Output shows an alternating pattern of red/white and azure/white in those columns.
    *    Actual output incorrectly replicates.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has one non-zero pixels: (0,1) = 4 (yellow)
    *   Expected Output shows an alternating pattern of yellow/white in that column.
    *    Actual output incorrectly replicates

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid initiate an alternating pattern in their respective columns.
  - observation: The pattern consists of the original pixel's color alternating with white (0).
  - observation: The original pixel is the center of the alternating pattern in that column.
  - observation: The pattern extends upwards and downwards from the original pixel's row.
  - object: column_pattern
    properties:
      original_color: color of the non-zero pixel
      alternating_color: white (0)
      center_row: row index of the original non-zero pixel
      extends: bidirectionally in the same column
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Trigger Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color.
2.  **Column-Based Transformation:** For each trigger pixel:
    *   Locate the column containing the trigger pixel.
    * The original pixel's location is the center of the pattern.
    *   Alternate the pixel's color and white (0) both upwards and downwards from this center, down the column.
    *    For example if the original color is at row r.
        row r + 1 = 0, row r + 2 = color
        row r - 1 = 0, row r - 2 = color, and so on.
3.  **Output:** The transformed grid contains these alternating patterns in the columns where trigger pixels were found, and retains the original zeros elsewhere.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
