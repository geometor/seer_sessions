      - description: 3x3 grids
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
          - structure: Each row is identical to the other rows within the same grid
          - columns: 3 columns, each with a unique transformation rule.
  - actions:
      - description: Column-wise addition modulo 10
        details:
          - Each column has a specific increment value.
          - Increment is added to each cell in the column.
          - Modulo 10 operation ensures the result stays within 0-9.
      - description: Determine the increments:
          details: for each grid, subtract, modulo 10, the first row of the
            input from the first row of the output
