Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code are incorrect. The core issue is that it adds a fixed value (4) to each cell, when the actual transformation is more complex, and likely involves a different constant. The error analysis clearly shows mismatches in colors and pixel values across multiple examples, indicating that a simple addition is not the underlying rule. My strategy will be to:

1.  Re-examine *all* the input/output pairs to discern a more accurate relationship between input and output pixel values.
2.  Focus on determining what value gets added or subtracted from the input pixel values.
3.  Look at all examples - not just one at a time

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution):**

To get the data, I will execute the code in my head for all examples.

**Example 1:**

*   Input: `3 1 2` -> Output: `4 5 6`
*   Differences: `1, 4, 4`.

**Example 2:**

*   Input: `2 3 8` -> Output: `6 4 9`
*   Differences: `4, 1, 1`.

**Example 3:**

*   Input: `5 8 6` -> Output: `1 9 2`
*   Differences: `-4, 1, -4`, which wraps to: `6, 1, 6`.

**Example 4:**

*   Input: `9 4 2` -> Output: `8 3 6`
*   Differences: `-1, -1, 4`, which wraps to `9, 9, 4`.

**YAML Block - Facts:**

```yaml
task: 008
examples:
  - id: example_1
    input_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    output_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    transformations:
      - type: arithmetic
        operation: add/modulo
        value_map: {3: 7, 1: 5, 2: 6}
        notes: "inconsistent differences"
  - id: example_2
    input_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    output_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    transformations:
      - type: arithmetic
        operation: add/modulo
        value_map: {2: 6, 3: 7, 8: 2}
        notes: "inconsistent differences"
  - id: example_3
    input_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    output_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    transformations:
      - type: arithmetic
        operation: add/modulo
         value_map: {5: 9, 8: 2, 6: 0}
        notes: "inconsistent differences"
  - id: example_4
    input_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    output_grid_shape: (3, 3)
    transformations:
      - type: arithmetic
        operation: add/modulo
        value_map: {9: 3, 4: 8, 2: 6}
        notes: "inconsistent differences"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell in the input grid.
2.  **Calculate** a new value for each cell based on its original value using a consistent transformation.
3.  **IF** the original value is one of the values seen in the previous value maps, add a value to create the output, taking the modulus 10.
4.  **Apply** a consistent method across all input examples.

It looks like the relationship between the value isn't linear across all pixels, and could be a lookup table.

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 5      |
| 2     | 6      |
| 3     | 7      |
| 4     | 8      |
| 5     | 9      |
| 6     | 0      |
| 8     | 2      |
| 9     | 3      |
