The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  Map the original value of the cell to a new value based on a predefined lookup table.
3.  Assign the new value to the corresponding cell in the output grid.

The lookup table is as follows:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 5      |
| 2     | 6      |
| 3     | 7      |
| 4     | 8      |
| 5     | 9      |
| 6     | 0      |
| 8     | 2      |
| 9     | 3      |
