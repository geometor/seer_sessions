Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer corresponds to a specific color, as defined by the `COLOR_MAP`. The transformation appears to involve a consistent change in the numerical value, and consequently, the color of each cell in the grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          - value: integer (0-9)
          - color: mapped from value
    transformation:
      - type: value_change
        description: Each cell's value is modified according to a consistent rule.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Iterate** through each cell in the input grid.
2.  **Add 4** to the original value of each cell, and assign the new value to the same position.
3. Output will be result of adding 4 to each cell value.

Effectively, every value in the grid has 4 added to its original value.
