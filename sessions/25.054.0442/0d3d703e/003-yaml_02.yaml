observations:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (consistent across all examples)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    transformations:
      - type: element-wise modification
        details:
          - operation: addition
            operand: column-dependent value
          - operation: modulo 10 #to consider cyclical nature of color mapping 0-9
  - columns: each column is indexed 0, 1, 2, and each has it's own rules
  - row: the transformation is consistent across all rows, and columns are all treated equally
