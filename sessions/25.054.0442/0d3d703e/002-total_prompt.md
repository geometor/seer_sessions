## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFE5F9A0>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFE5FFD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color, and it appears the transformation involves incrementing each integer by 1. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color: mapped from value
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: 2D grid arrangement

actions:
  - type: increment
    target: cell value
    amount: 1

rules:
  - condition: all cells
    action: increment
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid where each cell contains a single-digit integer (0-9).
2.  **Transformation:** For each cell in the grid, increment its integer value by 1.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the incremented integer values. The layout stays the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
