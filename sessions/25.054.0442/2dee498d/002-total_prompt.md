## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7AA3AFB9D810>

**output:**
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFEF6C20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The colors (represented by numbers) are consistent between the input and output, indicating that the color of a pixel itself is not being transformed, but their positions and overall grid dimensions are.  Specifically, it seems like every other column might be removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - cells: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    relationships:
      - input_grid: larger dimensions
      - output_grid: smaller dimensions

actions:
  - type: column_removal
    description: Removes specific columns from the input grid.
    parameters:
      - removal_pattern:  Likely alternating columns (e.g., every other column).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts a subgrid from the input. The subgrid consists of the odd columns (first, third, fifth, etc ) of the input. The rows appear to be identical from input to output.

1.  **Iterate** through the input grid.
2.  **Select** every other colum.
3.  **Construct** a new output grid.
4.  **Populate** the output with the selected columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
