The input grid appears to be a repeating pattern of colored squares, and the output grid seems to be a condensed version of that pattern, extracting a single instance of the repeating unit. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input has dimensions 2x6 and the output has dimensions of 2x2.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, columns 1 and 2 ([2,1] and [2,3]) define the minimal repeating unit which repeats in columns 3 and 4, then again in cols 5 and 6.\n2.  **Extract the repeating unit:** Create a new grid consisting of only the first instance of this repeating pattern from left.\n3.
