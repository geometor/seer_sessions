## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2 1
2 3 2 3 2 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7AA3AFEF6C20>

**output:**
```
2 1
2 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7AA3AFEF6B30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a repeating pattern of colored squares, and the output grid seems to be a condensed version of that pattern, extracting a single instance of the repeating unit. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input has dimensions 2x6 and the output has dimensions of 2x2.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 2x6
    elements: colored_pixels
    colors: [red, blue, green]
    pattern: repeating_sequence
    sequence: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements: colored_pixels
    colors: [red, blue, green]
    pattern: subsequence_of_input
    sequence: [2, 1], [2, 3]

  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description: Extracts the fundamental repeating unit from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the repeating pattern:** Observe the input grid and identify the smallest horizontal sequence of pixels that repeats itself across the entire width. In this case, columns 1 and 2 ([2,1] and [2,3]) define the minimal repeating unit which repeats in columns 3 and 4, then again in cols 5 and 6.
2.  **Extract the repeating unit:** Create a new grid consisting of only the first instance of this repeating pattern from left.
3. The new grid is the output grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts the smallest repeating horizontal sequence from the input to form the output. The height seems to be preserved, acting on the entire rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
