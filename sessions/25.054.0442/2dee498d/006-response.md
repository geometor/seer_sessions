"""
The transformation extracts a subgrid from the input, consisting of the odd-positioned columns (first, third, fifth, etc.). The rows are identical between the input and output.

1. Iterate through the input grid row by row.
2. Select columns at odd positions (first, third, fifth, etc.).
3. Construct a new output grid.
4. Populate each row of the output grid with pixels from selected columns, maintaining original row order.
