## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x256 at 0x7AA3AFEF6B30>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger, repeating pattern, while the output is a smaller, condensed version of that pattern. The transformation seems to involve extracting a specific sub-grid from the input. The colors and their relative positions within the sub-grid are preserved. The overall impression is one of pattern extraction or down-sampling, where a representative "tile" is extracted from a larger "tiled" input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      elements: pixels
      colors: [red, white, blue, yellow] # Values: 2, 0, 1, 4

input_grid:
  dimensions: [4, 12]

output_grid:
  dimensions: [4, 4]

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A sub-grid is extracted from the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: sub-grid
    description: The output grid is a sub-grid of the input grid.
  - type: pattern_repetition
    description: The input grid appears to be a repetition of the output grid pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the repeating pattern:** Observe that the input grid consists of a smaller pattern repeated horizontally.
2.  **Determine the dimensions of the repeating unit:** The repeating unit (and thus the output) is 4 columns wide. The height is the same as input grid, 4 rows.
3.  **Extract the first instance of the repeating unit:** Extract the leftmost 4x4 sub-grid from the input grid.
4.  **Output the extracted sub-grid:** The extracted sub-grid constitutes the output.

In essence, the transformation extracts the first instance of the horizontally repeating pattern in the input grid to produce the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
