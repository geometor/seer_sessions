The input grid appears to have a larger dimension than the output grid. The colors present are azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4). The most prominent feature seems to be a cross shape formed by green (3) pixels in the input, surrounded by azure (8) pixels. The output appears to be a smaller subsection of the original input grid, composed of only the bottom left corner containing the yellow (4) and surrounding azure pixels (8).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
