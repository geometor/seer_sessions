## Example 3

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 8 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x704 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3
3 8 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7AA3AFB7E470>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a larger grid, predominantly green (3) with a vertical blue (1) stripe in the center.  There's a single azure (8) pixel on the left side of the blue stripe. A horizontal blue (1) line intersects the vertical blue line.
*   The output is a smaller, square grid, containing only the green (3) and azure (8) pixels from the upper-left corner of the input grid. The blue stripe and line are completely removed. It appears that the output is a cropped section of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [green, blue, azure]
      dimensions: 11x11
      elements:
        - color: green
          value: 3
          shape: background
        - color: blue
          value: 1
          shape: vertical_stripe, horizontal_line
          position: center_vertical, center_horizontal
        - color: azure
            value: 8
            shape: single_pixel
            position: left_of_vertical_stripe, row 3

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [green, azure]
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements:
        - color: green
          value: 3
          shape: background
        - color: azure
          value: 8
          shape: single_pixel
          position: row 3, column 2

relationships:
  - type: cropping
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output grid is a cropped section of the top-left portion of the input grid.
  - type: color_removal
      subject: input_grid
      colors_removed: [blue]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Crop Area:** Determine the dimensions of the output grid (5x5).
2.  **Crop:** Extract the 5x5 subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid.
3. **Remove Blue:** Remove all blue (value 1) pixels within the subgrid.
4. **Output:** Return the cropped subgrid with just green and azure pixels.

In essence, the transformation extracts a fixed-size square from the top-left of the input, discarding all pixels of a specific color (blue).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
