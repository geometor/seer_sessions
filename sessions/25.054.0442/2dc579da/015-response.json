            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a misunderstanding, focusing on a 5x5 crop and removing blue pixels (which sometimes worked coincidentally). The results clearly show that this approach is incorrect for Examples 1 and 2. Example 3 matched, but not for the reason expected. The expected outputs have different sizes and shapes, and the transformation isn't simply about cropping and removing blue. It appears we need to take a more precise approach on subgrids, and colors, which is not consistent with the first analysis. We are going to revise the code and description to correctly perform the task.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations, and what is different from expected results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Expected Output Size: 2x2\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Notes: There appears to be no change in the input. All the pixels remain unchanged. The expected size is different, and only a subset of pixels is included in the correct answer.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 7x7\n    *   Expected Output Size: 3x5\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Notes: There is a subgrid with consistent columns and rows. There are no blue pixels in the correct answer.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 11x11\n    *   Expected Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Notes: The transformation happened to produce the correct result by\n        coincidence. The 5x5 subgrid from the top is selected, and all pixels\n        in the expected output are coincidentally the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 014\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        color: mixed (8, 3, 4)\n        size: 5x5\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        color: mixed (8,4)\n        size: 2x2\n    transformation:\n      - description: \"Take the top-left 5x5 subgrid, keep only colors 8 and 4\"\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        color: mixed (4, 2, 1)\n        size: 7x7\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        color: 4\n        size: 3 x 5\n    transformation:\n       - description: \"Take the top-left 5x5 subgrid, keep only color 4, resize to area of color 4.\"\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        color: mixed (3, 1, 8)\n        size: 11x11\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        color: mixed (3, 8)\n        size: 5x5\n    transformation:\n       - description: \"Take the top-left 5x5 subgrid.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Extract Subgrid**: Extract the 5x5 subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid.\n2.  **Filter by colors.** Only keep some subset of the colors in the 5x5 subgrid.\n3. Crop to the bounding box of the remaining pixels.\n\n"
