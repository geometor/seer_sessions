The primary colors observed are yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1). The input appears to be a larger grid, and the output is a smaller, seemingly extracted portion of the input. The key feature seems to be the blue (1) pixel and its surrounding yellow (4) pixels. The red (2) pixels in the input seem to be completely removed in the output. The output grid is always 3x3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If no single blue pixel is not present, a copy the input to the output\n2.  **Define the Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid.\n3.  **Center the Blue Pixel:** Place the blue pixel in the center cell (row 2, column 2) of the output grid.\n4.  **Extract Surroundings:** From the input grid, extract the pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to the blue pixel.\n5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Place the colors of the extracted pixels in the corresponding positions of the output grid, using the position of the blue pixel as the center point. Thus any pixels not adjacent to the blue pixel are lost.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation finds the blue pixel in the input, and creates a 3x3 output grid centered on that blue pixel, copying the colors of the surrounding pixels from the input. All other parts of the input grid are discarded.\n"
