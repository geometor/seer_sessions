## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 8 3 8 8
8 8 3 8 8
3 3 3 3 3
8 8 3 8 8
4 8 3 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>

**output:**
```
8 8
4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7AA3AFC13E20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a larger dimension than the output grid. The colors present are azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4). The most prominent feature seems to be a cross shape formed by green (3) pixels in the input, surrounded by azure (8) pixels. The output appears to be a smaller subsection of the original input grid, composed of only the bottom left corner containing the yellow (4) and surrounding azure pixels (8).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - colors: [azure, green, yellow]
    observations:
      - "A green cross shape is present."
      - "Yellow is in the bottom left corner, surounded by azure"

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - colors: [azure, yellow]
    observations:
      - "Corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the input grid."

  - relationship:
      - type: "corner_subset"
      - subject: output_grid
      - object: input_grid
      - description: "The output grid is derived by taking only the bottom-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Subgrid:** Focus on the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Extract the 2x2 Corner:** Extract a 2x2 subgrid from the bottom-left corner of the input.
3  **Output as Result**: Output the 2x2 corner from step 2 as the final result.

Essentially, the program extracts the bottom-left 2x2 subgrid of the input to create the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
