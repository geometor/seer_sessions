The input grid has distinct rectangular regions of color (yellow, red, and azure). The output grid seems to represent a highly simplified version, preserving only one pixel of each color from the input. The spatial arrangement of colors in the output corresponds to the general layout in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
