            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and implemented a prioritization scheme (Above > Left > Below > Right) for placing a blue pixel adjacent to azure clusters. However, the second example reveals a flaw in this strict prioritization. The transformed output places blue pixels incorrectly, and there seems to be interaction across clusters. It seems that checking existence of a neighbor should not mean immediately placing a blue pixel. Instead all neighbors must be checked, across all clusters, then blue placed only if one neighbor exist.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Misplaced Pixels:** Carefully examine where the blue pixels are incorrectly placed in the transformed outputs compared to the expected outputs. This will highlight the limitations of the current prioritization logic.\n2.  **Relax Prioritization:** Modify the logic to *not* immediately place a blue pixel based on the first available white neighbor. Instead, consider all adjacent white pixels for each azure cluster and apply a more nuanced rule. The examples suggest a rule based on unique adjacent white pixels\n3.  **Inter-cluster interaction:** The placement of a blue in cluster seems to remove the option for placing another blue, even if the cluster has white (0) adjacencies.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the corrected logic, focusing on unique adjacency.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Two azure clusters: one 2x1, one 2x2.\n    *   Expected Output: A blue pixel is placed to the right of the 2x1 cluster, and to the left of one azure from the 2x2 cluster.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Blue pixels placed above the top-left corner of each cluster.\n    *   Issues: Strict prioritization (Above > Left > Below > Right) is incorrect and misses expected location.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Three azure clusters.\n    *   Expected Output: Blue pixels placed according to a one-blue-per-unique-white-neighbor rule.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Prioritization error and interaction between clusters.\n    *   Issues: Again, prioritization is a problem. Additionally there is interaction across the clusters.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: azure_cluster\n    type: cluster\n    color: azure (8)\n    properties:\n      - adjacent_whites: []  # List of (row, col) tuples\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_adjacent_whites\n    description: Locates all white (0) pixels adjacent to an azure cluster.\n  - name: place_blue_pixel\n    description: Places a single blue (1) pixel adjacent to an azure cluster in an empty white (0) cell,\n                 only if that white neighbor is unique to the cluster.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Find all contiguous clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Find Adjacent Whites:** For each identified azure cluster, find all adjacent white (0) pixels.\n3. **Determine Unique White Neighbors:** From the list of all adjacent white pixels found in step two, if an adjacent white cell is only adjacent to one azure cluster, it is considered \"unique.\"\n4.  **Place Blue Pixel:** For each azure cluster, change *one* of the *unique* adjacent white pixels to blue (1). If more than one such cell exists for a single cluster, one is selected, but it must be unique.\n\n"
