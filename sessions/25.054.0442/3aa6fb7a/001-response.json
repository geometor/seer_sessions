The input grid contains two distinct clusters of '8' (azure) pixels, surrounded by '0' (white) pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a single '1' (blue) pixel replaces one of the '8' (azure) pixels in each of the two clusters. The '1' pixels appear in the perceived \"center\" of each azure cluster, at least from a human's visual perspective.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

There will be one center per cluster.\n3.  **Replace Pixel:** Within each cluster, change the value of *one* of the '8' pixels in the center, from '8' to '1' (blue).\n4.  **Maintain Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the identified cluster of 8, or those pixels of 8 which were not selected, retain their original values.\n"
