Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Clusters:** Find all distinct clusters of '8' (azure) pixels in the input grid. A cluster is a group of orthogonally connected '8' pixels.
2.  **Find Cluster Center:** For each cluster:
    *   Calculate the centroid of the cluster (average row and average column of all pixels in the cluster).
    *   Identify all pixels within the cluster that are closest to the centroid (using Euclidean distance).
    *    Among the closest pixels, select the one with the smallest row index. If there's a tie, select the one with the smallest column index (prioritize top-left).
3.  **Replace Pixel:** Change the value of the selected center pixel in each cluster from '8' (azure) to '1' (blue).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
