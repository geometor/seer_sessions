            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and, as expected, doesn't perfectly generalize to the second example. The core idea of identifying azure clusters and placing a blue pixel adjacent to them is correct. However, the current logic for placing the blue pixel is too simplistic. It only places one blue pixel next to *any* white, and it doesn't follow the implicit rule in the examples of which white it selects.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Results:** Carefully examine *where* the blue pixels are placed in the correct outputs versus the transformed outputs. Note the specific positions relative to the azure clusters. The existing code places only *one* blue, the goal is to identify *which* white gets changed to blue.\n2.  **Refine the Placement Rule:** Develop a more precise rule for selecting the white pixel to change to blue. Consider factors like:\n    *   Direction (up, down, left, right) from the azure cluster.\n    *   Prioritization (e.g., always choose the white pixel above if available, otherwise to the right).\n    *   Possibly depends on shape/size/location of the clusters.\n3.  **Update the Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language program to reflect the refined rule.\n4.  **Update and Test Code:** Implement the refined rule in the `transform` function. Retest on the examples.\n\n**Example Analysis & Metrics:**\n\nHere's a more detailed analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** The code places a blue pixel to the right of the first azure cluster, and to the left of the second. The correct output shows it should be to the right and below, respectively.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** The code chooses the *first* white adjacent pixel.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** The code places blue to the left of the first cluster, above the second, and below the third, where the correct output is above, left and below, respectively.\n    *   **Inconsistency**: Same as above - first white adjacent pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: 008\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - type: cluster\n          color: azure (8)\n          pixels: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n        - type: cluster\n          color: azure (8)\n          pixels: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n      output_objects:\n        - type: pixel\n          color: blue (1)\n          location: (1, 2) #right\n          relative_to: cluster_1\n        - type: pixel\n          color: blue (1)\n          location: (4, 4) #below\n          relative_to: cluster_2\n      transformation:\n          rule: \"Place a blue pixel adjacent to each azure cluster.\"\n          details: \"Prioritize white pixels to change to blue, following rule: right, below, above, left\"\n\n  - example_2:\n    input_objects:\n      - type: cluster\n        color: azure (8)\n        pixels: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5)]\n      - type: cluster\n        color: azure (8)\n        pixels: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n      - type: cluster\n        color: azure (8)\n        pixels: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]\n    output_objects:\n      - type: pixel\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (0, 4) #above\n        relative_to: cluster_1\n      - type: pixel\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (2, 3) #left\n        relative_to: cluster_2\n      - type: pixel\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (5, 5) #below\n        relative_to: cluster_3\n    transformation:\n      rule: \"Place a blue pixel adjacent to each azure cluster.\"\n      details: \"Prioritize white pixels to change to blue, following rule: above, left, below, right.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Locate all clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A cluster is defined as a group of one or more orthogonally connected azure pixels.\n2.  **Place Blue Pixel:** For *each* identified azure cluster, find adjacent white (0) pixels.\n    *   Change a *single* white (0) pixel to blue (1).\n    *   Prioritize which white using this rule: *above*, *left*, *below*, *right*. If there is a white above the cluster, change it to blue. If not, if there's one to the left, change it. and so on.\n\nThis natural language program captures the key behavior observed in *both* training examples and gives a testable hypothesis for prioritization.\n"
