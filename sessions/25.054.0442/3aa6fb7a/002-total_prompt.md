## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7AA3AFC7B9A0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two 7x7 grids. The input grid contains two distinct clusters of '8' (azure) pixels, surrounded by '0' (white) pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a single '1' (blue) pixel replaces one of the '8' (azure) pixels in each of the two clusters. The '1' pixels appear in the perceived "center" of each azure cluster, at least from a human's visual perspective.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - domain: 2D grid
  - dimensions: 7x7
  - data_type: integer
  - values: [0, 1, 8]
  - objects:
    - object_id: 1
      type: cluster
      value: 8
      property: azure
      cardinality: 2
    - object_id: 2
      type: pixel
      value: 0
      property: white
      cardinality: multiple
    - object_id: 3
      type: pixel
      value: 1
      property: blue
      cardinality: 2 (in output)

  - actions:
    - action_id: 1
      type: replace
      target: object_1
      replacement: object_3
      location_criteria: "center of mass" of object_1
  - relationships:
      - relation_id: 1
        type: contains
        subject: grid
        object: object_1, object_2, and object_3 in output, object 1 and 2 in input

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Clusters:** Locate all distinct clusters of '8' (azure) pixels within the input grid. A cluster is defined as a contiguous group of '8' pixels, where contiguity includes orthogonal neighbors.
2.  **Find Center:** For each identified cluster, determine a "center" pixel. There will be one center per cluster.
3.  **Replace Pixel:** Within each cluster, change the value of *one* of the '8' pixels in the center, from '8' to '1' (blue).
4.  **Maintain Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the identified cluster of 8, or those pixels of 8 which were not selected, retain their original values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
