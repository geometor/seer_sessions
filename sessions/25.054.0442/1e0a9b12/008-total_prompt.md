## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7AA3AFEF6C20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 6x6 grid where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve moving or copying certain colored pixels based on their spatial relationships and possibly their values. The most obvious changes are the movement of the maroon (9) pixel and the azure (8) pixel. The yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels seem to be unaffected other than by the potential movement on to of them.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: (6, 6)

actions:
  - name: move_pixel
    description: Moves a pixel from one position to another.
    parameters:
      source: (row, column)
      destination: (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Describes pixels that are next to each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

  - type: position
    description: relationship to other object or location
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels**: Locate the maroon (9) pixel and the azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Maroon (9) Pixel Movement**: Move the maroon (9) pixel to the bottom right corner of the grid.
3.  **Azure (8) pixel movement**: Move the azure (8) pixel to the position that was vacated by the maroon (9) pixel.
4.  All other object locations remain in the original input.

The program can be summarized that the position of 9 and 8 swap, and 9 is favored to be at the bottom.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
