Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the maroon (9) pixel and the azure (8) pixel in the input grid.
2. Move the maroon (9) pixel to the bottom right corner of the grid.
3. Move the azure (8) pixel to the position that was vacated by the maroon (9) pixel.
4. All other object locations remain in the original input.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too specific to the first training example. It focused on swapping the maroon (9) and azure (8) pixels, and moving the maroon pixel to the bottom-right. This approach fails on examples where there is no azure pixel (Example 3) or when the interaction between objects isn't a simple swap (Examples 2,3). The core issue is an over-reliance on a very limited initial observation and not generalizing to consider interactions between all objects.

Example 3 strongly indicates that this approach should be discarded.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine all Examples:** We need to carefully look at *all* provided examples (input, expected output, *and* the incorrect transformed output) to identify common patterns and object interactions.
2.  **Focus on General Rules:** Instead of focusing on specific colors, we should identify more general rules about object movement or rearrangement.
3.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an "object" in each case (contiguous blocks of color, single pixels, etc.) and how they interact.

**Example Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a more detailed look at each example, focusing on what went wrong and what the *correct* transformation seems to be:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** `0 4 0 9\n0 0 0 0\n0 4 6 0\n1 0 0 0`
    *   **Expected:** `0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0\n1 4 6 9`
    *   **Transformed:** `0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 4 6 0\n1 0 0 9`
    *   **Analysis:** The `9` moved to the bottom right, which is correct. The `4` and `6` on the third row shifted down one row. The `4` on the first row replaced with a `0`.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** `0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 7 8 0 0\n4 0 7 0 0 0`
    *   **Expected:** `0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 7 8 0 0\n4 0 7 8 0 9`
    *   **Transformed:** `0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 7 8 0 0\n4 0 7 0 0 9`
    *    **Analysis:** The transformation moves the `9` to the bottom right. The final `8` in the penultimate row is also correct.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** `0 0 0 1 0\n0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 1 2\n6 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0`
    *   **Expected:** `0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 1 0\n6 3 0 1 2`
    *   **Transformed:** `0 0 0 1 0\n0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 1 2\n6 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0`
    *    **Analysis:** the transform does nothing - because there is no `9`.

        - action: "all objects attempt to shift down one row, but only if not blocked"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify all objects**: An object is defined as a single pixel.
2.  **Shift Down**: Every object in the grid attempts to move down by one row.
3. **Blocked**: Objects that have another object directly beneath it in the input grid do not change their position.
4.  **Bottom Right**: If there is a maroon (9) pixel, it moves to the bottom-right corner of the grid, regardless of whether it's blocked. The existing value in bottom-right is removed.

This revised program accounts for the "shifting down" behavior and the special rule for the maroon pixel. It's more general and addresses the observed transformations in all three examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
