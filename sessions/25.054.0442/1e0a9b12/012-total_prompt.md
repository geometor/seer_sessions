Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify all objects**: An object is defined as a single pixel.
2.  **Shift Down**: Every object in the grid attempts to move down by one row.
3. **Blocked**: Objects that have another object directly beneath it in the input grid do not change their position.
4.  **Bottom Right**: If there is a maroon (9) pixel, it moves to the bottom-right corner of the grid, regardless of whether it's blocked. The existing value in bottom-right is removed.

Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of downward movement and the special rule for the maroon (9) pixel. However, the errors in the test cases reveal a flaw in the "Shift Down" logic. The current implementation only moves pixels down if the space *immediately* below is empty. It doesn't account for "cascading" moves, where a pixel might need to move down multiple rows if there are multiple empty spaces below it. The strategy is to enhance the downward movement to be iterative.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Pixels Off: 2
    *   Issue: The '4' in the second column doesn't drop to the bottom because another '4' is blocking it earlier in the drop. The second '0' is missing too.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Pixels Off: 2
    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the `8` does not move to the correct place.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Pixels Off: 6
    *    Issue: more complex - several don't cascade

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: Single pixels of any color.
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer (0-9)
        description: Represents the color of the pixel.
      position:
        type: tuple (row, column)
        description: The location of the pixel in the grid.

actions:
  - name: Shift Down
    description: >
      Each pixel attempts to move down as many rows as possible. The movement
      stops if it encounters another pixel (of any color, including 0/white) or
      the bottom edge of the grid.
  - name: Maroon to Bottom-Right
    description: >
      If a maroon pixel (color 9) is present, it moves to the bottom-right
      corner of the grid.  The value in the bottom right is overwritten and
      cleared from its previous position.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat each individual pixel in the input grid as a separate object.

2.  **Iterative Shift Down:** For each object (pixel), attempt to move it down one row at a time. Continue moving the object down until it reaches the bottom row or encounters another object (any non-empty cell) directly below it.

3. **Bottom-Right (Maroon):** If a maroon colored object (value 9) exists in the grid, move it to the bottom-right cell of the grid. Any object that had that location is removed. The maroon object is removed from its previous position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
