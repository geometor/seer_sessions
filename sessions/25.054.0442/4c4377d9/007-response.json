The colors used are blue (1) and yellow (4).\n*   **Output Grid:** A 6x4 grid of colored pixels. It appears to be a modified, extended version of the input grid. The same colors (blue and yellow) are used.\n* **Relationship**: There's a clear positional relationship. Some parts of the input seem to be duplicated, and the arrangement of colors in certain areas is mirrored.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
