            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple vertical reflection and stacking.  The results show a consistent pattern of errors across all examples: the rows are in the wrong order within each half of the output. The top half of the output should be the *reverse* of the input, and the bottom half should be an exact copy of the input. The code currently has this reversed.  My strategy is to re-order the stacking of the grids.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of observations, I've included the input and output sizes for each.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x4\n    *   Output Size: 6x4\n    *   Observation: Rows are stacked in the wrong order. The top half should be the reverse of the input, and the bottom half a copy.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x4\n    *   Output Size: 6x4\n    *   Observation: Same error as Example 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x4\n    *   Output Size: 6x4\n    *   Observation: Same error as Example 1.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x4\n    *   Output Size: 6x4\n    * Observation: Same error as example 1\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 014\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The input grid is always transformed into an output grid that is twice the height and the same width.\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      values: integers 0-9\n      shape: variable\n  - object: reflected_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      values: integers 0-9\n      shape: same as input_grid\n      derivation: vertical reflection of input_grid\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      values: integers 0-9\n      shape:\n        height: 2 * input_grid height\n        width: same as input_grid width\n    derivation: concatenation of reflected_grid and input_grid, stacked vertically\n  - action: vertical_reflection\n    input: input_grid\n    output: reflected_grid\n    description: Each row of the input_grid becomes a row in reflected_grid, but in reverse order.\n  - action: vertical_stacking\n    input:\n      - reflected_grid\n      - input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    description: The reflected_grid is placed above the original input_grid, creating a new grid twice the height.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Reflect:** Create a vertically reflected copy of the input grid. This means flipping the input grid upside down.\n2.  **Stack:** Stack the reflected grid *on top of* the original input grid.  The result will be a new grid with twice the height of the original and the same width.\n\nEssentially, the output grid consists of two halves.  The top half is the vertically flipped input, and the bottom half is the original input, unchanged.\n"
