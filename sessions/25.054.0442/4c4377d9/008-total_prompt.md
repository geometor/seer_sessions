## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 1 1 4
1 1 1 1
4 4 4 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7AA3AFB9D540>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 1
1 1 1 1
4 1 1 4
4 1 1 4
1 1 1 1
4 4 4 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x384 at 0x7AA3AFB9CA30>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example provided:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x4 grid of colored pixels. The colors used are blue (1) and yellow (4).
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x4 grid of colored pixels. It appears to be a modified, extended version of the input grid. The same colors (blue and yellow) are used.
* **Relationship**: There's a clear positional relationship. Some parts of the input seem to be duplicated, and the arrangement of colors in certain areas is mirrored.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 3x4
        output: 6x4
      colors: [blue, yellow]
      color_values: {blue: 1, yellow: 4}

actions:
  - type: duplicate
    description: The input grid appears to be duplicated vertically.
  - type: mirror_section
    description: A section of the input grid seems to be mirrored and placed in the output.
  - type: reposition
    description: parts of the input are placed in specific rows and columns in the output

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: The output grid maintains some spatial relationships from the input, but with modifications (duplication and mirroring).
    - type: size increase
      description: output has twice the number of rows of the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate:** Duplicate the entire input grid vertically to create a 6x4 grid.
2.  **Mirror Top Left:**
    The first row of the duplicated grid is unchanged.
    The values of first column is copied to the last column of the duplicated grid.
3.  **Mirror Bottom Right**
The last row of the duplicated grid is unchanged.
The values of the last column are copied to the first column.

In short, the transformation copies values from the left edge of the input to the right edge of the output, and copies values from the right edge to the left edge.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
