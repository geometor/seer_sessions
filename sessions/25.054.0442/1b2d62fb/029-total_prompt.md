Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Extract:** Extract the first three columns from the input grid.
2.  **Conditional color changes:**
    *   Examine columns 1, 2, and 3 of the original input, along with column 4 (all '1's).
    *   Identify positions where the background color (0) is present in the first three columns.
    *   Apply color changes in the output grid (the 5x3 extracted portion) based on this rule:

        * If in the input, a '0' value in any of the first three columns, directly corresponds with a value of '1' in same row of the fourth column, the output grid value remains unchanged
        * If in the input, a '0' value in columns 1, 2, or 3 does *not* have a value of '1' in the same row, fourth column, replace the pixel in the output with an '8'.
        * if the value is not '0', the output will always be '0' in output.

3.  **Output:** The resulting 5x3 grid with the modified colors is the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
