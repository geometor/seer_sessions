The input grid appears to have a vertical line of '1's (blue) and surrounding pixels of '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The output grid seems to be a condensed version, with a row of '8's (azure) appearing where the '1's were in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The column containing the blue line in the original image will be the basis of a new feature.\n3. **Translate Feature**: Transform each pixel which was once the blue line into an azure (8) pixel.\n4.  **Reposition Feature:** Place the azure pixels as a horizontal line at row 4 (counting from 1) of the output grid.\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid become white (0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation detects a vertical line of a specific color, collapses the grid horizontally, and replaces the detected feature with a horizontal line of a different color in a specific row.\n"
