## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 9 1 9 9 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 0
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7AA3AFB9D000>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7AA3AFB9D780>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of different dimensions and integer values. The input grid appears to have a vertical line of '1's (blue) and surrounding pixels of '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The output grid seems to be a condensed version, with a row of '8's (azure) appearing where the '1's were in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x7
      values: [0, 9, 1]
      features:
        - type: vertical_line
          color: 1 # Blue
          location: column 4
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x3
      values: [0, 8]
      features:
        - type: horizontal_line
          color: 8 # Azure
          location: row 4

actions:
  - type: condense
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Reduces grid width and replaces a specific feature with another.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue vertical line in the input corresponds to the azure horizontal line in the output.  The width reduction collapses columns around the blue line.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Condense Width:** Reduce the width of the grid to three columns. The column containing the blue line in the original image will be the basis of a new feature.
3. **Translate Feature**: Transform each pixel which was once the blue line into an azure (8) pixel.
4.  **Reposition Feature:** Place the azure pixels as a horizontal line at row 4 (counting from 1) of the output grid.
5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid become white (0).

Essentially, the transformation detects a vertical line of a specific color, collapses the grid horizontally, and replaces the detected feature with a horizontal line of a different color in a specific row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
