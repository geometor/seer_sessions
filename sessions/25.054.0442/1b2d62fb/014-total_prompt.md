## Example 3

**input:**
```
9 0 0 1 9 0 9
9 0 0 1 0 9 0
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 0 9 9
0 0 9 1 0 9 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>

**output:**
```
0 8 0
0 0 8
0 8 8
8 0 0
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7AA3AFC12A10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x7 grid, and the output is a 5x3 grid. The input grid contains the digits 0, 1, and 9, representing white, blue, and maroon, respectively. The output grid contains digits 0 and 8, representing white and azure. The blue (1) pixels in the input seem to define the location of the azure (8) in the output and remove some columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x7
    elements: [0, 1, 9]
    element_colors: {0: white, 1: blue, 9: maroon}
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: [0, 8]
    element_colors: {0: white, 8: azure}
  - object: blue_column
    type: column
    location: 4
    value: 1
    relationship: "defines the center column of output"
  - action: transformation
    type: column_extraction_and_color_change
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    details: "Extracts columns around the blue column, changing blue to azure."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Column:** Find the column in the input grid that is entirely filled with blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Extract Columns:** Extract the target column, one to the right of the blue pixels, and one to the left of the blue pixels.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid using the extracted columns.
4.  Change color. Change all of the blue (1) pixels to azure (8) pixels.
5.  Maintain the other non-blue pixels with original color and location relative to the central column.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
