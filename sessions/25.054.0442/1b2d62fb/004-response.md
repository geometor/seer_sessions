Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the results of the previous code execution.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was overly simplistic, focusing solely on identifying a vertical blue line and extracting the portion of the grid to its left. This approach clearly fails to capture the actual transformation logic, as evidenced by the discrepancies between the `transformed_output` and `expected_output` in subsequent examples. The core issue is that the transformation isn't simply about isolating a region based on a blue line; there's a more complex pattern involving the shapes to the *right* of the blue line, and an insertion of azure (color 8) pixels. The previous code also doesn't handle cases without a blue line.

**Strategy for Improvement:**

1.  **Shift Focus:** Instead of focusing on the blue line as a *separator*, consider it as a *reference point*. The transformation seems to operate on the objects/shapes *relative to* the blue line (specifically to the right of it).

2.  **Identify Objects:** Disregard colors other than blue and azure for now. We need to programmatically identify contiguous regions of non-black pixels to the right of the blue line.

3.  **Positional Relationship:** Determine the precise relationship between the position and shape of the objects to the right of the blue line and the azure pixels in the output. It seems as though the columns to the right of the blue line in the input are collapsed, with the occupied positions being marked in azure in a shrunken output grid.

4.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Account for cases where the blue line might be at the very edge or absent.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

Let's use a slightly modified version of the provided code to gather more specific information, reporting all provided outputs.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Vertical Blue Line:** Find the column index (if any) where a vertical line of blue (color 1) pixels spans the entire height of the input grid.

2.  **Determine Output Grid Width:** The output grid's width is the same as the column index of the blue line.  If no blue line is found, the output width is likely zero (or a default value, needs further examples to confirm).

3.  **Iterate Rows:** For each row in the input grid:
    *   Check if there are *any* non-black pixels in the columns to the *right* of the blue line.
    *   If there are non-black pixels in that row to the right of the blue line, place an azure (color 8) pixel in the corresponding row and all columns of the output grid.
    *   If not, fill the output grid row with black pixels.

4. **Output Height:** Output height is same as input.

5.  **Handle No Blue Line:** (Needs more examples to be certain) If there's no blue line, it is possible there will be no output or some default.

In essence, the transformation collapses the columns to the right of the blue line into a representation where the presence of *any* non-black pixel in a row triggers the placement of an azure pixel in the output. The output represents a compressed "summary" of the presence of objects to the right of the blue reference line.
