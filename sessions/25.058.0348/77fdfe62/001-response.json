The input grid appears to contain several distinct objects, identifiable by color, embedded within a larger \"background\" of blue (1) and white(0). The output grid seems to represent a condensed or summarized version of the input, retaining only certain colors and possibly reflecting their spatial relationships in a simplified manner. The colors in output appear to be from the four corners of input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Extract the colors of subgrid corners.\n\n3.  **Output Grid Construction:** Create output grid and fill subgrids corners. If the color is white(0), fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with white(0). Otherwise, fill the extracted color.\n\nIn summary, the output takes colors on the corner of input and the 2x2 subgrids, and remove the blue(1) \"background\", only keeping non-blue and non-white colors, placing them in a smaller, condensed grid.\n"
