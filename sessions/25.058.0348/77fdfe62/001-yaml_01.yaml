task_description: |
  The task is to transform a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid,
  preserving specific color information and spatial relationships.

observations:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 8x8
      elements:
        - color_0:  # White
            - locations: [multiple]
        - color_1:  # Blue
            - locations: [multiple, forming a frame]
        - color_2:  # Red
            - locations: [(0,0)]
        - color_3:  # Green
            - locations: [(0,7)]
        - color_4: #yellow
            - locations: [(7,0)]
        - color_6:  # Magenta
            - locations: [(7,7)]
        - color_8:  # Azure
            - locations: [multiple]
      background_color: 1  # Blue

  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements:
        - color_0: #white
            - locations: [multiple]
        - color_2:  # Red
            - locations: [(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)]
        - color_3:  # Green
            - locations: [(1,3)]
        - color_4: #yellow
            - locations: [(3,0)]
        - color_6:  # Magenta
            - locations: [(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)]
      background_color: 0  # White

transformation_rules:
  - rule_1: "Extract the colors at four courners of the input grid"
  - rule_2: "Downscale input grid to output grid by 2x2 subgrids, and get corners of the subgrids"
  - rule_3: "If corner's color is not white, place it in output, otherwize, fill with white"
