## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x320 at 0x76A71F2D5590>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (2D array) of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). These digits correspond to different colors. The input grid appears to be transformed into a modified output grid. The primary change seems to be concentrated on the second row, where the non-zero pixels in the input are replaced and expanded. A new color (grey, represented by the digit 5) also seems to appear in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x11).
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 11
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 11
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      input_value: 1
      input_row: 1
      input_col: 0
  - object: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      input_value: 2
      input_row: 1
      input_col: 10
  - action: horizontal_expansion
    description: The blue and red pixels on the second row are expanded horizontally.
  - relationship:  The blue pixels expand to the left of the gray pixel and the red expand on the right.
  - relationship: The gray pixel is placed at the horizontal center of the grid, which is column 5.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the non-zero pixels on the second row of the input grid. In this case these pixels are blue (1) and red (2).
2.  **Find Center:** Determine the horizontal center column of the grid. In the 11 column example, that column is 5 (starting index 0).
3.  **Insert Center Pixel**: insert a gray pixel (5) in the center column of the second row of the output grid.
4.  **Expand Left:** Working outwards from the center of the second row of the input, going *left*, replace all the zeros in the output with the value of the original blue pixel. Stop before hitting another non zero entry.
5.  **Expand Right:** Working outwards from the center of the second row of the input, going *right*, replace all the zero in the output with the value of the original red pixel. Stop before hitting another non zero entry.
6.  **Copy other rows:** All other rows in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
