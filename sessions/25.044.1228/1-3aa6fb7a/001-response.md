Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (light blue). All other cells are '0' (grey).

2.  **Transformation Rule**
    *   Locate the rightmost 8 in the second row and replace the 0 to its right with a 1.
    *   Locate the bottommost 8 in the sixth column. Replace the 0 to the left with a 1.

3.  **Output:** The output grid reflects these changes, with all other cells remaining the same as the input grid.

In essence, the transformation involves finding specific '8' colored cells based on their row/column position, and using them to change selected adjacent 0's to 1's.
