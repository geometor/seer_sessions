Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
  background:
    - color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1,2)
        size: 1
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (4,5)
        size: 1
  background:
    - color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects of size 3. And the background is composed by white cells (color 0).

2.  **Detect the change**
    *   Locate the uppermost and leftmost azure cell of the first azure L-shape.
    *   Change the color of the cell to the immediate right to blue (color 1)

    *   Locate the uppermost and leftmost azure cell of the second azure L-shape.
    *   Change the color of the cell to the immediate down to blue (color 1).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as:
*For each azure L-shape object in the input grid, paint in blue (color 1) the right/down neighbor cell of its upper left pixel.*
