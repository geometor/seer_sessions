Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
  background:
    - color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1,2)
        size: 1
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (4,5)
        size: 1
  background:
    - color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects of size 3. And the background is composed by white cells (color 0).

2.  **Detect the change**
    *   Locate the uppermost and leftmost azure cell of the first azure L-shape.
    *   Change the color of the cell to the immediate right to blue (color 1)

    *   Locate the uppermost and leftmost azure cell of the second azure L-shape.
    *   Change the color of the cell to the immediate down to blue (color 1).

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule can be summarized as:
*For each azure L-shape object in the input grid, paint in blue (color 1) the right/down neighbor cell of its upper left pixel.*

```python
"""
For each azure L-shape object in the input grid, paint in blue (color 1) the right/down neighbor cell of its upper left pixel.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_l_shapes(grid, color):
    # Find all L-shaped objects of a specific color in the grid.
    l_shapes = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            if grid[r, c] == color:
                # Check for L-shape (3 cells)
                if grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c + 1] == color :
                    l_shapes.append((r, c))
                elif grid[r+1,c] == color and grid[r+1,c+1] == color:
                    l_shapes.append((r,c))
                elif grid[r,c+1] == color and grid[r+1,c+1] == color:
                    l_shapes.append((r,c))

    return l_shapes

def transform(input_grid):
    """

    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    azure_l_shapes = find_l_shapes(output_grid, 8)

    for r, c in azure_l_shapes:

        if output_grid[r + 1, c] == 8 and output_grid[r, c + 1] == 8 :
           # Change the cell to the right of the top-left corner to blue
           if c + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:
              output_grid[r, c + 1] = 1
        elif output_grid[r+1,c] == 8 and output_grid[r+1,c+1] == 8:

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
