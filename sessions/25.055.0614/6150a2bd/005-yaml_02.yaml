examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    input_colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    output_colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    transformation: |
      The shape is unchanged.
      The colors are not simply transposed.

  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    transformation: |
        The x and y dimensions are swapped.
        There seems to be color inversion based on position.
