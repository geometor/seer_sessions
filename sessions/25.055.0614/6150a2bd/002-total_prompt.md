## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x799A664604F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x799A66461A20>
Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example and provide my observations. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation from input to output seems to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The colors themselves remain unchanged, but their positions within the grid are altered. It's not a simple reflection or mirroring, as the positions are swapped in a more complex manner. It looks like a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_pixels
  - operation: rotation
    type: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90
  - observation: colors are preserved
  - observation: positions are changed based on rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. The individual color values within the grid remain the same, but their spatial positions are transformed according to the rotation.

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of color values.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Imagine the grid is a physical object being turned.
3.  **Output:** The rotated 3x3 grid with the original colors in their new positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
