Okay, I've analyzed the input and output grids, and formulated a natural language program describing the transformation. Now, I will provide the Python code implementation based on the program.

```python
"""
1. Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2. For each azure object, find the topmost azure pixel.
3. Place a blue pixel (color 1) one position to the right of this topmost azure pixel in the output grid.
4. Copy the identified azure objects to the output grid, maintaining original positions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input):
    # Initialize output as a copy of the input
    output = np.copy(input)

    # Find the coordinates of all azure pixels (color 8)
    azure_pixels = np.argwhere(output == 8)

    # Group azure pixels into connected components (objects)
    objects = []
    visited = set()
    for r, c in azure_pixels:
        if (r, c) not in visited:
            object_pixels = []
            stack = [(r, c)]
            while stack:
                curr_r, curr_c = stack.pop()
                if (curr_r, curr_c) not in visited:
