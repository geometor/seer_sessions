Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input and Output**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes (one 2x2, one 3x1 "ell")
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two L shapes
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 2), (4,4)]
      shape: Single cells
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case we have two separated "L-shaped" azure objects.

2.  **Find Top-Leftmost and Bottom-Rightmost Azure:** Within the azure objects, find the azure cell that is most to the top and to the left, also the one that is most to the bottom and to the right.

3. **Paint to Blue:** Paint blue (color 1) the cells to the right of the top-leftmost azure cell, and paint blue (color 1) the cell to the left of the bottom-rightmost azure cell.

In summary: the azure objects in the corners were identified, and the cells directly beside them were painted to blue.
