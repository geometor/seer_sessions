Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**  Contains three distinct azure (color 8) shapes. One 2x2 square at the top right, one 2x1 vertical shape in the center-left and one 2x2 square in the bottom right.
*   **Output Grid:** The azure shapes are in the same positions. A blue pixel (color 1) appears one position to the right of the topmost azure pixel of each shape.

**YAML Summary:**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2 square
    position: (0,4)
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 vertical rectangle
    position: (2,2)
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2 square
    position: (5,3)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1
    position: relative to each azure object, one pixel to the right of the top azure pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  For each azure object, find the topmost azure pixel.
3.  Place a blue pixel (color 1) one position to the right of this topmost azure pixel.
4.  Copy the identified azure object to the output maintaining the original positions.

The transformation rule is identical to the first example.
