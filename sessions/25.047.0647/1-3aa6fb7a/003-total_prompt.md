Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:** Contains two distinct azure (color 8) shapes. One is a 2x1 vertical shape on the left, and the other is a 2x2 square on the right.
*   **Output Grid:** The azure shapes remain in the same positions. However, a single blue pixel (color 1) appears directly to the right of the topmost azure pixel in each shape.

**YAML Summary:**



*text:*
```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8  # Azure
    shape: 2x1 vertical rectangle
    position: (1,1)
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2 square
    position: (3,4)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1
    position: relative to azure object, one pixel to the right of the top azure pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  For each azure object, find the topmost azure pixel.
3.  Place a blue pixel (color 1) one position to the right of this topmost azure pixel in the output grid.
4.  Copy the identified azure objects to the output grid, maintaining original positions.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
