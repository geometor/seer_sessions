Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: irregular
    positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid. In this case, we have a single object composed of multiple cells of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Singletons:** Look for single cells within object.

3. **Change color:** Transform the color from 8 to 1.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The input contains some disconnected azure (8) colored cells that are part of a larger object. All of these isolated single azure cells become blue(1).

```python

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
