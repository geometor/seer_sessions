All other cells, including non-isolated azure cells and cells of other colors, remain unchanged.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule identifies isolated azure (8) colored cells within a larger object and changes their color to blue (1).\nAll other cells, including non-isolated azure cells and cells of other colors, remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds objects in the grid.\n    An object is a set of connected cells with the same color.\n    \"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n\n    def is_valid(pos):\n        return 0 <= pos[0] < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= pos[1] < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, current_object):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not is_valid((row, col)) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(row + dr, col + dc, color, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if (row, col) not in visited:\n                color = grid[row, col]\n                if color != 0:\n                  current_object = []\n                  dfs(row, col, color, current_object)\n                  objects.append((color, current_object))\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    Isolated azure (8) colored cells that are part of larger objects become blue (1).\n    \"\"\"\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # change output pixels\n    for color, cells in objects:\n        if color == 8:\n          for cell in cells:\n              row,col = cell\n              neighbors = 0\n              for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n                  nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                  if 0 <= nr < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < input_grid.shape[1] and input_grid[nr,nc] == 8:\n                      neighbors +=1\n\n              if neighbors == 0:\n                  output_grid[row,col] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThe provided code and natural language description perfectly aligns with the transformation shown between the new example pair of input/output.
