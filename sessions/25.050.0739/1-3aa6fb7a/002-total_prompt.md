Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Input Grid**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: irregular
    positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid. In this case, we have a single object composed of multiple cells of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Singletons:** Look for single cells within object.

3. **Change color:** Transform the color from 8 to 1.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The input contains some disconnected azure (8) colored cells that are part of a larger object. All of these isolated single azure cells become blue(1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
