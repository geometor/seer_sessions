The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a specific interaction between adjacent green pixels, resulting in the introduction of yellow (4) pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The transformation appears local, focused on immediate neighborhoods.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
