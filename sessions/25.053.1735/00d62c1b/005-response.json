            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code attempted to identify contiguous green regions and change the color of green pixels to yellow if they were on the bottom or right edges of horizontal or vertical segments. However, the results show numerous mismatches, indicating that the edge detection logic is flawed or incomplete. The main issue seems to be an over-aggressive or incorrect identification of \"edge\" pixels, along with diagonal considerations. My strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Simplify Edge Detection:** Refocus on only cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) for neighbor checking, abandoning diagonal consideration.\n2.  **Refine Edge Criteria:** Ensure that a green pixel is only considered an edge pixel if it's part of a contiguous green segment in at least one cardinal direction AND has a non-green neighbor in the opposite direction along that axis.\n3. **Prioritize contiguous shapes:** Use the concept of contiguous shapes, rather than applying actions at random.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of the metrics based on provided examples, focusing on notable deviations between expected and transformed outputs:\n\n| Example | Pixels Off | Key Discrepancies                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| :------ | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | 2          | Two edge pixels not turned yellow.                                                                                                                                        |\n| 2       | 8         | Incorrect yellow pixels within the segments.          |\n| 3       | 24         | many edge pixels incorrectly turned yellow (especially interior edges), and several missed edge cases.                                                                                     |\n| 4       | 27         | Similar to Example 3, many incorrect yellows and missed edges, particularly around diagonal green segments.                                                                   |\n| 5       | 83        | Widespread incorrect yellow pixels, especially along diagonals, and some missing yellows on true horizontal/vertical edges.                                                              |\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: 045e1274\n  - objects:\n      - description: Contiguous green regions.\n        properties:\n          - color: green (3)\n          - shape: variable (lines, blocks, diagonals)\n          - edges: Defined by adjacent non-green pixels or grid boundaries.\n      - description: Transformed edge pixels\n        properties:\n          - original_color: green (3)\n          - new_color: yellow (4)\n          - location: Rightmost or bottommost pixel of a horizontal or vertical green segment.\n  - actions:\n      - name: Identify contiguous green regions.\n        details: Find all connected green pixels.\n      - name: Determine edge pixels.\n        details: Within each region, identify green pixels that are on the bottom or right edge of horizontal or vertical lines.\n      - name: Change color.\n        details: Change the color of identified edge pixels from green to yellow.\n  - rules:\n      - condition: A green pixel is part of a contiguous region, and it's the rightmost pixel in a horizontal green segment, or it is the bottomost in a vertical green line.\n        action: Change the pixel's color to yellow.\n      - condition: a pixel that is on the right or bottom of a contiguous region.\n        action: change the pixel's color to yellow\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green pixels. A contiguous region is a group of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, *not* diagonally) to at least one other green pixel in the region.\n\n2.  **Horizontal and Vertical Segment Identification:** Within each contiguous green region, examine each pixel to see if they are a member of a set of horizontal or vertical line segments.\n\n3.  **Edge Pixel Determination:**\n    *   **Horizontal Edges:** A green pixel on a horizontal segment is a \"right edge\" if the pixel to its immediate right is *not* green, or it is on the right boundary.\n    *    **Vertical Edges:** A green pixel on a vertical segment is a \"bottom edge\" if the pixel immediately below it is *not* green, or the pixel is on the bottom boundary.\n\n4.  **Color Transformation:** Change the color of any green pixel identified as a \"right edge\" or \"bottom edge\" to yellow.\n\n5.  **Other Pixels:** All the other pixels are not changed.\n"
