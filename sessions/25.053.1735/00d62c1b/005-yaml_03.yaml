  - task_id: 045e1274
  - objects:
      - description: Contiguous green regions.
        properties:
          - color: green (3)
          - shape: variable (lines, blocks, diagonals)
          - edges: Defined by adjacent non-green pixels or grid boundaries.
      - description: Transformed edge pixels
        properties:
          - original_color: green (3)
          - new_color: yellow (4)
          - location: Rightmost or bottommost pixel of a horizontal or vertical green segment.
  - actions:
      - name: Identify contiguous green regions.
        details: Find all connected green pixels.
      - name: Determine edge pixels.
        details: Within each region, identify green pixels that are on the bottom or right edge of horizontal or vertical lines.
      - name: Change color.
        details: Change the color of identified edge pixels from green to yellow.
  - rules:
      - condition: A green pixel is part of a contiguous region, and it's the rightmost pixel in a horizontal green segment, or it is the bottomost in a vertical green line.
        action: Change the pixel's color to yellow.
      - condition: a pixel that is on the right or bottom of a contiguous region.
        action: change the pixel's color to yellow
