The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid by adding new colored pixels around existing non-zero pixels. The added pixels seem to form a sort of \"halo\" or \"border\" around the original pixels. The colors of the added pixels depend on the color of the adjacent filled pixel.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

For each seed pixel determine a set of \"border\" positions relative to it.\n4.  For each seed pixel and relative position pair:\n    *   Check if calculated border position is within the bounds of the grid.\n    *   Check the \"seed\" pixel's color, and determine the border color from a fixed mapping.\n    *   Check the input and get border pixel color from color mapping.\n    *   Set the border pixel in the output grid to the determined border color.\n5.  **Copy** seed pixel to same location in output.\n6.  Pixels that are not seeds or borders are 0 (white) in the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation adds a colored border around each non-zero pixel in the input grid. The color of the border pixels, and the relative positions, depends on the color of the original, central pixel.\n"
