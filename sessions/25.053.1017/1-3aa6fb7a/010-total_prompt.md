# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x75C2E5C1AE60>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0

0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a numerical value corresponding to a color. The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure pixels. It appears that the blue pixels are inserted near the azure ones, but not just randomly; there seems to be some logic defining exactly where and how many.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 7
      - height: 7
      - cells: integers representing colors
    relations:
      - contains: azure_objects, blue_objects, white_objects

  - object: azure_objects
    description: Contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - shape: variable
    relations:
      - adjacent_to: blue_objects (in output)

  - object: blue_objects
    description: Individual blue (1) pixels
    properties:
      - color: blue
    relations:
      - adjacent_to: azure_objects (in output)
    notes: |
       introduced during the transformation; not present in the original input.

  - object: white_objects
    description: contiguous block of white(0) pixels
    properties:
      - color: white
    relations:
      - surrounds: azure_objects, blue_objects
    notes: the background
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Insert Blue Pixels Diagonally**: For some azure pixels, place a blue (1) pixel diagonally adjacent to the azure pixel, specifically, either directly above or directly below *and* left one position or right one position.
3. **Selective transformation**: Not all azure pixels get a blue neighbor, only those that are at the diagonal edges of an azure shape.
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including the existing azure pixels, remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
