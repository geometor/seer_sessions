Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. These are the target objects.
2.  **Iterate:** For each azure object:
    a. **Determine Top and Bottom Rows:** Find the minimum and maximum row indices for the object.
    b. **Target Rows:**
        * Get the row immediately *below* the top row.
        * Get the row immediately *above* the bottom row.
    c. **Select Pixel in Each Target Row:**
       * If a target row exists, and contains azure pixels:
          *Find the right-most azure pixel in that target row.
          *Find the azure pixel immediately to the *left* of that right-most pixel.
          *If found, select this pixel.
    d. **Modify:** If a pixel is selected, change its color from azure (8) to blue (1).
3.  **Output:** The output grid is the modified input grid. All original pixels are unchanged except for those specifically modified within the azure objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
