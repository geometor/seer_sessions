The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure pixels. It appears that the blue pixels are inserted near the azure ones, but not just randomly; there seems to be some logic defining exactly where and how many.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
