# Example

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470FC70>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470C520>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a consistent mapping of input values to output values. There is no apparent spatial or geometric manipulation; it appears to be a direct one-to-one substitution.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      role: input/output container
  - type: cell
    properties:
      value: integer
      color: mapped from integer value
      role: individual element within grid

actions:
  - type: value_substitution
    description: Each input cell value is replaced with a corresponding output value.
    logic: direct mapping

relationships:
  - type: one-to-one
    description: Each input cell maps directly to a corresponding output cell.
    constraint: same row and column index

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Mapping:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the cell value is 3, replace it with 4.
    *   If the cell value is 1, replace it with 5.
    *   If the cell value is 2, replace it with 6.
3.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

Essentially the process is the addition of one to the values of the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
