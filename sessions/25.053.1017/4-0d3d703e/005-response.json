Each number in the input grid corresponds to a specific color (as defined by the `COLOR_MAP`). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, but the numbers, and thus the colors, are different.  The transformation appears to be a consistent mapping of input numbers to output numbers.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
