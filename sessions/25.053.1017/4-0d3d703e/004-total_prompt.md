# Example

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470FC70>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470DEA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer represents a specific color. The transformation seems to involve adding a constant value to each corresponding element in the input grid to produce the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - color: defined by integer value (COLOR_MAP)
      - position: row and column index

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: add a constant value to each element
    input: 3x3 grid
    output: 3x3 grid

relationships:
  - element-wise correspondence between input and output grids
  - constant difference between corresponding elements
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers, each representing a color.
2.  **Transformation:** For each element in the input grid, add a constant value of '4' to it.
3. **Output:** the constant is added to every number. Therefore, the output will be the new numbers as another 3x3 grid.

Essentially we are adding the number 4 to the original value of each cell.
2 becomes 6.
3 becomes (3+1) = 4
8 becomes (8 + 1) = 9

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
