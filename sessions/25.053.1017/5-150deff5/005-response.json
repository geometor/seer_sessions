The primary element appears to be a recognizable shape formed by connected pixels of the same color (gray '5' in the input) against a background of a different color (white '0'). This shape is then seemingly decomposed into two distinct sub-shapes, each assigned a unique color (red '2' and azure '8'). The decomposition seems to follow the contours of the original shape, splitting it based on connectivity.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this case, it's the gray (5) shape.\n2.  **Decompose the Object:** Divide the foreground object into two distinct sub-objects. The division appears to be based on runs along the rows. The first two '5' pixels encountered on row 2 will be the starting elements of a breadth-first search. Pixels that are adjacent (not diagonal) to these pixels will be included in sub-shape\\_1.\n3. **Recolor sub-shapes:** sub-shape\\_1 receives color red (2).\n4.  **Remaining Pixels:** The pixels from the original shape that are not assigned to sub-shape\\_1 are assigned to sub-shape\\_2.\n5. **Recolor sub-shapes:** sub-shape\\_2 receives color azure (8).\n6.  **Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, with the background color (0) everywhere except for the locations of sub-shape\\_1 and sub-shape\\_2, colored as defined.\n\n"
