In this case, it's the gray (5) shape.\n2.  **Decompose the Object:** Divide the foreground object into two distinct sub-objects. The division appears to be based on runs along the rows. The first two '5' pixels encountered on row 2 will be the starting elements of a breadth-first search. Pixels that are adjacent (not diagonal) to these pixels will be included in sub-shape_1.\n3. **Recolor sub-shapes:** sub-shape_1 receives color red (2).\n4.  **Remaining Pixels:** The pixels from the original shape that are not assigned to sub-shape_1 are assigned to sub-shape_2.\n5. **Recolor sub-shapes:** sub-shape_2 receives color azure (8).\n6.  **Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, with the background color (0) everywhere except for the locations of sub-shape_1 and sub-shape_2, colored as defined.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_object(grid, background_color):\n    # returns a set of (row, col) tuples representing the object\n    object_pixels = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != background_color:\n                object_pixels.add((r, c))\n    return object_pixels\n\ndef breadth_first_search(grid, start_pixels, object_pixels):\n    # performs a breadth-first search to find connected pixels\n    visited = set()\n    queue = list(start_pixels)  # convert set to list\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.pop(0)\n        if (r, c) in visited or (r, c) not in object_pixels:\n            continue\n        visited.add((r, c))\n\n        # Add adjacent neighbors (not diagonal)\n        neighbors = [(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)]\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]:\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n    return visited\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    background_color = 0\n    foreground_color = 5\n    sub_shape_1_color = 2\n    sub_shape_2_color = 8\n\n    # get the foreground object\n    object_pixels = get_object(input_grid, background_color)\n\n    # find start pixels for sub-shape 1 (first two foreground pixels on row 2)\n    start_pixels = set()\n    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        found_count = 0\n        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n           if input_grid[r,c] == foreground_color:\n              start_pixels.add((r,c))\n              found_count += 1\n              if found_count == 2:\n                break\n        if found_count == 2:\n            break\n    \n    # decompose the object using BFS\n    sub_shape_1 = breadth_first_search(input_grid, start_pixels, object_pixels)\n    sub_shape_2 = object_pixels - sub_shape_1\n\n    # fill output grid with sub-shape 1\n    for r, c in sub_shape_1:\n        output_grid[r, c] = sub_shape_1_color\n    \n    # fill output grid with sub-shape 2\n    for r, c in sub_shape_2:\n        output_grid[r, c] = sub_shape_2_color\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
