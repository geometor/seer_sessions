The primary element is a recognizable shape formed by connected pixels of a single color (gray - 5) in the input grid. This shape appears to be undergoing a color transformation and possibly a type of \"splitting\" or \"alternating\" color fill. The background (white - 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Apply an alternating pattern - fill.\n4. The pattern starts on the topleft most pixel of the object, and alternates horizontally and vertically.\n5.
