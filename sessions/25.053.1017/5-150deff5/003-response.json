The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5) in the input and azure (8) and red (2) in the output. The output grid appears to maintain the overall shape and dimensions of the input grid. The transformation seems to involve a color substitution based on the arrangement of the gray pixels, specifically creating an outline.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
