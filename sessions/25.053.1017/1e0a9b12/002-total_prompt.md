# Example

**input:**
```
0 4 0 9
0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0
1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x75C2E470C730>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 4x4 grids. The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a rearrangement of some of the elements from the input grid, with many elements becoming 0. The non-zero elements in the input do not change their values when they appear in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_meaning: color_codes
  - observation: input_grid_contains_non_zero_elements
  - observation: output_grid_mostly_zeros
  - observation: non_zero_elements_retain_value_in_output
  - action: rearrange_elements
    description: Some non-zero elements from the input are moved to different positions in the output grid.
  - relationship: input_output_element_correspondence
    description: The values of the moved elements are preserved.
  - relationship: most_input_elements_become_zero_in_output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-zero Elements:** Locate all non-zero elements within the input grid.
2.  **Discard Most:** Most of the non-zero elements are discarded (set to 0).
3. **Reposition Remaining:** Move a few non-zero elements to new locations on the grid, specifically to the last row.
4. **Order:** Order non-zero elements in the last row by their original row index, then column index, from top-left to bottom right.
5.  **Fill with Zeros:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with 0.

In more concise way:

The transformation moves the non-zero elements of the input grid to the last row of the output grid, preserving their original values, and all other cells are zeros. The last row ordering by index in original grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
