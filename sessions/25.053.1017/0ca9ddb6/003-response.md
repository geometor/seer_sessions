Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation isn't a simple one-to-one color mapping, as the same colors in the input can map to different colors in the output, and vice versa. The spatial arrangement and relative positions of colored pixels seem to play a crucial role. There are several distinct colors appearing: white (0), azure (8), blue (1), red (2), and it looks like new colors yellow (4) and orange (7) are introduced in the transformation. The azure (8) in the input appears to influence or seed a pattern in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 9x9.
  - observation: |
      Input grid contains colors: white (0), azure (8), blue (1), and red (2).
  - observation: |
      Output grid contains colors: white (0), azure (8), blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), and orange (7).
  - object: azure_pixel
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
    location:
      input: (0, 3) # (row, column), 0-indexed
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
    locations:
      input: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
  - object: red_pixels
    properties:
      color: red (2)
    locations:
      input: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
  - relationship: |
      The azure (8) pixel in the input remains in the same location in the output.
  - relationship: |
       An orange (7) cross shape appears centered on the locations of the blue pixels.
  - relationship: |
      A yellow (4) cross shape appears adjacent to the red pixels, extending diagonally.
  - action: |
      New colors (orange and yellow) are introduced based on the positions of existing colors.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Azure:** Keep any azure (8) pixels in their original positions.

2.  **Orange Crosses:** For each blue (1) pixel in the input:
    *   Create an orange (7) pixel at the same location in the output.
    *   Extend an orange (7) "cross" shape: one pixel up, down, left, and right from the original blue pixel's location, but only if those locations are within the grid bounds and not occupied by the azure (8) pixel.

3.  **Yellow Diagonals:** For each red (2) pixel in the input:
    * Create a yellow pixel one step diagonally up and to the right.
    * Create a yellow pixel one step diagonally down and to the left.

4. **Maintain Input:** Keep any red and blue pixels in their original position.

5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other pixels remain white (0).
