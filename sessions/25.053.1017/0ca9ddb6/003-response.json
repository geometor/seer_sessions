The transformation isn't a simple one-to-one color mapping, as the same colors in the input can map to different colors in the output, and vice versa. The spatial arrangement and relative positions of colored pixels seem to play a crucial role. There are several distinct colors appearing: white (0), azure (8), blue (1), red (2), and it looks like new colors yellow (4) and orange (7) are introduced in the transformation. The azure (8) in the input appears to influence or seed a pattern in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
