The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a rearrangement of some of the elements from the input grid, with many elements becoming 0. The non-zero elements in the input do not change their values when they appear in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
