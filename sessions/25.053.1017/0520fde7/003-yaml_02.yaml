facts:
  - observation: Input grid is a 3x7 matrix of integers (0, 1, 5).
  - observation: Output grid is a 3x3 matrix of integers (0, 2).
  - observation: Input colors include blue (1), white (0), and gray (5).
  - observation: Output colors include white (0) and red (2).
  - object: Input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x7
      colors: [0, 1, 5]
  - object: Output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2]
  - relationship: Output_grid is derived from Input_grid.
  - action: Certain pixels in Input_grid are replaced to form Output_grid.
  - property_change: Color of some pixels changes from blue to red.
  - spatial_relation: The central column of gray pixels in the input corresponds to the creation of the output with the transformation defined.
