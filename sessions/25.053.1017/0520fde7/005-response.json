The input grid appears to be larger (7x3) than the output grid (3x3). The colors present in the input are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2).  The central column of gray pixels (5) in the input seems to disappear. It also looks like a blue (1) pixel is \"changing\" to a red pixel (2) at the same relative position.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
