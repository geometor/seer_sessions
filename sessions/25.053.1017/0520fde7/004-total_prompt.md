# Example

**input:**
```
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
0 0 1 5 1 1 1
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x75C2E5BFF730>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E5BFD810>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid appears to be a smaller, condensed version of the input, focusing on specific colors and possibly their relative positions, resulting in white(0) and red(2) pixels. The most prominent change seems to be the replacement of certain colored pixels with red ones, possibly based on the gray column in input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is a 3x7 matrix of integers (0, 1, 5).
  - observation: Output grid is a 3x3 matrix of integers (0, 2).
  - observation: Input colors include blue (1), white (0), and gray (5).
  - observation: Output colors include white (0) and red (2).
  - object: Input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x7
      colors: [0, 1, 5]
  - object: Output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2]
  - relationship: Output_grid is derived from Input_grid.
  - action: Certain pixels in Input_grid are replaced to form Output_grid.
  - property_change: Color of some pixels changes from blue to red.
  - spatial_relation: The central column of gray pixels in the input corresponds to the creation of the output with the transformation defined.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Column:** Locate the vertical column in the input grid where all pixels are gray (5).
2.  **Extract Adjacent Columns:** Consider the columns immediately to the left and right of the key gray column.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
4. **Populate White:** Populate the output grid with white pixels, everywhere
5. **Translate and Transform Pixels**: If, in the columns extracted, a pixel is blue(1), then a red(2) pixel occupies that index in the output.
6. Ignore the gray column, and other input data, it is used to establish the columns to transform, but has not other data related to the transformation.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
