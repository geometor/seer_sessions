The input grid seems to have a pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid appears to be a smaller, condensed version of the input, focusing on specific colors and possibly their relative positions, resulting in white(0) and red(2) pixels. The most prominent change seems to be the replacement of certain colored pixels with red ones, possibly based on the gray column in input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
