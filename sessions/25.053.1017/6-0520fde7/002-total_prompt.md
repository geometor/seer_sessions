# Example

**input:**
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x75C2E470ED40>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470C7F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a specific pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a central area, changing the gray (5) to red (2) and surrounded by the white pixels, based on the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, gray]
      - dimensions: 3x7
      - pattern: vertical stripe of gray in the center, blue and white elsewhere.
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red]
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - pattern: central red pixel, surrounded by white.
  - type: object
    description: central column
    properties:
       - color: gray
       - location: input grid, column 4 (index 3)
  - type: transformation
    description: color change
    properties:
      - from: gray
      - to: red
    location: center of the input grid
  - type: transformation
    description: size reduction
    properties:
       - from: 3 x 7
       - to:  3 x 3
  - type: relationship
    description: spatial
    properties:
      - input_center: maps to output center
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center:** Locate the central 3x3 region within the input grid.
2.  **Extract Central Region:** extract the central region as the base for
    output
3.  **Transform Center:** locate center pixel in the central region, if
    color is gray (5), change to red (2).
4.  **Preserve Surrounding:** keep every other pixel in extracted region from input to output

In essence, the transformation extracts the central 3x3 area of the input grid, and if present, changes gray to red in center, and keep the surrounding.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
