# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x75C2E470D9C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470DCC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger (7x3) than the output grid (3x3). The colors present in the input are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2).  The central column of gray pixels (5) in the input seems to disappear. It also looks like a blue (1) pixel is "changing" to a red pixel (2) at the same relative position.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 7x3 grid of pixels with colors white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
  - observation: |
      The output is a 3x3 grid of pixels with colors white (0) and red (2).
  - observation: |
     The central column, all Gray(5), in the input grid is absent in output grid.
  - observation: |
     Blue pixel in input at 0-indexed position [0,2] changes to Red(2) at 0-indexed position[0,1]
  - observation: |
      Blue pixel in input at 0-indexed position [1,1] changes to Red at 0-indexed position [1,0]
  - observation: |
     Blue pixel in the input at 0-indexed position [2,2] changes to Red at 0-indexed position[2,2]
  - relationship: |
      The output grid's width is less by four. The output grid's height is equal.
  - action: |
    Input is transformed to Output, keeping some structure, while the colors change and the central Gray(5) pixels are removed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Remove the Central Column:** Delete the entire central column (column index 3, 0-indexed) of the input grid, which consists of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Remove Columns:** remove one more column of pixels to the left of the original central column, and two columns of pixels from the right of the original central column.
3.  **Change Blue to Red:** In the remaining grid, any pixel that had color 1(blue) becomes color to 2 (red) in the output.
4. **Retain Whites:** white (0) colored pixels are not changed.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
