observations:
  - task: Copy and expand objects
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 4
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [5, 5] # height, width
          count: 3
        - color: 3
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [3, 5]
          count: 1
      transformations:
        - action: replicate
          details: "Replicate existing objects next to original, maintaining shape, size and color. If object adjacent, do not replicate"
      notes: |
        The first object (color 4) should be replicated horizontally because there is space.
        The second object (color 3) should not be replicated, since there is no adjacent space.
        Single-color objects are treated as any other object, expanding where there's adjacent blank space.

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 6
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [2, 3]
          count: 1
        - color: 6
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [4, 6]
          count: 1
        - color: 3
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [1,1]
          count: 1
        - color: 3
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [2,1]
          count: 1
        - color: 4
          shape: rectangle
          dimensions: [2,2]
          count: 1
      transformations:
        - action: replicate
          details: "Replicate single-color objects horizontally and/or vertically if adjacent space exists. No color changes"
      notes:
        Single cell object of color 3 at [9,2] replicates to occupy 4 cells in a rectangle with color 4 inside.
        single cell object of color 3 at [12,7] expands into a 4x4 object.
        Object of color 6 at 10,12 expands vertically.
