      description: >
        Duplicates objects across the horizontal center line of the grid.
        Objects maintain their original positions and are also mirrored.
      details: >
        For each object, the vertical reflection (mirror image) is created
        across the center row. The center row index is calculated as rows // 2.
        The mirrored position for a pixel at (r, c) is (rows - 1 - r, c).
