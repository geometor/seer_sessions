Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The transformation seems to involve inserting a modified copy of a section of the input grid into or beside the original grid. The modification usually has a color change of a sub-part. The insertion location and related dimensions seem critical.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: |
      Grid values are single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: |
     train_1: The number '1' is replaced by '0' and a copy of left side 4x4 matrix is added to the right.
  - observation: |
     train_2: The number '1' is replaced by '0' and a copy of the left side 3x3 matrix added to the right.
  - observation: |
     train_3: Input can be divided into two parts, one part is 3x4 matrix with color '6', the other part is a 3x4 matrix made of numbers from 0,1,4,6 and 4. The first part is repeated three times, interpersed by three copies of only the last row of the second part.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify key column:** Find the right-most column in the input grid that contains the greatest number of *different* digits.
2.  **Construct Repetitions:**
    *   Create copies of all columns to the *left* of this key column.
3.  **Replace:** change all values in the key column to 0.
4. **Insert:**
    * in train\_1 and train\_2, we insert the left side copy to the *right* of the key column.
    * in train\_3, a special row is inserted repeatedly: extract just the key column from the input and set all values to 0. Insert a copy of this special row in between three copies of first part (3x4 matrix).
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.
