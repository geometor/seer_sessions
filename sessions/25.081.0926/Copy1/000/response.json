Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9).\n*   **Output:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels, with the same dimensions (height and width) doubled compared to the input grid.\n*   **Colors:** The input grids contain a primary color (3 in the first example, 2 in the second, and 4 in the third) and black (0). These colors are preserved in the output.\n*   **Pattern:** The input pattern appears to be repeated four times in a 2x2 arrangement within the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n"
