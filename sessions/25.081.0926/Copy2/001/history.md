Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids in each example: an input grid and a corresponding output grid. Both grids consist of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There are distinct rectangular shapes formed by non-zero pixels within each grid. The transformation seems to involve copying parts of the input grid and, more crucially, overlaying/inserting a smaller version of the upper shape onto the lower shape in the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - shape1:
      type: rectangle
      properties:
        color: variable (red in example 1, blue in example 2)
        location: top portion of grid
        content: may contain other colors
  - shape2:
      type: rectangle
      properties:
        color: azure
        location: bottom portion of grid
        content: initially, only azure and background
  - grid:
    type: 2D array
    properties:
        dimensions: variable (rows x cols)

actions:
  - copy:
    description: Duplicate a shape from one location to another.
  - overlay:
      description: Place one shape on top of another, replacing existing pixels.
  - translate_shape:
    description: extract and change position of the inner shape from a larger shape

relationships:
  - shape1_contains_smaller_shape: shape1 contains a region of different colors
  - shape2_becomes_target: shape2 has a smaller shape overlaid onto it.
  - overlay_centered: smaller shape overlaid on the bigger object in the original image

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate two primary rectangular shapes in the input grid. The first shape (`shape1`) is located in the upper portion of the grid and may contain an inner shape with different colors than the outside of `shape1`. The second shape (`shape2`) is in the lower portion and is initially filled with azure (color 8) and may have empty space (color 0) on the interior.
2.  **Extract Inner Shape:** From `shape1`, extract the contiguous inner region that does not have the same color as the outer border of `shape1`.
3.  **Copy Base:** Copy `shape2` from the input grid to the output grid.
4.  **Overlay:** Overlay the inner shape extracted in step 2 onto the center of `shape2` in the output grid. Center it based on the width and height of shape2 and inner shape .
5. **Copy remainder:** Copy other areas of input to output.

In essence, the transformation extracts an inner part of the upper shape and places it onto the center region of the lower shape, while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.
