The remaining pixels are white (0). The corresponding output grid uses only white (0) and the specific non-white color from the input grid.\n4.  **Pattern Correlation:** The 9x9 output grid appears to be a fixed pattern determined solely by the *position* of the single non-white pixel within the 3x3 input grid.\n5.  **Color Application:** The *color* of the non-white pixel in the input determines the color used for the non-white parts of the output pattern. White pixels in the input do not seem to directly influence the output pattern, other than signifying which pixel *is* the determining one.\n6.  **Positional Mapping:** It seems there's a distinct 9x9 pattern associated with each of the 9 possible locations within the 3x3 input grid. The training examples show the patterns for 5 specific input locations: (1, 0), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), and (1, 1).\n\n**Facts**\n\n```"
