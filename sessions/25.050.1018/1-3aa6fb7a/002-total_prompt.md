Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my breakdown:

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background_color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background_color: 0 (white)
  changes:
     - position: [1,2]
       original_color: 0
       new_color: 1
     - position: [4,4]
       original_color: 0
       new_color: 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule in natural language:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8). The rest of the grid is filled with the background color white (0).

2.  **Object Persistence:** both azure objects are preserved from input to output.

2.  **Detect Change:**
    *   The top left object has a new color to their right, in the top part of the L.
    *   The bottom right object has a new color to their left, in the bottom part of the L.

3. **Describe the changes**:
    *   The new colors added are 1.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation rule is simple, a color 1 is placed, relative to each object.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
