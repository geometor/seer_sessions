Here's my breakdown:\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (rotated)\n      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (rotated)\n      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]\n  background_color: 0 (white)\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 7x7\n  objects:\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (rotated)\n      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: L-shape (rotated)\n      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]\n  background_color: 0 (white)\n  changes:\n     - position: [1,2]\n       original_color: 0\n       new_color: 1\n     - position: [4,4]\n       original_color: 0\n       new_color: 1\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule in natural language:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8). The rest of the grid is filled with the background color white (0).\n\n2.  **Object Persistence:** both azure objects are preserved from input to output.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:**\n    *   The top left object has a new color to their right, in the top part of the L.\n    *   The bottom right object has a new color to their left, in the bottom part of the L.\n\n3. **Describe the changes**:\n    *   The new colors added are 1.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary:**\n\nThe transformation rule is simple, a color 1 is placed, relative to each object.\n\n"
