objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - pixels: Individual elements within the grid, each with a color value.

  - name: pixel
    description: A single cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: An integer representing the pixel's color (0-9).
      - row: The row index of the pixel.
      - col: The column index of the pixel.
      - neighbors: A set of up to four pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right).

actions:
  - name: check_neighbors
    description: Inspects the neighbors of a red pixel.
    input: A red pixel.
    process:
      - Get the colors of the four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
      - If any neighbor is out of bounds, it is not considered.
      - If and only if all four neighbors exist and have the same color, the condition is met.
    output: A boolean value indicating whether the condition is met.

  - name: change_color
    description: Changes the color of a pixel.
    input: A pixel and a new color.
    process: Sets the pixel's color to the new color.
    output: None (modifies the grid in place).

transformation_rule:
  description: Transforms red pixels to azure based on neighbor colors.
  process:
    - Iterate through each pixel in the grid.
    - If a pixel is red (color = 2):
        - Perform 'check_neighbors' action on the pixel.
        - If 'check_neighbors' returns True:
            - Perform 'change_color' action on the pixel, setting the new color to azure (8).
    - Other pixels remain unchanged.
