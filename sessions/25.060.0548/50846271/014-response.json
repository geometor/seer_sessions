I say 'some' because some of the gray pixels remain unchanged. It appears that the modification is done only if gray(5) is a part of the underlying checkerboard pattern. In other words, if gray(5) is surrounded by white(0), it may become an azure(8)\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_clusters(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds clusters of a specific color in a grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    clusters = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_cluster):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to explore a cluster.\"\"\"\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_cluster.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_cluster)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_cluster)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_cluster)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_cluster)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_cluster = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_cluster)\n                clusters.append(current_cluster)\n    return clusters\n\ndef get_adjacent_pixels(grid, pixel, include_diagonal=False):\n   \"\"\"Returns a list of adjacent pixel coordinates to the given pixel.\"\"\"\n   row, col = pixel\n   adjacent = []\n   for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n       for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n           if (dr == 0 and dc == 0) or (include_diagonal is False and (dr != 0 and dc != 0)):\n               continue\n           new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc\n           if 0 <= new_row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= new_col < grid.shape[1]:\n               adjacent.append((new_row, new_col))\n   return adjacent\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    red_clusters = find_clusters(output_grid, 2)\n\n    for cluster in red_clusters:\n        for red_pixel in cluster:\n            adjacent_pixels = get_adjacent_pixels(output_grid, red_pixel)\n            for adj_row, adj_col in adjacent_pixels:\n                if output_grid[adj_row, adj_col] == 5:\n                    # Check the checkerboard pattern.\n                    neighbors = get_adjacent_pixels(output_grid, (adj_row, adj_col))\n                    white_neighbors = 0\n                    for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                         if output_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                            white_neighbors +=1\n                    \n                    if white_neighbors > 0:\n                        output_grid[adj_row, adj_col] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
