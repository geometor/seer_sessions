Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of red (2) pixels. These are the "red objects".
2.  **Determine Extremities:** For each red pixel within a red object, count its red neighbors (up, down, left, right - not diagonal). If a red pixel has *one or fewer* red neighbors, it's an "extremity".
3. **Determine Inner**: Any red pixel which is *not* an extremity, will be considered "inner".
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid as follows:
    *   Copy all non-red pixels from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their values.
    *   For each "inner" red pixel identified in step 3, set corresponding pixel of the output to azure(8)
    *   For each "extremity" red pixel identified in step 2, keep its value to red (2).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
