Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Checkerboard:** Recognize the underlying checkerboard pattern consisting of alternating gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Locate Red Clusters:** Find all clusters of red (2) pixels.  A cluster is a group of one or more connected red pixels.
3.  **Check for Red/Gray Adjacency:** For each red pixel within each red cluster, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right – *not* diagonal).
4.  **Conditional Gray Modification:** If a gray (5) pixel is adjacent to a red (2) pixel, determine if the gray pixel is part of the checkerboard. *A gray pixel is considered part of the checkerboard if it's adjacent to at least one white pixel*. If *both* conditions are true (adjacent to red AND part of the checkerboard), change the gray (5) pixel to azure (8).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
