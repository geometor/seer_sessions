Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of red (2) pixels. These are the "red objects".
2.  **Determine Extremities:** For each red pixel within a red object, count its red neighbors (up, down, left, right - not diagonal). If a red pixel has *one or fewer* red neighbors, it's an "extremity".
3. **Determine Inner**: Any red pixel which is *not* an extremity, will be considered "inner".
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid as follows:
    *   Copy all non-red pixels from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their values.
    *   For each "inner" red pixel identified in step 3, set corresponding pixel of the output to azure(8)
    *   For each "extremity" red pixel identified in step 2, keep its value to red (2).

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of differentiating between "extremity" and "inner" red pixels. However, the initial definition of "extremity" (one or fewer red neighbors) is too restrictive. The test results, especially on examples with larger, more complex red shapes, demonstrated that the logic fails to correctly classify all inner and outer pixels. The code works perfectly for the first training example but fails on others, suggesting that the initial hypothesis, while partially correct, isn't general enough.

The strategy for resolving errors will be iterative:

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Examine the failed examples closely to understand *why* the current logic fails. Visually compare input, expected output, and actual output.
2.  **Refine "Extremity" Definition:** The crucial update is to redefine what constitutes an "extremity" or "inner" pixel.  The current neighbor count is insufficient. We need to consider connectivity more broadly.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** After each modification to the natural language program, generate updated code, and re-test against *all* examples, not just the current one.

**Example Analysis and Metrics (using code execution):**

I will use `numpy` for array manipulation and analysis. I'll write small utility functions within code execution blocks to derive specific metrics like the number of incorrectly classified pixels.

```python
import numpy as np

def count_mismatches(predicted, expected):
    """Counts the number of differing pixels between two grids."""
    return np.sum(np.array(predicted) != np.array(expected))

def analyze_results(examples):
    """Analyzes a list of examples, comparing predicted and expected outputs."""
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = example["input"]
        expected_output = example["output"]
        predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
        mismatches = count_mismatches(predicted_output, expected_output)
        results.append({
            "example": i + 1,
            "input_shape": np.array(input_grid).shape,
            "output_shape": np.array(expected_output).shape,
            "mismatches": mismatches,
            "success": mismatches == 0
        })
    return results

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
