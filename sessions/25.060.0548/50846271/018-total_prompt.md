Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the checkerboard pattern and the interaction between red and gray pixels. However, the additional training examples reveal a flaw in the checkerboard identification logic. Specifically, the original program *only* considered a gray pixel to be part of the checkerboard if it was adjacent to a *white* pixel. The provided examples, including the new failing cases show this is overly restrictive. The failures on examples 2 and 3 suggest that adjacency to ANY non-red neighbor should be sufficient.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Metrics and Error Analysis:** Execute the code on all training examples, and then write code to provide pixel counts of the input, expected output and actual output for each example.
2.  **YAML Fact Extraction:** Create a YAML document summarizing the objects (checkerboard, red clusters), their properties (colors, positions), and the actions (conditional color change). I will base this initially off of the example 0, updating as needed for the other examples.
3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Modify the natural language program to correctly describe the conditions under which a gray pixel is changed to azure, removing the restriction of requiring adjacent white cells, using the more general rule based on the errors.

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Checkerboard:** Recognize the underlying checkerboard pattern consisting of alternating gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Locate Red Clusters:** Find all clusters of red (2) pixels. A cluster is a group of one or more connected red pixels.
3.  **Check for Red/Gray Adjacency:** For each red (2) pixel within each red cluster, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right – *not* diagonal).
4.  **Conditional Gray Modification:** If a gray (5) pixel is adjacent to a red (2) pixel, determine if the gray pixel is part of the checkerboard. *A gray pixel is considered part of the checkerboard if it's adjacent to at least one non-red pixel*. If *both* conditions are true (adjacent to red AND part of the checkerboard), change the gray (5) pixel to azure (8).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
