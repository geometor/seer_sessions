Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (20x22).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   The dominant colors are white (0), gray (5), and red (2). There are a few instances of azure (8) in the output.
*   The red (2) pixels in the input seem to be replaced or influence the placement of azure (8) pixels in the output.
* The grey(5) and white(0) seems to be unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 20x22
      elements: pixels
      colors: [white, gray, red, azure]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        gray: 5
        red: 2
        azure: 8

actions:
    - name: replace_color
      input: red (2)
      output: azure (8)
      conditions:
        -  if a red pixel is surrounded by 4 grey, change to azure
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: grid contains many pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** "red" (value 2) pixels.
3. **Check Condition**: If a red pixel is surrounded by exactly four gray (5) colored pixels (up, down, left, right), change its value into "azure" (8). diagonals are not important.
4.  **Preserve** all other pixels (white, gray, etc.) - their values remain unchanged.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

Essentially, the transformation replaces certain red pixels with azure pixels based on their immediate gray neighbors, acting like a very simple conditional coloring rule. All the other color remain at their original location.
