Both grids are 13x13 and contain pixels with values ranging from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The primary colors present are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The core task appears to be a transformation where colored objects within the input grid are potentially moved or replicated in the output grid. There's a spatial correspondence, but it's not a simple one-to-one mapping. It seems some objects influence creation of other objects in different location.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
