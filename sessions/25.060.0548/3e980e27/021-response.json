We can see several distinct colored regions (objects) in the input, and these regions appear to be moving or being replicated in the output. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The most obvious changes involve the yellow (4) and green(3)/blue(1) structures.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There appears to be an element of insertion into the blue/green structure, expanding it.\n"
