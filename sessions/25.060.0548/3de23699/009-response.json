The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), green (3), and red (2). The output grid seems to retain only some of the green (3) pixels from the input, arranged in a different configuration. The red pixels are completely removed. The size of the input and output grids vary.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The new grid's dimensions appear to be derived some how from the positions, count, or a simplified representation of the input green pixels that have been kept. The output grid in this case contains three rows:\n    - Row 0 has two green pixels in columns 1 and 2.\n    - Row 1 repeats row 0, but also adds a green pixel at the end (column 4).\n    - Row 2 has green pixels in columns 0 and 3, and column 1 of row 0 is column 0 of row 2.\n    The pattern is not totally obvious but can be determined.\n\n"
