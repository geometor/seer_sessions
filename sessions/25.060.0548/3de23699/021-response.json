The input grid is larger (12x18) than the output grid (4x8). The input grid contains sparse arrangements of azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels, while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation focusing solely on the azure (8) pixels. The yellow pixels are completely gone in the output. It seems that groups of azure pixels in specific configurations might influence output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

We consider groups of 4 adjacent pixels to check if any are colored blue.\n4. **Transformation:** Transform all locations to contain a value of 8 if it or any of its neighbors have this value.\n5.  **Output Construction:** Extract to create a new, smaller grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation identifies azure pixels in the input grid and, based on their location creates an azure pixel in the ouput. Other color pixels, specifically yellow, are entirely disregarded. The output is a different dimension than the input, and is filled with azure or white.\n"
