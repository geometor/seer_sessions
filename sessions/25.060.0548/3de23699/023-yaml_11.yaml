  - observation: |
      The input grids contain azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels, among other colors.
      The output grids contain only azure (8) and white (0) pixels.

           Azure pixels in the input grid are mapped to azure pixels in the
           output grid based on a specific spatial relationship that accounts for adjacent and isolated pixels.
           Yellow pixels impact where azure pixels are placed.
  - dimensions:
      - rule: The output grid dimensions are derived by dividing the input grid rows by input_rows//2 - 1, and columns by 2 and rounding up (-1 is only applied if result is > 1).

          There is a one to one mapping between the azure input pixels and the
          azure output pixels. Input azure pixels that have a neighbor
          (diagonal or orthogonal of any color) are mapped to output azure
          pixels appearing in even columns. Input azure pixels which are
          isolated, not having any neighbors (orthogonal or diagonal) are
          mapped to output azure pixels appearing in odd columns. Yellow pixels act
          as part of a cluster of neighbor pixels and are used when determining if an
          azure pixel is isolated or not.
