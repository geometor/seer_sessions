There's a distinct cross-like shape of red pixels in the center and four isolated yellow pixels in the corners of a larger implied square.\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only yellow (4) pixels and some white (0). The output seems to be a cropped and color-filtered version of the input, focusing on the yellow pixels. The red pixels are completely absent. The white and yellow arrangement seems to derive from relative position of the original yellow.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
