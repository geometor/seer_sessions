The input grid is larger and contains mostly white (0) pixels, with a few pixels of magenta (6) and azure (8). The output grid is much smaller and seems to contain only magenta (6) pixels, arranged in a specific shape. The azure pixels in the input are completely gone in the output and replaced by white (0) pixels. It appears the transformation extracts a specific shape formed by some of the magenta pixels and re-arranges to the top-left corner of new, smaller, grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

There may be other magenta colored pixels, but only the 2x2 block is of interest.\n2.  **Extract Shape:** Extract the 2x2 magenta block along with its immediate magenta colored neighbors.\n3. **Remove other colored pixels:** Remove all azure colored pixels from the grid.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid, large enough to contain the extracted shape.\n5.  **Place Shape:** Position the extracted shape at the top-left corner of the new grid.\n6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0) pixels.\n\nEssentially, the rule extracts and repositions a connected component of magenta-colored pixels that form a solid 2x2 square, discarding all other parts of the input grid.\n"
