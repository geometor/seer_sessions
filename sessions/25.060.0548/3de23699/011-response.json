            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, incorporating the results from all training examples:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding from the first example.  It correctly identified the need to focus on green pixels (color 3) that act as boundaries, but the logic for arranging these pixels into the output grid was overly simplistic and hardcoded, and did not consider red (2) in boundary detection.  The subsequent test results clearly demonstrate this, with the second example highlighting that boundary green selection and placement requires more sophistication. The third example shows no transformation at all, meaning the python code is returning the empty output array, as no boundary pixels were selected.\n\nThe core issue is generalizing the boundary detection and the output grid construction. The existing code makes assumptions about placement based on very little data and relies on identifying *colored* pixels. Instead, the code should more generally consider the following:\n\n1.  **Robust Boundary Detection:** The current `get_boundary_green_pixels` function only identifies green pixels above or below *non-white, non-green* pixels. This must be generalized. We need to find all green pixels that are *adjacent* to internal boundaries.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Output Grid Construction:**  The output grid size and the placement of green pixels within it are not fixed.  The code currently hardcodes a 3x5 grid and specific positions.  We need to determine the output grid's dimensions and the green pixels' positions *based on the arrangement of the boundary green pixels in the input*.\n\n3.  **Handling Different Numbers of Boundary Pixels**: The existing logic makes very specific assignments based on there being exactly 2 or 4 green pixels. It cannot handle cases with other amounts, as seen in the third training example.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Improved Boundary Detection:** Modify `get_boundary_green_pixels` to correctly identify *all* green pixels adjacent to a non-white, non-green pixel (above, below, left, or right, but not diagonal). *This includes red.*\n2.  **Analyze Boundary Pixel Arrangement:**  After identifying the boundary green pixels, analyze their positions (row, col) in the *input* grid. This analysis will inform the output grid's dimensions and the placement of the green pixels. We are looking for patterns, which could involve counting the number of distinct rows and columns the boundary pixels occupy, as well as identifying the minimum and maximum row and column values.\n3. **Output based on input:** Determine how to define output grid dimensions as a direct consequence of analysis of the boundary pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**\n\nI need to execute code to get precise information about the input and output grids, particularly the positions of the boundary green pixels. Since I can't directly execute code here, I'll describe the *kind* of information I'd gather and how I'd use it, assuming I could execute `get_boundary_green_pixels` and other analysis functions. I will then provide a YAML block based on reasonable deductions and the provided error report.\n\n*For each example:*\n\n1.  **Input Grid Dimensions:** (rows, cols)\n2.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** (rows, cols)\n3.  **Boundary Green Pixels (Input):**  A list of (row, col) tuples representing the locations of all green pixels identified as boundaries.\n4. **Boundary Green Pixels After Red Removal:** Determine if Red Pixels are relevant to boundary\n5.  **Min/Max Row/Col of Boundary Pixels:** The minimum and maximum row and column indices among the boundary green pixels in the input grid. This will help determine the extent of the \"region of interest.\"\n6.  **Number of Distinct Rows/Cols of Boundary Pixels:** The number of unique row values and unique column values among the boundary green pixels. This might correlate with the output grid dimensions.\n7. **Pixels in Output:** List of pixel values in output, with count.\n\n**Example-Specific Information**\n\nSince I cannot run code directly, I will deduce some information by visually inspecting the provided examples and the error report. The error report reveals whether the transformation was correct, and if the generated output array matches the expected output.\n\n*Example 1*\n- Input Grid Dimensions: (9, 11)\n- Output Grid Dimensions: (3, 5)\n- Boundary green Pixels After Red Removal:\n [(0, 4)], [(0, 6)], [(4, 4)], [(4, 6)]\n- Expected output array: [[0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]]\n- Actual output array: [[0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]]\n- Result: Pass\n\n*Example 2*\n\n- Input Grid Dimensions: (10, 8)\n- Output Grid Dimensions: (4, 3)\n- Boundary green Pixels After Red Removal:\n  [(1, 3)], [(1, 4)], [(6, 3)], [(6, 4)]\n- Expected output array: [[0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3]]\n- Actual output array: [[0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]]\n- Result: Fail\n\n*Example 3*\n\n- Input Grid Dimensions: (7, 9)\n- Output Grid Dimensions: (0, 0)\n- Boundary green Pixels After Red Removal: []\n- Expected output array: []\n- Actual output array: [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.], [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.], [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n- Result: Fail\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 77ae1072\nfacts:\n  - example_1:\n      input_grid_dims: [9, 11]\n      output_grid_dims: [3, 5]\n      boundary_pixels: [[0, 4], [0, 6], [4, 4], [4, 6]]  # Deduced visually + from error report\n      output_pixels:\n        3: 5  # five green pixels in output\n        0: 10 # ten empty pixels\n      transformation: \"Green pixels adjacent to non-white, non-green pixels define a region.

The difference between the max and min row + 1 will give you the height.\n    *   Find the minimum and maximum col indices of all boundary green pixels, The difference between the max and min col + 1 will give you the width.\n3.  **Create and Populate Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the calculated dimensions, initialized with all zeros (white).\n4.  **Map Boundary Pixels to Output:** Iterate through the boundary green pixels found in step 1. For each boundary green pixel at `(row, col)` in the *input* grid, set the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to green (3). The corresponding cell will be found by mapping each `(row, col)` from boundary pixel, to output by subtracting `min_row` from `row`, and subtracting `min_col` from `col`.\n5.  **Handle Empty Output:** If no boundary green pixels are found, return an empty grid (or a grid of size 0x0, as appropriate).\n\nThis natural language program is significantly more detailed and robust than the initial attempt. It addresses the shortcomings revealed by the test results and provides a clear path towards a correct solution.\n"
