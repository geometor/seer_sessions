Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to extract a 2x2 magenta block and place it in the top-left corner of a 4x4 output grid. It also included neighboring magenta cells. The code generally worked for the first example, but encountered issues with others. The primary problem is that it's too specific to a 2x2 block. The other examples show different configurations of magenta pixels, such as other sizes, shapes, adjacent, and nearby. The removal of azure pixels was not a consistent rule across examples.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Identify the common elements:** The common factor across all examples is the presence of magenta (6) pixels and their transformation. The 2x2 assumption is wrong and needs to be generalized to handle any configuration.
2.  **Generalize magenta extraction:** Instead of looking for a 2x2 block, we must detect *all* connected magenta pixels and copy this shape.
3.  **Re-evaluate the azure removal:** Azure removal appears to be specific to the first training example and should not be applied universally, as it's not present in other examples.
4.  **Bounding Box** Identify the bounding box of the contiguous magena pixels.
5.  **Top-Left Alignment:** Maintain the top-left alignment of the extracted magenta shape within the output grid.
6. **Output Size:** Make sure output grid size is big enough to contain all contiguous magenta pixels.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To gather precise metrics, I will describe the input and output grids, focusing on the magenta pixels.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A 2x2 magenta block with adjacent azure pixels.
    *   Output: The 2x2 magenta block in the top-left corner, expanded to include any contiguous neighbors.
    *   Result: Success, with the additional neighboring magenta.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: A 3x1 vertical magenta block and an additional magenta 1 cell away on the row below.
    *   Output: The 3x1 magenta block and the additional magenta in the top-left corner of the 4x4 output grid.
    *   Result: Failure. The code is looking for a 2x2 block, so it does not transform this input correctly.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Four magenta pixels, arranged horizontally, but not perfectly adjacent.
    *   Output: Appears to copy the contiguous magenta cells to the output grid.
    *   Result: Failure, the code does not find and transform any pixels.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: 0d87d731
  - objects:
      - color: 6  # Magenta
        shape: variable  # Can be any contiguous shape
        transformation:
          - action: copy
            details: Copy the contiguous magenta pixels.
          - action: translate
            details: Move to the top-left corner of the output grid.
  - output_grid:
      size: dynamic #determined by the bounding box of the input
      default_color: 0  # white
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Magenta Pixels:** Find all magenta (color 6) pixels in the input grid that are part of a contiguous shape.
2. **Determine Bounding Box.** Compute a bounding box that contains all contiguous magenta pixels.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid of white (0) pixels that is large enough to contain the bounding box.
4.  **Copy and Translate:** Copy the contiguous shape formed by the magenta pixels from the input grid to the output grid. Position the shape such that its top-left corner aligns with the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
