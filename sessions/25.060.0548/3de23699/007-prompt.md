Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Corner Markers:** Locate the four yellow pixels (color 4) in the input grid. These pixels act as corner markers, defining the vertices of a conceptual rectangle.

2.  **Define Conceptual Rectangle:** Determine the full extent of the rectangle implied by the four yellow corner markers.  This rectangle's sides will be parallel to the grid axes. The rectangle extends to the furthest row and column occupied by ANY of the yellow pixels, effectively forming the rectangle defined *by* those corners, not just *containing* them.

3. **Extract Subgrid**: Obtain the data inside the rectangle described in Step 2.

4.  **Replace Colors:** Within the extracted subgrid, change all pixels that are *not* yellow (color 4) to white (color 0).  Keep the yellow pixels unchanged.

5.  **Output:** The resulting subgrid, with color replacements, is the output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
