Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Corner Markers:** Locate the four yellow pixels (color 4) in the input grid. These pixels act as corner markers, defining the vertices of a conceptual rectangle.

2.  **Define Conceptual Rectangle:** Determine the full extent of the rectangle implied by the four yellow corner markers.  This rectangle's sides will be parallel to the grid axes. The rectangle extends to the furthest row and column occupied by ANY of the yellow pixels, effectively forming the rectangle defined *by* those corners, not just *containing* them.

3. **Extract Subgrid**: Obtain the data inside the rectangle described in Step 2.

4.  **Replace Colors:** Within the extracted subgrid, change all pixels that are *not* yellow (color 4) to white (color 0).  Keep the yellow pixels unchanged.

5.  **Output:** The resulting subgrid, with color replacements, is the output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and proposed updates to the natural language program and facts, incorporating the additional training examples.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: a rectangle defined by yellow corner pixels. However, the initial program missed a key transformation: *all* non-yellow pixels inside the rectangle should become white. The provided code only preserves the yellow pixels and sets the background to a default of 0, but it doesn't explicitly replace the *other* colors within the rectangle. The additional training examples highlight this, as they contain colors other than yellow within the rectangle, which are all transformed to white in the correct outputs. The core logic of finding the bounding box is sound, but the color replacement logic needs adjusting.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

The primary error is incomplete color replacement. The code correctly crops the rectangle but only preserves the yellow pixels, defaulting other cells to zero.  The corrected strategy is:

1.  **Find Bounding Box:**  As before, locate the yellow pixels and define the bounding rectangle.
2.  **Crop:** Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box.
3.  **Replace All Within:**  *Within the cropped subgrid*, replace *all* non-yellow pixels with white (0).

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution for Verification):**

I will execute the existing code on each input and analyze the results to create detailed reports.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
