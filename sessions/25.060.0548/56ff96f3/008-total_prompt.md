Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the core concept of extending colored rectangles based on non-white pixel positions. However, the provided examples and the errors (especially in examples 2 and 3) reveal a crucial misunderstanding: the rectangles extend from the *left edge* of the grid (column 0) *up to, and including, the column* of the triggering non-white pixel, not stopping before it as original interpreted. The original code had a minor issue related to starting the fill at column 1, now fixed to correctly use column 0.

The height of the rectangles is consistently 3, centered on the row of the original pixel, this part was correctly implemented.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** I will examine the input and output grids, and the result of applying the current `transform` function. I will look for specific patterns in how the transformation fails or succeeds, focusing on where the rectangles are drawn, their colors, and heights relative to the input pixels.
2.  **YAML Facts:**  I'll create a structured YAML representation summarizing the observations about the objects (pixels, rectangles), their properties (color, position), and the actions (extending rectangles).
3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will update the natural language program to reflect the "extend to the left edge" behavior and the consistent height of 3. The key change is clarifying the *starting point* of the rectangle extension.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations**
```python
def code_execution(input_grid, expected_output, result_grid, example_id):
    """
    Analyzes an example and the result, printing relevant metrics.
    """
    print(f"--- Example {example_id} ---")

    # Find non-white pixels in the input
    input_pixels = get_non_white_pixels(input_grid)
    print(f"Input Non-White Pixels: {input_pixels}")

    # Compare expected output and result
    diff = expected_output != result_grid
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    num_diffs = np.sum(diff)

    print(f"Number of Differences: {num_diffs}")
    if num_diffs > 0:
        print(f"Difference Indices (row, col): {list(zip(diff_indices[0], diff_indices[1]))}")

# Loop through examples and apply code_execution
for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(train_pairs):
    result_grid = transform(np.array(input_grid))  # Ensure input is a NumPy array
    code_execution(np.array(input_grid), np.array(expected_output), result_grid, i + 1)
    print("\n")
```

**Code Execution Results (Condensed)**

```

Input Non-White Pixels: [((3, 3), 1), ((3, 7), 2)]
Number of Differences: 0

```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
    input_objects:
      - {type: pixel, color: blue, position: (3, 3)}
      - {type: pixel, color: red, position: (3, 7)}
    output_objects:
      - {type: rectangle, color: blue, start: (2,0), end: (4,3), height: 3}
      - {type: rectangle, color: red, start: (2,0), end: (4, 7), height: 3}
    transformation:  Extend colored rectangles from the left edge to the triggering pixel's column.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - { type: pixel, color: red, position: (2, 8) }
        - { type: pixel, color: blue, position: (5, 5) }
        - { type: pixel, color: red, position: (6, 8) }
      output_objects:
        - { type: rectangle, color: red, start: (1, 0), end: (3, 8), height: 3}
        - { type: rectangle, color: blue, start: (4, 0), end: (6, 5), height: 3}
        - { type: rectangle, color: red, start: (5, 0), end: (7, 8), height: 3}
      transformation: Extend colored rectangles from the left edge to the triggering pixel's column.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - { type: pixel, color: red, position: (2, 7)}
        - { type: pixel, color: red, position: (3, 3)}
        - { type: pixel, color: blue, position: (3, 7)}
        - { type: pixel, color: red, position: (6, 3)}
        - { type: pixel, color: red, position: (6, 5)}
      output_objects:
        - {type: rectangle, color: red, start: (1, 0), end: (3, 7), height: 3}
        - {type: rectangle, color: red, start: (2, 0), end: (4, 3), height: 3}
        - {type: rectangle, color: blue, start: (2, 0), end: (4, 7), height: 3}
        - {type: rectangle, color: red, start: (5, 0), end: (7, 3), height: 3}
        - {type: rectangle, color: red, start: (5, 0), end: (7, 5), height: 3}
      transformation: Extend colored rectangles from the left edge to the triggering pixel's column.

general_rule: "For each non-white pixel in the input, create a rectangle of the same color with height 3, centered on the input pixel's row, extending from column 0 to the input pixel's column."
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each identified non-white pixel:
    *   Create a rectangle of the *same color* as the identified pixel.
    *   The rectangle's *height* is always 3.
    *   The rectangle is *centered* on the row of the identified pixel.
    *   The rectangle *starts at column 0* of the grid.
    *   The rectangle *ends at the column* of the identified pixel (inclusive).
3.  Any cells not covered by a colored rectangle are filled with white (0).
4.  Return the resulting grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
