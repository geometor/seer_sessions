          - color: orange
            shape: horizontal line
            pixels: [(3,3), (3,4)]
      output:
        objects:
          - color: orange

              relation_to_input: Expands the input line upwards by two rows.
      correct: False

overall_rule: |
    The output grid expands the orange object in the input grid
    into a rectangle.
    If you draw a line above the orange object two rows up,
    the filled area will extend to fill that area.
