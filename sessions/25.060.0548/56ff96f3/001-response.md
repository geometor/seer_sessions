Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-colored objects (represented by integers 0-9, each corresponding to a color). The transformation seems to involve expanding or flood-filling existing non-zero colored pixels horizontally and/or vertically, creating rectangular blocks of the same color. The extent and direction of expansion vary. The background is always 0 (white).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0-9] # Integer representing color
      position: [row, column] # 2D coordinates

  - type: block
    properties:
      color: [0-9]
      top_left: [row, column]
      bottom_right: [row, column]
      shape: rectangle

actions:
  - name: expand
    parameters:
      object: pixel
      direction: [horizontal, vertical, both] #Possibly both
      extent: [integer] # Number of pixels to expand

relationships:
  - type: contains
    subject: grid
    object: pixel

  - type: becomes
    subject: pixel
    object: block
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color value.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Primary):** For each non-zero pixel, extend it horizontally to form a contiguous block of the same color. Determine the maximum extent of the horizontal block. The examples have conflicting details about expansion:
    *   Example 1 indicates that colored pixels form separate horizontal regions.
    *   Example 2 shows regions merging (green and orange).
    *   Example 3 shows yellow expands in both directions, to the largest extent.

3. **Vertical Expansion (Secondary, conditional):** Examine the vertical boundaries created by horizontal expansion. Within those vertical boundaries, expand each color vertically:
     *   Example 1 expands the blue and red to fill the space between the regions
     *   Example 2 expands orange and green by 1 row, preserving the offset
     *   Example 3 expands yellow to the top, but the top edge of the object
     *   Example 4 expands orange to make the top edge of the block align

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the expanded blocks. All other pixels remain 0 (white).

The primary rule is horizontal expansion. The vertical is conditional, possibly based on the presence of other object or the top/bottom boundaries.
