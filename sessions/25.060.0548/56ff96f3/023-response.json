The primary colors observed are white (0) and orange (7). The input grid contains isolated orange pixels, while the output grid shows a filled rectangular area of orange pixels. The transformation seems to involve identifying the locations of the orange pixels and filling the area between, encompassing any gaps to form a solid rectangle, or perhaps finding the orange pixel bounds and creating a new shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
