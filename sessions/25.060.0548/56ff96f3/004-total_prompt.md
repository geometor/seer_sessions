Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, based on the first training example, implements horizontal and vertical expansion of non-zero pixels. The horizontal expansion seems to work correctly by extending each colored block to the grid edges or until it encounters another non-zero pixel. The vertical expansion is more complex and its logic, as implemented, does not accurately capture the transformation rule across all examples. The errors in Examples 2, and 3 highlight deficiencies in the vertical expansion logic.

The general strategy to resolve these errors will involve these steps:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output for each example, focusing on where the vertical expansion deviates from the expectation.
2.  **Refine Vertical Expansion Rule:** Based on the error analysis, formulate a more precise and comprehensive rule for vertical expansion. This will likely involve considering the interaction between different colored blocks and potentially the initial positions of pixels.
3.  **Hypothesis and NL program update**: Propose changes to the NL program.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test, observe, and refine.

**Example Metrics and Observations**

To make the analysis concrete, let's gather some information about each example, including checking if output_grid == expected_grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all non-zero pixels (colored pixels) in the input grid. Each contiguous block of the same color is considered an object.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Primary):** Each object expands horizontally to the maximum extent possible within the grid. This expansion stops if it encounters a non-zero pixel of a *different* color or the edge of the grid.
3.  **Vertical Expansion (Secondary):** After horizontal expansion, each object expands vertically. The expansion occurs across the *entire height* of the grid. The vertical expansion maintains the horizontal width achieved in step 2. Vertical expansion happens for *all* colored objects.

The key update here is to the vertical expansion. The previous version had a complex and incorrect rule. Vertical expansion is simplified: once horizontally expanded, every object fills the entire vertical extent of the grid, using the object's new horizontal width.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
