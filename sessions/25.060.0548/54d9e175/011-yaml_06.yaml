task: 88a10457
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of various colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - observation: |
      Pixels with values 0 and 5 in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Other pixel values (non-0, non-5) in the input grid are replaced in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      The replacement forms a 3x3 block of the same color centered on the position of the original pixel that triggered the replacement.
  - observation: |
      The replacement colors are consistently applied based on the order in which the original values (non-0 and non-5) appear when scanning the input grid from left to right, top to bottom.
  - observation: |
    The identified replacement color mapping is as follows, based on order of appearance:
      - 1st unique value (non 0 or 5): 7 (orange)
      - 2nd unique value (non 0 or 5): 8 (azure)
      - 3rd unique value (non 0 or 5): 6 (magenta)

  - action: |
      Iterate through the input grid, identifying unique values other than 0 and 5.
  - action: |
      For each unique value, map it to a replacement color according to its order of appearance.
  - action: |
      Replace the identified pixel and its immediate 8 neighbors (forming a 3x3 square) with the corresponding replacement color.
  - action: |
      Pixels with values of 0 and 5 are kept.
