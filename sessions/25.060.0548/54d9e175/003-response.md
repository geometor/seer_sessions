Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5). The output grid contains pixels of colors magenta (6), gray (5), and orange (7). There's a clear correspondence between specific colors in the input and output, and the spatial arrangement seems crucial. The size of the input (3x11) is the same as the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x11
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: blue (1)
      - color: red (2)
      - color: gray (5)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x11
    elements:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - color: gray (5)
      - color: orange (7)

  - name: gray_columns
    type: object_group
    property: vertical columns containing only gray(5) and white(0) pixels
    input_location: columns 4 and 8

  - name: blue_pixels
      type: object_group
      property: blue (1)
      input_location: row 2, columns 2 and 10

  - name: red_pixels
      type: object_group
      property: red(2)
      input_location: row 2, columns 6

actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    details: Change specific colors based on their original color and position relative to other colors.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details: Gray columns in the input remain gray in the output.
  - type: color_mapping
    details: |
      White (0) becomes Magenta (6) unless adjacent to gray(5)
      Blue (1) becomes Orange (7)
      Red (2) becomes Orange (7)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Locate the columns in the input grid that contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels. These are considered "anchor" columns.

2.  **Preserve Anchor Columns:** Copy the gray (5) pixels from the anchor columns in the input grid directly to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

3. **Color Substitution of colored pixels:** All the colored pixels (blue and red) are transformed to orange(7)

4.  **Color Substitution of white pixels near gray columns:** White pixels, horizontally adjacent to gray columns (left or right), become orange (7)

5.  **Color Substitution of remaining white pixels:** All other white pixels (0) in the input, which aren't horizontally adjacent to gray(5), are transformed to magenta (6) in the output grid.
