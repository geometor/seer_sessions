2.  **Left Region:** The region to the left of the *first* grey separator is the "left region". Replace all colors other than 5 (grey) in this region with 8 (azure).
3.  **Middle Region:** The region between the *first* and *last* grey separators is the "middle region". Replace all colors other than 5 within this region with 6 (magenta).
4.  **Right Region:** The region to the right of the *last* grey separator is the "right region". Replace all colors other than 5 within this region with 9 (maroon).
5. **Preserve Separator** The grey separators (5) remain unchanged.
6. **Single Separator:** If there is only a single grey separator, then the "middle region" does not exist.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of separating the grid based on grey (5) pixels and applying different colors to the regions. However, the results reveal a crucial flaw in the handling of multiple separators within the *same column*. The original logic assumed separators would neatly divide the grid into distinct *columns*, but the examples show that multiple separators can exist *vertically* within a column, creating sub-regions *within* columns. This means we need to adjust our approach to consider separators on a per-row basis rather than a purely column-wise division.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Row-wise Processing:** Instead of finding *all* separator indices at once, we'll iterate through each row of the grid individually.
2.  **Per-Row Separators:** For each row, we'll identify the first and last separator indices.
3.  **Region Coloring:** Within each row, we'll apply the color transformations based on these per-row separator positions.
4.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Correctly manage rows with zero or one separator.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate Row-wise:** Process each row of the input grid independently.
2.  **Identify Separators (Per Row):** Within each row, find the column indices of all grey (5) pixels. These are the row's separators.
3.  **Handle No Separators:** If a row has no separators, replace all non-grey pixels in that row with azure (8).
4.  **Handle One Separator:** If a row has exactly one separator, replace all non-grey pixels to the left of the separator with azure (8) and all non-grey pixels to the right with maroon (9).
5.  **Handle Multiple Separators:** If a row has two or more separators:
    *   Replace all non-grey pixels to the left of the *first* separator in that row with azure (8).
    *   Replace all non-grey pixels between the *first* and *last* separator in that row with magenta (6).
    *   Replace all non-grey pixels to the right of the *last* separator in that row with maroon (9).
6.  **Preserve Separators:** Ensure that all grey (5) pixels remain unchanged in the output grid, regardless of their position.

This revised program explicitly addresses the row-wise nature of the transformation and correctly handles cases with varying numbers of separators within each row. It's more precise and covers all observed scenarios in the training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
