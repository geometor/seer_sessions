Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Key Columns:** Locate the columns in the input grid that contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels. These are considered "anchor" columns.
2. **Preserve Anchor Columns:** Copy the gray (5) pixels from the anchor columns in the input grid directly to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
3. **Color Substitution of colored pixels:** All the colored pixels (blue and red) are transformed to orange(7)
4. **Color Substitution of white pixels near gray columns:** White pixels, horizontally adjacent to gray columns (left or right), become orange (7)
5. **Color Substitution of remaining white pixels:** All other white pixels (0) in the input, which aren't horizontally adjacent to gray(5), are transformed to magenta (6) in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
