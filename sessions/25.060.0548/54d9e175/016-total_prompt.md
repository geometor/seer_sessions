Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The output grid seems to be a simplified, "blocked" version of the input, with some input colors seemingly mapped to specific output colors, and areas of 0 in the input getting replaced with other numbers. The critical detail is the transformation of colors and filling of empty regions while maintaining original solid colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11).
  - object: Input Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x11
      - data_type: integer (0-9)
  - object: Output Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x11
      - data_type: integer (0-9)
  - mapping: |
      Input color 0 (white) is replaced based on its neighboring colors, which are solid blocks and then replaced by distinct solid single color areas.
  - mapping: input color 3(green) is replaced by 8(azure)
  - mapping: input color 1(blue) is replaced by 6(magenta)
  - mapping: input color 4(yellow) is replaced by 9(maroon)
  - mapping: input color 5(grey) is replaced by 5(grey)

  - action: replacement
    description: |
        Specific colors in the input grid are consistently replaced with other specific colors in the output grid. The blank space is filled.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into three distinct regions based on the non-zero colored pixels. The first region, on the left, is defined by color values other than grey. The second (middle) region is defined by a block of grey. The third (rightmost) region is also defined by non-grey color values.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Replace all pixels in the area left of the first solid 5 with 8.
    *   Replace pixels of color 3 (green) within the left region with 8 (azure).
    *   Leave 5 (grey) unchanged.
    *   Replace all pixels between the first and second solid 5 with 6.
    *  Replace pixels of color 1 (blue) between solid 5 blocks with 6 (magenta).
    *   Replace all pixels in the area right of the second solid 5 with 9.
    * Replace pixels of color 4 (yellow) within the right region with 9 (maroon).

In essence, the transformation recolors areas based on the non-zero values, and particularly the location of grey 5.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
