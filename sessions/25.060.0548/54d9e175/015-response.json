The output grid seems to be a simplified, \"blocked\" version of the input, with some input colors seemingly mapped to specific output colors, and areas of 0 in the input getting replaced with other numbers. The critical detail is the transformation of colors and filling of empty regions while maintaining original solid colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The first region, on the left, is defined by color values other than grey. The second (middle) region is defined by a block of grey. The third (rightmost) region is also defined by non-grey color values.\n2.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Replace all pixels in the area left of the first solid 5 with 8.\n    *   Replace pixels of color 3 (green) within the left region with 8 (azure).\n    *   Leave 5 (grey) unchanged.\n    *   Replace all pixels between the first and second solid 5 with 6.\n    *  Replace pixels of color 1 (blue) between solid 5 blocks with 6 (magenta).\n    *   Replace all pixels in the area right of the second solid 5 with 9.\n    * Replace pixels of color 4 (yellow) within the right region with 9 (maroon).\n\nIn essence, the transformation recolors areas based on the non-zero values, and particularly the location of grey 5.\n\n"
