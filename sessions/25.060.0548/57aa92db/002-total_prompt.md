<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=4384x2256 at 0x7B4C05B57C50>Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary elements seem to be contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, which can be considered "objects". These objects have properties like color, size, and position. The transformation appears to involve modifying these objects, potentially by extending or combining them based on certain rules. It seems that there's some 'background extension' involved.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value representing the color (0-9).
      - size: Number of pixels in the block.
      - position: Location of the block in the grid (coordinates).
      - shape: The arrangement of pixels within the block.
actions:
  - name: Extend
    description: Increase the size of an object by adding pixels of the same color, usually performed on the background color around the object.
  - name: combine
    description: this happens if the object is extended and it incorporates another object of a different color
relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: Objects can be adjacent to each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  - type: Containment
    description: One object might fully enclose another (though not apparent in these particular examples so far, could happen if the 'extend' goes to completion).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color within the input grid. Consider these as distinct objects.
2.  **Background Identification:** identify if an object is of the same color of the 'background'. We determine the background color by looking for edges of objects, and if the cells on the edge are the same color we consider them as a candidate.
3.  **Iterate through Objects:** For each object identified.
4.  **Extend Background**: Check if an object is adjacent, either above, below, to the right or the left, to an object of the background color.
5. **Combine Objects**: If the background object fills a region and meets a non-background colored object during the extension, incorporate the non-background object into the now extended region.
6.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid with the combined objects.

In simple terms, the output grid expands the areas of background color adjacent to existing colored objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
