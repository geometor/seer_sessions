The input grid contains a few distinct colored regions (green, blue, and yellow). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, where:\n\n1.  The green and, initially, single blue pixel regions in the top left remain unchanged.\n2.  The yellow region expands and there is a new set of blue pixels filling the same positions with the same shape as the original set of blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
