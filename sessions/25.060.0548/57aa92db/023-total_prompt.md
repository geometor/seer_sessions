Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed as follows:
1.  **Green Object Expansion:** The single green pixel expands. One pixel to the left, and one diagonally up and to the left.
2.  **Azure Object Stays:** The isolated azure object and isolated azure object in rectangle formation stays in the same place.
3.  **Yellow Object Expansion/Merge:** The 2x2 yellow square expands downwards by two rows. It overlaps and effectively replaces/merges with the 2x2 red square that was originally positioned directly below it.
4. Other red object also stays constant.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
