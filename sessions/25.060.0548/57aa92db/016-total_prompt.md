Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored shapes within a grid. The primary colors involved are blue (1), yellow (4), and azure (8). The background is white (0). The transformation seems to involve repositioning and expanding existing shapes, and potentially combining shapes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: blue_shape_1
    color: blue
    type: rectangle
    initial_position: (2,2) # Top-left corner
    initial_dimensions: (3x3) # width x height
    notes: "Contains a yellow pixel at (3,3)"

  - id: azure_shape_1
    color: azure
    type: rectangle
    initial_position: (7,9)
    initial_dimensions: (3x3)

  - id: yellow_shape_1
     color: yellow
     type: rectangle
     initial_position: (10, 9)
     initial_dimension: (3x3)

actions:
  - type: combine
    target: azure_shape_1
    with: yellow_shape_1
    notes: "Azure and yellow shapes are combined."

  - type: expand
    target: combined_shape # name of a hypothetical object
    notes: "combined shape is enxpanded."

  - type: maintain
    target: blue_shape_1
    notes: "the blue shape, and the yellow pixel inside it, stay at the top"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the blue rectangle, containing one yellow pixel at its center, at the top of the grid. Identify an isolated square shape of azure and another of yellow towards the bottom.

2.  **Preserve:** Do not change the blue shape or the yellow cell inside.

3. **Combine**: Combine the two shapes at the bottom (azure and yellow).

4.  **Expand**: Expand the combined shape (azure/yellow) by adding one azure outline around the combined shape, to the right, to the left and below. Above, extend the azure background to the top row of the grid.

5.  The result is the output, consisting of two shapes: the original top shape is unchanged, and the new combined shape is expanded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
