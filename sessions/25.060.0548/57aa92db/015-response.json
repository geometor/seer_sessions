The transformation seems to involve repositioning and expanding existing shapes, and potentially combining shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify an isolated square shape of azure and another of yellow towards the bottom.\n\n2.  **Preserve:** Do not change the blue shape or the yellow cell inside.\n\n3. **Combine**: Combine the two shapes at the bottom (azure and yellow).\n\n4.  **Expand**: Expand the combined shape (azure/yellow) by adding one azure outline around the combined shape, to the right, to the left and below. Above, extend the azure background to the top row of the grid.\n\n5.  The result is the output, consisting of two shapes: the original top shape is unchanged, and the new combined shape is expanded.\n"
