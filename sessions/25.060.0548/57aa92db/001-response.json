The primary elements seem to be contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, which can be considered \"objects\". These objects have properties like color, size, and position. The transformation appears to involve modifying these objects, potentially by extending or combining them based on certain rules. It seems that there's some 'background extension' involved.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

Consider these as distinct objects.\n2.  **Background Identification:** identify if an object is of the same color of the 'background'. We determine the background color by looking for edges of objects, and if the cells on the edge are the same color we consider them as a candidate.\n3.  **Iterate through Objects:** For each object identified.\n4.  **Extend Background**: Check if an object is adjacent, either above, below, to the right or the left, to an object of the background color.\n5. **Combine Objects**: If the background object fills a region and meets a non-background colored object during the extension, incorporate the non-background object into the now extended region.\n6.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid with the combined objects.\n\nIn simple terms, the output grid expands the areas of background color adjacent to existing colored objects.\n"
