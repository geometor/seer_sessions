      blue: []
    transform_notes: >
      Blue pixels are removed.  The yellow region expands upwards.  The yellow
      object that starts as two disconnected components, becomes two
      horizontally connected components.  The single row of yellow becomes three
      rows.
    discrepancy: >
       Yellow expansion is incorrect. The single row of yellow expanded by only
       one row, it needs to expand by two.  The disconnected components did not
       fully connect.
  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      yellow: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
    expected_output_objects:
      yellow:  [[(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]]
    transform_notes: >
      The yellow region, which is a single horizontal line, expands upwards by
      two rows.
    discrepancy: >
      The yellow region should expand to fill rows 0, 1, and 2.  The
      current transformation only expanded one row above and one row below.

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      yellow: [(1, 4)]
    expected_output_objects:
      yellow: [(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4)]
    transform_notes: >
       The yellow region, a single pixel, extends vertically to create a
       three-pixel line.
    discrepancy: >
      The transformation added a row above and below, which is correct.
