Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed as follows:
1.  **Green Object Expansion:** The single green pixel expands. One pixel to the left, and one diagonally up and to the left.
2.  **Azure Object Stays:** The isolated azure object and isolated azure object in rectangle formation stays in the same place.
3.  **Yellow Object Expansion/Merge:** The 2x2 yellow square expands downwards by two rows. It overlaps and effectively replaces/merges with the 2x2 red square that was originally positioned directly below it.
4. Other red object also stays constant.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, focusing on refining the natural language program and addressing the discrepancies observed in the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code were a good first attempt, capturing some of the key transformations. However, the testing revealed inconsistencies, especially with how the code dealt with "objects" and overlaps. The core issue seems to be a too-rigid definition of "object" and how expansion should occur, and some missing actions. We need to:

1.  **Refine Object Definition:** The `find_object` function currently uses a simple flood-fill algorithm, which is fine, but the conceptual understanding of "object" needs to be more flexible in the natural language program. We need to be able to consider non-contiguous arrangements as part of the description.
2.  **Handle Overlaps Correctly:** The current code's "merge" concept for yellow and red is not generalized. We need to explicitly describe what should happen.
3. **Revisit expansion rules.** The expansion logic is not universal across training examples.
4.  **Consider all examples**: the provided code was based only a single example, and as a result does not perform well on the remaining examples.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

To get precise information, I'll execute the code with *all* training examples and compare the outputs. Since the code has a `transform` function, I'll use that.

```python
import numpy as np

# Provided COLOR_MAP and find_object, transform functions go here (as in the problem description)
COLOR_MAP = {
    0: (238, 238, 238),  # white
    1: (30, 147, 255),  # blue
    2: (220, 50, 40),  # red
    3: (79, 204, 48),  # green
    4: (230, 200, 0),  # yellow
    5: (85, 85, 85),  # gray
    6: (229, 58, 163),  # magenta
    7: (230, 120, 20),  # orange

The current code gets examples 1 and 2 correct, but fails on example 3. The green expansion isn't happening, and the yellow expansion is incorrect.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
