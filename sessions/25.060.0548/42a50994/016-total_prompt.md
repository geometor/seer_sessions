Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both grids of numbers (representing colors).
*   **Colors:** Primarily two colors are involved: 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
*   **Shapes:** Irregular shapes formed by groups of gray (5) pixels.
*   **Change:** Some gray pixels are removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: 11
      - columns: 19
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - white (0)
          - gray (5)
  - type: shape
    properties:
     - color: gray
     - composition: contiguous gray pixels

actions:
  - type: remove
    target: pixel
    condition: "gray pixel at specific locations"

relationships:
    - gray pixels form shapes
    - shapes are embedded in the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all gray (5) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Filter:** Iterate the gray pixels.
    *   If a gray pixel has a gray pixel to its immediate right, delete/remove/change that gray pixel to white.
    *   Maintain every other gray pixel.

In essence, the program deletes, filters, or removes the right-most gray pixels of every horizontal group/contiguous block of 2 or more gray pixels. It looks like a horizontal filter or right edge deletion within the shapes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
