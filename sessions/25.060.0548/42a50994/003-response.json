The primary color observed is '8' (azure) against a background of '0' (white). The transformation appears to selectively remove some of the azure pixels. The overall shape and structure of the azure regions is roughly preserved, but some \"island\" pixels and some pixels on the edge are erased. There appears to be a constraint against removing pixels in a way that splits a connected block, and it does not erase a single connected azure region completely.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
