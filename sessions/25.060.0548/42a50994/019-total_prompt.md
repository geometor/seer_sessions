Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Find all connected regions of gray (5) pixels.  A region is defined as one or more gray pixels that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally).
2.  **Process Each Region:** For each identified gray region:
    *   Iterate through each pixel of the gray region.
    *   If a pixel is gray and not on the *western-most edge* of the grid/region, change its color to white (0). The western-most gray pixel of each region is the pixel with the lowest column index within the connected region.
    *   If a pixel is gray and it is the western-most edge of the grid/region, it remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
