facts:
  - observation: "All input grids have a consistent pattern of color blocks, mostly homogenous rows."
  - observation: "Row replication is consistently applied, doubling the number of rows."
  - observation: "Row swapping does *not* occur in every transformed example"
  - observation: "In examples 1 & 4, Row swapping occurs. The second row of the original is swapped with the replicated first row"
  - observation: "In Example 3, the fourth row is replicated and added after all others."
  - observation: "in Example 2, there is no row swapping."
  - rule: "The last row of the input grid is the critical factor. Specifically the position of the 0 valued pixels determines which replication/swapping operations take place"
