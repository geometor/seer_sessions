The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The transformation seems to involve a change in the grid's dimensions and a rearrangement of the pixels, maintaining some relative positioning. It's important to note that there are repeating patterns and symmetry. The main action involves a change in size (adding rows) and reordering the existing rows, with the new rows being copies of the original rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Reordering sequence is:\n    *   The last row of the input becomes the first row of the output.\n    *   The second to last row of the input becomes the second row.\n    *   The first row is the third row of the input.\n    *   Repeat rows in reverse order to create the final output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the input, reorders the rows in reverse order, and then the output contains two copies of the reordered set of rows.\n"
