Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integer values, which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are blue (1) and yellow (4). The grids have different dimensions; the input grid is 3x4, and the output grid is 6x4. The output appears to be a modified, enlarged version of the input, not just simply scaled up.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x4
    elements: [1, 4]
    description: The original grid.
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x4
    elements: [1, 4]
    description: The transformed grid.

properties:
  - name: color
    values: {1: blue, 4: yellow}
  - name: dimensions
    type: tuple (rows, columns)

actions:
  - name: pattern_duplication
    description: Duplicates a detected pattern and applies to grid
    input_objects: [input_grid]
    output_objects: [output_grid]

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid via a pattern.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core Pattern:** Observe the input grid.
    -Notice the arrangement of yellow (4) and blue (1) pixels.

2.  **Vertical and Horizontal Mirroring:**
    The transformation can be viewed as mirroring/copying: The first row is copied and some elements flipped.
    Specifically:
    - copy row 1 to row 6
    - copy row 2 to row 5
    - copy row 3 to row 4 and flip elements

3. **Overall Transformation Rule:** The output grid is created from the input grid such that rows are mirrored and, for every two rows the elements are swapped.
