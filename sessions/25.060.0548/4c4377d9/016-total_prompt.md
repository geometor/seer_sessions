**input:**
```
9 4 9 4
9 9 4 4
4 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7B4C05B557D0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 4
9 9 4 4
9 4 9 4
9 4 9 4
9 9 4 4
4 4 4 4
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x4 grid (matrix) of single-digit integers (colors).
*   **Output:** A 6x4 grid, which appears to be an expanded version of the input.
*    The bottom row of the input grid, is replicated as the bottom row of the output grid.
*   The input grid appears twice in the output grid, once at the bottom, and once, flipped upside down, starting at row index 0.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 4
      values: [9, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 6
      columns: 4
      values: [9, 4]

actions:
  - name: duplicate_and_flip
    input: input_grid
    description: The input_grid is duplicated. One copy is placed at the bottom of a new grid. the other copy is flipped upside down.
    output: output_grid

relationships:
    - type: 'size relationship'
      from: input_grid
      to:   output_grid
      details: the number of rows in the output_grid is double that of the input_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create** an empty output grid with the same number of columns as the input grid, but double the number of rows.
2. **Copy** the input grid, and flip upside down.
3.  **Place** this flipped copy at the top of the output grid.
4. **Copy** original input grid.
5.  **Place** original input grid at the bottom of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
