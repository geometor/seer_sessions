Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve a selective horizontal extension or "filling" of certain colored pixels based on others. Specifically, it appears the yellow (4) pixels are expanding to the left, but only in areas influenced by nearby green(3) pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_region
    type: contiguous_region
    color: 3
    properties:
      shape: irregular
      size: 5 pixels
      location: top-left

  - name: isolated_yellow_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: 4
    properties:
      location: center-right, (row:3, col:9) in input, deleted in output

  - name: persistent_yellow_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: 4
    properties:
      location: bottom, (row:7, col:7)
      extended: true #indicates this pixel is the seed for expansion

  - name: azure_background
    type: background
    color: 8
    properties:
      dominant: true

actions:
  - name: extend_yellow
    agent: persistent_yellow_pixel
    type: horizontal_fill
    direction: left
    condition: "within_row_of_green_region"
    result: changes azure(8) to yellow(4)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: green_region
    object: persistent_yellow_pixel
    relation: influences_extension # The green region determines where the yellow extension occurs
  - type: "row adjacent"
    subject: green_region
    object: isolated_yellow_pixel
    relation: "deletes the isolated yellow pixel if no green is present in the row"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color green (3) and yellow (4).

2.  **Green Region Influence:** Consider the rows containing the green (3) region.

3.  **Yellow Pixel Extension:** Identify the yellow (4) on row 7. It extends to the left, changing all azure (8) pixels to yellow (4) on those rows, and stops when there are no more azure pixels before hitting the green region.

4.  **Isolated Yellow Pixel:** The yellow (4) that is alone and is on the same rows as the green pixel is not extended. The single yellow pixel on a row that does not contain any green is deleted/turned azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
