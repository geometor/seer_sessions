Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify the yellow rectangle:** Locate the contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels.
2. **Identify red pixels:** Find all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
3. **Red Pixel Transformation (Above):** Red pixels located above the yellow rectangle are moved down to touch the top border.
4. **Red Pixel Transformation (Corner):** The red pixel to the top right of the yellow box is kept. All other red pixels adjacent to the right border of the yellow rectangle get the value two, converting them to red.
5. **Other pixels stay the same.** All blue and yellow pixels keep the same value.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
