objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: integer values (0-9), representing colors
  - type: object
    properties:
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored pixels
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - size: number of pixels
      - isolated: boolean (true if no adjacent pixels of different colors, except background)

actions:
  - extend_object:
      condition: object is isolated and adjacent to another object
      operation: change neighboring background pixels to the object's color, possibly dependent on relative size, extending horizontally

relationships:
    - adjacency:  pixels sharing an edge or corner.
    - background: large area of single color, usually azure (8)
    - containment: objects are contained within the grid
