```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color green (3) and yellow (4).

2.  **Green Region Influence:** Consider the rows containing the green (3) region.

3.  **Yellow Pixel Extension:** Identify the yellow (4) on row 7. It extends to the left, changing all azure (8) pixels to yellow (4) on those rows, and stops when there are no more azure pixels before hitting the green region.

4.  **Isolated Yellow Pixel:** The yellow (4) that is alone and is on the same rows as the green pixel is not extended. The single yellow pixel on a row that does not contain any green is deleted/turned azure.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some key aspects of the transformation, but it's not entirely accurate across all training examples. The main issues seem to be:

1.  **Inconsistent Yellow Pixel Extension:** The rule for extending yellow pixels isn't universally applied. It works in some cases but not others. Specifically the extension on row 7 did not happen in the examples provided.

2.  **Incorrect Single Yellow Deletion:** The condition for deleting/turning to azure isolated yellow pixels isn't precise.
    It turned yellow pixels azure (8) in example 3 when it should not have.

3.  Yellow pixels seem to expand only to the left, and only azure.

The strategy to resolve these errors is to:

1.  **Re-examine Yellow Extension:** Carefully analyze *all* instances of yellow pixels and how they change (or don't change) concerning green and azure pixels.

2.  **Refine Deletion Condition:** Precisely define the condition under which an isolated yellow pixel is removed. Consider whether the presence/absence of the green region dictates removal, and how the yellow pixel may, or may not, be isolated.

3. Gather metrics on the provided examples

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns better, let's collect some metrics from the examples. I'll refer to example pairs as (in, out).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
