Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify the Yellow Rectangle:** Locate the contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels, defining its top-left and bottom-right corners. If no yellow rectangle exists, the input is unchanged.

2. **Red Pixel Interaction - Above:** Red (2) pixels directly above the yellow rectangle move to be directly adjacent to the top border of the yellow rectangle.

3. **Red Pixel Interaction - Right:** Extend the yellow rectangle to the right by one. Change that pixel to red.

4. **Red Pixel Interaction - Left:** Extend the yellow rectangle to the left by one. Change that pixel to red.

5. **Blue Pixels:** All other blue pixels stay blue.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
