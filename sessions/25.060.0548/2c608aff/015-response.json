The primary colors involved appear to be blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4). There's a large blue background, a central yellow rectangle, and a few isolated red pixels. The transformation seems to involve modifying the red pixels based on their position relative to the yellow rectangle.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
