The primary colors observed are azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve a selective horizontal extension or \"filling\" of certain colored pixels based on others. Specifically, it appears the yellow (4) pixels are expanding to the left, but only in areas influenced by nearby green(3) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
