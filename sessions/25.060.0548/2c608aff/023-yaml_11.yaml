observations:
  - task: Connect diagonally adjacent yellow pixels.
  - condition: Only blue pixels lying between the diagonally adjacent yellow pixels are changed.
  - unchanged: Pixels of other colors are not affected.
  - object_yellow:
    - color: yellow (4)
    - property: Can be diagonally adjacent.
  - object_blue:
    - color: blue (1)
    - property: Becomes yellow if between diagonally adjacent yellow pixels.
  - object_other:
    - property: unaffected by the transformation
  - adjacency:
    - relation: diagonal
    - condition: pixels are diagonally connected
    - action: if an intervening pixel is blue, change to yellow.
