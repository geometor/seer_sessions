The input grids transform into output grids of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve modifying specific colored regions based on their surroundings. It appears that isolated, single-pixel objects of certain colors are extended if near other objects, possibly dependent on size.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are the objects.\n2.  **Identify Background:** The background is considered to be the most frequent color present in the input, forming a connected component.\n3.  **Check for Isolated Single Pixels**: Iterate through each identified object. Determine if it has only one pixel, if so, check if it is *isolated*. An isolated, single-pixel object is one whose neighboring pixels, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals), are only background pixels.\n4. **Extend Isolated Pixels Adjacent to Objects**: If an *isolated, single pixel object* has a neighbor (8-connectivity) which is not the background color, then extend the single pixel object, *horizontally* towards (in the direction of) the neighboring non-background pixels. The neighboring object remains intact.\n5. **Repeat Step 4**: Iterate through all the isolated single-pixel objects and repeat step 4.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extends isolated single-pixel objects horizontally towards nearby objects. The nearby object isn't changed. The extension occurs only horizontally. The background stays unchanged otherwise.\n"
