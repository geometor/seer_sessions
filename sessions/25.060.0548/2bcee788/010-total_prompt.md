Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with a cluster of colored pixels (red and magenta) forming an "L" shape, surrounded by white pixels (color 0).
*   **Output:** A 10x10 grid where the white pixels are replaced by green pixels (color 3), and the original magenta pixels (color 6) are retained. The red pixels (color 2) in the Input are replaced by magenta (6).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: 0  # white
        role: background
      - color: 2  # red
        shape: part of "L"
      - color: 6  # magenta
        shape: part of "L"

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: 3  # green
        role: background
      - color: 6 # magenta
        shape: "L"

  - action: replace_color
    input:
        - color: 0 #white
        - color: 2 #red
    output:
        - color: 3 #green
        - color: 6 #magenta

  - relationship: color_preservation
    element:
      - color: 6 #magenta
    property: remains unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Background Replacement:** Replace all white pixels (color 0) in the input grid with green pixels (color 3).
2.  **Color Change:** Replace all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid with magenta pixels (color 6).
3.   **Preservation:** Keep the magenta pixels (color 6) unchanged.
The final output is a grid where the background is green, and the original "L" shape made by red and magenta is wholly magenta.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
