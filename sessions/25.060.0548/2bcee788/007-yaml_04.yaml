observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: [4, 2] # Yellow and Red
          shape: Rectangle with internal variations
          red_pixels: 9
          yellow_pixels: 8
          changes: All red pixels within the object change to yellow.
      output_objects:
        - color: 4 # Yellow
          shape: Rectangle (same as input)
          red_pixels: 0
          yellow_pixels: 17
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: [4, 2]  # Yellow and Red
          shape: Irregular, but contiguous.
          red_pixels: 3
          yellow_pixels: 7
          changes:  All red pixels change to yellow
      output_objects:
        - color: 4 # Yellow
          shape:  Same as input
          red_pixels: 0
          yellow_pixels: 10

  - example_3:
    input_objects:
      - color: [2,4]
        shape: Irregular
        red_pixels: 8
        yellow_pixels: 6
        changes: All red pixels turn to yellow.
    output_objects:
      - color: 4
        shape: Same as input
        red_pixels: 0
        yellow_pixels: 14

transformation_rule: "Within contiguous regions of yellow and red pixels, all red pixels are converted to yellow pixels."
