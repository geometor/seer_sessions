facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation rule depends on the presence of blue pixels.
  - condition: |
      If a row contains at least two blue pixels, the transformation occurs.
  - action: |
      White pixels between the outermost blue pixels in a row are changed to magenta.
  - constraint: |
      If a row has fewer than two blue pixels, no changes are made to that row.
  - object: Blue pixels
    property: Act as delimiters for the transformation.
  - object: White pixels
    property: Are subject to change if within the blue pixel boundaries.
  - object: Magenta pixels
    property: Result from the transformation of white pixels.
