            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were too simplistic. The original program assumed that the *first* three consecutive white pixels *at the beginning of the row* should be replaced. The test results show that the rule applies to the first occurrence of three consecutive white pixels *anywhere* in each row, not necessarily at the start. We need to adjust both the natural language program and, subsequently, the code to reflect this.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results in Detail:** I'll look closely at where the original code succeeded and failed on each example to understand precisely where the initial assumptions broke down. I need to identify the *actual* trigger for the replacement and confirm that the rule does indeed apply only to the *first* such occurrence in each row.\n2.  **Gather Metrics:** I will use code execution to develop reports.\n3.  **Update YAML:** I'll document the corrected observations about objects, properties and actions in a YAML format.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** I will revise the natural language description to accurately and completely capture the observed transformation rule.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Provided Code:\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule: replace the first three consecutive white pixels with magenta pixels in each row.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()  # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input.\n\n    # Iterate over each row\n    for row_index in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n        row = output_grid[row_index]\n\n        # Check if the first three pixels are white\n        if len(row) >= 3 and all(row[i] == 0 for i in range(3)):\n            # Replace the first three pixels with magenta (6)\n            output_grid[row_index, :3] = 6\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Examples (replace with the actual examples)\nexamples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1,2,3,4,5], [0,0,0,0,0]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[6, 6, 6, 1, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 2], [1,2,3,4,5], [6,6,6,0,0]]),\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2], [1,2,0,0,0]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[6, 6, 6, 0, 2], [6, 6, 6, 1, 2], [1,2,0,0,0]]),\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]),\n    },\n]\n\nresults = []\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n  predicted = transform(example[\"input\"])\n  match = np.array_equal(predicted, example[\"output\"])\n  results.append(\n        {\n            \"example\": i,\n            \"match\": match,\n            \"predicted\": predicted.tolist(),  # Convert to list for easier viewing\n            \"expected\": example[\"output\"].tolist(),\n        }\n    )\nprint(results)\n```"
