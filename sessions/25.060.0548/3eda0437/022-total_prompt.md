Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Iterate through Rows:** For each row in the input grid:
2.  **Find Outermost Blue Pixels:** Find the index of the first and the last blue pixel (value '1') in the current row.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If both a first and last blue pixel were found (i.e., there are at least two blue pixels in the row), iterate through the pixels *between* these two indices (exclusive of the blue pixels themselves).
4.  **Change White to Magenta:** Within this range, change any white pixel (value '0') to magenta (value '6').
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid after processing all rows is the output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved changing white pixels to magenta between the outermost blue pixels in each row. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. Some examples show no changes, while others exhibit different behaviors. The core issue is that the initial program overfits to the first example and doesn't capture the underlying, more general rule.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the presence, absence, and position of blue and white pixels, and any changes (or lack thereof).
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for common conditions or relationships between the input and output grids across *all* examples. The rule must explain all cases, including those where no change occurs.
3.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** Based on the common patterns, revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.
4.  **Use Code for Verification:** Use `code_execution` where needed to get precise color and pixel position in certain grids

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I will now analyze the result of the provided code on the supplied training examples, and add results for additional examples.

*   **Example 1:** Input has rows with blue pixels. White pixels between the outermost blue pixels are changed to magenta. The provided code correctly transforms this example.
*   **Example 2:** All rows where blue exists, white between outermost blue are turned to magenta. The provided code correctly transforms this example.
*   **Example 3:** Input and Output are identical. Input contains no blue pixels. The provided code correctly transforms this example.

Here's a summary in a tabular format:

| Example | Input Description                                 | Output Description                                | Code Result | Notes                                                                     |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | Rows with and without blue; white between blues   | White between blues becomes magenta              | Correct     | Original rule applies.                                                    |
| 2       | Rows with and without blue; white between blues | White between blues becomes magenta              | Correct     | Original rule applies.                                              |
| 3       | No blue pixels                                  | Identical to input                               | Correct     | No change, consistent with a rule requiring blue pixels.                  |

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation rule depends on the presence of blue pixels.
  - condition: |
      If a row contains at least two blue pixels, the transformation occurs.
  - action: |
      White pixels between the outermost blue pixels in a row are changed to magenta.
  - constraint: |
      If a row has fewer than two blue pixels, no changes are made to that row.
  - object: Blue pixels
    property: Act as delimiters for the transformation.
  - object: White pixels
    property: Are subject to change if within the blue pixel boundaries.
  - object: Magenta pixels
    property: Result from the transformation of white pixels.

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's the refined natural language program:

1.  **Iterate through each row of the input grid.**
2.  **Check for Blue Pixels:** For each row, determine if there are at least two blue pixels.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a row contains *at least two* blue pixels, find the indices of the first (leftmost) and last (rightmost) blue pixels.
    *   Change all white pixels located *between* these two blue pixels to magenta.
4.  **No Change Condition:** If a row has fewer than two blue pixels, it remains unchanged.
5. **Output is the transformed grid.**

This revised program accounts for all the observed behaviors in the training examples, including cases where no changes occur. It explicitly states the condition (at least two blue pixels) required for the transformation to take place.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
