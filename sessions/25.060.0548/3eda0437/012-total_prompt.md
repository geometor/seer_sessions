Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers. The primary colors involved appear to be blue (1) and white (0), with a new color, magenta (6) appearing in the output. The overall grid dimensions remain the same between input and output. The change seems localized to a specific region within the grid.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid consists of blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - observation: |
      A horizontal sequence of three white(0) pixels changes into magenta(6) pixels.
  - object: original_grid
    properties:
      colors: [blue, white]
      dimensions: [4, 20]
  - object: transformed_grid
    properties:
      colors: [blue, white, magenta]
      dimensions: [4, 20]
  - action: color_change
    input_color: white
    input_sequence_length: 3
    input_sequence_orientation: horizontal
    output_color: magenta
    location: row 1, columns 15-17 (zero indexed)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Sequence:** Scan the input grid for horizontal sequences of exactly three consecutive white (0) pixels.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** If such a sequence is found, replace all three white pixels in that sequence with magenta (6) pixels in the output grid.
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of a targeted sequence of three white(0) pixels are copied to the output grid without change.

Essentially any place where 3 zeros (white) are next to each other horizontally gets replaced with 6s (magenta).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
