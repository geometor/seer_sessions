The primary change observed between input and output is the introduction or extension of magenta (6) colored regions. These regions appear to replace sequences of white (0) pixels adjacent to azure (1) pixels. The core operation seems to be a localized color replacement based on adjacency. It's crucial to analyze the extent and direction of these replacements.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
