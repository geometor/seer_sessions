Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Iterate through Rows:** For each row in the input grid:
2.  **Find Outermost Blue Pixels:** Find the index of the first and the last blue pixel (value '1') in the current row.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If both a first and last blue pixel were found (i.e., there are at least two blue pixels in the row), iterate through the pixels *between* these two indices (exclusive of the blue pixels themselves).
4.  **Change White to Magenta:** Within this range, change any white pixel (value '0') to magenta (value '6').
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid after processing all rows is the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
