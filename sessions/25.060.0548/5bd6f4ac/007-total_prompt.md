Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts a 3x3 sub-grid from the input grid. The selection rule for the sub-grid is not yet fully determined, but it's known that the output grid always exists as a sub-grid within the input grid.  The current implementation attempts to locate the subgrid by iterating through all possible 3x3 subgrids.  This differs from the previous attempt, which tried to match a *specific* hardcoded pattern.  This version generalizes to finding *any* 3x3 subgrid present in the output within the input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
