The grids consist of single-digit integers representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a selection of specific elements and their spatial relationships from the input grid, but significantly reduced in size. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple cropping or resizing, nor does it appear to be a mathematical operation on the numbers. Instead it is selecting a specific sub-grid, suggesting a pattern-matching or object-identification process.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
