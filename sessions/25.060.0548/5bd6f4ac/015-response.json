The input grid appears to contain various single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input, retaining only specific colors/values in a particular arrangement. There is no obvious geometric transformation (rotation, reflection). It seems that some form of filtering and repositioning, or object extraction, is taking place.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
