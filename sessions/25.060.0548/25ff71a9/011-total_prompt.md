    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # flip the grid vertically

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, strategy, and deliverables:

**General Assessment:**

The provided code implements a vertical flip (`np.flipud`) which correctly transforms the input to the output for all three training examples. The `compare_grids` function accurately checks for equality between the transformed input and the expected output. The code's logic is sound, and the results confirm that the initial hypothesis (vertical flip) holds true for all provided training examples. Since all the training examples produce the expected results, there are not updates to the natrual language program required.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the provided examples and results, focusing on relevant properties:

```
example_reports = [
    {
        "example_index": 0,

    }
]
for report in example_reports:
  print(report)

```

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_set: "train"
    examples:
      - example_index: 0
        objects:
          - description: "Horizontal stripes of color"
            properties:
              colors: [blue, red, green]
              arrangement: "Stacked vertically"
        transformations:
          - type: "Vertical Flip"
            result: "The order of the stripes is reversed."

      - example_index: 1
        objects:
          - description: "Horizontal stripes of color"
            properties:
              colors: [gray, magenta]
              arrangement: "Stacked vertically"
        transformations:
          - type: "Vertical Flip"
            result: "The order of the stripes is reversed."

      - example_index: 2
        objects:
          - description: "Horizontal stripes of color"
            properties:
              colors: [orange, azure, maroon]
              arrangement: "Stacked vertically"
        transformations:
          - type: "Vertical Flip"
            result: "The order of the stripes is reversed."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a vertical flip. The input grid is flipped along the horizontal axis, reversing the order of rows. This effectively inverts the vertical arrangement of any elements within the grid.

```text
1.  **Identify the input grid.**
2.  **Flip the grid vertically.** The rows of the grid are reordered in reverse order, with the top row becoming the bottom row, the second row becoming the second-to-last row, and so on.
3.  **The resulting flipped grid is the output.**
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
