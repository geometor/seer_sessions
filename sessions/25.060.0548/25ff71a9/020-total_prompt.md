**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4BFE15FDD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 0

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid also contains blue and white pixels, but their positions have changed. It appears that the blue object is being rotated or moved within the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    values:
      - 0  # White
      - 1  # Blue

actions:
  - type: rotation
    object: blue pixels
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90 #This is my estimate, to be confirmed after I see more examples

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Blue pixels are adjacent to each other, forming a connected component.
  
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid contains a connected shape formed by blue pixels. This shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid. The white pixels simply fill the remaining spaces.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
