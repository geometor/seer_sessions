The input grid contains a connected shape formed by blue pixels. This shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the rotated shape, and the shape is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with white pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and outline a strategy for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the assumption that the transformation involves isolating a blue shape, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, and placing it in a new, appropriately sized white grid. The provided code correctly implements this. The tests confirm that the approach is working correctly for all training examples. No updates are necessary at this stage. The strategy will involve checking that the test input is also processed correctly.

**Metrics and Observations**

To confirm our analysis and ensure we have accurate information, I will execute the `transform` function on each training input and compare the result with the expected output. I will also check the dimensions and other characteristics and include this in the YAML report.

    min_row = np.min(blue_pixels[:, 0])
    max_row = np.max(blue_pixels[:, 0])
    min_col = np.min(blue_pixels[:, 1])
    max_col = np.max(blue_pixels[:, 1])
    return grid[min_row:max_row+1, min_col:max_col+1]

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
