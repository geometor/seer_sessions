facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: |
      Red pixels (value 2) are the only objects being transformed.
  - transformation: |
      Red pixels are reflected.
      If height and width of the input grid are equal, red pixels are reflected across the horizontal axis.
      If height and width of the input grid are not equal, red pixels are reflected across the vertical axis.
  - constraint: |
      The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
      Pixels other than the red ones remain in their original position.
