Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule reflects red pixels across either the horizontal or vertical axis based on the grid's dimensions.

1.  **Examine** the input grid to determine if height is equal to width.
2.  **Identify** the red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
3.  **If height and width are equal:**
    *   **Reflect** the position of each red pixel across the horizontal axis (x-axis). The new row index will be `height - 1 - old_row_index`, and the column index will remain the same.
4. **If height and width are not equal:**
    *   **Reflect** the position of each red pixel across the vertical axis (y-axis). The new col index will be `width - 1 - old_col_index`, and the row index will remain the same.
5.  **Clear** original positions of the red pixels by making them black.
6. **Update** the position of the red pixels in a copy of the input.
7.  **Return** the modified grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
