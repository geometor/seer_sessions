Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule appears to either rotate the red pixels 90 degrees clockwise, OR it reflects the grid along the horizontal axis (x-axis).

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Rotate** the set of red pixels 90 degrees clockwise within the 3x3 grid. OR
3.  **Reflect** the position of the red pixels across the x-axis

    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    input_grid_shape = input_grid.shape
    # Find the coordinates of red pixels
    red_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)

    # Apply 90-degree clockwise rotation OR reflection across x-axis
    for r, c in red_pixels:

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
