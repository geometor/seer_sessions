Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid also contains blue and white pixels, but their positions have changed. It appears that the blue object is being rotated or moved within the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    values:
      - 0  # White
      - 1  # Blue

actions:
  - type: rotation
    object: blue pixels
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90 #This is my estimate, to be confirmed after I see more examples

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Blue pixels are adjacent to each other, forming a connected component.
  
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid contains a connected shape formed by blue pixels. This shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid. The white pixels simply fill the remaining spaces.
