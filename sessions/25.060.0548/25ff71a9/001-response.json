Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color (0-9). The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The non-zero values seem to be the focus of the transformation, while the zeros act as a background. The transformation maintains the relative positions of colored pixels *within* their original row/column. The overall effect is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
