Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved a simple row shift, specifically moving the row containing all blue pixels to the bottom. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more complex pattern. The initial hypothesis is too specific. We need to generalize the transformation rule to account for cases where an all-blue row might not exist, or when it exists at other location within the grid. The core concept of row shifting (or rotation) is still relevant, but the condition triggering the shift and amount of shift needs adjustment. We will continue to use python and numpy to accomplish this.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To better understand the transformations, I'll describe each example and the observed output of the current code.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid, Row 1: [0, 0, 0], Row 2: [1, 1, 1], Row 3: [2, 2, 2].
    *   Expected Output: Row 1: [0, 0, 0], Row 2: [2, 2, 2], Row 3: [1, 1, 1].
    *   Actual Output: Row 1: [0, 0, 0], Row 2: [2, 2, 2], Row 3: [1, 1, 1].
    *   Result: Success. The all-blue row [1, 1, 1] was moved to the bottom.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid, Row 1: [2, 2, 2], Row 2: [1, 1, 1], Row 3: [0, 0, 0]
    *   Expected Output: Row 1: [2, 2, 2], Row 2: [0, 0, 0], Row 3: [1, 1, 1]
    *   Actual Output: Row 1: [2, 2, 2], Row 2: [0, 0, 0], Row 3: [1, 1, 1]
    *   Result: Success. The all-blue row [1, 1, 1] was moved to the bottom.
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input: 3x3 grid, Row 1: [0, 0, 0], Row 2: [2, 2, 2], Row 3: [1, 1, 1]
    *   Expected Output: Row 1: [0, 0, 0], Row 2: [2, 2, 2], Row 3: [1, 1, 1]
    *   Actual Output: Row 1: [0, 0, 0], Row 2: [2, 2, 2], Row 3: [1, 1, 1]
    *   Result: Success. The all-blue row is already at the bottom. No change required.
*  **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 4x3 grid, Row 1: [0,0,0], Row 2: [2,2,2], Row 3: [3,3,3], Row 4:[1,1,1]
    *   Expected Output: Row 1: [0,0,0], Row 2: [2,2,2], Row 3: [3,3,3], Row 4:[1,1,1]
    *   Actual Output: Row 1: [0,0,0], Row 2: [2,2,2], Row 3: [3,3,3], Row 4:[1,1,1]
    *   Result: Success. All blue row is at the bottom.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the "target" row:** Find the row that consists entirely of blue pixels (value 1).
2.  **Conditional Shift:** If a target row is found, and is *not* already the last row, shift all rows from the target row to one index *below* the last row downwards, and move the target row to the bottom of the grid.
3. If no such row exists, or if its already the last row, leave the input unchanged.
