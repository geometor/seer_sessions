Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify Objects: Find the single rectangle of color other than black (0) in the input grid. A rectangle is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  Determine Movement:** Identify the position of the rectangle within the input.
    - if the rectangle is in the top third of input, move to the bottom third of the grid
    - if the rectangle is in the bottom third of input, move to the center third of the grid
    - if the rectangle is in the center third of input, move to the top third of the grid
3.  Preserve Shape and size:** Maintain the rectangle's original dimensions (width and height) and color during the move.
4. Clear previous location:** Set all pixels in the original location to black (color 0).
5.  Output:** Create an output grid where the identified rectangle is in the determined location with it's original size and shape.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
