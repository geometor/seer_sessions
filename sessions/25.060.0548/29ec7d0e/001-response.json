The most obvious element is the consistent pattern of repeating sequences of numbers within each grid. There are also noticeable areas of '0' (white) pixels in the input grids that seem to disappear in the corresponding output grids. The output grids appear to be a \"cleaned up\" version of the input grids, where those white areas are removed, making existing patterns uniform.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
