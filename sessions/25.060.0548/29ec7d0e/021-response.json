The primary observation is that certain numbers in the input grid are replaced or removed based on their surrounding context, to produce the output grid. Specifically, zeros are removed and some are replaced. It appears that local patterns, and potentially object identification based on connectivity or similar logic, are used.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
