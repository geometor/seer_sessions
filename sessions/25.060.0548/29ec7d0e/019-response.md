Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the repeating pattern concept. However, the provided examples and the current implementation assume the input and output grids are always the same size, and that the repeating pattern simply overlays. The new examples show this is an oversimplification. Specifically, example 2 demonstrates the output grid is larger than the input, while example 3 showcases a different size of repeating pattern, but keeps the general 7x7 pattern. The key is to recognize that the *output* is constructed from the repeating pattern.

The strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the results from the code execution. Quantify discrepancies (e.g., size differences, incorrect pixel values).
2.  **Refine Pattern Identification:** Determine if the pattern size (currently 7x7) is consistent or needs adjustment based on the examples. Based on Example 3, it appears to remain consistent.
3.  **Output Construction:** Emphasize that the output grid is *built* from the repeating pattern, not just an overlay on the input. The input merely *defines* the repeating unit. The size of the repeating pattern and the size of the desired output combine to create the result.
4. **Update Natural Language program, facts and summary.**

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**
Because the code provided has already executed and given results I will document the important information from them here.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Output Shape: (14, 14)
    *   Repeating Pattern: (7, 7)
    *   Result: Correct
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (21, 21)
    *   Repeating Pattern: (7, 7)
    *   Result: Incorrect. The result should be a 21x21, but instead the current code returns the 7x7 input.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input Shape: (10, 10)
    *    Output Shape: (14, 14)
    *    Repeating Pattern (from top left 7x7): (7,7)
    *    Result: Incorrect. While the initial pattern extraction is correct the output should be filled completely.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Identify and replicate a repeating pattern to construct the output grid."
  - example_1:
      input_shape: [14, 14]
      output_shape: [14, 14]
      pattern_size: [7, 7]
      pattern_origin: "top-left corner of input"
      result: "correct"
  - example_2:
      input_shape: [7, 7]
      output_shape: [21, 21]
      pattern_size: [7, 7]
      pattern_origin: "top-left corner of input"
      result: "incorrect - output size mismatch"
  - example_3:
      input_shape: [10, 10]
      output_shape: [14, 14]
      pattern_size: [7,7]
      pattern_origin: "top-left corner of the input"
      result: "incorrect - output size mismatch, pattern replication incomplete"
  - repeating_unit:
      description: "A 7x7 grid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid."
      size: [7, 7]
  - output_construction:
      method: "The output grid is constructed by repeating the repeating unit."
      size_relation: "The output grid's dimensions are independent from input, but are multiples of the repeating unit size."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Repeating Unit:** Extract a 7x7 grid from the top-left corner of the input grid. This is the `repeating_unit`.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output size is given, and will always have dimensions that are a multiple of the repeating unit size (7).
3.  **Construct Output:** Create an output grid of the specified dimensions. Fill the output grid by repeatedly copying the `repeating_unit`. Start at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid, and repeat the unit, moving 7 pixels horizontally and vertically for each repetition, until the entire output grid is filled.
