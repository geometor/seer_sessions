observations:
  - task: "Repeating Pattern Overlay"
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: same as input_grid
          - values: integers (0-9)
      - name: repeating_pattern
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 7x7
          - values: derived from the top-left 7x7 section of the input_grid
  - actions:
      - name: pattern_extraction
        description: The 7x7 top-left section of the input_grid is identified as the repeating_pattern.
      - name: pattern_overlay
        description: The repeating_pattern is overlaid onto the output_grid, starting from the top-left corner and repeating every 7 rows and 7 columns.  All pixels within the overlaid areas are replaced by the corresponding pattern values.
