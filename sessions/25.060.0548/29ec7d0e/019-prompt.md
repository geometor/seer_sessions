Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the Repeating Pattern: Extract the 7x7 grid from the top-left corner of the input grid. This is the `repeating_pattern`.
2. Overlay the Pattern: Copy the `repeating_pattern` onto the output grid. Start at the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid.
3. Repeat Overlay: Repeat the overlay process, shifting the starting position of the `repeating_pattern` by 7 units horizontally and vertically. Continue this repetition until the entire output grid is covered. All pixels in positions corresponding to the repeating pattern should take the value in the repeating pattern.
"""

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
