Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine our natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of finding 2x2 blocks of ones and changing surrounding zeros to ones. However, the results on the training set reveal that this is not the complete rule. The code sometimes produces incorrect output, indicating that it's either too aggressive (changing zeros that shouldn't be changed) or misses some transformations, or perhaps the premise itself is incorrect. The core problem is that the implemented code is overly broad and doesn't accurately reflect the constrained conditions seen in the successful transformations.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully compare the input and output grids of *all* training examples, not just the first, paying close attention to where zeros are changed to ones and, importantly, where they are *not* changed. The current approach doesn't use the output grid to make decisions.
2.  **Identify Constraints:** The current code changes *all* neighboring zeros. The examples will show that the actual rule has stricter conditions. We need to pinpoint the specific spatial relationships or patterns that trigger the zero-to-one changes.
3.  **Refine the Program:** Based on the constraints identified, we'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.
4. **Focus on the "inside"**: The original prompt had some insight about finding 0's _inside_ 2x2 blocks of 1s. The error is that the current code changes 0s surrounding a 2x2 block.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the patterns, I'll analyze each input-output pair, noting:

*   The dimensions of the grids.
*   The locations of 2x2 blocks of ones.
*   The locations of zeros that are changed to ones.
*   The locations of zeros that remain unchanged.
*   The specific error locations in the output

I'll create a summary report in YAML form after the code execution.

**YAML Report:**

```yaml
task_id: "fill_2x2_blocks"
overall_assessment: |
  The initial code incorrectly modifies surrounding zeros instead of interior zeros within 2x2 blue blocks.
  The transformation rule is more specific than initially implemented. The examples show that only 0's that
  complete a 2x2 block are changed to 1s.
examples:
  - example_1:
      dimensions: [3, 5]
      2x2_blocks: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]
      changed_zeros: [(2, 3)]
      unchanged_zeros: []
      predicted_output:
        - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
      errors: []
  - example_2:
      dimensions: [4, 5]
      2x2_blocks: [(1, 1), (1, 2)]
      changed_zeros: []
      unchanged_zeros: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all 2x2 blocks of blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Check for Interior Zeros:** Within each identified 2x2 block, check if there are any white (0) pixels.
3.  **Fill Interior Zeros:** If a white (0) pixel is found *within* a 2x2 blue block, change it to blue (1).
4. **Leave other pixels unchanged.** Pixels that are not part of a 2x2 blue square are not modified.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
