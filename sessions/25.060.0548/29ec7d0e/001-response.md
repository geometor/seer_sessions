Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The most obvious element is the consistent pattern of repeating sequences of numbers within each grid. There are also noticeable areas of '0' (white) pixels in the input grids that seem to disappear in the corresponding output grids. The output grids appear to be a "cleaned up" version of the input grids, where those white areas are removed, making existing patterns uniform.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        rows: integer
        columns: integer
        patterns: repeating sequences of integers
        white_areas: contiguous blocks of '0' pixels

actions:
  - remove_white_areas:
      input: grid
      description: Removes all '0' pixels from the grid.
      constraints: Maintains the relative order of non-zero pixels.

relationships:
  - input_output:
      type: transformation
      rule: remove_white_areas
      description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by removing all zero-valued pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to remove all occurrences of the digit '0' (representing white pixels) from the input grid to produce the output grid. The relative order and arrangement of the non-zero digits are preserved. Essentially, the rule "erases" or "filters out" the white background, leaving only the colored patterns intact and making them fill the complete grid without any gaps.
