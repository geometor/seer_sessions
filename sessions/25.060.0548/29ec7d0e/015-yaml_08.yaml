objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 18x18
      elements: integers (0-7)
      role: [input, output]
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      elements: integers (1-7)
      repetition: horizontal and vertical
      role: background
  - type: region
    properties:
      elements: integer (0)
      shape: irregular, connected
      role: foreground, replaced

actions:
  - type: replacement
    agent: program
    target: region (where element is 0)
    source: pattern
    description: Zeros are replaced based on their position within a repeating pattern.

relationships:
  - input grid *contains* pattern
  - input grid *contains* region
  - output grid *contains* pattern (identical to input)
  - output grid *does_not_contain* region (all zeros are replaced)
  - The repeating sub-grid appears to be of size 7x7. The region is replaced with an upscaled version of this pattern.
