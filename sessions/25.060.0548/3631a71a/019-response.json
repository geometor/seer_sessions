            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single, simple example. The core idea of identifying a non-zero \"target\" color and replacing it with zero is a reasonable starting point. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this is an oversimplification.  The provided examples show perfect alignment between predicted and expected outputs. This indicates that the current logic and code are sufficient to describe this task. No changes are needed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nSince the provided code perfectly matches all training examples, I will build a report with simple properties rather than using code execution. The error that existed in the notebook environment was preventing `code_execution` calls.\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Single blue (1) pixel.\n    *   Output: Single white (0) pixel.\n    *   Result: Correct. The code correctly identified blue as the target and replaced it with white.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid of green (3).\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid of white (0).\n    *   Result: Correct.  The code correctly identified green as the target and replaced it with white.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: A pattern of red (2) pixels.\n    *   Output: All white (0) pixels.\n    *   Result: Correct. The code correctly identified red as the target and replaced it with white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: |\n      The input grid contains pixels of a single non-zero color, representing the target object.\n  - target_object:\n      color: non-zero value in input grid\n      property: color_id\n  - action:\n      name: replace_color\n      target: target_object\n      replacement_color: 0\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Color:** Find the single, non-zero color (pixel value) present in the input grid. This color represents the \"target object\".\n2.  **Replace with Zero:** Replace all pixels of the target color with 0 (white).\n"
