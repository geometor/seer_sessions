The rest of the grid seems to be copied directly from input to output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies contiguous regions of the same color as distinct objects.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, obj_pixels):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        obj_pixels.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, obj_pixels)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, obj_pixels)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, obj_pixels)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, obj_pixels)\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if not visited[row, col] and grid[row, col] != 0:\n                obj_pixels = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], obj_pixels)\n                if obj_pixels:\n                    objects.append({'color': grid[row, col], 'pixels': obj_pixels})\n    return objects\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the neighbors of a given cell, including diagonals.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(-1, 2):\n        for j in range(-1, 2):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            neighbor_row, neighbor_col = row + i, col + j\n            if 0 <= neighbor_row < rows and 0 <= neighbor_col < cols:\n               neighbors.append((neighbor_row, neighbor_col, grid[neighbor_row, neighbor_col]))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the selective masking rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Identify objects in the input grid\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # Selective masking: Replace '9' at boundaries with surrounding color.\n    for obj in objects:\n      for row,col in obj['pixels']:\n          if input_grid[row,col] == 9:\n            neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col)\n            for r,c,color in neighbors:\n              if input_grid[r,c] != 9 and input_grid[r,c] !=0: #prioritize non-background\n                output_grid[row,col] = input_grid[r,c]\n                break #apply change from only first neighbor\n              elif input_grid[r,c] != 9:\n                output_grid[row,col] = input_grid[r,c]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
