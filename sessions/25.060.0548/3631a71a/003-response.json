The primary change seems to be the removal of a large, contiguous block of the color maroon (9). Other colored blocks remain mostly intact, with their original positions and shapes preserved, although some colors are shifted to replace the area where the maroon color was. There are many different object colors and the shapes are complex.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

A large maroon (9) object exists in the lower middle, shaped somewhat irregularly, but occupying several adjacent rows and columns.\n  - object_identification:\n      - object: MaroonBlock\n        color: 9 (maroon)\n        property: Large, contiguous\n        location: lower-middle section of the grid\n        status: removed in the output\n      - object: OtherColoredBlocks\n        color: 0-8 (various)\n        property: maintain shape and relative position\n        status: largely unchanged, possibly with a slight vertical shift down on pixels that were above the removed block\n  - transformation:\n      - action: removal\n        target: MaroonBlock\n      - action: shift (implicit)\n        target: OtherColoredBlocks above the removed maroon area\n        direction: down\n\n```"

All other pixels remain in their original locations.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to remove the large maroon block and allow other colors (but not necessarily all) to take its place by shifting them downwards, without rearranging the remaining layout.\n"
