The grids contain single-digit integers, which represent different colors. There are many multi-pixel regions of the same color, forming irregular shapes. Some of these shapes appear to be touching or overlapping. Comparing the input and output, it seems like a significant portion of the grid remains unchanged.  The primary change seems to involve the removal of certain colored pixels, specifically the color 9 (maroon).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
