Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through the grid, and every value that is 9, changes to 0.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by changing all occurrences of the value 9 to 0.
    """
    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify.  This avoids modifying the original.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell of the grid.
    for row_index, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        for col_index, cell_value in enumerate(row):
            # Check if the cell value is 9.
            if cell_value == 9:
                # Change the value to 0 in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
