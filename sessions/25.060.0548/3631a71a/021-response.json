The transformation seems to involve selective removal/retention of certain colored pixels. It is clear that many groups of digits are changing, I will explore which ones are.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

For each such pixel, trace the entire contiguous block of pixels of the original color.\n5. **Delete Some Groups**.
