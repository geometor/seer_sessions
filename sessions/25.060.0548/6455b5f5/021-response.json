The primary colors involved are red (2), white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid appears to have a distinct pattern of red pixels forming a complex, interconnected shape. The transformation seems to involve identifying specific regions within this red shape and filling them with different colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
