Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core task appears to involve modifying an existing pattern within the grid. The input grid consists primarily of white (0) and red (2) pixels.  The red pixels form a distinct shape, possibly resembling a stylized "T" or cross. The output grid introduces two new colors: azure (8) and blue (1). The azure appears to "highlight" certain points. The blue fills the lower, previously blank section, adjacent to the bottom of the existing shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: Red Shape
    type: Connected Component
    color: Red (2)
    description: A shape, looks like T
    properties:
      - static: true # doesn't really move in traditional sense

  - name: White Background
    type: Background
    color: White (0)
    description: The canvas on which Red Shape resides

  - name: Azure Highlight
    type: Point
    color: Azure (8)
    description:  Highlights two specific points in the red shape

  - name: blue_fill
    type: fill
    color: blue (1)
    description: bottom segment fill

actions:
  - name: Highlight Corners
    agent: SEER
    target: Red Shape
    parameters:
      color: Azure (8)
    description: Adds azure pixels at specific locations.

  - name: Fill area
    agent: SEER
    target: White space, bound by Red Shape
    parameters:
        color: Blue (1)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: red shape
    to: blue fill
    description: The blue fill will occur down, adjacent to existing red shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Locate the connected component of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Highlight:** Add an azure (8) pixel in the top-left corner of the grid, if there is a red pixel in that position.
3.  **Highlight:** Find the bottom-right most pixel that has value of 2 (red), add an azure pixel (8) to the right adjacent to that.
4.  **Fill:** starting from bottom-left corner of the grid, paint blue color (1) until the complete grid width.
5. **Fill:** Paint all rows from the bottom until the bottom-most of red color is painted. Paint with blue, until the red shape stops the paint.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
