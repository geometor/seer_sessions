The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). There are distinct shapes formed by connected pixels of the same color. The transformation modifies the colors within the grid, but the overall shape structure seems to be mostly preserved. The key seems to lie in the color changes, and these changes are not random.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
