Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are red (2), white (0), azure (8), and blue (1).  The input grid appears to contain two distinct red shapes: a vertical line and a horizontal line that intersect, plus other areas of red pixels. The output grid maintains the structure of the original red shape, but with added areas of azure (8) and blue(1) pixels filling the rest of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_shape_vertical
    type: shape
    color: red
    description: Vertical line of red pixels.
    position: Starts at column 4, extends top to near bottom.

  - id: red_shape_horizontal
    type: shape
    color: red
    description: Horizontal line of red pixels.
    position: Starts at row 6, extends from the left edge to column 8.
  - id: red_shape_intersection
    type: shape
    color: red
    description: Intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines
    position: Row 6, Column 4

  - id: azure_regions
    type: region
    color: azure
    description: Areas filled with azure adjacent to the vertical red line.

  - id: blue_region
    type: region
    color: blue
    description: Fills the remaining area of the image.

actions:
  - type: fill
    target: azure_regions
    color: azure
    condition: Adjacent to the vertical red line, left and right.

  - type: fill
    target: blue_region
    color: blue
    condition: remaining area of the image, except where there is red or azure pixels.

relationships:
  - vertical_line: adjacent_to: azure_regions
  - azure_regions: contained_within: blue_region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Shapes:** Locate the red (2) pixels forming a vertical line and a horizontal line in the input grid. Note the intersection.
2.  **Fill with Azure:** Change to azure (8) three columns of pixels immediately to the left and the right, of the vertical red line where cells are not part of the horizontal red lines.
3. **Fill with blue**: Change to blue (1) the background.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
