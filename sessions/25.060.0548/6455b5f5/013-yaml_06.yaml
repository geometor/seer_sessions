  The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels.  The primary colors
  involved are red, white, azure, and blue. The transformation rule depends on
  the spatial relationship between red pixels and white pixels.

observations:
  - object: red_shape
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: varies (not always a vertical line)
    behavior: acts as a dividing element or boundary

  - object: white_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    behavior:
      - transformed:
          condition: to the right of any red_shape
          action: change color to azure (8)
      - transformed:
          condition: to the left of any red_shape
          action: change color to blue (1)
