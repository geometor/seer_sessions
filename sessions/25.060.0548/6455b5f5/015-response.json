The primary colors involved are red (2), white (0), azure (8), and blue (1).  The input grid appears to contain two distinct red shapes: a vertical line and a horizontal line that intersect, plus other areas of red pixels. The output grid maintains the structure of the original red shape, but with added areas of azure (8) and blue(1) pixels filling the rest of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
