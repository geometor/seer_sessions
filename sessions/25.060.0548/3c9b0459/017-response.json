            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for improvement, metrics, YAML documentation, and an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code (90-degree clockwise rotation) are correct for the first training example. However, a 90 degree rotation does not properly describe the transformation for the second example. This suggests a potential issue in generalization from a single example or some other contextual factor.\n\nThe strategy should involve re-evaluating the relationship between the input and output grids, specifically looking for a transformation different than rotation. It's crucial to identify a consistent rule that applies to all available examples, then update both natural language program and the code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary)**\n\nSince the grids are provided and the code works, I will directly analyze results and not use a code execution block, for efficiency.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Transformation: Rotation (90 degrees clockwise) works perfectly.\n    *   Specifics: The colors and their positions are correctly rotated.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x3\n    *   Output Shape: 5x3\n    *   Transformation: Rotation (90 degrees clockwise) FAILS.\n        *   The output should be a horizontal reflection (flipping over the vertical axis)\n\n*   **Combined Analysis:** Rotation is not consistent with the examples. Example 2 strongly points towards reflection.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 39e1d7f9\nsummary: >\n  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by reflecting/flipping the pixels over the vertical axis.\n\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      objects:\n        - description: Single object consisting of connected pixels.\n        - properties:\n            - color: The object uses multiple colors, arranged in rows.\n            - shape: Irregular, though contained within a larger rectangular grid.\n        - transformation: Reflecting the object over the central vertical axis.\n\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: 5x3\n      output_shape: 5x3\n      objects:\n        - description: Multiple objects/regions within the grid.\n        - properties:\n            - color: Different regions have distinct colors.\n        - transformation:  Reflecting the entire grid's contents over the central vertical axis.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n```\nThe output grid is created by reflecting the input grid across its vertical central axis. Each pixel in the input grid is mirrored to the opposite side, maintaining its distance from the central vertical axis. This is equivalent to a horizontal flip.\n```\n"
