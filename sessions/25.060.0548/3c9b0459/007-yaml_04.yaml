- task: 39e1d7f9
- description: Identify the largest contiguous object in the input, create an output grid of the same dimensions, and reproduce the object within it.
- objects:
  - name: largest_object
    description: The largest contiguous block of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Determined by the input pixels.
      - shape: Rectangular, defined by the bounding box of the largest object.
      - size: Determined by the dimensions of the bounding box.
      - position: Top-left corner at (0,0) in the output grid.
- actions:
  - find_largest_object: Locate the largest connected component of non-white pixels in the input.
  - determine_output_size:  The output grid size matches the bounding box of the largest object.
  - copy_object: Recreate the largest object in the output grid, preserving its shape and colors.
