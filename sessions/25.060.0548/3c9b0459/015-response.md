Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The grid cells contain two distinct values: 8 (azure) and 5 (gray). The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 8
        color: azure
      - value: 5
        color: gray

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: elements are arranged in a 2D grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid.
