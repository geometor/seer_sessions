**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4C05B1FE50>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4C05B1FB50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer represents a color. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of these colored pixels within the grid. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is maintained. There's no introduction or removal of colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: rearrange
    description: pixels are moved within the grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixels maintain their existence but change their relative positions within the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire grid. This can be verified by observing how the colors change positions. For instance, the red '2' pixel at the top-left corner in the input becomes the red '2' pixel at the top-right corner in the output and the blue '1' pixel at top-right of input goes to the bottom-right in the output, and so on for the other pixels on the edge and center.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
