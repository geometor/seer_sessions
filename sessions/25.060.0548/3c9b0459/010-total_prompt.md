**input:**
```
9 2 4
2 4 4
2 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4BFE14F750>

**output:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 2
4 2 9
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of these numbers/colors within the grid. The overall shape of the grid (3x3) is preserved. It is not a simple rotation as the values at the edges don't support it.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 2D_grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  data_type: integer
  values: [0-9]
output:
  type: 2D_grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  data_type: integer
  values: [0-9]
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (colors)
actions:
  - name: rearrange
    description: Permutes the cell values within the grid.
relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: The output grid is a rearranged version of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation performs a reflection of the grid across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) combined with a swap.

1.  First swap element at `grid[0][1]` with element at `grid[1][0]`
2.  Then, the grid is reflected along its main diagonal. This means the element at `grid[i][j]` is swapped with the element at `grid[j][i]`.

In simpler way:

The rows of the input grid appear to become the columns of the output grid, and the columns of input grid appear to become the rows in the output grid, but with elements at `grid[0][1]` with element at `grid[1][0]` being swapped.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
