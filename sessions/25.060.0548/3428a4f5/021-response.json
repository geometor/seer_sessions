The input grid contains primarily the colors red (2) and white (0), with a single horizontal line of yellow (4). The output grid seems to be a compressed representation of the input, predominantly green (3) and white (0). The size reduction is significant, and the position of the white pixels in the output appears to correspond to areas of transition or specific features in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output grid is significantly smaller than the input. The exact method of reduction needs further examples, but it is preserving the locations of transitions to the background color 0. White pixels are in positions of transition or edge of object.\n4. **Output**: Return new compressed grid.\n\nFurther examples would help disambiguate between different potential \"reduction\" approaches.\n"
