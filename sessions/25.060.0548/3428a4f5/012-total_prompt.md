Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the execution on the full training set reveals some discrepancies. The core ideas of removing the yellow row and cropping are correct. The object detection and color transformation logic, specifically for red objects, needs adjustment. The current implementation correctly identifies connected components (objects), and handles big red object, but we need to add more detail to color transform rule.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll meticulously examine each input-output pair, noting the exact changes, especially focusing on object characteristics (size, color, position) and how they are transformed.
2.  **Refine Object Handling:** The color transformation logic should be as accurate as possible.
3.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** I will create a structured YAML representation of the observed facts, capturing object properties and actions.
4.  **Updated Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, I will rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation rule.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To gather precise metrics and validate assumptions, I'll leverage the image display capabilities and focus on a comparative analysis of the input and output grids.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x10 grid with a yellow row, some blue and red.
    *   Output: 6x10 grid. Yellow row is gone. Red pixels of size > 1 are now green.
    *   `code_execution` Result: correct

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 13x14 grid with a yellow row, red, blue, and green.
    *   Output: 6x14 grid. Yellow row is gone. Big red become green, small red is removed.
    *   `code_execution` Result: correct

*   **Example 3:**
    *  Input: 10x11. similar contents with example 1 and 2.
    *  Output: 6x11. The yellow row is removed and take top 6 rows. Big red object change to green, small red is removed, and other colors don't change.
    *   `code_execution` Result: correct

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grid contains a row of only yellow pixels."
    action: "Remove the entire row containing only yellow pixels."
  - observation: "The input grid has more than 6 rows."
    action: "Crop the grid to keep only the top 6 rows."
  - observation: "There are red objects in the grid."
    condition: "if the object has size 1."
    action: "remove the red object."
  - observation: "There are red objects."
    condition: "if the size of object greater than 1"
    action: "change to green."
  - observation: "other color objects"
    action: "keep the color."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Remove Yellow Row:** Identify and remove any row that consists entirely of yellow pixels.
2.  **Crop:** If the grid has more than 6 rows, keep only the top 6 rows.
3.  **Red objects:** If there is red object and has size 1, remove it(change to white). If the red object has size greater than 1, change it to green.
4. **Other color:** keep the original colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
