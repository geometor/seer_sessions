1. Remove Yellow Row: Identify and remove any row that consists entirely of yellow pixels.
2. Crop: If the grid has more than 6 rows, keep only the top 6 rows.
3. Red objects: If there is red object and has size 1, remove it(change to white). If the red object has size greater than 1, change it to green.
4. Other color: keep the original colors.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial natural language program and its corresponding Python code to the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial program and code were based on the first training example, and as expected, they don't perfectly generalize to all training examples. The core issues stem from handling variations in the input grids that weren't present in the first example. The errors observed across the examples relate to red object processing, and handling different grid sizes.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will go through each training example pair (input and expected output) provided, along with the actual output produced by the current code. I'll use `code_execution` to build detailed information for each example.
2.  **Fact Gathering (YAML):**  I'll create a YAML block summarizing key observations. This will include details about objects (size, color, position) and the transformations that *should* occur.
3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis and YAML facts, I'll revise the natural language program to accurately capture the transformation rules, accommodating all training examples.
4.  **Anticipate Code Changes:** I'll keep the yaml and revised natural language program in mind to help in the code generation step that will come later.

**Detailed Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's use the `code_execution` tool to get a precise understanding of what happened in each example. I'll build on an initial report that was already generated, extending it with analysis of the expected output as well as additional observations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
