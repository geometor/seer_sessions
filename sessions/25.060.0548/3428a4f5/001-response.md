Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids consistently contain the colors white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The yellow (4) appears as a solid horizontal line separating two regions of intermixed white and red pixels.
* **Output Grids:** The output grids contain only white (0) and green (3).  The output grids seem smaller overall. The green appears to replace specific regions.
* **Size Change:** The output grids are smaller (fewer rows and same cols) than the corresponding input grids.
*    **Color transformation:** Red becomes green, some of the white becomes green and the yellow separating line goes away.

**YAML Fact Identification:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, red, yellow]
      shape: rectangle
      size: variable
    relations:
      - contains: [red_region, white_region, yellow_line]

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, green]
      shape: rectangle
      size: smaller_than_input
    relations:
        - derived_from: input_grid

  - object: yellow_line
    properties:
      color: yellow
      shape: horizontal_line
    actions:
      - disappears: output_grid

  - object: red_region
    properties:
       color: red
    actions:
      - changes_color: green

  - object: white_region
    properties:
        color: white
    actions:
      -  changes_color_selectively: green #some white remains white
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This line acts as a delimiter.

2.  **Consider** only the grid of pixels *above* the yellow line.

3.  **Transform** all red (2) pixels in this region to green (3).

4.  **Transform** a *subset* of white (0) pixels to green (3). White becomes
    green *only if* the white is immediately diagonally or adjacent to a green
    (previously red) pixel.

5.  **Output** this transformed region above the yellow line as a new grid. The yellow row, and everything below it, is discarded.
