Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Yellow Row:** Find the row index in the input grid that is entirely filled with yellow (4) pixels.
2. **Define Output Region:** Determine a region of interest in the input grid. The top of the region of interest begins one row above yellow row, the region of interest continues to the end of input. The height of the output grid can be calculated by `input_grid.height - yellow_row_index`
3. **Condense:** Reduce input grid section above the identified yellow row to output grid size
4.  **Recolor:** Within this new grid section, change all red (2) pixels to green (3). All other colors become white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
