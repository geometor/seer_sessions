The input grid contains pixels of colors red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The output grid contains pixels of colors green (3) and white (0). The output grid appears to be a condensed or abstracted version of the input grid, focusing on specific features and changing their colors. The single row of yellow (4) pixels in the input seems to be particularly important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top of the region of interest begins one row above yellow row, the region of interest continues to the end of input. The height of the output grid can be calculated by `input_grid.height - yellow_row_index`\n3. **Condense:** Reduce input grid section above the identified yellow row to output grid size\n4.  **Recolor:** Within this new grid section, change all red (2) pixels to green (3). All other colors become white (0).\n\n"
