            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the initial code against all training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. While the code correctly handles the first example, it fails to generalize to other cases where the presence of orange (7) doesn't dictate the output in a simple 4x4 compression. The core issue is that the initial program assumes a fixed 4x4 output grid and a direct correspondence between input regions and output cells based solely on the presence of orange. The additional examples demonstrate more complex relationships and potentially different output grid sizes.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the size of both grids, the placement of colors, and any potential patterns.\n2.  **Identify Key Features:** Determine the relevant features that influence the transformation. This may include the presence, absence, count, or position of specific colors. It might also involve identifying shapes, patterns or object interactions.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to accurately capture the transformation rule observed across *all* training examples.\n4. **Generate new code based on updated program**\n5.  **Iterate:** Test the refined program against the examples and repeat the process until all training examples are correctly handled.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately analyze, I'll use a conceptual approach (since I can't directly execute code) to describe what code execution *would* do and the expected results.\n\n*Example 1*\n\n*   Input Size: 16x16\n*   Output Size: 4x4\n*   Result: Success. The code correctly identifies orange and maps regions to green.\n*   metrics report:\n    ```\n    example: 1\n    input_shape: (16, 16)\n    output_shape: (4, 4)\n    output_shape_match: False\n    orange_in_input: True\n    green_in_output: True\n    transformation_type: compression\n    success: True\n    ```\n\n*Example 2*\n\n*   Input Size: 14x14\n*   Output Size: 14x14.\n*   Result: Fail. Output is 4x4, where it must match the dimensions of input.\n*   metrics report:\n    ```\n    example: 2\n    input_shape: (14, 14)\n    output_shape: (14, 14)\n    output_shape_match: True\n    orange_in_input: True\n    green_in_output: True\n    transformation_type: conditional_replacement\n    success: False\n    ```\n\n*Example 3*\n\n*   Input Size: 16x16\n*   Output Size: 16x16.\n*   Result: Fail. Output is 4x4, but it should maintain the original size.\n*   metrics report:\n    ```\n    example: 3\n    input_shape: (16, 16)\n    output_shape: (16, 16)\n    output_shape_match: True\n    orange_in_input: True\n    green_in_output: True\n    transformation_type: conditional_replacement\n    success: False\n    ```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: (16, 16)\n      output_shape: (4, 4)\n      transformation: \"Compression.

Every orange (7) pixel in the input grid is replaced by a green (3) pixel in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
