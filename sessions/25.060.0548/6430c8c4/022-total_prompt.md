Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying contiguous blocks of color and representing their presence with green in a structured output grid. The provided code correctly identifies blocks. However the arrangement of the green blocks in a structured grid has not generalized well, failing to create consistent structure in other train examples.

The strategy to correct this is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair and the code's output to understand the discrepancies.
2.  **Identify the True Pattern:** Determine the *actual* rule governing the transformation, paying close attention to the spatial relationships and arrangements, not just the presence of blocks. It seems there is structure in a new grid with 1x1 objects.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the observed rule. Use precise language.
4.  **Metrics:** Record detailed observations including counts of objects, spatial, size.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered using code execution to confirm observations:

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_counts = {color: np.sum(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}
    print(f"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")
    print(f"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}")
    print(f"  Color Counts: {color_counts}")

def find_blocks(grid):
    """Find contiguous blocks of the same color."""
    blocks = []
    visited = set()
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    def dfs(row, col, color, block):
        if (row, col) in visited or row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or grid[row, col] != color:
            return
        visited.add((row, col))
        block.append((row, col))
        dfs(row + 1, col, color, block)
        dfs(row - 1, col, color, block)
        dfs(row, col + 1, color, block)
        dfs(row, col - 1, color, block)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r,c] != 0:
                block = []
                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], block)
                blocks.append(block)
    return blocks

    {
        "input": [[5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5]],
        "output": [[3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3]],

        "output": [[3, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3]],
    },

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print("Input:")
    describe_grid(example["input"])
    blocks = find_blocks(np.array(example["input"]))
    print(f"  Number of blocks: {len(blocks)}")    
    print("Output:")
    describe_grid(example["output"])
    blocks = find_blocks(np.array(example["output"]))
    print(f"  Number of blocks: {len(blocks)}")        
    print("-" * 20)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
