Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids are larger and contain multiple colors (orange, yellow, red, and white). The output grids are consistently smaller (4x4) and contain only two colors: green and white. The green color (value 3) in the output seems to correspond to the orange color (value 7) in the input. The spatial arrangement of the green pixels in the output seems to be related to a compressed representation of the orange pixels within the input. White regions match zeros.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids have variable sizes, output is always 4x4.
  - observation: Output contains only colors green (3) and white (0).
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      - colors: orange(7), yellow(4), red(2), white(0)
      - size: variable
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      - colors: green(3), white(0)
      - size: 4x4
  - relationship: Green(3) in output corresponds to orange(7) in input.
  - action: Compress input grid to 4x4 output grid.
  - action: Replace orange(7) with green(3) during compression.
  - action: replace other colors with white(0)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Orange:** Locate all pixels with the value 7 (orange) in the input grid.
2.  **Compress/Downsize:** Reduce the input grid to a 4x4 output grid.
3. **Map Orange positions:** where there was orange (7) in the input, replace those position in the 4x4 grid with green (3). If a quadrant contains any orange, the compressed cell in that area will be green.
4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with white (0). The specific method of compression is to check if *any* orange pixel exists within each corresponding region of the input grid that maps to a single pixel in the 4x4 output.

In Essence, the output is 4x4 representation of input. Orange in the input, represented by 7, are areas of interest. The output grid, marks with color green (3) the areas with orange. All other input colors are discarded.
