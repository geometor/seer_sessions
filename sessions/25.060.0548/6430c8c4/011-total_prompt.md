Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Examine the Input: Scan the input grid to find areas that contain orange (7) pixels.
2.  Define Output Grid: Create a 2x2 output grid filled with black (0) pixels.
3.  Check for top-left orange: If there's at least one orange (7) in the top two rows, check if the rectangle spanning from the top left to the column of the first orange cell contains only orange (7) cells. If so, place a green (3) pixel in the bottom-right cell (1, 1) of the 2x2 output grid.
4.  Check for top-right orange: If there is any orange pixel on the top two rows that have not yet been considered (check whether the column of the new first orange pixel is outside the rectangle considered in step 3). If so, place a green (3) at position (0, 1) of the output grid.
5.  Return Output: The 2x2 output grid is the result. All other pixels in the grid are black.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
