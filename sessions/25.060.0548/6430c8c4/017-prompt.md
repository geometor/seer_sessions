Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Top-Left Object:** Find the dimensions of the contiguous block of same-colored pixels starting from the top-left corner of the input grid.
2. **Output Grid Size:**  The output grid has the same dimensions as this top-left object.
3. **Color Transformation:**
    * If the top-left object's color is NOT azure (8), fill the output grid with green (3).
    * If the top-left object's color IS azure (8), fill the output grid with white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
