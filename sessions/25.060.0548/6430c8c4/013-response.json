The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0, 2, 4, and 7), while the output grid contains only two colors (0 and 3). The output seems to focus on the corners of the input grid, somehow extracting a sub-grid. The colors in the input do not appear directly in the output, suggesting a color transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
