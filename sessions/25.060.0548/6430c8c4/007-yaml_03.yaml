objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9x4] (input), [4x4] (output)
      elements: pixels
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
    relations:
      - input_grid "contains" multiple colored regions
      - output_grid "represents" a transformation of the input_grid

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Condenses the input grid into a smaller output grid.
    details:
      - Selects certain pixel values/colors from the input based on an unknown rule.
      - The selected pixels are placed in the output at a new location

observations:
    - The top left 2x2 block of 7s (orange) in the input is transformed into a single 3 (green) at coordinate (0,2).
    - The top right 2x1 block (adjacent to the previous one) of 7s (orange) is transformed to a single 3 (green) at (1,0).
    - All others pixels in the input are zeroed.
