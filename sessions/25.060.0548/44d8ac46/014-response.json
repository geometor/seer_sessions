Diagonally connected gray pixels are considered part of the same region.\n\n2.  **Determine Enclosure:** For each gray region, determine if it's fully enclosed. A region is considered fully enclosed if and only if all non-gray pixels within its bounding box are completely surrounded, including diagonals, by either gray pixels belonging to that region or the edge of the entire grid. This means there are no \"leaks\" to the outside.\n\n3.  **Fill Enclosed Interiors:** If a gray region is fully enclosed, change the color of all non-gray pixels *inside* the region to red (2). A non-gray pixel is considered \"inside\" if it is within the bounding box defined by the gray region, and all eight neighboring pixels (including diagonals) are either: (a) gray pixels that are part of the *same* contiguous gray region, or (b) outside the bounds of the entire input grid. Specifically, *do not* change gray pixels that are found inside a larger gray object.\n\n4.  **Leave Other Regions Unchanged:** Gray regions that are not fully enclosed (i.e., have a \"leak\" to the outside) should remain unchanged, as should any gray pixels within the enclosing region.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous regions of a specific color in the grid, including diagonals.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    regions = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_region):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to explore contiguous regions, including diagonals.\"\"\"\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] != color\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_region.append((row, col))\n        # Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, current_region)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_region = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_region)\n                regions.append(current_region)\n    return regions\n\ndef is_fully_enclosed(region, grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a region is fully enclosed within the grid.
