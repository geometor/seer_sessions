In some output grids, there are red (2) pixels. The red pixels appear to be within enclosed areas formed by the grey pixels. It seems like the transformation focuses on identifying enclosed regions of grey pixels, possibly changing those enclosed spaces (interior only) to red. It seems important that train_4 input and output are the same, and nothing is changed. This means that the shape of the grey objects is important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A region is considered enclosed if it's impossible to reach the edge of the grid from any pixel within the region without crossing a grey pixel.\n2.  **Conditional Color Change:**  If there exist such enclosed regions, take all of the white pixels in the enclosed region change them to red (2).\n3. **No changes:** if a white pixel can trace a line to the edge of the grid, then there is no change (as in train_4).\n\nThe key here is the concept of \"enclosed\". The transformation only affects the _interior_ pixels of fully enclosed grey regions. The grey pixels themselves are unchanged and white pixels that can reach the edge without passing over grey pixels are unchanged.\n"
