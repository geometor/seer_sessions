            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed to find an \"H\" shape made of gray pixels, locate its inner 2x2 block, and recolor it red. The provided code works for the first example. However, it fails for the second and third examples. The primary issue seems to be the rigid definition of the \"H\" shape. The current `find_h_shape` function expects a very specific \"H\" structure, which might not always be the case, and does not account for \"H\" shapes of different sizes. The second example does not contains an \"H\", The last example contains an \"H\" shape but of the different size. The strategy will be to generalize the `find_h_shape` function to detect H-like shapes robustly and find the inner 2x2 block and change the color correctly.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results, obtained through observations of the provided data, aided with visualization via the `code_execution` tool when needed.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid with a gray \"H\" shape.\n    *   Expected Output: Same grid, but the inner 2x2 block of the \"H\" is red.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.\n    *   Metrics: The code correctly identifies and modifies the \"H\".\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 9x9 grid with two gray vertical bars.\n    *   Expected Output: Same as input (no change).\n    *   Actual Output: The left bar's center 2x2 block is red, but the right bar remains unchanged.\n    *   Metrics: Incorrectly identified a partial-\"H\" and modified it. The `find_h_shape` detected one \"H\" which does not fully match the shape.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 11x11 grid with a larger gray \"H\" shape.\n    *   Expected Output: Same grid, but the inner 2x2 block of the large \"H\" is red.\n    *   Actual Output: Same as input (no change).\n    *   Metrics: The `find_h_shape` cannot identify the bigger \"H\" shape since it does not match the expected size in the function.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - shape: \"H\"\n          color: gray\n          size: 5x5\n          inner_block_position: center\n      output_objects:\n        - shape: \"H\"\n          color: gray\n          size: 5x5\n          inner_block_color: red\n          inner_block_position: center\n      transformation: \"Recolor inner 2x2 block of 'H' to red\"\n\n  - example_2:\n     input_objects:\n       - shape: \"Two Vertical bars\"\n         color: \"gray\"\n     output_objects:\n       - shape: \"Two Vertical bars\"\n         color: \"gray\"       \n     transformation: \"No transformation expected\"\n\n  - example_3:\n      input_objects:\n        - shape: \"H\"\n          color: gray\n          size: 9x9\n          inner_block_position: center\n      output_objects:\n        - shape: \"H\"\n          color: gray\n          size: 9x9\n          inner_block_color: red\n          inner_block_position: center\n      transformation: \"Recolor inner 2x2 block of 'H' to red\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify \"H\" Shapes:** Scan the input grid to find shapes resembling the letter \"H\". An \"H\" shape consists of two vertical bars of equal height, connected by a horizontal bar (of any consistent length) somewhere along their height. The height and width of the \"H\" can vary.\n\n2.  **Locate Inner 2x2 Block:**  If an \"H\" shape is found, determine the central 2x2 block within the \"H\" shape. This block's location relative to the overall \"H\" structure depends on the 'H's dimensions, but the center should match with 'H''s center.\n\n3.  **Recolor:** Change the color of the identified 2x2 block to red.\n\n4. **No Change**: If no H Shape found, the output should be the same with input.\n"
