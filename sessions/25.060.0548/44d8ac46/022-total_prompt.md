Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair. Here's my report on the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of pixels, where each pixel has a numerical value representing a color. The dominant colors are white (0) and gray (5). The input and output grids appear identical in this example. There's a distinct shape formed by the gray pixels in both the input and output. The task could involve shape detection, color filtering, or potentially no operation at all (identity transformation). Given just one example it is hard to tell.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: train_4
objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 12
      columns: 12
      elements: pixels
      default_color: white # 0

  - id: shape1
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: gray # 5
      location:
        - (1,1) to (4,4)
        - (6,3) to (10,7)
    relations:
       - borders white pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Input:** The input is a 12x12 grid.
2.  **Identify Shapes:** Identify contiguous blocks of non-white pixels.
3.  **Process:** There is no processing because the output grid is identical to input grid.
4. **Output:** return the input

Because of the identical grids it is impossible to determine the logic of the
transform. It may be that:

- this is an identity map task - i.e. do nothing, just return the input
- this particular input is an exception to the general rule, where the
  transformation is the identity function.
- the task involves detecting a shape, but in this case no modifications were
  done

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
