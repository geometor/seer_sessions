Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). The input grid contains regions of gray (5) and white(0) pixels. The output grid seems to be identical to the input grid, except for a specific modification: some gray (5) pixels within a specific shape have changed to red (2). The modification isn't changing all gray to red, only those that appear within a bounded area.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - dimensions: 12x12
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - white (0)
          - gray (5)
          - red (2)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid

  - action: color_change
    description: Some gray pixels are changed to red
    details: it is bounded, and appears on the interior of the gray areas.

  - relation: inside
    description: The transformation happens inside a gray shape
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Identify Interior Pixels:** Examine each gray (5) pixel to establish the location within the gray object.
3.  **Change Color:** It appears the gray pixels change if there is gray pixel on all 4 sides (above, below, left and right). Change the interior gray(5) pixels to red (2).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (white and the exterior gray ones) remain unchanged.
5. **Output:** The output grid is the modified copy of the input.

In short, the transformation identifies the "interior" gray pixels of shapes within the grid, and then colors those interior pixels to red. The outer "border" of the shapes remain gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
