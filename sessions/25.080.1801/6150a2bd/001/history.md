## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers, as the relationship isn't consistent across the examples. The relationship appears to be a re-arrangement, a change of spatial configuration and a rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "The integers in the grid represent colors."
  - observation: "The transformation involves a re-arrangement of the integers not a change in their values"
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: "rows x columns"
      - elements: "single-digit integers (colors)"
    actions:
      - "elements are re-arranged"
  - relationship: "input grid is rotated and elements are repositioned"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Reverse Order**: reverse the order of the rows

It is not very clear to explain, but the rotation happens at the "array" level and individual cells do not rotate.
