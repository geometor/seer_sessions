facts:
  - observation: Inputs are 3x3 grids.
  - observation: Outputs are single integers.
  - observation: Input grid values are 0 (white) or 2 (red).
  - observation: Output values are 1 or 7.
  - relationship: The output value depends on properties of the input red pixels.
  - object: red_pixels, type: set, property: count, property: positions
  - object: white_pixels, type: set, property:count, property:positions
  - action: count, target: red_pixels
  - action: determine_pattern, target: red_pixels
  - hypothesis: If the number of red pixels in each row and each column sums to an odd number, then the output is 1.
  - hypothesis: If the number of red pixels in the entire grid is even, and not all rows and columns have an odd number of red cells, the output is 7.
