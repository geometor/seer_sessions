observations:
  - task_type: object_extraction_and_reconstruction
  - input_objects:
      - description: Single-color regions within a black grid.
        properties:
          - color: Varies (1, 2, 7, 8 in the examples).
          - shape: Irregular, but contiguous.
          - size: Varies.
  - output_objects:
      - description: Condensed representation of the input object's color.
        properties:
          - color: Same as the input object's color.
          - shape: Rectangular, size varies between 1 x N
          - size: Equal to the number of non-zero cells in the input.
  - transformations:
      - action: Extract non-black color.
      - action: Count the number of non-black pixels.
      - action: Create output grid with non-black color repeated that count
      - result: A compact rectangular grid containing only the extracted color.
  - relationships:
      - input_color: output_color
      - input_non_black_pixels : output_size
