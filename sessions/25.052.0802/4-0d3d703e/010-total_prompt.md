Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (green, blue, and red). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (yellow, gray, and magenta). Each color in the input is consistently mapped to a different color in the output:

-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
-   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

The transformation rule can be described as a simple color substitution, maintaining the shape and position of the objects while adding 1 to the object id (color) in the input data.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3.  Increase the color value, obtaining the new color for the output
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.


```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:
- Green (3) -> Yellow (4)
- Blue (1) -> Gray (5)
- Red (2) -> Magenta (6)
Essentially, we add 1 to input_color to get output color.
The structure of the grid remains identical.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
task: 005
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:

    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Similar to the first example, the input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (red, green, and azure). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (magenta, yellow, and maroon). The transformation appears to be another color substitution:

-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).
-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
-   Azure (8) is transformed to Maroon (9).

This transformation rule, however, is not simple as adding one to the value. It maintains the shape and position of the objects, but the color mapping is different: +4, +1, +1.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3. Apply the following color changes:
    -   If the color is Red (2), change it to Magenta (6).
    -   If the color is Green (3), change it to Yellow (4).
    -   If the color is Azure (8), change it to Maroon (9).
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:

            output_grid[i, j] = output_color

    return output_grid
```

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and synthesize a Python module based on the observed transformations.

**Combined Analysis of Examples**

From the two examples, we can discern the following:

1.  **Structure Preservation:** The spatial layout and shape of colored regions are identical between input and output grids. This means the transformation is purely color-based.
2.  **Color Mapping:** The transformation involves a mapping between input colors and output colors. However, this mapping isn't a simple, consistent arithmetic operation across all colors. It's color-specific.

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

Given the inconsistencies between the two examples, a more generalized, data-driven approach is necessary. We'll create a color mapping based on *all* observed input-output pairs.

1.  **Build a Color Map:** Iterate through the example input and output grids. For each corresponding cell, record the input color and its corresponding output color in a dictionary.
2.  **Apply Mapping:** For a new input grid, iterate through each cell. Look up the input color in the color map. If a mapping exists, apply it to the corresponding output cell. If no mapping exists, we have two options that we should try, (1) keep the same color (2) assign black (or zero).

**Python Module**

```python
"""
The transformation rule involves a color substitution based on a mapping
derived from example input-output pairs. The spatial structure is preserved.
If an input color is encountered that wasn't seen in the examples,
it defaults to keeping the original color.
"""

import numpy as np

def build_color_map(example_inputs, example_outputs):
    """Builds a color mapping dictionary from example input/output pairs."""
    color_map = {}
    for input_grid, output_grid in zip(example_inputs, example_outputs):
        for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
            for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
                input_color = input_grid[i, j]
                output_color = output_grid[i, j]
                color_map[input_color] = output_color
    return color_map

def transform(input_grid, color_map):
    """
    Transforms the input grid into the output grid by applying a color substitution
    based on the provided color_map.

    Args:
        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.
        color_map (dict):  A dictionary mapping input colors to output colors

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The transformed output grid.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            # Get the color of the current cell.
            input_color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Apply the color substitution if mapping is known.
            output_color = color_map.get(input_color, input_color) # Default: Keep original

            # Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
            output_grid[i, j] = output_color

    return output_grid

```

**Key Improvements and Considerations**

*   **Data-Driven:** The `build_color_map` function creates the mapping directly from the examples, avoiding hardcoding.
*   **Handles Unknown Colors:** The `.get(input_color, input_color)` in the `transform` function handles cases where an input color has no corresponding mapping in the `color_map`.  The default behavior will be keeping the same color.
*   **Flexibility:** This code is now more adaptable to various color-substitution tasks, as long as the spatial structure is preserved.
*   **Multiple Examples:** The code explicitly handles multiple example input/output pairs in `build_color_map`. This is essential for robust learning.

**How to Use**

1.  **Gather Examples:** Create `numpy` arrays for all your example input and output grids.
2.  **Build the Map:**
    ```python
    example_inputs = [example_1_input, example_2_input]  # Your example input arrays
    example_outputs = [example_1_output, example_2_output] # Your example output arrays
    color_map = build_color_map(example_inputs, example_outputs)
    ```
3.  **Transform:**
    ```python
    new_input = np.array([[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]) # Some new input
    output_grid = transform(new_input, color_map)
    print(output_grid)
    ```

This revised approach provides a much more robust and generalizable solution to the color-substitution problem, directly addressing the inconsistencies observed in the initial examples. It also lays the groundwork for handling more complex transformations in the future.

Okay, let's analyze this new example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
task: 009
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line

      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The input and output grids maintain the same 3x3 structure with three vertical lines.  The transformation is, again, a color substitution:

*   Gray (5) is transformed to Blue (1).
*   Azure (8) is transformed to Maroon (9).
*   Magenta (6) is transformed to Red (2).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3.  Apply the following color changes, based on observed mappings:
    *   If the color is Gray (5), change it to Blue (1).
    *   If the color is Azure (8), change it to Maroon (9).
    *   If the color is Magenta (6), change it to Red (2).
4.  Place the transformed color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

This natural language program is very similar to the previous examples. The core concept remains a color substitution that preserves spatial structure.  The provided Python module from the previous response *already handles this correctly* because it builds the `color_map` dynamically from examples.  We don't need to modify the code; we just need to *include this new example* when building the `color_map`.

```python
import numpy as np

# Previous examples (assuming these are defined elsewhere)
example_1_input = np.array([[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]])
example_1_output = np.array([[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]])

example_2_input = np.array([[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]])
example_2_output = np.array([[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]])

# New example
example_3_input = np.array([[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]])
example_3_output = np.array([[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]])

# Build the color map using *all* examples
example_inputs = [example_1_input, example_2_input, example_3_input]
example_outputs = [example_1_output, example_2_output, example_3_output]
color_map = build_color_map(example_inputs, example_outputs)

# Test with a new input (same as example 3)
new_input = np.array([[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]])
output_grid = transform(new_input, color_map)
print(output_grid)  # Expected: [[1 9 2] [1 9 2] [1 9 2]]

# Demonstrating the 'unknown color' handling (using '7' which isn't in the map)
new_input_unknown = np.array([[5, 7, 6], [5, 7, 6], [5, 7, 6]])
output_grid_unknown = transform(new_input_unknown, color_map)
print(output_grid_unknown)  # Expected: [[1 7 2] [1 7 2] [1 7 2]] - 7 remains unchanged.

def build_color_map(example_inputs, example_outputs):
    """Builds a color mapping dictionary from example input/output pairs."""
    color_map = {}
    for input_grid, output_grid in zip(example_inputs, example_outputs):
        for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
            for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
                input_color = input_grid[i, j]
                output_color = output_grid[i, j]
                color_map[input_color] = output_color
    return color_map

def transform(input_grid, color_map):
    """

    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):

            input_color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
            output_grid[i, j] = output_color

    return output_grid

```

The key takeaway is that by accumulating examples and rebuilding the `color_map`, the code remains correct without modification. The `build_color_map` function handles the creation of the appropriate mapping, and `transform` applies it. The added test cases demonstrate the expected behavior with both known and unknown colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
