Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (green, blue, and red). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (yellow, gray, and magenta). Each color in the input is consistently mapped to a different color in the output:

-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
-   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

The transformation rule can be described as a simple color substitution, maintaining the shape and position of the objects while adding 1 to the object id (color) in the input data.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3.  Increase the color value, obtaining the new color for the output
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
