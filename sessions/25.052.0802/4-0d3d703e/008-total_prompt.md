Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves a color substitution based on a mapping
derived from example input-output pairs. The spatial structure is preserved.
If an input color is encountered that wasn't seen in the examples,
it defaults to keeping the original color.

Train Set Results:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
9 4 2
9 4 2
9 4 2
```
Expected Output:
```
8 3 6
8 3 6
8 3 6
```
Status: ERROR: transform() missing 1 required positional argument: 'color_map'
Okay, I understand the task and the error encountered. The error message `transform() missing 1 required positional argument: 'color_map'` indicates that the `transform` function was called without providing the `color_map` argument, which is essential for the color substitution logic. This happened because, in the testing setup, the color map generated on the examples was not used for the evaluation on the train set.

Here's a breakdown of the observed transformation and the natural language program:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observation:** The input and output grids are identical in size and shape.  The only difference is the color of the cells.

2.  **Color Mapping:** A direct one-to-one mapping exists between colors in the input and output grids.  We can determine this mapping by comparing corresponding cells in the example input/output pairs.

3.  **Transformation:** For each cell in the input grid, determine its color.  Look up this color in the color mapping derived from the examples.  Replace the input color with the corresponding output color from the mapping. If a color is encountered in the input that wasn't present in the example set, keep the color unchanged.

4. **Spatial Preservation:** The transformation involves only color changes. The x, y coordinates of each value in the grid is unchanged.

**Example-Specific Mapping (from the single example):**

*   9 maps to 8
*   4 maps to 3
*   2 maps to 6

I will now use this description to make sure the color map built during training is passed for the evaluation of the training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
