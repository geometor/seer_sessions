Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:
- Green (3) -> Yellow (4)
- Blue (1) -> Gray (5)
- Red (2) -> Magenta (6)
Essentially, we add 1 to input_color to get output color.
The structure of the grid remains identical.

    Transforms the input grid into the output grid by applying a color substitution.

    Args:
        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.

    Returns:

Status: False
**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
