Okay, I see the issue. My previous code was too simplistic. I assumed a simple color increment, but I didn't account for the color values wrapping around or having a specific mapping when reaching the maximum color value (9). The provided example clearly shows that when a color value of 9 is incremented, it becomes 8, and not 10 as my code produced. I need to consider the specific color mappings provided and implement a modulo operation if a direct increment exceeds color value 9, otherwise the color stays.

Here's the revised natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of cells, each with a specific color represented by a number (0-9).

2.  **Transformation Rule:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid. The transformation is as follows:
    *   If the input color is less than 9, it is incremented by 1.
    *   If the input color is 9, it is changed to 8.

3. **Action:** Replace input color with the new color.

4.  **Predicates:** Color of the cell.

In essence, instead of simply adding 1, the transformation adds 1 to the input color. If the incrementing results in a value greater than 9 (in this case, just 10), change it to 8. The grid's structure (shape and size) remains constant; only the cell colors change according to this rule.
