# 4-0d3d703e • 006 • example_2 - CODE

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and synthesize a Python module based on the observed transformations.

**Combined Analysis of Examples**

From the two examples, we can discern the following:

1.  **Structure Preservation:** The spatial layout and shape of colored regions are identical between input and output grids. This means the transformation is purely color-based.
2.  **Color Mapping:** The transformation involves a mapping between input colors and output colors. However, this mapping isn't a simple, consistent arithmetic operation across all colors. It's color-specific.

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

Given the inconsistencies between the two examples, a more generalized, data-driven approach is necessary. We'll create a color mapping based on *all* observed input-output pairs.

1.  **Build a Color Map:** Iterate through the example input and output grids. For each corresponding cell, record the input color and its corresponding output color in a dictionary.
2.  **Apply Mapping:** For a new input grid, iterate through each cell. Look up the input color in the color map. If a mapping exists, apply it to the corresponding output cell. If no mapping exists, we have two options that we should try, (1) keep the same color (2) assign black (or zero).

**Python Module**

```python
"""
The transformation rule involves a color substitution based on a mapping
derived from example input-output pairs. The spatial structure is preserved.
If an input color is encountered that wasn't seen in the examples,
it defaults to keeping the original color.
"""

import numpy as np

def build_color_map(example_inputs, example_outputs):
    """Builds a color mapping dictionary from example input/output pairs."""
    color_map = {}
    for input_grid, output_grid in zip(example_inputs, example_outputs):
        for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
            for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
                input_color = input_grid[i, j]
                output_color = output_grid[i, j]
                color_map[input_color] = output_color
    return color_map

def transform(input_grid, color_map):
    """
    Transforms the input grid into the output grid by applying a color substitution
    based on the provided color_map.

    Args:
        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.
        color_map (dict):  A dictionary mapping input colors to output colors

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The transformed output grid.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            # Get the color of the current cell.
            input_color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Apply the color substitution if mapping is known.
            output_color = color_map.get(input_color, input_color) # Default: Keep original

            # Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
            output_grid[i, j] = output_color

    return output_grid

```

**Key Improvements and Considerations**

*   **Data-Driven:** The `build_color_map` function creates the mapping directly from the examples, avoiding hardcoding.
*   **Handles Unknown Colors:** The `.get(input_color, input_color)` in the `transform` function handles cases where an input color has no corresponding mapping in the `color_map`.  The default behavior will be keeping the same color.
*   **Flexibility:** This code is now more adaptable to various color-substitution tasks, as long as the spatial structure is preserved.
*   **Multiple Examples:** The code explicitly handles multiple example input/output pairs in `build_color_map`. This is essential for robust learning.

**How to Use**

1.  **Gather Examples:** Create `numpy` arrays for all your example input and output grids.
2.  **Build the Map:**
    ```python
    example_inputs = [example_1_input, example_2_input]  # Your example input arrays
    example_outputs = [example_1_output, example_2_output] # Your example output arrays
    color_map = build_color_map(example_inputs, example_outputs)
    ```
3.  **Transform:**
    ```python
    new_input = np.array([[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]) # Some new input
    output_grid = transform(new_input, color_map)
    print(output_grid)
    ```

This revised approach provides a much more robust and generalizable solution to the color-substitution problem, directly addressing the inconsistencies observed in the initial examples. It also lays the groundwork for handling more complex transformations in the future.
