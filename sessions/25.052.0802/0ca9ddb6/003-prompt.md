The transformation rule involves preserving the original single-cell objects and introducing new objects of different colors around them in specific patterns. Yellow cells surround the red cell, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cell.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
