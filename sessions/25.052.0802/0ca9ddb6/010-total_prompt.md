Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  size: (9, 9)
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
      shape: four single cells
    - color: 7
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: L-shape plus cells
  size: (9, 9)
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** In the input grid, we have two single-cell objects: one red (color 2) at position (3, 2) and one blue (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Preserve Key Objects:** The red (color 2) and blue (color 1) objects from the input are preserved in the output grid in the same positions.

3.  **Introduce New Objects around Original Positions:**
    *   Around the red object (color 2), four instances of yellow object (color 4) are placed at the following relative positions: one cell up and one cell left, one cell up and one cell right, one cell down and one cell left, and one cell down and one cell right. These positions would correspond to (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 3) in the grid.

    *   Around the blue object (color 1), a cross, or "plus" shape made of the orange color (color 7) is introduced, centered at the original blue cell's location (6, 6). This shape consists of the following cells: (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6).

4. **Background:** The rest of the cells remain unchanged (color 0).

**Summary of the rule**

The transformation rule involves preserving the original single-cell objects and introducing new objects of different colors around them in specific patterns. Yellow cells surround the red cell, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cell.

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** The input grid has several single-cell objects of colors 8, 2, and 1.

2.  **Preserve Key Objects:** The single-cell objects of colors 8, 2 and 1 from the input are preserved in the output grid at their original positions.

3.  **Introduce New Objects around Original Positions (Conditionally):**
    *   Around each red object (color 2), four instances of yellow object (color 4) are placed: one cell up and one cell left, one cell up and one cell right, one cell down and one cell left, and one cell down and one cell right, *if possible within the grid boundaries*.

    *   Around each blue object (color 1), orange cells (color 7) are placed to form a "plus" shape *if possible within the grid boundaries*. One cell up, down, left and right.

4.  **Background:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged (color 0).

**Summary of the rule**

The transformation rule involves preserving the original single-cell objects (colors 8, 2, and 1) and introducing new objects of different colors around the 2 and 1 colored cells, in specific patterns, taking boundaries into account. Yellow cells surround the red cells, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cells.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the third example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (2, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (7, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 6
      position: (5, 6)
      shape: single cell
  size: (9, 9)
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (2, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (7, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 6
      position: (5, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      positions: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)]
      shape: four single cells
    - color: 7
      positions: [(6, 3), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 3)]
      shape: L-shape plus cells
  size: (9, 9)
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** In the input grid, we have three single-cell objects: one red (color 2) at (2, 2), one blue (color 1) at (7, 3), and one magenta (color 6) at (5, 6).

2.  **Preserve Key Objects:** The red (color 2), blue (color 1), and magenta (color 6) objects from the input are preserved in the output grid in their original positions.

3.  **Introduce New Objects around Specific Original Positions:**
    *   Around the red object (color 2), four instances of yellow object (color 4) are placed at the following relative positions to the original cell: one cell up and one cell left, one cell up and one cell right, one cell down and one cell left, and one cell down and one cell right. These positions would correspond to (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3) in the grid.

    *   Around the blue object (color 1), a "plus" shape of orange cells (color 7) is introduced, centered at the original blue cell's location (7, 3). This shape consists of the following cells: (6, 3), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 3).

4.  **Magenta Object Behavior:** The magenta object (color 6) does not trigger any new object creation around it, nor is modified. It simply persists.

5.  **Background:** The rest of the cells remain unchanged (color 0).

**Summary of the rule**

The transformation rule involves preserving all the original single-cell objects and introducing new objects of different colors around *some* of them, namely the Red (2) and Blue(1) colored cells, in specific patterns, ignoring others (Magenta (6)). Yellow cells surround the red cell, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cell.

This aligns with the refined understanding of object persistence and the introduction of specific patterns based on object color, matching precisely the provided Python implementation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python
