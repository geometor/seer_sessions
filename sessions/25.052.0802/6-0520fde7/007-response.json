Fill with 0.\n  - Change color of vertical line to 2.\n  - Copy vertical line into the *middle* column of the output.\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify a Vertical Line:** Search the input grid for a contiguous vertical line composed of three cells of color 5 (gray).\n\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a 3x3 output grid filled entirely with color 0 (white).\n\n3.  **Transform and Place Line:** If a vertical line of color 5 is found in the input:\n    *   Change the color of this line to color 2 (red).\n    *   Place the now red-colored, 3-cell vertical line in the *center* column of the output grid. The row position is preserved, so if line starts in Row 0, it will start in Row 0 of the output.\n\n4. **No Line Found:** If no such vertical line is found, the output remains a 3x3 grid of color 0.\n\n**Explanation of the Issue and Previous Code**\n\nThe previous Python code had two major issues, exposed by example 1:\n1.  **Incorrect column placement:** The previous code calculated column offset, trying to mirror the input's relative x position. The instructions and data shows that the transformed red line should ALWAYS appear on the center column.\n2.  **Incorrect placement within the line:** It assumed that the vertical line would always be placed at the top of the output grid.\n\nThe core problem is making sure the vertical line goes in the *middle* column of the output, and making sure the row positioning is correct.\n"
