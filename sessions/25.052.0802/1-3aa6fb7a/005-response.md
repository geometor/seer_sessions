Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   There are four distinct objects of color 8 (azure).
    *   One is a horizontal line of length 2 at row 0, columns 4 and 5.
    *   One is a vertical line of length 2 at row 2 and 3, column 2.
    *   One is a single cell at row 1, column 5.
    * One is a vertical line at row 5 and 6, and column 4

*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The azure objects (color 8) remain in their original positions and shapes.
    *   Three new cells with color 1 (blue) appear.
      * One is to the left of the horizontal line object at [0,3]
      * One is to the right of the vertical line object at [3,3]
      * One is to the left of the second vertical line object at [5,3]
    * The single azure cell at \[1,5] is kept, but no blue cell appears next to it.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects composed of color 8 (azure).
2.  **Preserve Objects:** Keep all azure objects in their original positions and shapes.
3.  **Check for lines:** For each azure object, determine if it's a vertical or horizontal line (length greater than 1).
4.  **Conditional Blue Cell Addition:**
    *   If the object is a horizontal line, add a blue cell (color 1) to its left.
    *   If the object is a vertical line, add a blue cell (color 1) to its right.
    *   If it's not a line (e.g. single cell), make no change.

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The transformation preserves azure (8) objects. It adds a blue cell (1) to the left of horizontal azure lines and to the right of vertical azure lines. Single-cell azure objects are preserved without adding any blue cells.

The program I implemented before covers this logic.
