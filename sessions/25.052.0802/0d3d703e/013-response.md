Okay, let's analyze this new example and formulate the natural language description of the transformation.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
task: 013
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The input and output grids again preserve the 3x3 structure and the three vertical lines. This is another color substitution:

*   Maroon (9) is transformed to Azure (8).
*   Yellow (4) is transformed to Green (3).
*   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  For each cell, determine its color.
3.  Apply the following color transformations based on the observed mappings:
    *   If the color is Maroon (9), change it to Azure (8).
    *   If the color is Yellow (4), change it to Green (3).
    *   If the color is Red (2), change it to Magenta (6).
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

This description is consistent with the established pattern of color substitution, maintaining spatial structure. The existing Python module, with its `build_color_map` and `transform` functions, is perfectly suited to handle this transformation *without modification*, provided we update the color map with this new example.

The concise, step-by-step natural language program captures the essence of the transformation: identify the color of each cell and, if a mapping exists for that color, apply the corresponding transformation to the output cell, otherwise keep the original color.
