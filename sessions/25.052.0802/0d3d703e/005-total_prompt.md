Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (green, blue, and red). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (yellow, gray, and magenta). Each color in the input is consistently mapped to a different color in the output:

-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
-   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

The transformation rule can be described as a simple color substitution, maintaining the shape and position of the objects while adding 1 to the object id (color) in the input data.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3.  Increase the color value, obtaining the new color for the output
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.


```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:
- Green (3) -> Yellow (4)
- Blue (1) -> Gray (5)
- Red (2) -> Magenta (6)
Essentially, we add 1 to input_color to get output color.
The structure of the grid remains identical.

    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            # Get the color of the current cell.
            input_color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Apply the color substitution:  output_color = input_color + 1
            output_color = input_color + 1

            # Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
            output_grid[i, j] = output_color

    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
