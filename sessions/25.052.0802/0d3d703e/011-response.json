            "text": "Okay, I understand the task and the error encountered. The error message \"transform() missing 1 required positional argument: 'color_map'\" clearly indicates that the `transform` function was called without providing the `color_map` argument. This happened because the testing code did not create and pass the `color_map` to this function.\n\nHere's the natural language description of the transformation, followed by an analysis of the provided code and a revised usage example reflecting what I must do in the next steps:\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule)**\n\n1.  **Observe and Map Colors:** For each example pair, iterate through every cell in the input grid and its corresponding cell in the output grid. Note the color in the input cell and the color in the corresponding output cell. Create a mapping (dictionary) where the input color is the key and the output color is the value.\n\n2.  **Apply Color Mapping:** For any given input grid, create a new output grid of the same size. For each cell in the input grid, look up its color in the color mapping created in step 1.\n\n    *   If the color is found in the mapping, place the corresponding mapped color into the same position in the output grid.\n    *   If the color is *not* found in the mapping, place the original input color into the same position in the output grid.\n\n**Analysis of the provided Python Code**\nThe python code provided accurately implements the logic described above.\n\n*   `build_color_map`: This function correctly creates the color mapping dictionary by iterating through the example input/output pairs.\n*   `transform`: This function correctly applies the color mapping to transform an input grid to an output grid. It handles the case where a color is not found in the map by keeping the original color, as specified.\n\n**Next Step Instructions Summary:**\nI must prepare complete usage examples by instantiating a color_map, and then invoke transform() passing both the input_grid and color_map as arguments.\n"
