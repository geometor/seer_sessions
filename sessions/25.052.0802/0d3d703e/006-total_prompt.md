Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 5 (gray)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (green, blue, and red). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (yellow, gray, and magenta). Each color in the input is consistently mapped to a different color in the output:

-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
-   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

The transformation rule can be described as a simple color substitution, maintaining the shape and position of the objects while adding 1 to the object id (color) in the input data.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3.  Increase the color value, obtaining the new color for the output
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.


```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:
- Green (3) -> Yellow (4)
- Blue (1) -> Gray (5)
- Red (2) -> Magenta (6)
Essentially, we add 1 to input_color to get output color.
The structure of the grid remains identical.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
task: 005
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 3 (green)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line

    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line

    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 3
      shape: vertical line
      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Similar to the first example, the input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (red, green, and azure). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (magenta, yellow, and maroon). The transformation appears to be another color substitution:

-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).
-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
-   Azure (8) is transformed to Maroon (9).

This transformation rule, however, is not simple as adding one to the value. It maintains the shape and position of the objects, but the color mapping is different: +4, +1, +1.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  For each cell, identify its color.
3. Apply the following color changes:
    -   If the color is Red (2), change it to Magenta (6).
    -   If the color is Green (3), change it to Yellow (4).
    -   If the color is Azure (8), change it to Maroon (9).
4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:
- Red (2) -> Magenta (6)
- Green (3) -> Yellow (4)
- Azure (8) -> Maroon (9)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
