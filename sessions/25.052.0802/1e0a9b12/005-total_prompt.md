Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Documentation of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      notes: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [(2, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 12
      notes: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 1
      positions: [(2,1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains five distinct objects based on color: white (0, background), yellow (4), maroon (9), magenta (6), and blue (1).

2.  **Predicate Identification:**
    *   The colored objects, yellow, maroon, magenta and blue are significant, non-backgound cells.
    * The objects maintain their colors across the transformation.

3. **Action/Transformation:**
   *  All the non-white cells are moved to the last row, maintaining the column from which they came.
   *  One of the yellow colored cell disapears.

**Natural Language Program**
1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. For each column, record the presence and color of any non-white cell.
3. Clear the input, leaving only the white cells.
4. Construct the output grid by placing these recorded colors in the last row.


```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. For each column, record the presence and color of any non-white cell.
3. Clear the input, leaving only the white cells.
4. Construct the output grid by placing these recorded colors in the last row.

    maintaining their original column order.

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, then filled with white (0).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
