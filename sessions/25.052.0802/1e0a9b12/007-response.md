Okay, let's analyze the observed transformation and refine the natural language program to accurately capture the rule.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Cells:** Examine each column in the input grid to find cells that are not white (color code 0).

2.  **Record and Preserve:** For each column, as soon as a non-white cell is found, record its color. It is only the first non-white cell for each column.

3. **Translate to last row:** move the set of recorded colors to the last row of the output grid. The order of colors in a column are maintained.

4.  **Clear other rows:** Set all cells in the rows above to be white.

**Explanation of the previous error and adjustments**
The error in the first example arises because there were cells that were not set to white.

I have improved the description.
