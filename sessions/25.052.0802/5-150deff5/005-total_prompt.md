Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 5 (gray)
        shape: irregular, composed of multiple connected components
        position: starts at row 2, column 3
        notes: |
          The gray object appears to be a combination of smaller
          rectangles, or it is moving along a path.
    - background:
        color: 0 (white)

  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Similar to the input, but some parts replaced by color 2
        position: Replaces the initial parts of the gray shape
        notes: Retains a portion of object_1 shape.
    - object_2:
        color: 2 (red)
        shape: replaces the rest of the color 5 input.
        position: fills the final components of object_1.
        notes: completes the action
    - background:
        color: 0 (white)

```

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-step transformation):**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous region of color 5 (gray) in the input grid. This serves as our primary object.

2.  **Trace and Recolour (Part 1):** The first part of the shape made with colour 5 is replaced by colour 8.

3.  **Trace and Recolour (Part 2):** The final part of the shape made with colour 5 is replaced by colour 2.

4.  **Background Preservation:** The cells with color 0 (white) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Overall Description**
The gray shape (color 5) present in the input is recolored. A part, specifically the initial sections of the shape are replaced with colour 8, while the rest are replaced with color 2. The white background is preserved.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
