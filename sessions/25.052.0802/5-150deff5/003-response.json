A way to ensure a consistent order is by sorting coordinates first by row and then by column.\n    *   Recolor a subset of the cells in the gray object to azure (color 8), and another to red(color 2).\n    *    The specific cells to replace are determined by the coordinates in the `output_grid`.\n\n3.  **Preserve Background:** The white background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**Analysis of the Previous Attempt and Error**\n\nThe original code has a key problem. It does recolor most of the gray shape to color 8, but the problem are the hardcoded indexes that replace colors to 2. This will not work in general for all inputs. Also, the provided description do not specify correctly the recoloring actions, as the order matters.\n\n**Revised Description**\nThe gray object (color 5) is partially recolored. Most part is replaced with azure (color 8), and certain cells are replaced with red (color 2). The white background is preserved.\n"
