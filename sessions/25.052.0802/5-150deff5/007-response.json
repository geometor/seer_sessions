This approach is inflexible and won't generalize to other examples. The core issue lies in the way that segments were divided, since a general rule to separate both subsections was not present, and the incorrect red segment indices are hardcoded.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Improve my updated natural language program by adding a new step.\n2. Transform the natural language steps into Python Code.\n"
