These positions would correspond to (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 3) in the grid.\n\n    *   Around the blue object (color 1), a cross, or \"plus\" shape made of the orange color (color 7) is introduced, centered at the original blue cell's location (6, 6). This shape consists of the following cells: (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6).\n\n4. **Background:** The rest of the cells remain unchanged (color 0).\n\n**Summary of the rule**\n\nThe transformation rule involves preserving the original single-cell objects and introducing new objects of different colors around them in specific patterns. Yellow cells surround the red cell, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cell.\n"
