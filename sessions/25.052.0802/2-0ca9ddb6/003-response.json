            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided example and the initial attempt at the Python code.\n\n**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.\n\n2.  **Red Cell (2) Processing:**\n    *   Locate single-cell red objects (cells with a value of 2).\n    *   For each red cell found:\n        *   Place a yellow cell (value 4) diagonally adjacent to the red cell in all four diagonal directions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n        *   Ensure not to go out of bounds of the grid.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell (1) Processing:**\n    *   Locate single-cell blue objects (cells with a value of 1).\n    *   For each blue cell:\n        * Place an orange cell in the cells that form an horizontal and vertical line centered on the blue cell.\n        * Ensure that output grid cells set to orange (7) respect boundary conditions.\n        * Ensure to keep the blue cell, changing it to orange.\n\n4. **Gray Cell (6) Processing:**\n    * Locate single-cell gray objects (cells with value of 6).\n    * Preserve these cells without changing or adding anything.\n    * Ensure to keep them.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid, after processing all red and blue cells, becomes the final output grid.\n\n**Summary of Objects, Predicates, and Actions:**\n\n*   **Objects:** Single-cell red objects (2), single-cell blue objects (1), single-cell gray object (6), yellow cells (4), orange cells (7).\n*   **Predicates:**\n    *   `is_red(cell)`: Checks if a cell is red (value 2).\n    *   `is_blue(cell)`: Checks if a cell is blue (value 1).\n    *   `is_gray(cell)`: Checks if a cell is gray (value 6).\n    *   `is_within_bounds(row, col)`: Checks if a given row and column are within the grid boundaries.\n*   **Actions:**\n    *   `place_yellow(row, col)`: Places a yellow cell (4) at the specified location.\n    * `place_orange(row, col)`: Places an orange cell (7) at the specified position.\n    * `copy_value(input_row, intput_col, output_row, output_col)`: Copy value.\n\n**Key Improvements over Previous Code (Explanation)**\nThe main problem with the transformed output is the central blue cell which turns into orange.\n\nI have rewritten completely the natural language program to be sure of covering all cases.\n"
