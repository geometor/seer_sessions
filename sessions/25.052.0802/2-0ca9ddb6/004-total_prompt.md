"""
The transformation rule involves preserving the original single-cell objects and introducing new objects of different colors around them in specific patterns. Yellow cells surround the red cell, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cell.

    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

Status: False
Okay, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided example and the initial attempt at the Python code.

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step Transformation):**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.

2.  **Red Cell (2) Processing:**
    *   Locate single-cell red objects (cells with a value of 2).
    *   For each red cell found:
        *   Place a yellow cell (value 4) diagonally adjacent to the red cell in all four diagonal directions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
        *   Ensure not to go out of bounds of the grid.

3.  **Blue Cell (1) Processing:**
    *   Locate single-cell blue objects (cells with a value of 1).
    *   For each blue cell:
        * Place an orange cell in the cells that form an horizontal and vertical line centered on the blue cell.
        * Ensure that output grid cells set to orange (7) respect boundary conditions.
        * Ensure to keep the blue cell, changing it to orange.

4. **Gray Cell (6) Processing:**
    * Locate single-cell gray objects (cells with value of 6).
    * Preserve these cells without changing or adding anything.
    * Ensure to keep them.

5.  **Final Output:** The modified grid, after processing all red and blue cells, becomes the final output grid.

**Summary of Objects, Predicates, and Actions:**

*   **Objects:** Single-cell red objects (2), single-cell blue objects (1), single-cell gray object (6), yellow cells (4), orange cells (7).
*   **Predicates:**
    *   `is_red(cell)`: Checks if a cell is red (value 2).
    *   `is_blue(cell)`: Checks if a cell is blue (value 1).
    *   `is_gray(cell)`: Checks if a cell is gray (value 6).
    *   `is_within_bounds(row, col)`: Checks if a given row and column are within the grid boundaries.
*   **Actions:**
    *   `place_yellow(row, col)`: Places a yellow cell (4) at the specified location.
    * `place_orange(row, col)`: Places an orange cell (7) at the specified position.
    * `copy_value(input_row, intput_col, output_row, output_col)`: Copy value.

**Key Improvements over Previous Code (Explanation)**
The main problem with the transformed output is the central blue cell which turns into orange.

I have rewritten completely the natural language program to be sure of covering all cases.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
