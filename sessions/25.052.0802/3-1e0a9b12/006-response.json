Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2. For each column, record the presence and color of any non-white cell.\n3. Clear the input, leaving only the white cells.\n4. Construct the output grid by placing these recorded colors in the last row.\n\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2. For each column, record the presence and color of any non-white cell.\n3. Clear the input, leaving only the white cells.\n4. Construct the output grid by placing these recorded colors in the last row.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-white cells to the last row,\n    maintaining their original column order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, then filled with white (0).\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n        # Find the non-white cell in the current column.\n        for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                # Place the color of the non-white cell in the last row of the output grid.\n                output_grid[-1, j] = input_grid[i, j]\n                break  # only one move per column\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
