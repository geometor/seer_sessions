Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Documentation of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001
input_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 10
      notes: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 2
      positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(0, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [(2, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]

output_grid:
  size: 4x4
  objects:
    - color: 0 (white)
      count: 12
      notes: background
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      count: 1
      positions: [(2,1)]
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 3)]
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 2)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      count: 1
      position: [(3, 0)]
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains five distinct objects based on color: white (0, background), yellow (4), maroon (9), magenta (6), and blue (1).

2.  **Predicate Identification:**
    *   The colored objects, yellow, maroon, magenta and blue are significant, non-backgound cells.
    * The objects maintain their colors across the transformation.

3. **Action/Transformation:**
   *  All the non-white cells are moved to the last row, maintaining the column from which they came.
   *  One of the yellow colored cell disapears.

**Natural Language Program**
1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. For each column, record the presence and color of any non-white cell.
3. Clear the input, leaving only the white cells.
4. Construct the output grid by placing these recorded colors in the last row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
