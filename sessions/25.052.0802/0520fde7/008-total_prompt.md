The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the vertical line of color 5 in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0s.
3. Transform the identified vertical line from color 5 to color 2.
4. Place this transformed line into the output grid, maintaining its vertical orientation and relative position.
5. Ensure all other cells in the output grid remain color 0.

Train Set Results:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```
Expected Output:
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```
Transformed Output:
```
0 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 0
```

Status: False
Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation and a revised natural language description:

**Initial Observations and YAML Summary**

```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid to a smaller output grid based on the presence and position of a vertical line of a specific color.

input_objects:
  - vertical_line:
      color: 5
      shape: vertical line
      size: 3x1

output_objects:
  - vertical_line:
      color: 2
      shape: vertical line
      size: 3x1

transformations:
  - Find a vertical line of color 5 in the input.
  - Create 3x3 output. Fill with 0.
  - Change color of vertical line to 2.
  - Copy vertical line into the *middle* column of the output.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify a Vertical Line:** Search the input grid for a contiguous vertical line composed of three cells of color 5 (gray).

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a 3x3 output grid filled entirely with color 0 (white).

3.  **Transform and Place Line:** If a vertical line of color 5 is found in the input:
    *   Change the color of this line to color 2 (red).
    *   Place the now red-colored, 3-cell vertical line in the *center* column of the output grid. The row position is preserved, so if line starts in Row 0, it will start in Row 0 of the output.

4. **No Line Found:** If no such vertical line is found, the output remains a 3x3 grid of color 0.

**Explanation of the Issue and Previous Code**

The previous Python code had two major issues, exposed by example 1:
1.  **Incorrect column placement:** The previous code calculated column offset, trying to mirror the input's relative x position. The instructions and data shows that the transformed red line should ALWAYS appear on the center column.
2.  **Incorrect placement within the line:** It assumed that the vertical line would always be placed at the top of the output grid.

The core problem is making sure the vertical line goes in the *middle* column of the output, and making sure the row positioning is correct.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
