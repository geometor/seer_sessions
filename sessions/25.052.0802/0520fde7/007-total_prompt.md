The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the vertical line of color 5 in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0s.
3. Transform the identified vertical line from color 5 to color 2.
4. Place this transformed line into the output grid, maintaining its vertical orientation and relative position.
5. Ensure all other cells in the output grid remain color 0.

Train Set Results:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```
Expected Output:
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```
Transformed Output:
```
0 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 0
```

Status: False
**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
