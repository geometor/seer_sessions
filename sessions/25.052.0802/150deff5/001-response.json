This serves as our primary object.\n\n2.  **Trace and Recolour (Part 1):** The first part of the shape made with colour 5 is replaced by colour 8.\n\n3.  **Trace and Recolour (Part 2):** The final part of the shape made with colour 5 is replaced by colour 2.\n\n4.  **Background Preservation:** The cells with color 0 (white) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**Overall Description**\nThe gray shape (color 5) present in the input is recolored. A part, specifically the initial sections of the shape are replaced with colour 8, while the rest are replaced with color 2. The white background is preserved.\n"
