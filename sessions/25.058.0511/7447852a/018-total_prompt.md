Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a rule that changes white pixels to yellow if they are horizontally or vertically adjacent to a red pixel. The provided code's logic correctly handles the first example. However, by testing it against other examples, we will gather insights into the deficiencies. The core strategy is to iteratively refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code, based on discrepancies found in the execution results on additional training examples. We need to look for consistent patterns of how red and white pixels, and maybe other colored pixels, are related across *all* training examples.

**Gather Metrics and Results**

To accurately assess the code's performance, I need to see the input and output grids, as well as the expected output grids, for each training example. Since I can't directly execute code, I will describe the hypothetical outputs based on the provided description. If the environment allows for code execution, I'd create functions for comparing the results, counting differences, etc.

I will make an assumption - the initial code *only* worked for example 1. Subsequent examples revealed the deficiencies.

**Example Analysis (Hypothetical, Assuming Failure on Examples 2 and 3)**

*   **Example 1:** (Assumed Success)
    *   Input: (Described in previous turn - contains red and white pixels)
    *   Expected Output: White pixels adjacent to red become yellow.
    *   Actual Output: Matches expected output.
    *   Analysis: The code works as intended for this specific case.

*   **Example 2:** (Hypothetical - Assumed Failure)
    *   Input: Let's assume there are red, white, and blue pixels. White pixels adjacent to red *diagonally* become yellow.
    *   Expected Output: Diagonally adjacent white pixels should be yellow.
    *   Actual Output: Only horizontally/vertically adjacent white pixels are yellow.
    *   Analysis: The code fails to account for diagonal adjacency.

*   **Example 3:** (Hypothetical - Assumed Failure)
     *   Input: Assume white pixels surrounded by red on opposite ends are affected.
     *   Expected Output: White pixels are affected only by the presence of red on at least *two* non-adjacent sides.
     *   Actual Output: All white adjacent to red on *any* side change to yellow.
     *   Analysis:  Need to incorporate more complex spatial relationships and conditions beyond direct adjacency.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary colors involved are red, white, and yellow.
  - object_interaction: |
      Red pixels influence the color of white pixels.
  - condition_1: |
      In the first example, horizontal or vertical adjacency to a red pixel causes a white pixel to become yellow.
  - condition_2: |
      Hypothetically, diagonal adjacency may also be a factor.
  - condition_3: |
       Hypothetically, more complex spatial relationships involving multiple red pixels may need to be considered.
  - transformation: |
      White pixels can change to yellow. Red pixels remain unchanged. Other color pixels remain unchanged.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value representing red (2).
2.  **Identify White Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value representing white (0).
3. **Check Adjacency to Red Pixels for Each White** For *each* white, examine its neighbors:
    - check horizontal neighbors
    - check vertical neighbors
    - **Hypothesis:** check diagonal neighbors
4.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a white pixel has red neighbor(s) meeting *some* criteria, change that
        white to yellow. The exact conditions and the nature of the neighbor
        relationship (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, surrounding) is determined
        by analyzing *all* example pairs.
    *   All red pixels must be copied to output as red
    *   all other pixels, not white or red, must be copied to the output unchanged

The initial program focused too narrowly on simple horizontal/vertical adjacency. The revised program acknowledges the *possibility* of more complex spatial relationships, and more complex adjacency requirements, including diagonal, by stating clearly that *all* examples must be considered to complete the rule for transforming white to yellow based on properties of red and their proximity.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
