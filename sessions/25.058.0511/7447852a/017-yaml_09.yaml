facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary colors involved are red, white, and yellow.
  - object_interaction: |
      Red pixels influence the color of white pixels.
  - condition_1: |
      In the first example, horizontal or vertical adjacency to a red pixel causes a white pixel to become yellow.
  - condition_2: |
      Hypothetically, diagonal adjacency may also be a factor.
  - condition_3: |
       Hypothetically, more complex spatial relationships involving multiple red pixels may need to be considered.
  - transformation: |
      White pixels can change to yellow. Red pixels remain unchanged. Other color pixels remain unchanged.
