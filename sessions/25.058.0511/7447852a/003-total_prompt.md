Previous Code:
```python
"""
Examine the input grid. The red (2) pixels are the focus.
If a red pixel is immediately adjacent to a red pixel, it might turn to yellow (4), either horizontally or vertically.
If a red pixel has a direct horizontal or vertical neighbor, that is also red, under the following condition:
- if a red pixel is on the edge, it will have at maximum, 2 vertical or 2 horizontal neighbours
- if a red pixel is in the middle, it will have at maximum, 1 horizontal or 1 vertical neighbours.
- if a red pixel satisfy any of these condition, it is converted to yellow (4).
Create the output grid by copying the input grid, changing some red (2) to yellow(4), according to previous rules. All other pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
