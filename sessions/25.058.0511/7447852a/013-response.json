The input grid contains the colors red (2) and white (0). The output grid introduces a new color, yellow (4), while retaining some reds and whites from the input. The positions of the red pixels seem to influence the placement of the yellow pixels. The shape and size of input and output grids are same.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
