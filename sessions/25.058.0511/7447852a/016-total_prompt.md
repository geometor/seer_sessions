Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterates through the input grid, identifies red (2) pixels, and checks their immediate horizontal neighbors.
If a neighbor is white (0), it's replaced with yellow (4) in the output grid.
All original red (2) pixels are copied to output unchanged.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output grid as a copy of input

    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each cell
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check for red pixels
            if input_grid[i, j] == 2:
                # Check left neighbor
                if j > 0 and input_grid[i, j - 1] == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j - 1] = 4
                # Check right neighbor
                if j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i, j + 1] == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j + 1] = 4

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on replacing white (0) pixels adjacent to red (2) pixels with yellow (4). This rule works for the first training example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule is too narrow. It only considers horizontal adjacency and doesn't account for other potential relationships or conditions present in the other examples.  We need to broaden our understanding of the transformation by considering all training examples. The provided code is a reasonable *starting point* and correctly identifies one aspect (changing _some_ white pixels to yellow) and a relevant object (red pixels), but it misses the complete picture of how/why the changes are made.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We'll meticulously examine each input-output pair, noting:
    *   The locations of red pixels.
    *   The locations of white and yellow pixels *before and after* the transformation.
    *   The spatial relationships between red, white, and yellow pixels.
    * Any patterns regarding shapes and connectivity.
    * Consider if the operation involves mirroring, rotating, or translating

2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll adjust the initial hypothesis (red pixels cause adjacent white pixels to turn yellow) to incorporate new observations.

3.  **Natural Language Program Update:**  We'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the observed transformation.

4.  **Code Execution for Metrics:** We can add a code cell that will be executed in
    the next iteration to help clarify aspects of the transformation, for
    example count the number of red, white and yellow pixels.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example.  I'll refer to input grids as `input_grid` and output grids as `output_grid`.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `input_grid`: One red pixel at (0, 1). White pixels at (0, 0) and (0, 2).
    *   `output_grid`: White pixels at (0, 0) and (0, 2) are now yellow.
    *   *Observation:* The initial code correctly handles this case. Horizontal adjacency to red turns white to yellow.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   `input_grid`: One red pixel at (1, 1). White pixels surround it at (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1).
    *   `output_grid`: All surrounding white pixels are now yellow.
    *   *Observation:*  The rule extends to vertical adjacency. The red pixel is "coloring" all adjacent white pixels.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   `input_grid`: Red pixels form a vertical line: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3). White pixels are adjacent to this line.
    *   `output_grid`: All white pixels adjacent to the red line (horizontally and vertically) are yellow.
    *   *Observation:* This confirms that adjacency in all four directions (up, down, left, right) matters. The *shape* of the red object doesn't appear to be a constraint – it can be a single pixel or a line.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixels
    color: red
    properties:
      - adjacency_effect: "Changes adjacent white pixels to yellow"
  - name: white_pixels
    color: white
    properties:
      - change_condition: "Adjacent to red_pixels"
      - change_to: yellow
  - name: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow
    properties: []

actions:
  - subject: red_pixels
    verb: influence
    object: white_pixels
    details: "Change color to yellow if adjacent (horizontally or vertically)"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all red pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each white pixel in the input grid, check for adjacency (horizontal or vertical) to any red pixel.
3.  If a white pixel is adjacent to any red pixel, change its color to yellow in the output grid.
4. Copy all red pixels to output grid.
5. All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
