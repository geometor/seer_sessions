```python
"""
Examine the input grid. The red (2) pixels are the focus.
If a red pixel is immediately adjacent to a red pixel, it might turn to yellow (4), either horizontally or vertically.
If a red pixel has a direct horizontal or vertical neighbor, that is also red, under the following condition:
- if a red pixel is on the edge, it will have at maximum, 2 vertical or 2 horizontal neighbours
- if a red pixel is in the middle, it will have at maximum, 1 horizontal or 1 vertical neighbours.
- if a red pixel satisfy any of these condition, it is converted to yellow (4).
Create the output grid by copying the input grid, changing some red (2) to yellow(4), according to previous rules. All other pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. The tests revealed discrepancies in subsequent examples, indicating that the initial rule was incomplete or incorrect. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the conditions under which red pixels transform to yellow. The adjacency rules need to be refined to reflect a more nuanced understanding of the spatial context and the interaction of red pixels.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the specific locations where the transformation rule fails. We will execute the function to debug the specific values.
2.  **Refined Adjacency Logic:** Develop a more precise description of how the number and arrangement of adjacent red pixels affect the transformation, fixing the boundary condition and the internal condition.
3.  **Iterative Testing and Adjustment:** After modifying the natural language program and code, re-test on all examples to ensure consistent results.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To better understand the errors, let's use a function to compute these metrics:
*   **Total Red Pixels:** number of red pixels in input and output
*   **Transformed:** number of pixels that should have changed from input to output
*   **Correct Change:** How many pixels were changed correctly
*   **Incorrect Change:** How many pixels were changed incorrectly,
*   **Missed Changes:** How many pixels that should have been changed were missed

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      value: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
      position: (row, column)
      adjacency: [horizontal, vertical]

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    precondition:
      - object: pixel
        property: color
        value: red
      - object: pixel
        property: adjacency
        condition: "A red pixel changes to yellow if and only if exactly two of its horizontal and vertical neighbors are red. If one or three or more of its neighbors are red, it will remain red."
    postcondition:
      - object: pixel
        property: color
        value: yellow

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy:** Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
2.  **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Identify Red:** If a pixel is red (value 2):
    a. **Count Neighbors:** Count the number of adjacent red pixels (horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally).
    b. **Apply Rule:** If a red pixel has exactly two adjacent red pixels that are horizontal and vertical neighbors, change its color to yellow (value 4) in the *output* grid.
4.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
