facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid consists of red (2) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels in addition to red and white.
  - observation: |
      The grid dimensions (height and width) are preserved in the transformation.
  - relationship: |
      Yellow pixels in the output appear in proximity to red pixels in the input.
  - pattern: |
      The placement of red pixels creates a checkerboard on a diagonal with a step of 2 cells
      within each row and column of the input grid. Yellow replaces some white pixels on the row
      above and to the left of the white cells bounded by red and the top and left of the image, and to the bottom, and
      right of the white pixels.
