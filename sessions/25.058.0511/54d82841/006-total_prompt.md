Previous Code:
```python
"""
Copy the input grid to the output grid. Then, in the last row of the output grid, add yellow pixels in the 3rd and 7th columns.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Add yellow pixels to the last row at specific columns.
    output_grid[rows - 1, 2] = 4  # 3rd column (index 2)
    output_grid[rows - 1, 6] = 4  # 7th column (index 6)

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too specific, focusing on placing yellow pixels at fixed positions in the last row. The provided examples reveal that placement of yellow pixels is dependent upon the location of black pixels in the input grid. We need to shift from absolute positioning to a relational approach.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Input-Output Pairs:** Carefully examine each input and output grid to identify the relationship between black pixels in the input and yellow pixels in the output.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Document concrete, measurable properties of black squares using code execution to get the values.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Describe the transformation rule in terms of the relationship between black pixels in the input and added yellow pixels. The current hypothesis focuses on columns.
4. **YAML documentation**

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To analyze each example, I will use a python script to get details to help understand the reasoning.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_black_pixel_columns(grid):
    """Returns a list of column indices where black pixels (value 0) are present."""
    black_pixel_columns = []
    for col in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if 0 in grid[:, col]:
            black_pixel_columns.append(col)
    return black_pixel_columns

def get_yellow_pixel_columns(grid):
    """Returns a list of column indices where yellow pixels (value 4) are present."""
    yellow_pixel_columns = []
    for col in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if 4 in grid[:, col]:
            yellow_pixel_columns.append(col)
    return yellow_pixel_columns
def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Analyzes a single input-output pair and returns relevant information."""
    
    input_black_cols = get_black_pixel_columns(input_grid)
    output_yellow_cols = get_yellow_pixel_columns(output_grid)

    analysis = {
        'input_black_cols': input_black_cols,
        'output_yellow_cols': output_yellow_cols,
    }
    return analysis

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: black_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 0 in the input grid.
    properties:
      - column_indices: List of column indices where black pixels are present.
  - object: yellow_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 4 in the output grid. Always added to the last row.
    properties:
      - column_indices: List of column indices where yellow pixels are present.
    actions:
        - copy_input_to_output: "create a copy of the input to begin building the output"
        - add_yellow: "add yellow pixels to the last row of the output"

  - relationships:
    - "If a column in the input grid has a black pixel, a yellow pixel is placed in that column in the last row."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2.  For each column in the input grid, check if it contains any black pixels.
3.  If a column contains a black pixel, place a yellow pixel in the same column of the last row of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
