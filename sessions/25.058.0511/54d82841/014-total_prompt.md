## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 4 0 0 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7B1DE5F8EAD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid transforms into the output grid, seemingly based on a rule related to the position of specific colors and the addition of a new color/element in a specific row. The primary colors involved are azure (8), magenta (6), and yellow (4), with white (0) as a background. It appears the transformation adds yellow (4) pixels to the bottom row (row index 4) of the grid, in the x-position matching white (0) pixels in the second to last row (row index 3).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 7
      colors: [0, 8, 6, 4]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        azure: 8
        magenta: 6
        yellow: 4
      position: [row_index, column_index]

actions:
  - name: add_yellow
    description: Adds yellow pixels to the last row.
    trigger: Based on white positions in second to last row
    parameters:
        row: 4 # the last row
        column: x # based on the column of white pixels in row index 3

relationships:
  - type: positional
    description:  The horizontal position of new yellow pixels is determined by the position of white pixels on the second-to-last row.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Row:** Locate the second-to-last row (index 3) of the input grid.
2.  **Find White Pixels:** Within this row, identify all pixels with the color white (value 0).
3.  **Note Columns:** Record the column indices of these white pixels.
4.  **Add Yellow Pixels:** In the *last* row (index 4) of the grid, add yellow pixels (color 4) at the column positions recorded in step 3.
5. If there are no white pixels, don't add yellow.
6. **Output Grid:** The modified grid is the output.

In essence: Yellow pixels are added to the bottom row, mirroring the horizontal positions of white pixels in the second-to-last row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
