Previous Code:
```python
"""
A single white pixel at the bottom is recolored to yellow.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Locate the specific white pixel to change: last row, middle column
    #  (adjusting for zero-based indexing).
    target_row = rows - 1
    target_col = cols // 2

    # Change the color of the target pixel to yellow (4)
    output_grid[target_row, target_col] = 4

    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
