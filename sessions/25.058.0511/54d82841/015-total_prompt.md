Previous Code:
```python
"""
Yellow pixels are added to the bottom row, mirroring the horizontal positions of white pixels in the second-to-last row.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by adding yellow pixels to the last row based on the
    positions of white pixels in the second-to-last row.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = output_grid.shape[0]
    cols = output_grid.shape[1]

    # 1. Identify Target Row: Locate the second-to-last row (index rows - 2).
    target_row = rows - 2

    # 2. Find White Pixels: Find white pixels (value 0) in the target row.
    white_pixel_cols = []
    for col in range(cols):
        if output_grid[target_row, col] == 0:
            white_pixel_cols.append(col)

    # 3. Note Columns: The white_pixel_cols list now holds the column indices.

    # 4. Add Yellow Pixels: Add yellow (4) to the last row (rows - 1) at the recorded columns.
    for col in white_pixel_cols:
        output_grid[rows - 1, col] = 4

    # 5. If there are no white, we don't hit the loop, so don't add yellow
    # 6. Output Grid: The modified grid is the output.
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
