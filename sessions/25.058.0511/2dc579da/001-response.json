The input grid appears to contain a larger, more complex pattern, while the output grid seems to be a simplified or extracted version of the input. The colors present are primarily azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4). The most notable change is the removal of the green (3) pixels and some of the azure (8) pixels, resulting in a smaller grid containing only the yellow (4) and some surrounding azure(8). It appears the transformation is extracting the bottom left corner where the color changes from 8 to a color other than 8.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
