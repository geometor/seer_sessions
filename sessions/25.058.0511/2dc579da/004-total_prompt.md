Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts a 2x2 subgrid from the bottom-left corner of the input grid,
starting at the first non-azure(8) pixel.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_bottom_left_non_8(grid):
    """Finds the row index of the bottom-most, left-most non-8 pixel."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] != 8:
                return r, c
    return None  # Should not happen in these tasks, as there's always a non-8 pixel

def transform(input_grid):
    """Extracts a 2x2 subgrid based on color change in bottom left."""
    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Find the bottom-left non-8 pixel
    start_row, start_col = find_bottom_left_non_8(input_grid)

    # Extract the 2x2 subgrid
    output_grid = input_grid[start_row-1:start_row+1, start_col:start_col+2]

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and focused on extracting a 2x2 subgrid from the bottom-left, starting at the first non-azure (8) pixel. The results indicate this approach is partially correct but needs adjustments. The core issue seems to be that the starting point of the 2x2 grid and potentially the object we are focusing on has to be refined and should maybe not consider the color azure (8) at all.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the location and values of pixels in the input versus the output.
2.  **Identify Key Objects:** Determine which object in the input is being transformed and extract that object in full.
3.  **Refine Starting Point Logic:** Re-evaluate the criteria for selecting the starting point of the extraction. It may not always be the bottom-left non-8 pixel. Look at the color and position.
4.  **Consider Size and Shape:** While many outputs are 2x2, explore if any input grids have the feature in other shapes or sizes, or if those shapes or sizes are important to the rule.
5. **Document the Process:** Write a clear description of the observed transformation rule to produce a clear program in plain language.

**Example Metrics and Observations**

I'll use `code_execution` to gather grid sizes and output content to provide an organized view of each.
I will inspect to see if the output contents exists as a perfect subset of the input grid.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape

    # Check if the output grid is a direct subgrid of the input
    is_subgrid = False
    for i in range(input_shape[0] - output_shape[0] + 1):
        for j in range(input_shape[1] - output_shape[1] + 1):
            if np.array_equal(input_grid[i:i+output_shape[0], j:j+output_shape[1]], output_grid):
                is_subgrid = True
                break
        if is_subgrid:
            break

    print(f"""
Input Shape: {input_shape}
Output Shape: {output_shape}
Output Content:
{output_grid}
Is output a direct subgrid of input: {is_subgrid}
""")

task = data['train']
for i, example in enumerate(task):
    print(f"--- Example {i+1} ---")
    analyze_example(example)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
