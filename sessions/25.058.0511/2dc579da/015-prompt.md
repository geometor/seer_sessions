Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Lines:** Locate the vertical and horizontal lines composed of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Intersection:** Determine the point where these blue lines intersect.
3. **Define Quadrant:** The intersection divides the grid into 4 quadrants conceptually, select top-left quadrant.
4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid by extracting all pixels from the original grid that fall within the top-left quadrant, *excluding* the pixels that form the intersecting blue lines.
5. **Preserve colors**: maintain all original colors.
"""

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
