The input grid is larger and contains a vertical and horizontal line of blue (1) pixels intersecting at the center. The output grid is a smaller subsection of the input grid, specifically the top-left quadrant defined by the intersection of the blue lines, excluding the blue lines themselves. There's also a single azure (8) pixel in both input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
