## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 9 2 0 0 0 0
4 4 0 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 0 0 0 0
4 0 4 4 2 0 9 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
0 4 4 4 2 0 9 0 0 2 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7B1DDE6A0A50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 4
4 4 9 4
4 9 4 4
1 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7B1DE5F8E1D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, including my perception of elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The colors present in the output grid seem to be a subset of those in the input grid, but their positions and arrangements are altered. Specifically, I see colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), and 9 (maroon) present. There's a noticeable reduction in the number of columns and the output appears to focus on a particular section of the input. The two blocks of blue 1's in the lower right hand corner of the input are gone in the output. The other values are present.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [4, 14]
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [4, 4]
      colors: [0, 1, 4, 9]
  - objects:
      - color: 0  # White
        instances_input: Multiple
        instances_output: 1
      - color: 1  # Blue
        instances_input: Multiple
        instances_output: 1
      - color: 2  # Red
        instances_input: Multiple
        instances_output: 0
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        instances_input: Multiple
        instances_output: Multiple
      - color: 9  # Maroon
        instances_input: Multiple
        instances_output: 2
  - actions:
      - type: column_selection
        description: A subset of columns from the input grid is selected.
      - type: color_preservation
        description: Only specific colors from input are retained; the others are discarded.
      - type: rearrangement
        description: objects are rearranged
  - relationships:
      - input_to_output: "Many-to-one, as the output grid is smaller and contains a subset of the input grid's elements."
      - spatial: The output seems to represent a "zoomed-in" or cropped and rearranged view of a section of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the input grid and select columns 4, 5, 9, and 3 (indexed from 0). These correspond to the first instances of colors 4, 2, 9, and 4.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create a new grid using *only* the values found in these selected columns, maintaining the original row order (top to bottom).

3.  Rearrange the grid into a square.

In essence, the transformation extracts a specific 4x4 subgrid from the input, based on selecting certain columns, and rearranges into a square grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
