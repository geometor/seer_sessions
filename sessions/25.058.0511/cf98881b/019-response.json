            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, including my perception of elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The colors present in the output grid seem to be a subset of those in the input grid, but their positions and arrangements are altered. Specifically, I see colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), and 9 (maroon) present. There's a noticeable reduction in the number of columns and the output appears to focus on a particular section of the input. The two blocks of blue 1's in the lower right hand corner of the input are gone in the output. The other values are present.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
