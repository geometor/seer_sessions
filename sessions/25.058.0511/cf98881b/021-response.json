            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against all three training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a hypothesis formed from the first training example. It correctly identified a pattern of selecting specific columns and maintaining the row order, then reforming this into a square. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the column selection logic and the square shape constraint are not universally applicable. We need to develop a more flexible and accurate description of the transformation.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on identifying consistent patterns and deviations from the initial hypothesis.\n2.  **Object Identification and Property Tracking:** Use the YAML format to record key observations about objects (contiguous blocks of the same color), their properties (color, size, position), and any actions performed on them.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis and YAML documentation, update the natural language program to reflect the generalized transformation rule.\n4. Use code execution to gather accurate data to track differences between\n   expected and actual outputs of the tranform\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nLet's use a function to gather accurate data about each example.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)\n    actual_output = np.array(actual_output)\n\n    input_shape = input_grid.shape\n    expected_shape = expected_output.shape\n    actual_shape = actual_output.shape\n\n    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output)\n\n    print(f\"  Input Shape: {input_shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected Output Shape: {expected_shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Actual Output Shape: {actual_shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Match: {match}\")\n    if not match:\n        diff = expected_output - actual_output\n        print(f\"  Difference:\\n{diff}\")\n    else:\n      print(\"  No difference\")\n\n#Example Usage\nexample_input_grids = [\n    [[3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 9]],\n    [[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]],\n    [[6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6], [6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6], [6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6]],\n\n]\n\nexample_output_grids = [\n    [[4, 2, 9, 4], [4, 2, 9, 4], [4, 2, 9, 4]],\n    [[7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]],\n    [[5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5]]\n]\n\nexample_actual_outputs = [\n    transform(example_input_grids[0]), transform(example_input_grids[1]), transform(example_input_grids[2])\n]\n\nfor i in range(len(example_input_grids)):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    analyze_results(example_input_grids[i], example_output_grids[i], example_actual_outputs[i])\n\n```\n\n**YAML Documentation and Observations**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - color: 3, shape: 3x3 rectangle\n      - color: 4, shape: 3x1 column, position: column 3\n      - color: 2, shape: 3x2 rectangle, position: column 4,5\n      - color: 8, shape: 3x3 rectangle\n      - color: 9, shape: 3x1 column, position: column 9\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - color: 4, shape: 3x1 column\n      - color: 2, shape: 3x1 column\n      - color: 9, shape: 3x1 column\n      - color: 4, shape: 3x1 column  #Duplicate color\n  action: \"Select specific columns (4,2,9) and stack.

The output has some zeros, when the colors should be 7 and 0\"\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - color: 6, shape: variable, around a main central block of 5s\n      - color: 5, shape: block that occupies most of grid\n  output:\n    objects:\n    - color: 5, shape: 5 x 4 block\n  action: \"Selects columns with color 5, result is 5 x 4 rectangle\"\n  notes: \"output width is number of distinct colors in input\"\n  result: \"Correct\"\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Unique Colors:** Determine the set of unique colors present in the input grid.\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Width:** The output grid's width equals the number of unique colors in the input grid.\n3. **Determine Output Grid Height:** The output grid's height equals the input's height.\n4.  **Column Selection:** For each row, select the pixel values of the columns corresponding to the first appearance of a unique color. If there are multiple appearances, select the leftmost instance. The order is given by the column order of first occurrence.\n5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid, preserving row order and placing selected column contents, and stack these together, left-to-right based on unique color order.\n\nThe critical changes are to derive the selection of columns by looking at the *unique colors present in the input*, and construct a new grid with height equal to the original input and a width based on the number of unique colors. The square shape is not a consistent constraint, being a consequence of the unique colors in each row.\n"
