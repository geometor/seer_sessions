"""
1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The output grid retains only the colors yellow (4), maroon (9), blue (1) and white (0).
2.  **Color Elimination:** Remove all red (2) pixels from the input.
3. **Spatial Selection**:
    *   The first column is the top-left yellow, top maroon (if they exists at the first column of the input).
    *   The second column appears to be the leftmost section of continuous yellow (4) starting from the left.
    * The third column is composed of 0, 9, 1, 4 from the input where 0 are to the left of 9, 9 are above another 9, and 1 are above another 1, and 4 are under 1.
    * The forth column seems to take the last column of the largest continuous yellow section (at the forth row).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code captured some aspects of the transformation, particularly the color filtering and some elements of spatial selection. However, the results on the other training examples show significant discrepancies, especially in columns 2, 3 and 4. This indicates that the spatial selection rules, particularly for those columns, are not correctly generalized.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** For each example, pinpoint exactly where the output differs from the expected output, noting the row, column, and expected vs. actual values.
2.  **Object Identification:** Accurately identify all relevant objects (contiguous regions of the same color) in both input and output grids. Pay close attention to yellow and maroon objects, as these seem to be key.
3.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the error analysis and object identification, adjust the rules for each column, especially focusing on how the objects in the input relate to the cells in the output. The rules for columns 2, 3, and 4 need the most work.
4. **Consider alternative hypothesis**: It is likely that the rules for column selection and color filtering are incorrect and that the size of output is fixed to 4x4 based on the examples.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Analysis**

**YAML Facts**
```yaml
task:
  name: "Color and Spatial Pattern Extraction"
  overall_strategy: "Determine a consistent rule set for extracting and arranging specific colors and patterns into a 4x4 grid."
  observations:
    - The output grid is always 4x4.
    - Only colors 0, 1, 4, and 9 are present in the output.
    - Red (2) is always eliminated.
    - Column 1:
        - Contains a 4 if yellow exists in input, 9 if there is maroon in the first column of input and 0 otherwise.
    - Column 2:
        -  Contains 4 in every row where there is a horizontal line of yellow in the input. Otherwise 0.
    - Column 3:
        - If there's a configuration in the input where a 0 is immediately to the left of a 9, the output at [0,2] is 0.
        - If there is a 9 above 9, the output in [1,2] is 9.
        - If there is a 1 above 1, the output in [2,2] is 1.
        - If there is 4 under 1, the output in [3,2] is 4
    - Column 4:
        - Contains 4 if there is a line of at least one yellow in the fourth row of the input, at that row. Otherwise 0.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 4x4 output grid filled with zeros.
2.  **Color Filtering:** Remove all pixels of color 2 (red) from the input. Any other color becomes 0 in input.
3.  **Column 1 Logic:**
    *   If there's a yellow (4) anywhere in the filtered input, place a 4 in the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output.
    * If there is a maroon (9) in the first column of the input, place a 9 in the top-left cell (0,0) of the output.
    * Otherwise the top-left cell remains zero.
4.  **Column 2 Logic:**
    *   For each row (from 0 to 3), check if there's a continuous horizontal line of yellow (4) in the *input* grid at that row.
    *  If a horizontal line of yellow exist in the *input* for any row, set all values for column 2 of the output to 4.
5.  **Column 3 Logic:**
    *   Examine specific spatial relationships in the *input* grid:
        *   If a 0 is immediately to the left of a 9, set output\[0, 2] to 0.
        *   If a 9 is directly above another 9, set output\[1, 2] to 9.
        *   If a 1 is directly above another 1, set output\[2, 2] to 1.
        * If a 4 is directly below a 1, set output[3,2] to 4.
6.  **Column 4 Logic:**
    *  If row 4 (index 3) of input has a yellow, set all rows of column 4 to 4.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
