"""
1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The output grid retains only the colors yellow (4), maroon (9), blue (1) and white (0).
2.  **Color Elimination:** Remove all red (2) pixels from the input.
3. **Spatial Selection**:
    *   The first column is the top-left yellow, top maroon (if they exists at the first column of the input).
    *   The second column appears to be the leftmost section of continuous yellow (4) starting from the left.
    * The third column is composed of 0, 9, 1, 4 from the input where 0 are to the left of 9, 9 are above another 9, and 1 are above another 1, and 4 are under 1.
    * The forth column seems to take the last column of the largest continuous yellow section (at the forth row).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
