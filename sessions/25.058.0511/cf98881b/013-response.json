            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a rectangular grid of colored pixels into a smaller rectangular grid. The colors in the input grid seem to be reduced to a subset in the output grid. Specifically, yellow (4), maroon (9), white(0), and blue(1) appear in the output, while red(2) is gone. The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input. It's not a simple sub-region selection, as elements from different input regions are combined. There is a change in structure. The size is significantly smaller, specifically the input is 4x15 and the output is 4x4. The relationship is unclear.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In the provided images, each partition has different width due to different colors. We may be looking at an approximation and the transformation considers multiple partitions.\n\n2.  **Color Priority within Partitions:** Within each subgrid, some colors win. It is necessary to derive which.\n    From observation:\n    -   Yellow (4) appears to always be present.\n    -   Maroon (9) appears related to yellow (4).\n    - White(0) and blue(1) may be related somehow, at least they both win against red(2).\n   The color preservation rule is unclear.\n\n3. **Build the Output** Scan each vertical slice of size approximately n and determine a value to preserve and write to the output.\nRepeat until done.\n\nThe core challenge is in figuring out exactly *how* the input grid's spatial information and colors map to the output grid's cells. It's neither a simple cropping nor a direct color-for-color substitution. There is spatial compression/summarization. The selection rule seems to combine spatial and color information.\n"
