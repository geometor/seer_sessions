Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the observation that yellow pixels and the border were somehow central to the transformation. The code attempts to extract the yellow pixels, find their bounding box, and reconstruct a smaller grid with the yellow pixels and adjusted borders within that box.

The results indicate mixed success. Some examples work perfectly (Example 0, 1), while others have discrepancies in size and color placement (Example 2, 3). This suggests the initial hypothesis is partially correct but needs significant refinement to handle variations in how borders and other non-yellow pixels are handled. The bounding box concept based on yellow pixels alone is too restrictive. We need to consider how border colors outside the yellow pixel bounding box get included/placed in output.

Here's the refined strategy:

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine the incorrect outputs (Examples 2, 3) to pinpoint exactly *where* the logic fails. We'll compare the produced output with the expected output pixel by pixel.
2.  **Border Handling:** The most obvious issue is the inconsistent border handling. The current code tries to map input border pixels to output border pixels, adjusting for the yellow bounding box. This needs a more robust approach.  We need to understand the *relative* positioning of border pixels and how that's preserved.
3.  **Non-Yellow Pixel Handling:**  The current approach only handles yellow and border pixels. We need to find how other colored pixels are positioned in the output grid, in relation to the yellow and border.
4.  **Refine Bounding Box (or alternative):** The "bounding box of yellow pixels" might be a misleading concept. We need to see if there's a more general way to define the output grid's dimensions, potentially using the *entire* input grid's dimensions and some consistent offset/scaling factor related to the positions of specific colors.
5. Iterate the natural language program and the code based on updated observations and assumptions.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

I'll use `code_execution` to get precise details about the grids and discrepancies. I'll focus on:

*   Input and Output dimensions
*   Locations of yellow pixels in Input and Output
*   Border pixel values and their locations in Input and Output
*   Pixel-by-pixel comparison of the generated output vs. expected output

```

The code execution confirms our assessment: Examples 0 and 1 work perfectly, while Examples 2 and 3 have shape mismatches. This reinforces that the core issue is the determination of the output grid's dimensions, which the current code bases solely on the yellow pixels' bounding box. We must incorporate border information. It appears the output is created by removing columns that have all pixels of the same color, other than the color of the yellow pixel (color 4).

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is a sub-grid of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      Columns consisting only of the same color, except for yellow (4) pixels, are removed.
  - observation: |
       The output grid retains the relative positions of pixels of different colors.
  - observation: |
      Yellow (4) pixels are always present in the output.
  - observation: |
     The output grid can contain pixels other than yellow.
  - action: |
      Identify columns of the same color in input, excluding columns containing yellow (4).
  - action: |
      Remove the identified columns to form the output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Uniform Columns:** Examine the input grid. Identify columns that contain only one color, excluding any columns that contain the color yellow (4).
2.  **Remove Columns**: Remove the identified uniform columns.
3.  **Construct Output:** The remaining pixels, after removing the columns form the output grid. The relative positions of all the remaining pixels should be the same as in the input grid.

This natural language program focuses on the core concept of removing uniform-color columns, avoiding the potentially misleading "bounding box" terminology. It is more concise and directly addresses the observed transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
