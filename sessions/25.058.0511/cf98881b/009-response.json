            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program focused on extracting columns starting with specific colors (yellow, white, blue, and maroon).  While this worked for the first training example, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule. The core issue is that the transformation isn't *just* about selecting columns based on the top pixel's color. The output dimensions and structure aren't solely determined by the presence of those colors. It appears the height of the extracted subgrids plays an essential part of the transformation. It's not about extracting *entire* columns.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1. **Detailed Example Analysis:**  I'll use code execution to get the dimensions of each input and output grid, and I will carefully examine the pixel values in each example, particularly where the provided code's logic fails.\n2. **Identify the True Rule:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll formulate a more accurate description of the transformation, likely involving identifying sub-grids within columns that begin with the specified colors. The height of the subgrids from the examples will be the key factor.\n3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  I'll update the natural language program to reflect the corrected transformation logic, ensuring it's clear, concise, and accurately captures the input-to-output relationship.\n4. **Fact Documentation:** Organize observations into the requested YAML format.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` to gather information about each input/output pair.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)\n    input_shape = input_grid.shape\n    output_shape = output_grid.shape\n    \n    # Check the colors in first row of the input\n    first_row_colors = input_grid[0, :].tolist()\n    \n    # Target colors: 4, 0, 1, 9\n    \n    print(f\"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}\")\n    print(f\"Colors in the first row of input: {first_row_colors}\")\n\nexamples = [\n    ([[4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1],\n      [4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 5, 4, 8, 6],\n      [8, 5, 8, 7, 5, 7, 4, 6, 9],\n      [6, 8, 5, 8, 2, 5, 3, 5, 7],\n      [5, 2, 3, 7, 9, 1, 9, 8, 6]],\n     [[4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1],\n      [4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 5, 4, 8, 6]]),\n      \n    ([[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 8, 0, 5, 7, 7],\n      [7, 5, 7, 7, 3, 7, 9, 6, 2, 9],\n      [8, 6, 2, 4, 4, 7, 5, 2, 8, 5],\n      [3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 4, 8, 4, 2, 5],\n      [2, 8, 4, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4, 5, 9],\n      [0, 1, 8, 7, 7, 1, 7, 5, 3, 7],\n      [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 0],\n      [7, 7, 5, 1, 8, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2]],\n     [[0, 0, 0],\n      [7, 9, 2]]),\n    \n    ([[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n     [2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9],\n     [7, 7, 5, 4, 0, 8, 2, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 4, 2, 3, 8],\n     [6, 3, 9, 6, 4, 7, 8, 6, 8, 5, 7, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]],\n    [[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n     [2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9]])\n]\n\nfor i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):\n    print(f\"--- Example {i+1} ---\")\n    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)\n```"
