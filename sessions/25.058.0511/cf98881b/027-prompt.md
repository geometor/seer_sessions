"""
1.  **Identify Border:** Locate the outermost rows and columns of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Border Colors:** Maintain the colors from those positions.
3.  **Identify Yellow:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
4.  **Reduce Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid.
5.  **Reconstruct Yellow:** Place the yellow pixels in the new grid, maintaining the original relative positions.
6.  **Fill the rest**: Fill any gaps on the border with colors based on input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
