Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. It's clear from running the code on the other examples that the initial hypothesis is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core idea of extracting subgrids is relevant, but the selection criteria (starting colors and output height matching) and assembly process are incorrect for some examples.

The strategy to resolve the errors involves the following:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to discrepancies between the `output_grid_computed` and the expected `output_grid`.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent rules or patterns across *all* examples, not just the first one. This might involve different selection criteria for subgrids, a different method of combining them, or additional transformations.
3. **Objectness**: use knowledge of objects, adjacency, and counts to improve
   the description and the approach.
4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately reflect the generalized transformation rule.
5. **Iterate and Test:** Generate new code based on the refined program and test it against all examples.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To accurately describe the transformations, I need to gather information about sizes and other properties of the input and output grids, and identify key differences.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
