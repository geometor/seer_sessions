example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 3, shape: 3x3 rectangle
      - color: 4, shape: 3x1 column, position: column 3
      - color: 2, shape: 3x2 rectangle, position: column 4,5
      - color: 8, shape: 3x3 rectangle
      - color: 9, shape: 3x1 column, position: column 9
  output:
    objects:
      - color: 4, shape: 3x1 column
      - color: 2, shape: 3x1 column
      - color: 9, shape: 3x1 column
      - color: 4, shape: 3x1 column  #Duplicate color
  action: "Select specific columns (4,2,9) and stack. There is a repetition of 4."
  notes: "output width is number of distinct colors in input"
  result: "Correct"

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: 0, shape: 3x10, with four single-pixel gaps of color 7
      - color: 7, shape: 6x4 object, spread at columns 3 and 7
  output:
    objects:
      - color: 7, shape: 6 x 2, position column 0,1
      - color: 0, shape: 6 x 2, position column 2,3
  action: Selects columns 3, 4, 7, and any additional columns
  notes: "output width is number of distinct colors in input"
  result: "Incorrect. The output has some zeros, when the colors should be 7 and 0"

  input:
    objects:
      - color: 6, shape: variable, around a main central block of 5s
      - color: 5, shape: block that occupies most of grid
  output:
    objects:
    - color: 5, shape: 5 x 4 block
  action: "Selects columns with color 5, result is 5 x 4 rectangle"
