facts:
  - observation: The output width is consistently 4 across all examples.
  - observation: The output height always matches the input height.
  - observation: The input grid is vertically partitioned into 4 sections.
  - observation: Example 1 input contains colors 0 and 1, and the output contains only color 0.
  - observation: Example 2 input contains colors 0 and 9, and the output contains only color 0.
  - observation: Example 3 input contains colors 0, 1, and 4, and the output contains colors 0, 1 and 4.
  - observation: In Example 3, a vertical section of color 4 is preserved in the output. A vertical section of color 1 is preserved in the output.
  - observation: Input grids can have varying widths and heights.
  - hypothesis:  If an entire partition consists of a contiguous block of a single color, other than black (0), that color might be preserved, and black sections are removed.
