Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on selecting non-zero pixels, sorting them, and arranging them into a 3x3 grid. However, the testing revealed that this approach doesn't perfectly capture the transformation logic for all cases. The core issue seems to be that the initial program always tries to fill a 3x3 grid, it does not correctly determine the output grid shape, and may not be arranging the blocks as expected, especially when the number of non-zero pixels is not exactly nine. The sort order may be incorrect.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each example where the output didn't match. Identify the specific pixels that were misplaced or missing.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Revisit what constitutes an "object" in this context. Is it always a single non-zero pixel, or could it be a connected group of pixels?
3.  **Revisit Arrangement:** Determine the precise rule for arranging the selected pixels. How is the order maintained? and what is the shape of the output?
4.  **Update Program:** Modify the natural language program to reflect the refined understanding of object selection, ordering, and arrangement.
5. Test and Iterate.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To get a clearer picture, I'll analyze the provided grids.
Here are the results of the previous code execution:

```
Example 0:
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 9 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 9 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 9 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[9 9 9]]
Actual Output:
[[9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Example 1:
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 6 6 6 0 0 0]
 [0 6 6 6 0 0 0]
 [0 6 6 6 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[6 6 6]
 [6 6 6]
 [6 6 6]]
Actual Output:
[[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]]

Example 2:
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 2 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 3 0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[1]
 [2]
 [3]]
Actual Output:
[[1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Example 3:
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[5 5]
 [5 5]]
Actual Output:
[[5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

**Observations:**

*   **Example 0:** The code creates a 3x3 when the output should be 1x3. It fills with zeros
*   **Example 1:** The code creates a 3x3 when the output should be 3x3. It fills with zeros.
*   **Example 2:** The code creates a 3x3 when the output should be 3x1. It fills with zeros.
*   **Example 3:** The code creates a 3x3 when the output should be 2x2. It fills with zeros.

The current implementation is not discerning the correct output grid shape.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: Non-zero blocks of color
    properties:
      - color: Determined by the non-zero pixel value.
      - shape: A single pixel or adjacent pixels.
      - location: Original row and column in the input grid.
actions:
  - select: Identify non-zero blocks.
  - arrange: Position blocks to form output grid.
  - size: output grid dimensions derived from the input grid dimensions and block shapes.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Selection:** Identify all distinct, contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) pixels within the input grid. A block is defined as one or more adjacent pixels of the same color.
2.  **Ordering:** Maintain the input order of the blocks.
3.  **Arrangement:** Create an output grid. The dimensions of the output grid and arrangement of blocks are determined by the shapes and locations of the selected blocks in the input. Each block from the input is placed into the output grid in its entirety. If multiple blocks are present, the output grid encompasses them, maintaining their relative positions and the space between. If blocks form rows or columns, maintain that relationship.
