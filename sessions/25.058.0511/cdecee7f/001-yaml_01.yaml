facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains single-color pixels scattered on a background of 0.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains only the non-zero pixels from the input grid, rearranged.

  - action: extraction
    description: Non-zero pixels are extracted from the input_grid.

  - action: rearrangement
    description: Extracted pixels are reordered and placed into the output_grid.
    
  - relationship: input_output
    description: The output_grid is derived from the input_grid by extracting and rearranging non-zero pixels

  - property: order_input
    description: input grid has an implicit ordering, going across each row, starting from top-left.

  - property: order_output
    description: output grid preserves ordering but reduces the size of grid.
