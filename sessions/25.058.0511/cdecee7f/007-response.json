The input grid seems to have a sparse distribution of colored pixels, with the majority being white (value 0). The output grid appears to be a condensed representation, retaining some of the non-zero colored pixels from the input, but with altered positions. The colors themselves are preserved during transformation. There appears to be some relationship between the original locations of the pixels that are included and not included.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
