            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for moving forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial `transform` function (not shown, but implied in `analyze_results`) clearly doesn't capture the correct transformation rule. The `analyze_results` function is helpful for comparing the predicted output with the actual output, and we can see that *none* of the examples were predicted correctly (`\"correct_prediction\": false` for all).  The most obvious discrepancy across all examples is the difference in shape and non-zero pixel counts between the expected output and the (incorrectly) predicted output. The provided examples seem to focus on extracting a single non-zero color from the input grid and placing it at a specific, consistent location in the output grid, while maintaining a fixed output shape.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on the consistent pattern:**  The output grids *always* have a shape of (3, 3) and usually contain only one non-zero pixel.  This suggests a transformation that identifies the *first* non-zero pixel in the input, notes its color, and places that color in a specific location within a 3x3 output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros (white).\n\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:** The primary \"object\" is the non-zero pixel in the input grid. Its properties are its color and, implicitly, its original location (although the original location isn't directly used in the output, knowing *which* non-zero pixel is selected is crucial).\n\n3.  **Iterative Program Development:** We need to adjust the natural language program to accurately describe the \"find the first non-zero pixel, and put it in the top-left corner of a 3x3 grid\" rule.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using `analyze_results` output):**\nThe code provided gives already the requested metrics.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: \"example_set_1\"\n  - example_count: 4\n  - input_shapes: [(4, 6), (4, 6), (4, 6), (4, 6)]\n  - output_shapes: [(3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3), (3, 3)]\n  - input_colors_per_example:\n      - [[0, 1]]\n      - [[0, 1]]\n      - [[0, 4]]\n      - [[0, 2]]\n  - output_colors_per_example:\n      - [[0, 1]]\n      - [[0, 1]]\n      - [[0, 4]]\n      - [[0, 2]]\n  - object_types:\n      - single_colored_pixel:\n          properties:\n              - color: int (0-9)\n              - original_position: (int, int)  # Row, Column (not directly used in output)\n  - transformation_rule: |\n      The transformation identifies the first non-zero pixel in the input grid.\n      It creates a 3x3 output grid filled with zeros.\n      The color of the identified non-zero pixel is placed in the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid.\n  - consistent_output_shape: true\n  - output_shape: (3, 3)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled entirely with zeros (white).\n2.  **Find First Non-Zero:** Iterate through the input grid, row by row, and within each row, from left to right.  Find the *first* pixel that has a non-zero color.\n3.  **Extract Color:** Note the color value of this first non-zero pixel.\n4.  **Place Color:** Place the extracted color in the top-left corner (position (0, 0)) of the output grid.\n5. **Return Output Grid:** return the initialized output grid.\n"
