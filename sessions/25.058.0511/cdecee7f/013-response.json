Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), with a few colored pixels scattered throughout. The output is a 3x3 grid containing only the non-zero colored pixels from the input, preserving their original colors (represented by their numerical values). The spatial arrangement of the colored pixels appears to change significantly between the input and output. The task involves extracting and rearranging specific elements, discarding the majority.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The top-left element of the output is the bottom-left non-zero pixel in input, and proceeds row by row. The pixels will be arranged in the order they appear, filling the 3 x 3 output grid from left to right and top to bottom.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts all colored pixels from the large input grid and compacts them into a smaller 3x3 grid, preserving their original colors and filling the grid in a specific order, the details of the order seem to read the input grid from bottom to up, left to right.\n"
