Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Selection:** Identify all non-zero (non-white) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Ordering:** Sort the selected pixels first by their row index in ascending order, and then by their column index, also in ascending order.
3.  **Arrangement:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Populate this grid row by row. For each row in the output grid, select up to the first three pixels from the ordered list of pixels. Place each pixel into the output row, moving from left to right (increasing column index). Once a row is full (3 pixels) or no more pixels are available from this original row index, move to the next row in the output grid. Repeat until the output grid is full (3x3) or there are no more selected pixels to place.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
