      transformation: "The single non-zero pixel in the input grid is placed at the top-left corner of the output grid."

      input:
          object_count: 1
          object_color: 1
          object_location: (3,3)
      output:
          object_count: 1
          object_color: 1
          object_location: (0,2)
      transformation: "The single non-zero pixel is placed at the top-right (0,2) of the output grid."

      input:
          object_count: 1
          object_color: 4
          object_location: (1,1)
      output:
        object_count: 1
        object_color: 4
        object_location: (0,1)
      transformation: "The single non-zero pixel is placed at (0, 1) of the output grid"
  - example_4:
      input:
        object_count: 1
        object_color: 2
        object_location: (0,0)
      output:
          object_count: 1
          object_color: 2
          object_location: (0,0)
      transformation: "The single non-zero pixel in the input is placed at the top-left corner (0,0) of the output."

overall_transformation: "The output grid is always 3x3. The single non-zero pixel from the input grid is placed in the output grid based on its original column position. The column position of the input pixel corresponds to its column in the output. The non-zero pixel always appears on the top row."
