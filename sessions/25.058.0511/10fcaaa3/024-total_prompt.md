Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation logic:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code captured some aspects of the transformation, specifically relating to the red pixels and attempting to incorporate the azure pattern. However, the results highlight several inaccuracies:

*   **Inconsistent Azure Pattern:** The logic for placing the azure pixels (8) is highly specific to individual examples and doesn't generalize. It tries to use conditional logic based on the red pixel locations, but this approach is brittle and doesn't capture the underlying rule.
*   **Scaling and Placement:** While the code detects the presence of red pixels and adjusts the output size accordingly sometimes, the exact placement and scaling logic are incorrect in several cases. It sometimes multiplies coordinates and adds offsets, but this is not consistent across examples.
*   **Missing a unifying concept:**. The initial assumption that each example must be explained on it's own terms is not necessarily the best approach. There must be common logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** Instead of hardcoding positions and scaling factors, focus on the *relative* positions of red and azure pixels within each input and how those relationships translate to the output.
2.  **Identify Consistent Patterns:** Analyze the *relative* arrangements. Are the azure pixels always surrounding the red pixels? Are they forming a specific shape or frame?
3.  **Revisit Scaling:** Instead of multiple conditional scalings, is there a single, consistent scaling factor or rule applied that relates input and output grid sizes?
4.  **Object-Oriented Thinking**: Consider red and azure regions as independent objects, then determine how they interact or combine.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Grid:** The input grid (always 3x3) is doubled in size to create a 6x6 output grid.

2.  **Locate Red Objects**: Identify the red (value 2) pixels in the input.

3. **Transform Red:**
   - If there is one red pixel, and it's on an edge/corner, it stays in relative same place within a quadrant, the output grid is composed of 4 3x3 quadrants
   - If there are two red pixels and form a line, those red pixels will appear along the same line type (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) in one of the 4 quadrants.
   - If the red pixels form a vertical line, they are centered vertically within an output quadrant.

4.  **Create Azure Frame/Checkerboard:** An azure (value 8) pattern is created based on the position of the transformed red pixels:
    -   If a single red pixel is in the top row, the azure pattern is horizontal lines in first and last row, every other column.
    -   If a single red pixel is *not* on the top row, an azure checkerboard pattern appears, where azure fills every other cell in rows 1 and 3.
    -   If the red forms a vertical line, an azure checkerboard pattern appears in rows 1 and 3, every other cell, *starting at column 1*.
    - If the red forms a diagonal, an azure 2x2 square is created in the center of the 6x6 grid.

5.  **Combine:** The transformed red pixels and the azure pattern are combined to form the final output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
