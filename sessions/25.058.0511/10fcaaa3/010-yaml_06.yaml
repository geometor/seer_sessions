    description: Each pixel in the input_grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same pixel value in the output_grid.
    details: >
      The output grid's dimensions are always double that of the input grid in both height and width. Every individual element at input[i,j] produces a corresponding 2x2 subgrid in the output, such that output[2i:2i+2, 2j:2j+2] all equal input[i,j].
