The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. The output grid seems to have a repeating pattern, with the original input seemingly embedded within and expanded. Specifically, the single gray (5) pixel in the input is replicated in the output, and a new color, azure (8), is introduced, creating a checkered pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
