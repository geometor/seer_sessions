## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 6 0
0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7B1DDE42DD50>

**output:**
```
0 0 6 0 0 0 6 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 6 0 8 0 6 0 8
8 0 6 0 8 0 6 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7B1DDE69BDD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x4 grid with values mostly 0 (white), with two 6s (magenta).
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x8 grid, seeming to be an expansion of the original. The 6s (magenta) from the input are present, and there's a new color, 8 (azure), interspersed. The placement of the magenta pixels appears to follow a specific replicated pattern relative to their original location.
* **Size change:** the input grid's height and width are doubled.
* **Background and fill:** azure(8) pixels are used to fill in between the replicated magenta and white cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 4]
    elements:
      - color: 0  # White
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,3], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,0], [2,2]]
      - color: 6  # Magenta
        positions: [[0, 2], [2, 1]]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [6, 8]
    elements:
      - color: 0  # White
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,3], [0,4], [0,5], [0,7], [2,2], [2,6], [3,1], [3,5], [5,0], [5,1], [5,2], [5,3], [5,4], [5,5], [5,6], [5,7]]
      - color: 6  # Magenta
        positions: [[0, 2], [0, 6], [2, 1], [2, 5], [3,2], [3,6], [4,1],[4,5]]
      - color: 8 # Azure
        positions: [[0,3],[0,7],[1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [1,6], [1,7], [2,3],[2,7],[3,0],[3,4],[3,7],[4,0], [4,2],[4,3],[4,4],[4,6],[4,7]]

  - transformation:
    type: expansion and fill
    input_dimensions: [3,4]
    output_dimensions: [6,8]
    rules:
     - double_dimensions
     - replicate_pixels
     - fill_new: 8

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The input grid's dimensions (height and width) are doubled to create the output grid's dimensions.
2. **Replicate original pixels:** Each pixel in the input grid is replicated in output grid in a 2x2 pattern of cells.
3. **Translate the replicates:** The replicates are at a position 2x their index in both the x and y.
4.  **Fill:** Fill the remaining cells with azure (8).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
