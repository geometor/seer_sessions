facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's dimensions are always double the input grid's dimensions.
  - object: input_pixel
    properties: |
       Represents a single cell in the input grid.
       Has a color value (0-9).
    actions: |
        Replicated in the output grid.
  - object: output_block
    properties: |
        A 2x2 block of cells in the output grid.
        All cells in the block have the same color.
    actions:
        Corresponds to a single input_pixel.
  - transformation: |
      Each input pixel maps to a 2x2 output block.
      The color of the input pixel becomes the color of all cells in the corresponding output block.
