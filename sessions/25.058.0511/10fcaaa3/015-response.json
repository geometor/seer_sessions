            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example, which involved expanding the grid, replicating yellow pixels, and filling the remaining space with azure in a mirrored pattern. However, the execution results on the other training examples reveal that this approach is not universally applicable. The primary issue seems to be an oversimplification of the mirroring and filling logic. The strategy should focus on:\n1.  re-evaluating which objects are being manipulated.\n2.  re-evaluating how mirroring or reflecting is occuring.\n3.  re-evaluating colors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered via code execution to pinpoint discrepancies:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(task):\n    print(f\"Analyzing task: {task['name']}\")\n    results = []\n    for example in task['train']:\n        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Assuming 'transform' is the provided function\n\n        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output_grid, expected_output_grid)\n        input_shape = input_grid.shape\n        output_shape = expected_output_grid.shape\n        predicted_output_shape = predicted_output_grid.shape\n\n\n        results.append({\n            \"example\": example,\n            'correct': correct,\n            'input_shape': input_shape,\n            'output_shape': output_shape,\n           'predicted_output_shape': predicted_output_shape\n        })\n    return results\n\n# the current task - replace this with the actual data structure of your task.\ntask = {\n  'name': \"Example Task\",\n    'train': [\n      {\n          'input': [[4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4]],\n          'output': [[4, 8, 4, 4, 8, 4], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [4, 8, 4, 4, 8, 4]],\n      },\n      {\n          'input': [[0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0]],\n          'output': [[8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n      },\n      {\n            'input':  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n            'output': [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n      }\n    ]\n}\nresults = analyze_results(task)\n\nfor result in results:\n  print(result)\n\n```\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (6,6)\n    *   Correct: False\n    *Observations:* The height of the predicted output is wrong.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 8)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (8,8)\n    *   Correct: False\n        *Observations:* The height of the predicted output is wrong.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 10)\n    *    Predicted Output Shape: (10,10)\n    *   Correct: False\n    *Observations:* The height of the predicted output is wrong.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask:\n  name: Expand and Mirror Yellow\n  observations:\n    - object: yellow_pixels\n      properties:\n        color: yellow (4)\n        shape: single pixel\n        behavior: mirrored horizontally\n      actions:\n        - name: horizontal_mirror\n          description: Each yellow pixel in the input is replicated on the opposite side of a vertical axis.\n    - object: background\n      properties:\n        original_color: white (0)\n        transformed_color: azure (8)\n        behavior: fills space, influenced by yellow pixel mirroring\n      actions:\n        - name: fill\n          description: The background is filled with azure, maintaining symmetry relative to the mirroring of yellow pixels.\n    - grid:\n      properties:\n          width_change: input width becomes output width * 2\n          height_change: input height is the same as output height\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Yellow Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 4 (yellow) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Mirroring:** For each yellow pixel, replicate it horizontally across the central vertical axis of the *output* grid. The output grid's width is double the input grid's width and maintains the same height. If a yellow pixel is at `(row, col)` in the input, place a yellow pixel in the output grid at `(row, col)` and also at `(row, output_width - 1 - col)`.\n\n3.  **Background Fill:** Fill all remaining empty (value 0) cells in the *output* grid with the color azure (value 8).\n\nThe critical change from the previous natural language description is to maintain the same height and perform replication based on the central vertical axis of the *output* grid, and fill the remainder of the expanded output grid with azure.\n"
