    def transform(input_grid):
        # Find largest rectangle of one color
        largest_rectangle = find_largest_rectangle(input_grid)
        # Create output grid of same size as largest rectangle
        output_grid = create_grid(largest_rectangle.width, largest_rectangle.height)
        # Fill output with color of largest rectangle
        fill_grid(output_grid, largest_rectangle.color)
        return output_grid

    ```
    It is likely that the function creates a grid that matches the size of the original input.

**Example Analysis and Pattern Identification**

Here is a breakdown of each provided example result, and the conclusions:

Example 1:

Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 7 7 7]
 [0 0 0 7 7 7]
 [0 0 0 7 7 7]]
Expected Output:
[[7 7 7]
 [7 7 7]
 [7 7 7]]
Actual Output:
[[7 7 7]
 [7 7 7]
 [7 7 7]]

**Assessment:** Correct. The largest rectangle (orange, color 7) is identified and reproduced at the top-left. The inferred initial hypothesis holds.

Example 2:

Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 5 5 5 0]
 [0 5 5 5 0]
 [0 5 5 5 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[5 5 5]
 [5 5 5]
 [5 5 5]]
Actual Output:
[[5 5 5 0]
 [5 5 5 0]
 [5 5 5 0]
 [0 0 0 0]]

**Assessment:** Incorrect. The largest rectangle (gray, color 5) is identified.  The output is *not* positioned at the top-left, and includes extra, incorrect, pixels, making the output grid too large. It appears to have maintained the shape of the input.

Example 3:

Input:
[[1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 2 2]]
Expected Output:
[[1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]]
Actual Output:
[[1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
 [1 1 1]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 2 2]]

**Assessment:** Incorrect. The largest rectangle (blue, color 1) is identified, *but* the output includes extra pixels. It is also clear, that the expected output requires selecting the largest rectangle of the colors that are not black(0).

**Key Observations and Missed Patterns:**

1.  **Output Size:** The initial hypothesis incorrectly assumes the output grid will always be the same dimensions as the *largest rectangle*. The correct output size is sometimes smaller, equal to the dimensions of the bounding box of the largest non-black rectangle.
2.  **Black as Background:** Black (0) is acting as a "background" color. The transformation focuses on the largest non-black rectangle.
3. **Output Dimensions**: The output is not correctly located at the top-left, and appears to have the dimensions of the original input grid.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

"Identify the largest contiguous rectangle of a single, *non-black* color in the input grid. Create an output grid with the dimensions of the bounding box containing this rectangle. Copy the largest rectangle to the top-left corner of the output grid."
