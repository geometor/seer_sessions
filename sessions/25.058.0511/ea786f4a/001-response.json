The integers represent colors. The input grid appears to be transformed into another 3x3 grid. The core operation seems to be a change in the color of specific cells based on their original color and possibly their position.  Specifically, the blue (1) cells in the input become white (0) cells in the output, and the white (0) center cell remains white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
