## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 5 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DDE487050>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE487BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a few distinct regions of colors: mostly white (0), a patch of blue (1), and a single grey (5) pixel. The output grid seems to be a simplified representation of a section of the blue pixels from the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: white # 0
        count: many
      - color: blue # 1
        count: several
        shape: irregular
      - color: grey # 5
        count: 1

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white #0
        count: 2
      - color: blue # 1
        count: 7
        shape: L-like

relationships:
  - type: subset
    from: output_grid
    to: input_grid
    description: The output grid appears to represent a concentrated area of blue pixels from the input. The blue pixels in output are arranged similar to some blue pixels within the input grid.

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A region of interest (blue pixels) is extracted from the input grid.
  - type: simplification
    description: The extracted region is simplified or reduced into a smaller grid, preserving the relative arrangement of one color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Locate the largest connected region of blue (1) pixels within the input grid. Ignore other colors except for locating a contiguous region of the target color.
2.  **Locate the region:** Check the boundary of blue pixels within the input
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create the smallest possible rectangular output grid containing all the blue area.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
