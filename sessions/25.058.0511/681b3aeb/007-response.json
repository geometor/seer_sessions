The input grid appears to be larger and sparser, containing two distinct colored regions (yellow and magenta). The output grid is smaller, more compact, and retains the colors from the input, but in a rearranged configuration. The most obvious transformation appears to be a cropping and repositioning of the colored areas. The relative positions of colored blocks are modified.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
