The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, combining elements from both colored regions. The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. The relative positions of the blue and green objects appear to be preserved somehow.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this case, we have a green (3) region and a blue (1) region.\n\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. I will need to figure out a consistent rule on the size.\n\n3.  **Translate Green Region to Output.** Find the minimal bounding box for the green region. Place the green region in output at the bottom, horizontally centered.\n\n4. **Translate Blue Region to Output:** Find the minimal bounding box for the blue region. Place the blue region in output in the row above the green region, horizontally centered.\n\n5. **Result**: the result is a 3x3 grid composed of the bounding boxes of the identified color regions.\n\nI think the trickiest part here is figuring out precisely *how* the input regions are condensed and placed in the output, as the example only gives us one input-output pair. More details would be needed about the exact condensation/resizing method for an accurate transformation on other inputs.\n"
