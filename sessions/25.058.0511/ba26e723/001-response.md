Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are yellow (4) and white (0) in the input. The output introduces a new color, magenta (6), while retaining some of the yellow and white pixels from the input. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x10). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of yellow pixels with magenta, particularly at the corners and edges of contiguous yellow blocks.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x10
      elements: pixels
      colors: [yellow, white, magenta]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        input: [yellow, white]
        output: [yellow, white, magenta]
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    properties:
      from: yellow
      to: magenta
    conditions:
      - "corners of yellow blocks"
      - "edges of yellow blocks"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically."
  - type: containment
    description: "Grid contains pixels."
  - type: grouping
    description: "Yellow pixels form contiguous blocks."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each yellow block**:
    *   If a yellow pixel is on a corner of a block replace the yellow pixel with a magenta (6) pixel. Corners are left and right ends of a horizontal block.
    *    If a yellow pixel borders a white pixel on any edge on the left or right, replace that yellow pixel with a magenta (6).
3.  **Retain** all white (0) pixels in their original positions.
4.  **Output** the modified grid.

Essentially, the transformation replaces specific yellow pixels with magenta based on their position relative to other yellow pixels and white pixels, focusing on edges, and left and right ends of contiguous blocks.
