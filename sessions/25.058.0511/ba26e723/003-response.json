            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of yellow pixels and attempts to modify them based on corner positions and adjacency to white pixels. However, the results indicate that the logic isn't entirely accurate across all training examples. The main issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of \"Corners\"**: The initial code only considered the left and right ends of *horizontal* yellow blocks as corners. It needs to consider corners of all yellow blocks, irrespective of their shape (horizontal, vertical, or irregular).\n2.  **Incomplete Adjacency Check**: It only checks for white pixels directly to the left or right. The rule needs to encompass all neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and potentially diagonal).\n3. **Missing Rule Elements**: It did not capture the shape and structure requirements - a square.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors is as follows:\n\n1.  **Refine Corner Detection:** Instead of assuming horizontal blocks, we need to check for corners by looking at the neighbors of each yellow pixel within a block. A corner will have fewer yellow neighbors.\n2.  **Expand Adjacency Check:** Implement a comprehensive check for white neighbors in all relevant directions (at least the four cardinal directions).\n3. **Shape Detection**: Add a check to verify the shape as square.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo gather accurate metrics, I'll use a conceptual approach. Let's represent the input and output grids and highlight the discrepancies.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 3x3 yellow square.\n*   **Expected Output:** The four corners of the square are magenta.\n*   **Actual Output:** Only the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the middle row are magenta.\n*   **Observation:** The code failed to identify all four corners of the square.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A horizontal yellow line with white pixels on either end, and a separate 2x2 yellow square.\n*   **Expected Output:** The ends of the horizontal line are magenta, the side pixels next to the white are magenta, and the four corner pixels of the 2x2 square are magenta.\n*   **Actual Output:** The ends of the horizontal line are magenta. The corner pixels of the 2x2 are all magenta. The side of the horizontal yellow line adjacent to the white is magenta.\n* **Observation:** Correct corner identification for square and horizontal.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*    **Input:** a 3x3 yellow square and some individual yellow pixels.\n*    **Expected Output:** the corner pixels of the 3x3 yellow square are magenta.\n*    **Actual Output:** only the left and right most pixels of the middle row of the 3x3 are magenta.\n* **Observation:** The code failed to identify all four corners of the square.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: yellow_blocks\n    type: contiguous_block\n    color: yellow\n    properties:\n      - shape: square\n      - corners: []\n      - adjacent_colors: {}\n\nactions:\n  - name: modify_corners\n    object: yellow_blocks\n    condition: \"shape is square\"\n    transformation: \"change corner color to magenta\"\n\n  - name: modify_adjacent\n    object: yellow_block_pixel\n    condition: \"adjacent to white pixel and part of 2 pixel long horizontal block\"\n    transformation: \"change color to magenta\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **For each yellow block**:\n    *    **If** the block forms a square, replace the corner pixels with magenta (6).\n        - A corner is the point where 2 edges intersect.\n    *    **Else if** the block is a horizontal line two pixels long with adjacent white, replace the yellow with magenta (6).\n\n3.  **Retain** all other pixels in their original colors and positions.\n4.  **Output** the modified grid.\n"
