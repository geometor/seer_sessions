## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7B1DDE739B50>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have isolated single-pixel objects of different colors (red, green, azure). The output grid introduces a new color (blue) in a specific pattern seemingly related to the position of the original colored pixels. It appears that the blue color expands or "floods" from the original non-zero pixels, but has a specific structure.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: [white, red, green, azure, blue]
          - position: [row, column]
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: [8x8]
  - actions:
      - name: flood_fill
        description: Replaces white pixels with blue pixels based on proximity to existing non-white pixels.
  - relationships:
      - type: proximity
        description: Blue pixels appear adjacent to or encompassing the original non-white pixels.
        details: The shape formed by color blue has a cross or "+" structure.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color value not equal to 0). These are the "seed" pixels.

2.  **Construct Cross Shapes:** For each seed pixel:
    *   If the position of the seed pixel is on the edge of the grid, extend a line of blue (value 1) of length 1 in the available direction.
    *   If the position of the seed pixel is not on the edge of the grid, create a "cross" or "+" shape centered on the seed pixel using blue pixels (value 1), with lines in all four cardinal directions. Each arm of the cross will have length one, and the shape consists in the pixels that are at distance one. The center point of the cross coincides with the position of the seed.
    *   The original seed pixel value in retained in the output grid.

3. **Other Pixels**: Every other pixel that is not involved in any transformation remain the same, with value 0 (color white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
