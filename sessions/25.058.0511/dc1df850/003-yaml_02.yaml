task_description: |
  The input grid is transformed into an output grid by selectively filling regions with blue.  Red and magenta pixels are preserved.  A downward-propagating blue fill starts from the top and is blocked by certain colors.

objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output images.

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # Standard ARC colors
        description: Represents the color of the pixel.
      position:
        type: (row, column)
        description: The coordinates of the pixel within the grid.

  - name: blue_fill
    type: region
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        value: 1
        description: The color blue.
      start_row:
        type: integer
        value: 0
        description: The fill starts from the top row.
      propagation:
        type: string
        value: downwards
        description:  Fill propagates downwards, column by column.
      blocking_colors:
        type: set
        values: [3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 9, 1]
        description: The set of colors that block the downward propagation of the blue fill. Red (2) and magenta (6) are *not* blocking.

actions:
  - name: preserve_pixels
    description: Red (2) and magenta (6) pixels in the input grid are copied to the output grid without modification.

  - name: blue_fill
    description:  A blue fill propagates downwards from the top row.  It fills white (0) pixels with blue (1). The fill stops in a column when it encounters a blocking color.
