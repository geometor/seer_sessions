The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The input grid seems to have a scattered distribution of colors, while the output grid is significantly smaller and appears to contain a subset of the colors present in the input, arranged in a specific pattern. The colors azure (8) and blue(1) are of importance.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
