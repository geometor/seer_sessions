Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The colors present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid, specifically, colors azure (8) and blue (1) with white/background(0) removed. The output grid appears to be a concentrated representation of a pattern found within the input grid. It seems like a specific region within the larger input grid is selected and extracted to create the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid is 9x9, output grid is 3x3"
  - objects:
    - type: "grid"
      properties:
        - name: "input_grid"
          dimensions: [9, 9]
          colors: [0, 1, 8]
        - name: "output_grid"
          dimensions: [3, 3]
          colors: [1, 8]
  - actions:
      - type: "extraction"
        description: "A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the input grid."
  - relationships:
    - type: "spatial"
      description: "The output grid corresponds to a specific region within the input grid, centered and focused on non-zero, non-background color values."
    - type: color_content
      description: "Only the color values 1 and 8 are preserved in the output, 0 is skipped."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate a region within the input grid. The program focuses on the arrangement of azure (8) and blue (1) pixels, excluding background (0) pixels.

2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the identified target region.

3.  **Filter Colors:** Keep the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels only.

4. **Output:** form the output grid of size 3x3 from the filtered contents.
