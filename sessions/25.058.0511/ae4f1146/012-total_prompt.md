Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address the errors.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses on finding contiguous blocks of 1s (blue) and 8s (azure) and extracting a 3x3 subgrid from the top-rightmost block. This approach works for some cases but fails when:

1.  There are no 1s or 8s. The current code returns None.
2.  The top-right most block has a shape different than what can be fit into a 3x3.
3. There is no object that is considered the top-right most.

The strategy to resolve these will be to:

*   Revisit every example in the training set. I must include ALL examples.
*   Gather metrics about the results.
*   Update the natural language program, to include all conditions and provide better overall instructions.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output and the result from the current code:

```python
def code_execution(task):
    print(f"Task: {task['name']}")
    correct_count = 0
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output = example['output']
        predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
        if predicted_output == expected_output:
            correct_count += 1
            print(f"  Example: {example['id']} - Pass")

        else:
            print(f"  Example: {example['id']} - Fail")
            print(f"    Input: {input_grid}")
            print(f"    Expected Output: {expected_output}")
            print(f"    Predicted Output: {predicted_output}")

    print(f"  Passed {correct_count} of {len(task['train'])} examples")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find all pixels that are either blue (1) or azure (8).
2.  **Find Contiguous Blocks:** Group the target pixels into contiguous blocks, where contiguity is defined by 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right).
3.  **Locate Top-Rightmost Block:** Among all identified blocks, select the one whose top-right corner is furthest to the right. If there are multiple blocks with the same rightmost coordinate, select the one among those that is highest.
4. **Determine the Top-Right Coordinates:** Find the top right-most pixel of the top-rightmost block, by find the pixel with the largest column, and from these select the smallest row.
5.  **Extract 3x3 Subgrid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid's top-right corner is positioned at the top-right corner of the target block.
6. **Return Subgrid:** The 3 x 3 subgrid will be the ouput.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
