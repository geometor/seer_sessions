The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The colors present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid, specifically, colors azure (8) and blue (1) with white/background(0) removed. The output grid appears to be a concentrated representation of a pattern found within the input grid. It seems like a specific region within the larger input grid is selected and extracted to create the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
