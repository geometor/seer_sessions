## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 1 1 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 1 0 8 1 1
0 0 1 1 8 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 8
8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 1 0 8 1 8 0 0
1 8 8 0 1 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE90AFD0>

**output:**
```
8 1 1
1 1 1
8 1 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5F8F6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The input grid seems to have a scattered distribution of colors, while the output grid is significantly smaller and appears to contain a subset of the colors present in the input, arranged in a specific pattern. The colors azure (8) and blue(1) are of importance.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - colors: [0, 1, 8] # white, blue, azure
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [1, 8] # blue, azure
  - observation: output_grid_colors_subset_of_input_grid_colors: true
  - observation: The output grid contains only blue and azure pixels.
  - observation: The position and quantity of the colors seem to be a transformation.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the input.
  - location: center
    description: the sub-grid is composed of elements from the center area of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Focus on pixels with values 1 (blue) and 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Locate Central Region**: extract a region of the input grid, centered as much as possible.
3. **Extract Subgrid:** Create a 3x3 subgrid from the identified area composed only of azure and blue pixels.

In simple words, we take only the blue and azure pixels from the center of the input and put them on output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
