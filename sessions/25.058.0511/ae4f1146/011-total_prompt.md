Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the task, the results of the previous code execution, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code (which isn't provided but can be inferred from the `code_execution` function and the results) clearly didn't capture the core transformation logic. It seems like a very basic attempt, perhaps just extracting a small portion of the input grid. The results show that while the first example passed (likely by chance), all subsequent examples failed. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the understanding of the transformation. The strategy must shift from simple extraction to identifying the actual pattern manipulation. The consistent failure across varied input sizes points to a rule that's independent of the overall dimensions and focuses on specific object features.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Disregard the previous (incorrect) code logic. Focus intensely on the relationship between the input and output grids in *all* provided examples.
2.  **Identify Consistent Elements:** Look for consistent colors, shapes, or relative positions that are transformed in a predictable way across all examples.
3.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate a new hypothesis about the rule, describe it in natural language, and then prepare to translate that into updated code. It should account for all examples
4. Iterate the process - repeat steps as necessary

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on observations that might be relevant:

*   **Example 6d76b4v9-0:**
    *   Input: 7x10, mostly white (0), with a vertical line of blue(1), azure(8), blue(1), blue(1), azure(8).
    *   Output: 3x3, containing \[0, 0, 1], \[0, 0, 8], \[0, 0, 1]
    *   Result: Pass (likely coincidental)
*   **Example 6d76b4v9-1:**
    *   Input: 5x19, mostly white, with a group of blue(1), azure(8) at the top, mirrored with azure and blue below
    *   Output: 3x3, containing \[1, 1, 8], \[8, 1, 1], \[1, 8, 8]
    *   Result: Fail
*   **Example 6d76b4v9-2:**
    *   Input: 5x21 mostly white, group of 1, 1, and 8, mirrored below
    *   Output: 3x3, containing \[1, 1, 8], \[8, 1, 1], \[1, 8, 8]
    *   Result: Fail
*   **Example 6d76b4v9-3:**
    *   Input: 5x25, mostly white, group of 1, 1, and 8, mirrored below
    *   Output: 3x3, containing \[1, 1, 8], \[8, 1, 1], \[1, 8, 8]
    *   Result: Fail

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object_types:
    - color_blocks:
      - description: Contiguous regions of the same color.
      - colors: [blue, azure] # Observed colors so far
  - spatial_relationships:
    - mirrored_pattern: 
        description: A set of color appears in one section, mirroed in another
    - vertical_line:
        description: colored blocks appear vertically adjacent
  - transformations:
    - extraction:
      - description: Specific color blocks are extracted.
    - size_reduction:
      - description: The output grid is consistently smaller (3x3) than the input grids.
  - consistent_output_size:
    - height: 3
    - width: 3
  - consistent_colors:
    - blue: 1
    - azure: 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate connected blocks of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2. Find the vertical lines of blue (1) and azure (8)
3. Recreate the vertical lines in the top right corner of a 3 x 3 grid.
4. Ignore all other objects
5. Mirror the objects on all axis
6. The output grid is always 3x3.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
