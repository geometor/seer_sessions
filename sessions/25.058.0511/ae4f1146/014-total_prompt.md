## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0
8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0
8 8 8 0 1 8 8 0 0
8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 8
8 1 8 0 0 0 1 1 8
8 8 1 0 0 0 1 8 1
1 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE7FE8D0>

**output:**
```
8 1 8
1 1 8
1 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE909950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains primarily 'azure' (8) and 'blue' (1) pixels, with some 'white' (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a concentrated representation of the 'blue' and 'azure' pixels, specifically focusing on the 'blue' ones and their immediate 'azure' neighbors. The 'white' pixels are completely absent in the output. It appears we are extracting a specific sub-region, a cluster of blue and its surrounding azure, from the input.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x9
        elements: [0, 1, 8]  # white, blue, azure
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: [1, 8] # blue, azure

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        present_in: input_grid
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        present_in: [input_grid, output_grid]
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        present_in: [input_grid, output_grid]

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Isolates a specific region containing blue pixels and their immediate azure neighbors.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
   - relation: contains
     from: input_grid
     to: pixel

   - relation: adjacent
     description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner.
     from: pixel
     to: pixel
     
   - relation: composed_of
     from: output_grid
     to: a cluster of blue and its surrounding azure pixels in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all 'blue' (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Define Extraction Region:** Find the bounding box contains all the identified blue pixels in the previous step. The extracted region is defined as a cluster that includes:
    *   The 'blue' pixel itself.
    *   All immediately adjacent 'azure' (8) pixels (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, smaller grid (the output grid) by extracting the identified cluster/region from the input grid. The position information within the original grid may not important, the main object is to extract and reconstruct the sub-grid.
4. **Discard other pixels:** Any pixel which not belong to the target sub-grid should be ignored.

In essence, the transformation rule extracts a subgrid from the input, where the subgrid is defined by the location of blue pixels and their immediate azure neighbors. The rest of the input grid is discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
