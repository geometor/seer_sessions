The input grid contains primarily 'azure' (8) and 'blue' (1) pixels, with some 'white' (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a concentrated representation of the 'blue' and 'azure' pixels, specifically focusing on the 'blue' ones and their immediate 'azure' neighbors. The 'white' pixels are completely absent in the output. It appears we are extracting a specific sub-region, a cluster of blue and its surrounding azure, from the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The extracted region is defined as a cluster that includes:\n    *   The 'blue' pixel itself.\n    *   All immediately adjacent 'azure' (8) pixels (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, smaller grid (the output grid) by extracting the identified cluster/region from the input grid. The position information within the original grid may not important, the main object is to extract and reconstruct the sub-grid.\n4. **Discard other pixels:** Any pixel which not belong to the target sub-grid should be ignored.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule extracts a subgrid from the input, where the subgrid is defined by the location of blue pixels and their immediate azure neighbors. The rest of the input grid is discarded.\n"
