Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to double the width of the input grid. The central pattern of alternating red (2) and azure (8) pixels in rows 1 and 2 (0-indexed) is extended, while the surrounding white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with double the width, filled with white (0)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols * 2), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid rows
    for i in range(rows):
        if i == 1 or i == 2:  # Rows with the alternating pattern (0-indexed)
            # Extend the pattern by duplicating each pixel
            k=0
            for j in range(cols):
                output_grid[i, k] = input_grid[i, j]
                output_grid[i, k+1] = input_grid[i, j]
                k+=2
        else:
            # Copy the white rows, extending their width.
            for j in range(cols * 2):
               output_grid[i,j]=0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved doubling the width and extending a specific alternating color pattern. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that the transformation rule is slightly more complex, as not just duplicating each pixels. It seems that we should duplicate based on the object and the input object properties.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Analysis of Each Example:** I will examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to how objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) are transformed, not just individual pixels.
2.  **Object-Based Reasoning:** I'll shift the focus from pixel-level operations to object-level operations. This means identifying objects, their properties (color, size, position), and how these properties change in the output.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the object-level analysis, I'll update the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation rule.
4. **YAML documentation**: create a set of facts based on the observations

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

Let's examine each input-output pair:

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to double the width of the input grid while maintaining the same number of rows. Each object within the input grid, defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color, is duplicated horizontally. The white background (color 0) is also extended to fill the remaining space in the doubled-width output grid. The row and col position is preserved.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
