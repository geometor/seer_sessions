The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid appears to have a single horizontal line of alternating red and green pixels, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid seems to be an expansion of this line, creating a wider line using the same pattern while maintaining symmetry.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
