The input grid has a height of 5 and width of 8, while output grid keeps it shape, increasing the width of the colored pattern, duplicating each colored pixel. The white (0) background remains unchanged. The colored band seems to be \"stretched\" horizontally.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Double colored pixels, keeping theyr shape.\n4. **Horizontal Stretch:** For each column within the colored band, duplicate it to the immediate right. This effectively doubles the width of each original colored column, keeping they original colored grid shape.\n5 the output keeps background size and shape\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to horizontally stretch the colored band by duplicating each of its columns while leaving the white background untouched.\n"
