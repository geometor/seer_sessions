## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
2 8 2 8 2 8
2 8 2 8 2 8
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x320 at 0x7B1DDE6A1850>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 8 2 8 2 8 2 8 2 8 2 8
2 8 2 8 2 8 2 8 2 8 2 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x320 at 0x7B1DDE90AFD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The input grid seems to be a subset or a cropped version of the output grid. The main feature is two rows of alternating red and azure pixels. The output grid expands the width of these rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 6
      colors: [0, 2, 8]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 12
      colors: [0, 2, 8]
  - name: pattern_rows
    type: object
    properties:
      rows: [1, 2] # Rows 1 and 2 (0-indexed) of the input grid
      pattern: alternating
      colors: [2, 8]

actions:
 - name: extend_width
   description: The width of the pattern rows is doubled.

relationships:
  - object1: input_grid
    object2: output_grid
    relation: input_grid is a cropped version of the central part of output_grid
  - object1: pattern_rows
    object2: output_grid
    relation: pattern_rows are extended horizontally in the output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** Locate the two rows (rows 1 and 2, 0-indexed) in the input grid that contain the alternating pattern of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Extend the width:** Double the width of these two rows. Each pixel in the original rows is duplicated to the right of itself.

3.  **Preserve other parts:** Keep the rest of the grid (rows 0, 3, and 4) filled with white (0) and same length as extended rows.

In simpler terms the width of input image is doubled. The central pattern is simply extended, while keeping the surrounding white pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
