## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 1 2 4
0 0 0 1 2 4 0
0 0 1 2 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7B1DDE6E0AD0>

**output:**
```
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of digits (representing colors) into another grid of digits. The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of non-zero digits (1, 2, and 4 - blue, red, and yellow) emanating from the bottom-left corner, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to have a repeating checkerboard-like pattern using only the digits 1, 2, and 4, with no zeros. The dimensions of the input and output grids are different (7x7 input, 7x7 output).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains a diagonal pattern of non-zero digits (1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Input grid contains zeros surrounding the diagonal.
  - observation: Output grid contains only digits 1, 2, and 4.
  - observation: Output grid exhibits a repeating checkerboard-like pattern.
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - relationship: The non-zero digits in the input (1, 2, 4) are the same digits present in the output.
  - object: Input_grid
    properties:
        dimensions: 7x7
        elements: [0, 1, 2, 4]
  - object: Output_grid
    properties:
       dimensions: 7x7
       elements: [1,2,4]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Ignore the input grid entirely, except for knowing which values appear.** Observe the distinct non-zero values present in the input grid; in this case, they are 1, 2, and 4.
2.  **Create output grid.** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7).
3. **Populate checkerboard.** Construct a repeating checkerboard pattern within the output grid, cycling through the observed non zero values (1, 2, and 4) in that specific sequence. Start with value '2' in the top left cell. Horizontally the sequence across a row is always: 2,4,1
Vertically down a column the sequence is also always: 2,4,1

Essentially the output ignores the input data and constructs the output grid with a size and values taken from the input, but in a new sequence.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
