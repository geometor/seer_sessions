## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 3 0
0 0 0 8 3 0 0
0 0 8 3 0 0 0
0 8 3 0 0 0 4
8 3 0 0 0 4 0
3 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7B1DDE6E0AD0>

**output:**
```
4 8 3 4 8 3 4
8 3 4 8 3 4 8
3 4 8 3 4 8 3
4 8 3 4 8 3 4
8 3 4 8 3 4 8
3 4 8 3 4 8 3
4 8 3 4 8 3 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to contain a diagonal line of non-zero values (8, 3) extending from the top right to the bottom left, with another diagonal of non-zero values (4) extending from the middle right to the middle down. The rest of the grid consists of zeros. The output grid seems to be a patterned repetition of the non-zero values, without the zeros. The output keeps the original dimensions (7x7).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains a diagonal pattern of non-zero values.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains a repeating pattern derived from the input grid's non-zero values.
  - name: diagonal_pattern_1
    type: sequence
    elements: [8, 3]
    description: Values on the main diagonal.
  - name: diagonal_pattern_2
    type: sequence
    elements: [4]
    description: second group of values

actions:
  - name: extract_pattern
    description: Identify and extract the non-zero values and their repeating structure.
  - name: replicate_pattern
    description:  Repeat pattern across entire grid based on original position.
  - name: replace
    description: Replace all '0' with other values based on its position, related to the position of the non-zero values in the input.
relationships:
  - input_output_dimension_match: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - pattern_replication: The output grid's pattern is derived from the non-zero elements of the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Values:** Find the non-zero values in the input grid, along with their row and column indices. In this example, they are 8, 3, and 4.
2. **Establish the Repeating Unit:** The input's non-zero digits, positioned in a particular order, forms the basic repeating unit for the output.
3. **Construct Output:** The output grid maintains the same size. Starting with the value '4', construct the first column and rows as '4 8 3'. Repeat them to form the full output matrix. It appears to depend on the relative index distance with the non-zero digits.

In essence, the transformation extracts the non-zero values and their relative positions, and replicates that pattern, with spacing, throughout the output grid of the original size.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
