The input grid appears to have a smaller, distinct pattern in the top-left corner, while the rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be an expansion or tiling of this initial pattern. The colors involved are red (2), azure (8), green (3), and white (0). The core pattern appears to be a 3x3 block in the upper left. The output replaces the white pixels with a repeating pattern derived by extending the columns and rows, with the colors alternating.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
