Previous Code:
```python
# Example of analysis I'd ideally perform (this is illustrative)
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_dims = input_grid.shape
    output_dims = output_grid.shape
    input_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    output_colors = np.unique(output_grid)

    print(f"Input Dimensions: {input_dims}")
    print(f"Output Dimensions: {output_dims}")
    print(f"Input Colors: {input_colors}")
    print(f"Output Colors: {output_colors}")

    # Simplified cell-by-cell comparison (would be more detailed in actual code)
    comparison = input_grid == output_grid
    print(f"Cells Matching: {np.sum(comparison)} / {comparison.size}")

# --- Assume this analysis was performed for each example ---

# Example:  If I had the first example, the report might look like:
# --- Example 1 Report (Illustrative)---
# Input Dimensions: (3, 3)
# Output Dimensions: (3, 3)
# Input Colors: [0 1 2 4]
# Output Colors: [0 1 2 4]
# Cells Matching: 3 / 9  (the black '0' squares)

# --- Example 2 Report (Illustrative)---
# Input Dimensions: (4, 4)
# Output Dimensions: (4, 4)
# Input Colors: [0 1 2]
# Output Colors: [0 1 2]
# Cells Matching: 7 / 16

# --- Example 3 Report (Illustrative)---
# Input Dimensions: (5, 5)
# Output Dimensions: (5, 5)
# Input Colors: [0 1 4]
# Output Colors: [0 1 4]
# Cells Matching: 13 / 25
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
