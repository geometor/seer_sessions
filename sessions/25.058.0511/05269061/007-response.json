The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of non-zero digits (1, 2, and 4 - blue, red, and yellow) emanating from the bottom-left corner, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to have a repeating checkerboard-like pattern using only the digits 1, 2, and 4, with no zeros. The dimensions of the input and output grids are different (7x7 input, 7x7 output).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Start with value '2' in the top left cell. Horizontally the sequence across a row is always: 2,4,1\nVertically down a column the sequence is also always: 2,4,1\n\nEssentially the output ignores the input data and constructs the output grid with a size and values taken from the input, but in a new sequence.\n"
