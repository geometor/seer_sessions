Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies the colors in the input grid and uses them to construct the output grid. It operates on vertical slices of 3 rows. For each 3xn slice (where n is the width of the input), it places those same colors into the output grid. Subsequent slices shift the colors downward by one position, wrapping the bottom color to the top. Finally, if a cell in the output grid has the same color as the cell directly above it, that cell is changed to black (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
