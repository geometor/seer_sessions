facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids always have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The output grid uses the same non-zero colors as the input grid, including zero.
  - observation: |
      The transformation is not a simple color replacement; the spatial arrangement of colors changes.
  - observation: |
       The input non-zero colors form the basis of the output colors.
  - observation: |
      The prior checkerboard logic does not hold across all test examples.
  - observation: |
      There is a pattern in the output grids based on the positions of the cells, though not a typical checkerboard.

      example_1: Input colors [0, 1, 2, 4] produce an output that uses those same values, but rearranged.
      example_2: Input colors [0, 1, 2] produce an output that uses those same values, but rearranged.
      example_3: Input colors [0, 1, 4] produce an output that uses those same values, but rearranged.
