facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains a diagonal pattern of non-zero digits (1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Input grid contains zeros surrounding the diagonal.
  - observation: Output grid contains only digits 1, 2, and 4.
  - observation: Output grid exhibits a repeating checkerboard-like pattern.
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - relationship: The non-zero digits in the input (1, 2, 4) are the same digits present in the output.
