Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies a 3x3 pattern in the top-left corner of the input grid and extends it both vertically and horizontally to fill the entire output grid. The extension maintains the relative positions of the colors within the pattern and alternates them in the rows and columms.
"""

import numpy as np

def get_top_left_pattern(grid):
    """Extracts the 3x3 top-left pattern from the input grid."""
    return grid[:3, :3]

def extend_pattern(input_grid):
    """Extends the 3x3 top-left pattern to fill the output grid."""
    pattern = get_top_left_pattern(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # build first three columns
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(rows):
            output_grid[j,i] = pattern[j % 3, i]

    # extend the pattern horizontally
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3,cols):
            output_grid[:,j] = np.roll(output_grid[:,j-3],1)  # shift the colors to the right

    return output_grid

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by extending the top-left 3x3 pattern."""
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    output_grid = extend_pattern(input_grid)


    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying and extending a 3x3 pattern was partially successful. The first example, which was used to generate the code worked well, but the code does not accurately transform the second example, and only a small part of the third. This indicates that the transformation rule is more complex than a simple extension of the top-left 3x3 pattern. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of how the pattern is extended and an assumption the 3x3 top left corner will be extended.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all training examples, paying close attention to how colors and shapes relate to each other within and between the input and output grids. Don't fixate on the top-left corner.
2.  **Identify the *Real* Pattern Unit:** Determine the *actual* repeating unit, which might not be 3x3, and is likely dependent on the color.
3.  **Precise Pattern Repetition Logic:** Figure out the exact rule governing how the pattern unit repeats. This may involve rotations, reflections, or other manipulations, in addition to simple repetition.
4.   Document the changes in the pattern from input to output.

**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` where applicable):**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the observed results, along with some attempts to use code to get more precise data:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Shape:** (11, 11)
*   **Output Shape:** (11, 11)
*   **Result:** Correct. The initial 3x3 pattern (blue, green, yellow; green, yellow, blue; yellow, blue, green) is correctly extended, with a rightward shift to the colors.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Shape:** (15, 15)
*   **Output Shape:** (15, 15)
*   **Result:** Incorrect. The code output shows a 3x3 pattern of only two colors in an input grid of three colors. The initial 3x3 are extended. The output is an alternating two-color pattern.
*   **Expected output analysis:** There is no 3x3 pattern of three colors in either input or output. The output alternates two colors in an intricate pattern.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input Shape:** (30, 30)
*   **Output Shape:** (30, 30)
*  **Result:** Partially Correct. It appears that the basic premise of extending a color-alternating, shifted pattern is on track, but the initial 3x3 pattern is wrong. The test extends this same pattern, but the extension is not correctly implemented.
* **Expected output analysis:** Output uses the colors of the input, plus black. It extends a pattern of three colors in vertical stripes and alternates rows of the pattern.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        shape: (11, 11)
        colors: [blue, green, yellow]
        pattern_unit: [3x3, top-left, color-shifting]
      output:
        shape: (11, 11)
        pattern_extended: True
      result: correct
  - example_2:
      input:
        shape: (15, 15)
        colors: [red, gray, green]
        pattern_unit: [undetermined]
      output:
        shape: (15, 15)
        pattern_extended: False
        dominant_colors: [gray, green]
      result: incorrect
  - example_3:
      input:
          shape: (30,30)
          colors: [yellow, azure, orange]
      output:
          shape: (30,30)
          colors: [yellow, azure, orange, black]
      result: partially_correct

```

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify Repeating Colors:** The output grid is constructed by identifying the colors present in the input grid.
2.  **Create color groupings:** For each 3 x n slice of the grid (where n = width of input), note the color and repeat in the same position in the output.
3.  **Color shift:** The next slice of the output is generated by rotating the colors in the first slice down one and placing the last color in the first position.
4.  **Introduce Black:** Where ever there are colors that are the same above and below each other, change the cell to black (value 0)

This revised program incorporates the color shifting. It moves away from a fixed 3x3 pattern and recognizes that the size is the pattern unit, which is determined by color repetition.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
