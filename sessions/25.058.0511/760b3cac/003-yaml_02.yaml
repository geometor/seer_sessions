rules:
  - azure_placement: "Azure pixels move to the leftmost available position in their row.  If a yellow object blocks movement in that row, azure moves as far left as possible. Azure pixels do not move to available positions in rows, they stack.  If azure is present in multiple rows, the filled azure pixels will occupy the same row position as the source azure."
  - yellow_placement: "Yellow pixels remain in their original positions."
