            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to all cases. The main issue seems to be the handling of the azure shape's transformation. The code assumes a specific configuration of the vertical and horizontal parts of the azure shape, and movement and extension that worked for first example, is wrong for other examples. The yellow shape is not causing any errors, but maintaining that shape can be simplified by just re-applying color.\n\nThe strategy to address the errors is:\n\n1.  **Improve Shape Detection:** Instead of separate vertical and horizontal detection, a more robust way will just consider the whole object as a single connected component.\n2.  **Context-Dependent Movement:** The new approach will account for all pixels, not just an assumption about a single vertical element.\n3. **Simplify and Generalize**: use more basic numpy operations\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations and metrics:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Azure shape resembling a rotated 'T'. Yellow shape is a single pixel.\n*   **Expected Output:** The vertical part of the azure 'T' extends horizontally and shifts up.\n*   **Actual Output:** Correct.\n*   **Observations:** The initial code worked as intended for this specific configuration.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Azure shape is a vertical line. Yellow shape is a 2x2 square.\n*   **Expected Output:** The azure line extends horizontally to become a 3-pixel wide line, and positioned one row above.\n*   **Actual Output:** Partial, only two added to azure, not three.\n*    **Observations:** The extension logic only adds one pixel at each end (left, right).\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Azure shape is a horizontal line. Yellow shape is a diagonal line.\n*   **Expected Output:** Azure shape remains unchanged, and yellow shape remains.\n*   **Actual Output:** Correct.\n*    **Observations:** initial code assumption was that vertical part would move.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      objects:\n        - shape_1:\n            color: azure\n            type: \"T-shape\"\n            action: \"vertical part extends horizontally and moves up\"\n        - shape_2:\n            color: yellow\n            type: \"single pixel\"\n            action: \"remains unchanged\"\n  - example_2:\n      objects:\n        - shape_1:\n            color: azure\n            type: \"vertical line\"\n            action: \"extends horizontally and moves up\"\n        - shape_2:\n            color: yellow\n            type: \"2x2 square\"\n            action: \"remains unchanged\"\n  - example_3:\n      objects:\n        - shape_1:\n            color: azure\n            type: \"horizontal line\"\n            action: \"remains unchanged\"\n        - shape_2:\n            color: yellow\n            type: \"diagonal line\"\n            action: \"remains unchanged\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (color 8) and yellow (color 4).\n2.  **Preserve Yellow:** The yellow object remains in its original position and shape. Simply copy the yellow pixels to the output grid.\n3. **Transform Azure**:\n    *   Locate all pixels with color 8 (azure)\n    *   Remove all original azure pixels, making them white (color 0)\n    *   Determine the bounding box of these azure pixels.\n    *   Extend one row above the original bounding box\n    *   Within the extended row, make all cells the same color as the original azure.\n4. **Output**: Return the final, transformed grid.\n"
