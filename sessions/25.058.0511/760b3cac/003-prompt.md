Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all azure (8) pixels and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Immobile Object:** The yellow (4) object remains unchanged.
3.  **Mobile objects:** The azure (8) pixels are mobile.
4.  **Transformation rule:**
    1.  The azure(8) color fills or moves to the leftmost position of its own row, as far as available, without wrapping to other rows.
    2.  If there is remaining azure after a row is filled, they are put in the leftmost available spot.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
