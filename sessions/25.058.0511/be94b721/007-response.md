Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). The output is a smaller grid, seemingly extracted from the input. The colors in the input are: white (0), green (3), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The output grid consists entirely of yellow (4) pixels. The yellow pixels in the input form a 2x2 contiguous block. The magenta pixels are only on the edge. The position of the yellow block in input is in the middle.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      name: input_grid
      dimensions: [5, 10]
      colors: [0, 3, 4, 6]  # white, green, yellow, magenta
    elements:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: 4  # yellow
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: [2, 2]
        position: (1,3)
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: 3
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: [3,1]
        position: (1,0)

  - type: grid
    properties:
      name: output_grid
      dimensions: [3, 2]
      colors: [4]  # yellow
    elements:
      - type: contiguous_block
        color: 4  # yellow
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: [3, 2]

actions:
  - type: extract
    object: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    parameters:
      color: 4  # yellow
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the largest contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract** a rectangle that includes all instances of the largest contiguous block. In this case, this is a 2x2 square.
3.   **Create** a filled rectangle from the shape extracted.
4.  **Output** the resulting 3x2 grid filled with yellow.
