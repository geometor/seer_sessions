The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of it. The output grid only includes non-white color from the third row, that is, it is not a simple sub-region selection. It appears that some selection or filtering criteria are applied based on position and possibly color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
