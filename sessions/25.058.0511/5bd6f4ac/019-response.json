The output is a smaller grid (3x3) also containing single-digit numbers (0-9). The output grid seems to be a drastically simplified version of the input, with a significant reduction in both size and the number of non-zero elements. The output grid's values and colors are present in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

From the second row, same process finds green (3). From the third row, the most bottom, right is also green (3).\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n4.  **Populate the new grid** with the selected pixels. Starting at top-right corner and going down to up: yellow (4) is at (0,2), green (3) is at (1,0) and the last green (3) is at (2,2).\n5. **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells in the output grid are filled with 0 (white).\n\nIn summary, the transformation selects a very specific pixel of all non-zero pixels from the input grid and arranges them in specific fixed coordinates into a smaller 3x3 grid, filling the rest with zeros.\n"
