## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 3
0 1 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 7 0 0 2 0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DE5E21450>

**output:**
```
0 0 4
3 0 0
0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5E216D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (9x9) containing single-digit numbers (0-9), representing different colors. The output is a smaller grid (3x3) also containing single-digit numbers (0-9). The output grid seems to be a drastically simplified version of the input, with a significant reduction in both size and the number of non-zero elements. The output grid's values and colors are present in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x9
        elements: integers (0-9)
        color_map:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: integers (0-9)
        color_map:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: derived from value using color_map

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Selects specific pixels from the input_grid.
  - type: arrangement
    description: Arranges the selected pixels into a new, smaller grid (output_grid).

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: pixels
  - output_grid_contains: pixels
  - output_grid_pixels: subset_of: input_grid_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels with a value other than 0.
2. **Select Specific Non-Zero Pixels** From the upper-right corner of input grid select the pixel at the most-bottom and most-right, in this case yellow (4). From the second row, same process finds green (3). From the third row, the most bottom, right is also green (3).
3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Populate the new grid** with the selected pixels. Starting at top-right corner and going down to up: yellow (4) is at (0,2), green (3) is at (1,0) and the last green (3) is at (2,2).
5. **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells in the output grid are filled with 0 (white).

In summary, the transformation selects a very specific pixel of all non-zero pixels from the input grid and arranges them in specific fixed coordinates into a smaller 3x3 grid, filling the rest with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
