Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid from the input grid,
regardless of the input grid's size. The subgrid will always contain the
bottom-right corner pixel, and extends upwards and leftwards to create a 3x3
square.

    Extracts the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.  If the input
    grid has fewer than 3 rows or columns, it effectively takes as much of
    the bottom-right corner as possible to construct a 3x3 grid filled mostly
    with 0, but with the values of the bottom right corner of the input grid.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
