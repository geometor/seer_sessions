The colors are represented by digits 0-9. The input grid seems to have a lot of '0' (white) pixels, suggesting a sparse matrix. The output grid is much smaller and appears to contain a selection of non-zero pixels from the input grid, but not all. It does preserve the arrangement. It appears to be the lower right 3x3 corner.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
