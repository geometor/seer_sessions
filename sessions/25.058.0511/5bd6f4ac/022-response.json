            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding from the first training example. While it correctly identified the bottom-right non-zero pixel, it made incorrect assumptions about where to place that pixel's value in the output grid. The additional examples demonstrate that the rule is simpler: find the bottom-right non-zero pixel in the *entire* input grid, and place its value in the bottom-right cell of the output grid. The initial attempt to divide the input grid into sections and process those sections individually is incorrect.\n\nThe overall strategy should be to simplify the `transform` function. The concept of the bottom-right pixel remains, but its application needs to be generalized to the whole input grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, highlighting what it reveals about the transformation rule:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has a 7 in the bottom right. Output has a 7 in the bottom right. This aligns with the \"bottom-right\" concept.\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 9), Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    * Result: Correct\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a 7 in the bottom right and a 5 on the second row. Output has a 7 in the bottom right.\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 9), Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    * Result: Correct\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has 7 on row six. Output is 7 at bottom right.\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 9), Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    * Result: Correct\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n      * Input has 7 and 6. Output is 7 at bottom right.\n      * Input Shape: (9, 9), Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    * Result: Correct\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n     * Input has 6 and 7. Output is 7 at bottom right.\n      * Input Shape: (9, 9), Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    * Result: Correct\n\nAll examples are consistent in their results. The existing code gets the correct answer but is using an incorrect procedure.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"The input is a 2D grid of integers representing colors.\"\n    type: \"input_grid_property\"\n    values:\n      data_type: \"integer_grid\"\n      dimensions: 2\n\n  - description: \"The output is a 3x3 2D grid of integers representing colors.\"\n    type: \"output_grid_property\"\n    values:\n      data_type: \"integer_grid\"\n      dimensions: 2\n      shape: [3, 3]\n\n  - description: \"The bottom-right non-zero pixel in the input grid determines the bottom-right value in the output.\"\n    type: \"transformation_rule\"\n    input: \"input_grid\"\n    output: \"output_grid\"\n    operation: \"find_bottom_right_nonzero\"\n    value_placement: [2,2]\n\n  - description: \"All other cells in the output grid are zero.\"\n    type: \"output_grid_property\"\n    values:\n      default_value: 0\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** A 2D grid of integers (colors).\n2.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of integers.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Find the bottom-right non-zero pixel in the entire input grid.\n    *   Set the value of the bottom-right cell (index \\[2, 2]) of the output grid to the value of the found pixel.\n    *   All other cells in the output grid are 0.\n"
