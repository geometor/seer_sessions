## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0
0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x192 at 0x7B1DDE42C350>

**output:**
```
0 3 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 5 0
0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern with alternating gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces green (3) pixels in a seemingly specific pattern, replacing some of the white (0) pixels while leaving the gray (5) pixels unchanged. The dimensions of the grid (3x12) remain consistent between input and output. The key seems to be determining where the green pixels are placed in relation to the existing gray and white ones.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x12
      elements: integers (0-9)
      pattern: alternating gray(5) and white(0) in checkerboard
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x12
      elements: integers (0-9)
      pattern: retains gray(5) from input, replaces some white(0) with green(3)
  - action: transformation
    description: replace white pixels with green ones, in locations determined to the existing pattern.
  - relationship: element_correspondence
    description: some white pixels transform to green, while gray pixels remain the same, dimensions remain constant
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Gray:** Copy all gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions.
3.  **Identify White Pixel Replacement:** Examine the input. Iterate to find white pixles. For every *other* white(0) pixel in each row, starting with the first white pixel, replace with green pixels.
4.   **Translate** replace white(0) pixels from the input with green(3), starting at position \[0,1].


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
