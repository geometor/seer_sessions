The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern with alternating gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces green (3) pixels in a seemingly specific pattern, replacing some of the white (0) pixels while leaving the gray (5) pixels unchanged. The dimensions of the grid (3x12) remain consistent between input and output. The key seems to be determining where the green pixels are placed in relation to the existing gray and white ones.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Iterate to find white pixles.
