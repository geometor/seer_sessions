The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x14). The transformation appears to involve changing some of the gray (5) pixels to green (3), and it seems the pattern is related to their position.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
