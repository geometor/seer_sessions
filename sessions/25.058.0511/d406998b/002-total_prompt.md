## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7B1DDE42C350>

**output:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3
0 3 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions (3x10). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids appears to be the selective replacement of some '5' (gray) pixels with '3' (green) pixels. The positions of the '0' (white) pixels remain unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all pixels with the value '5' (gray).
3.  **Change** some of the pixels with value 5 to to the value '3' (green) using this logic:
   * going from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, keep the first two gray pixels, then change the next one to green. Repeat this pattern.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
