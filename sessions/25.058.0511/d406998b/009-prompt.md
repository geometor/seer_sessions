Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replaces some white (0) pixels with green (3) pixels in a grid, while keeping gray (5) pixels unchanged. The replacement pattern for white pixels involves alternating replacements, starting with the first encountered white pixel in each row.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and values as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each row of the grid.
    for r in range(rows):
        # Keep track of whether to replace the next white pixel.
        replace_next_white = True
        # Iterate through each column of the current row.
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check if the current pixel is white (0).
            if output_grid[r, c] == 0:
                # If we should replace this white pixel, change it to green (3).
                if replace_next_white:
                    output_grid[r, c] = 3
                # Toggle the replacement flag.
                replace_next_white = not replace_next_white

    # Return the modified grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
