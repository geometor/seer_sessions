Previous Code:
```python
"""
Examine the input grid. Identify all pixels with the value '5' (gray).
Change some of the pixels with value 5 to to the value '3' (green) using this logic:
Going from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, keep the first two gray pixels, then change the next one to green. Repeat this pattern.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find the positions of all '5' (gray) pixels
    gray_positions = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)
    
    # Counter for the pattern (keep 2, change 1)
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the positions and apply the transformation
    for pos in gray_positions:
        if count < 2:
            count += 1
        else:
            output_grid[pos[0], pos[1]] = 3
            count = 0

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
