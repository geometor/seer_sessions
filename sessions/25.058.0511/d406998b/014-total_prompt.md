## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5
0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=832x192 at 0x7B1DDE42C350>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 0
3 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 5 0 0 3
0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0
```

Okay, here's a report on my perception of the task, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are of the same dimensions (3x13). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), gray (5), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the gray (5) and white(0) pixels to green (3).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 3 (green).
  - observation: Some white(0) pixels in the input become green(3) in the output.
  - observation: Some gray(5) pixels stay the same, while others don't change
  - object: pixels
    properties:
      color: [0, 5, 3]  # Possible color values
    possible_actions:
      - change_color:
          from: 0
          to: 3
      - change_color:
          from: 5
          to: 3
      - no_change
    relationships:
      - spatial: adjacent # Pixels are next to each other
      - pattern: diagonal # We check diagonal.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.

2.  **Gray to Green conversion**: Iterate through each cell of the input grid.

    * If a pixel on the top row is white(0), and the very next pixel to right diagonally downwards is also white(0), change this top row pixel to green(3)

3.  **White to green conversion**: Iterate row by row.
    *   If a pixel on the leftmost column is white (0) and the pixel diagonally to its bottom right is also 0, change color to 3(green).
    *   If any white(0) pixel on any other column has a white(0) pixel on both of its sides, it transforms to green(3).

4.  **Copy Unchanged:** All other pixels, including original gray(5) that don't meet any of the above condition remains gray(5). Pixels that are not changed are copied directly from the input to the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
