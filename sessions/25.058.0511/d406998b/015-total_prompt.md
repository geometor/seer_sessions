Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Gray to Green conversion**: Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    * If a pixel on the top row is white(0), and the very next pixel to right diagonally downwards is also white(0), change this top row pixel to green(3)
3.  **White to green conversion**: Iterate row by row.
    *   If a pixel on the leftmost column is white (0) and the pixel diagonally to its bottom right is also 0, change color to 3(green).
    *   If any white(0) pixel on any other column has a white(0) pixel on both of its sides, it transforms to green(3).
4.  **Copy Unchanged:** All other pixels, including original gray(5) that don't meet any of the above condition remains gray(5). Pixels that are not changed are copied directly from the input to the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
