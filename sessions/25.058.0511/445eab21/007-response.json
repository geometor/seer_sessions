The input grid contains two distinct shapes formed by connected pixels of the same color: one magenta (6) and one orange (7). The output grid is significantly smaller and consists only of orange (7) pixels arranged in a 2x2 square. The input has a significant amount of white (0) background. The key difference seems to be a drastic reduction in size and the selection of only the orange shape.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
