Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the results of the preliminary `transform` function.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis (likely based on the first example) seems to be that the output is always a 2x2 grid filled with azure (color 8). While this holds true for all provided examples, it's clearly an oversimplification. The input grids vary in size and contain gray (color 5) pixels in addition to azure, but the output is consistently a 2x2 azure grid. This suggests a reduction or extraction rule, focusing on the presence of azure and likely ignoring other colors. The strategy should be to:

1.  **Confirm Output Consistency:** Verify that *all* output grids are indeed 2x2 azure grids. The current code checks the `match`, but does not explicitly verify the content.
2.  **Identify the Trigger:** Determine what, if anything, beyond the mere presence of azure is required to produce the 2x2 output. The gray pixels seem irrelevant. It does *not* require a 2x2 block, as shown by the later grids.
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the analysis, create a more precise natural language program and subsequently update the Python code.

**Metrics and Observations (using provided code)**

The provided `analyze_example` function is already doing a pretty good job, we just need to inspect its results. Let's look for relevant metrics in the printed output.

```
--- Example 1 ---
Input Shape: (15, 25)
Input Colors: [5 8]
Number of Objects: 51
Object Colors: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8]
Output Shape: (2, 2)
Output Colors: [8]
Has 2x2 Azure Subgrid: False
Predicted Output Matches Expected: True

--- Example 2 ---
Input Shape: (6, 18)
Input Colors: [5 8]
Number of Objects: 13
Object Colors: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8]
Output Shape: (2, 2)
Output Colors: [8]
Has 2x2 Azure Subgrid: False
Predicted Output Matches Expected: True

--- Example 3 ---
Input Shape: (8, 13)
Input Colors: [5 8]
Number of Objects: 25
Object Colors: [8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8]
Output Shape: (2, 2)
Output Colors: [8]
Has 2x2 Azure Subgrid: False
Predicted Output Matches Expected: True

--- Example 4 ---
Input Shape: (5, 13)
Input Colors: [5 8]
Number of Objects: 9
Object Colors: [5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5]
Output Shape: (2, 2)
Output Colors: [8]
Has 2x2 Azure Subgrid: False
Predicted Output Matches Expected: True

--- Example 5 ---
Input Shape: (6, 15)
Input Colors: [5 8]
Number of Objects: 13
Object Colors: [8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8]
Output Shape: (2, 2)
Output Colors: [8]
Has 2x2 Azure Subgrid: False
Predicted Output Matches Expected: True

```
Key Observations:

*   **Consistent Output:** All output shapes are (2, 2) and contain only color 8 (azure).
*   **Variable Input:** Input shapes and the number of objects vary significantly.
*    **Gray Irrelevance**: The gray pixels seem to have no influence.
*   **Azure Presence:** All input grids contain azure (color 8).
*    2x2 Subgrid is *not* required.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: All output grids are 2x2 in size.
    type: observation
    attribute: output_shape
    value: (2, 2)
  - description: All output grids contain only the color azure (8).
    type: observation
    attribute: output_colors
    value: [8]
  - description: Input grids contain azure (8) and gray (5) pixels.
    type: observation
    attribute: input_colors
    value: [5, 8]
  - description: The presence of a 2x2 azure subgrid is not required for the transformation.
    type: observation
    attribute: has_2x2_azure
    value: False
    
  - description: The transform function always returns the expected result
    type: observation
    attribute: match
    value: True

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Check for Azure:** Examine the input grid to determine if it contains any pixels of color 8 (azure).
2.  **Create Output:** If azure is present, create a 2x2 grid filled entirely with azure (color 8).
3. If azure is not present, the behavior is undefined by the provided examples. We will assume for now that the presence of Azure is a requirement.
