## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DDE739B50>

**output:**
```
7 7
7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7B1DDE6A1850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). The input grid contains two distinct shapes formed by connected pixels of the same color: one magenta (6) and one orange (7). The output grid is significantly smaller and consists only of orange (7) pixels arranged in a 2x2 square. The input has a significant amount of white (0) background. The key difference seems to be a drastic reduction in size and the selection of only the orange shape.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains two distinct colored shapes.
    details:
      - shape1: color: magenta (6), location: top-left quadrant
      - shape2: color: orange (7), location: bottom-center, resembles a filled rectangle with a single-pixel wide "hole" in the middle
  - observation: Output grid contains only one color.
    details:
      - color: orange (7)
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller than the input grid.
    details:
      - input_shape: 10x10
      - output_shape: 2x2
  - observation: The output shape matches the color of one of the input shapes.
    details:
        - selected_color: orange (7)
  - observation: Output grid is a 2x2 square.
    details:
      - shape: square
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize distinct colored shapes within the input grid. A shape is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Select Target Object**: From the identified colored shapes, select an orange colored object.
3.  **Determine Bounding Box**: find a minimal bounding rectangle of the orange object.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 2x2 grid.
5. **Fill Output**: fill all cells in the output grid as orange.

In short the program could be considered as, select an orange colored object, output a 2x2 grid filled with orange.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
