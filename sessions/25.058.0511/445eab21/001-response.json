The input grid contains two distinct shapes, one orange (7) and one azure (8). The output grid consists only of azure (8) pixels, arranged in a 2x2 square. The orange shape and all white (0) pixels are absent from the output. It appears that the transformation is selecting a specific object based on color and possibly shape, and extracting a sub-grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
