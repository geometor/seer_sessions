The input grid contains two distinct objects, identifiable by their colors: yellow (4) and red (2). The yellow object forms a larger, hollow square-like shape. The red object forms a smaller, filled square in the bottom right corner. The output grid seems to consist of only a subset of the input. The back ground color is white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
