## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DDE4FAED0>

**output:**
```
4 4
4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7B1DDE6A1850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains two distinct objects, identifiable by their colors: yellow (4) and red (2). The yellow object forms a larger, hollow square-like shape. The red object forms a smaller, filled square in the bottom right corner. The output grid seems to consist of only a subset of the input. The back ground color is white (0).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: yellow_object
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: hollow square
    position: occupies the top-left and extends to the middle-right
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    shape: filled square
    position: bottom right corner
  - id: background
    color: white (0)

transformations:
  - action: select
    target: yellow_object
    condition: top-leftmost portion of the object
  - action: output result

relationships:
  - yellow_object contains background
  - red_object and yellow_object do not intersect

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify two primary objects within the input grid: a hollow square composed of yellow pixels and a solid square composed of red pixels.
2.  Locate the portion of the object made of yellow (4) at the top and the left of the grid.
3. extract a 2x2 block.
4.  Output the extracted 2x2 block as the result.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
