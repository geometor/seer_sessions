task_summary: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid to an output grid.
  The transformation appears to target contiguous regions of color 8 (azure).
  In the example, there are two separate regions of color 8 in the input.
  In the output, a cell adjacent to each of these regions has been changed to color 1 (blue).
  The transformation rule seems to be related to finding specific cells within each region of color 8 and modifying a cell to their right.

observations:

    dimensions: 7x7

      - color: 1

transformation_rule_hypothesis: |
  Identify contiguous regions of color 8 in the input grid.
  For the first identified region, locate the top-most, then left-most cell within the region.
  Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this identified cell to color 1.
  For the second identified region, locate the bottom-most, then left-most cell within the region.
  Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this identified cell to color 1.
  Assume that the cells to the right are initially color 0 and within the grid boundaries.

It seems I made a mistake and tried to call the `transform_grid` function before defining it in the execution environment. Let me define the function first and then test it.

It seems I am still having issues with the execution environment not recognizing the function definition. I will try defining the function and calling it in the same code block to ensure it is correctly defined and called.
