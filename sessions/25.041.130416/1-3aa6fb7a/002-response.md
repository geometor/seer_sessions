"""
For each connected region of color 8 in the input grid,
iterate through each cell of the region.
For each cell (r, c) in the region, check the cell immediately to its left (r, c-1) and right (r, c+1).
If the left cell is within the grid boundaries and has color 0,
change the corresponding cell in the output grid to color 1.
Similarly, if the right cell is within the grid boundaries and has color 0,
change the corresponding cell in the output grid to color 1.
