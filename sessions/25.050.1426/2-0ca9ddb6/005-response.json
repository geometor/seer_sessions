Pixels that are not neighbors of red or blue pixels, or whose neighbors in the input were not white, are also unchanged.\n6. **Unaffected Magenta Pixels:** Pixels of magenta color (color code 6) and their neighbors are not affected by this transformation and remain as they were in the input grid.\n7. **Output:** The final output grid is the result of applying these transformations."
