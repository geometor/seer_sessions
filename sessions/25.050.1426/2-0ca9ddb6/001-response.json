All other pixels that are not neighbors of red or blue pixels (or whose neighbors in input were not white) also remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.\n6. **Output:** The resulting output grid after processing all red and blue pixels in the input grid is the final transformed grid.\n\n**YAML Block: Object Observation and Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"Grid transformation based on color proximity.\"\nobjects:\n  - type: \"pixel\"\n    color: \"red\"\n    color_code: 2\n    behavior: \"Generates yellow border in horizontal and diagonal directions on empty spaces.\"\n  - type: \"pixel\"\n    color: \"blue\"\n    color_code: 1\n    behavior: \"Generates orange border in all 8 directions on empty spaces.\"\npredicates:\n  - \"is_red\": \"Checks if a pixel is red (color code 2).\"\n  - \"is_blue\": \"Checks if a pixel is blue (color code 1).\"\n  - \"is_white\": \"Checks if a pixel is white (color code 0).\"\n  - \"is_horizontal_diagonal_neighbor\": \"Checks if a position is a horizontal or diagonal neighbor.\"\n  - \"is_all_neighbor\": \"Checks if a position is any of the 8 neighbors.\"\nactions:\n  - \"create_yellow_border\": \"Sets horizontal and diagonal neighbors to yellow if input neighbor is white.\"\n  - \"create_orange_border\": \"Sets all neighbors to orange if input neighbor is white.\"\ntransformation_rule: \"For each red pixel, create a yellow border in horizontal and diagonal directions on white input neighbors.
