All other pixels that are not neighbors of red or blue pixels (or whose neighbors in input were not white) also remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.\n6. **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels of other colors, such as azure (color code 8) in this example, are not part of the transformation logic and remain unchanged in the output.\n7. **Output:** The resulting output grid after processing all red and blue pixels in the input grid is the final transformed grid.\n\n**YAML Block: Object Observation and Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"Grid transformation based on color proximity, applying different border colors for red and blue objects.\"\nobjects:\n  - type: \"pixel\"\n    color: \"red\"\n    color_code: 2\n    behavior: \"Generates yellow border in all 8 directions on empty (white) spaces.\"\n  - type: \"pixel\"\n    color: \"blue\"\n    color_code: 1\n    behavior: \"Generates orange border in all 8 directions on empty (white) spaces.\"\n  - type: \"pixel\"\n    color: \"azure\"\n    color_code: 8\n    behavior: \"Unaffected by transformation, remains unchanged.\"\npredicates:\n  - \"is_red\": \"Checks if a pixel is red (color code 2).\"\n  - \"is_blue\": \"Checks if a pixel is blue (color code 1).\"\n  - \"is_white\": \"Checks if a pixel is white (color code 0).\"\n  - \"is_neighbor\": \"Checks if a position is any of the 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).\"\nactions:\n  - \"create_yellow_border\": \"Sets all neighbors to yellow if input neighbor is white and the central pixel is red.\"\n  - \"create_orange_border\": \"Sets all neighbors to orange if input neighbor is white and the central pixel is blue.\"\ntransformation_rule: \"For each red pixel, create a yellow border in all directions on white input neighbors. For each blue pixel, create an orange border in all directions on white input neighbors. Azure pixels and their neighbors are unaffected.\"\n```"
