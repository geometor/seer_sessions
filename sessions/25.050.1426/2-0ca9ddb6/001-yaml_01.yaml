task_context: "Grid transformation based on color proximity."
objects:
  - type: "pixel"
    color: "red"
    color_code: 2
    behavior: "Generates yellow border in horizontal and diagonal directions on empty spaces."
  - type: "pixel"
    color: "blue"
    color_code: 1
    behavior: "Generates orange border in all 8 directions on empty spaces."
predicates:
  - "is_red": "Checks if a pixel is red (color code 2)."
  - "is_blue": "Checks if a pixel is blue (color code 1)."
  - "is_white": "Checks if a pixel is white (color code 0)."
  - "is_horizontal_diagonal_neighbor": "Checks if a position is a horizontal or diagonal neighbor."
  - "is_all_neighbor": "Checks if a position is any of the 8 neighbors."
actions:
  - "create_yellow_border": "Sets horizontal and diagonal neighbors to yellow if input neighbor is white."
  - "create_orange_border": "Sets all neighbors to orange if input neighbor is white."
transformation_rule: "For each red pixel, create a yellow border in horizontal and diagonal directions on white input neighbors. For each blue pixel, create an orange border in all directions on white input neighbors."
