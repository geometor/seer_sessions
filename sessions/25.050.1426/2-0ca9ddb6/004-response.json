All other pixels that are not neighbors of red or blue pixels (or whose neighbors in input were not white) also remain unchanged from the input to the output grid.\n6. **Unaffected Pixels:** Pixels of other colors, such as azure (color code 8) in this example, are not part of the transformation logic and remain unchanged in the output.\n7. **Output:** The resulting output grid after processing all red and blue pixels in the input grid is the final transformed grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules for red and blue pixels.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the given row and column are within the grid boundaries.\"\"\"\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def get_neighbors(r, c):\n        \"\"\"Returns all 8 neighbors of a cell.\"\"\"\n        neighbors = []\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                neighbors.append((r + dr, c + dc))\n        return neighbors\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Process red pixels\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 2:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(r, c)\n                for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                    if is_valid(nr, nc) and input_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = 4  # Change to yellow\n            # Process blue pixels\n            elif input_grid[r, c] == 1:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(r, c)\n                for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                     if is_valid(nr, nc) and input_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = 7 #change to orange\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
