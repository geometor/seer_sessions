Specifically:\n\n- Color 3 (green) is transformed to color 4 (yellow).\n- Color 1 (blue) is transformed to color 5 (gray).\n- Color 2 (red) is transformed to color 6 (magenta).\n\nThe positions and arrangement of the colors are preserved; only the color values themselves are changed. The dimensions of the grid remain the same."
