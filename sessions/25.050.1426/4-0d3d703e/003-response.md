The transformation rule is a direct color substitution, where each color in the input grid is replaced by a new color according to a specific mapping.  The positions and arrangement of colors are maintained, and only the color values are altered. The grid dimensions remain unchanged. The color mapping is as follows:

- Color 2 (red) is transformed to color 6 (magenta).
- Color 3 (green) is transformed to color 4 (yellow).
- Color 8 (azure) is transformed to color 9 (maroon).
