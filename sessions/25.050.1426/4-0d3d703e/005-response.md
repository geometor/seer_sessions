**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a direct color substitution.  Each color in the input grid is replaced with a new color according to a fixed mapping. Specifically:

- Color 5 (gray) is transformed to color 1 (blue).
- Color 8 (azure) is transformed to color 9 (maroon).
- Color 6 (magenta) is transformed to color 2 (red).

The positions and arrangement of the colors are preserved; only the color values themselves are changed. The dimensions of the grid remain the same.
