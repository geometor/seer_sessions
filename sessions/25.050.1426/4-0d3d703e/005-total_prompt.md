**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a direct color substitution.  Each color in the input grid is replaced with a new color according to a fixed mapping. Specifically:

- Color 3 (green) is transformed to color 4 (yellow).
- Color 1 (blue) is transformed to color 5 (gray).
- Color 2 (red) is transformed to color 6 (magenta).

The positions and arrangement of the colors are preserved; only the color values themselves are changed. The dimensions of the grid remain the same.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
