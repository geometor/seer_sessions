The positions and arrangement of colors are maintained, and only the color values are altered. The grid dimensions remain unchanged. The color mapping is as follows:\n\n- Color 2 (red) is transformed to color 6 (magenta).\n- Color 3 (green) is transformed to color 4 (yellow).\n- Color 8 (azure) is transformed to color 9 (maroon)."
