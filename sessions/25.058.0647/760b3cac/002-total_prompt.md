## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x79F1900E8AD0>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x79F1900E84D0>
Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (9x6).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   The colors present are primarily white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).
*   The azure (8) pixels appear to form a vertical line-like shape in the input, and this shape is modified in the output.
*   The yellow (4) pixels form a similar shape, and seem unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x6
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: shape
    color: azure (8)
    description: vertical line-like
    input_position:
      - [0,3]
      - [0,5]
      - [1,4]
      - [1,5]
      - [2,5]
    output_position:
      - [0,0]
      - [0,2]
      - [0,3]
      - [1,0]
      - [1,1]
      - [1,4]
      - [1,5]
      - [2,0]
      - [2,5]
    action: modified

  - type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    description: vertical line-like
    input_position:
        - [3,3]
        - [4,3]
        - [4,4]
        - [4,5]
        - [5,4]
    output_position:
        - [3,3]
        - [4,3]
        - [4,4]
        - [4,5]
        - [5,4]
    action: unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate contiguous regions of pixels of the same color. Consider each of these regions as a separate "shape."

2.  **Process Azure Shapes:** For each shape composed of azure (8) pixels:
    *   Shift all pixels of the shape to be as close as possible to the left boundary of the input grid.
    *   Preserve the relative positions (vertical stacking) of the pixels of the shape.

3.  **Preserve other Shapes:** Shapes that are not azure (8) remain unchanged in their original positions.

4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the modified azure shapes and the preserved other shapes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
