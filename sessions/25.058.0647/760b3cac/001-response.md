Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (9x6).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   The colors present are primarily white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).
*   The azure (8) pixels appear to form a vertical line-like shape in the input, and this shape is modified in the output.
*   The yellow (4) pixels form a similar shape, and seem unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x6
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: shape
    color: azure (8)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate contiguous regions of pixels of the same color. Consider each of these regions as a separate "shape."

2.  **Process Azure Shapes:** For each shape composed of azure (8) pixels:
    *   Shift all pixels of the shape to be as close as possible to the left boundary of the input grid.
    *   Preserve the relative positions (vertical stacking) of the pixels of the shape.

3.  **Preserve other Shapes:** Shapes that are not azure (8) remain unchanged in their original positions.

4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the modified azure shapes and the preserved other shapes.
