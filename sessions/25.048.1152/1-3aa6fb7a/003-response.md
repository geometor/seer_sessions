Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: Three separate objects: 1x2, 2x1, and an L shape.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]
      shape: Three separate objects: 1x2, 2x1, and an L shape.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: Three 1x1 blue objects.
  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, there are three distinct azure (color 8) objects.

2.  **Find Single Pixels to Change**: For each azure object, starting from its top-leftmost coordinate, we want to iterate the object's pixels and find the closest neighbor that is a white pixel (color code 0). The search of a neighbor starts from the right and follows a clockwise fashion.

3.  **Change**: Once found, change one white pixel (color 0) neighbor from step 2 to blue (color 1).

4.  **Preserve:** The azure objects remain unchanged. All other cells in the grid also remain the same.

In summary, it's the same transformation rule as in the first example. The transformation identifies each azure object, and adds a single blue pixel in the clockwise direction relative to the object.

```python

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements in the Code:**

1.  **Object Finding and Sorting:** The `find_objects` function now not only finds the contiguous regions of color 8 but also sorts the positions within each object. It sorts by the row first and then by the column. This makes sure that the iteration considers the object's pixels in the correct order for the rule.

2.  **Clockwise Search Logic:** The logic within the transform functions remains consistent. It checks for a neighbor in this order: right, down, left, and up.

3. **Object Iteration:**
    The main change is that the iteration iterates over the coordinates in the object.
