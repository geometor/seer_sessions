Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure objects.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
       shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure objects.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two separate 1x1 blue objects.

  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we can observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical block and the second one is a 1x2 horizontal block.

2.  **Find Single Pixels to Change**: For each one of the identified azure objects, we want to find the closest white pixel (color code 0) in the clockwise direction.

3. **Change**: Change the color of the white pixels (color 0) that are found in step 2 to blue (color 1).

4.  **Preserve:** The azure objects remain unchanged. All other cells in the grid also remain the same.

In summary, the transformation identifies the azure objects, and adds a single blue pixel in the clockwise direction.
