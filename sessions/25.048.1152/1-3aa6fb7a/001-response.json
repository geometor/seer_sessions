One is a 2x1 vertical block and the second one is a 1x2 horizontal block.\n\n2.  **Find Single Pixels to Change**: For each one of the identified azure objects, we want to find the closest white pixel (color code 0) in the clockwise direction.\n\n3. **Change**: Change the color of the white pixels (color 0) that are found in step 2 to blue (color 1).\n\n4.  **Preserve:** The azure objects remain unchanged. All other cells in the grid also remain the same.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies the azure objects, and adds a single blue pixel in the clockwise direction.\n"
