            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**Observations and Documentation**\n\nHere's a YAML block summarizing the initial findings:\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  objects:\n    - color: 6 (magenta)\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)\n```\n\n**Determining the Transformation Rule**\n\nSimilar to the previous example, this transformation involves a color substitution. The positions and shapes of the objects (vertical lines) remain the same, but their colors change according to a consistent mapping:\n\n*   Red (2) is replaced by Magenta (6).\n*   Green (3) is replaced by Yellow (4).\n*   Azure (8) is replaced by Maroon (9).\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** For each column (vertical line) in the input grid, identify its color.\n2.  **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column based on the following mapping:\n    *   If the color is Red (2), change the column to Magenta (6).\n    *   If the color is Green (3), change the column to Yellow (4).\n    *   If the color is Azure (8), change the column to Maroon (9).\n3.  **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (columns) are maintained.\n\nThis transformation is memoryless. Previous states are irrelevant and all objects of the same type are treated the same.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransformation Rule:\n\n1. **Identify Objects:** For each column (vertical line) in the input grid, identify its color.\n2. **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column based on the following mapping:\n    *   If the color is Red (2), change the column to Magenta (6).\n    *   If the color is Green (3), change the column to Yellow (4).\n    *   If the color is Azure (8), change the column to Maroon (9).\n3. **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (columns) are maintained.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified color mapping rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Create a copy to preserve structure.\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n            # Apply the color substitution rules.\n            if output_grid[i, j] == 2:  # Red to Magenta\n                output_grid[i, j] = 6\n            elif output_grid[i, j] == 3:  # Green to Yellow\n                output_grid[i, j] = 4\n            elif output_grid[i, j] == 8:  # Azure to Maroon\n                output_grid[i, j] = 9\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
