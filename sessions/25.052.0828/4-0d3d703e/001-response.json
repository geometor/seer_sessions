Each color in the input grid is consistently replaced by a different, specific color in the output grid:\n\n*   Green (3) is replaced by Yellow (4).\n*   Blue (1) is replaced by Gray (5).\n*   Red (2) is replaced by Magenta (6).\n\nThe shape and position of the objects (vertical lines in this case) remain unchanged. The transformation only affects the color of the cells.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** For each column (or vertical line of cells) in the input grid, identify its color.\n2.  **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column by the corresponding color as follows:\n    *   If color is Green (3), change to the column to Yellow (4)\n    *   If color is Blue (1), change to the column to Gray (5)\n    *   If color is Red (2), change to the column to Magenta (6)\n3. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the shape of each column during transformation.\n\nThis transformation is memoryless. Previous states are irrelevant and all objects of the same type are treated the same.\n"
