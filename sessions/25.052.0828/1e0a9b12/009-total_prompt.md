Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001-example_1
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        positions: [(0, 3)]
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        positions: [(2, 2)]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(3, 0)]
  output_grid:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(2, 1), (3,1)]
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        positions: [(3, 3)]
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        positions: [(3, 2)]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(3, 0)]
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all colored cells (non-zero) in the input grid. The objects here are individual single colored cells.

2.  **Move Down:** Each colored object of the grid moves down.

3. **Bottom Row Priority:** If any colored cells are in the last row, they persist in their positions.

4.  **Stack:** If by moving down, two or more objects coincide, the object originally positioned lower takes the place.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation involves moving down all the colored cells to the bottom row.


```python
"""
The transformation involves moving all colored cells down to the bottom row, maintaining their original column positions. If a cell is already in the bottom row, it remains unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
