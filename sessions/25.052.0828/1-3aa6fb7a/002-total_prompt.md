Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - "7x7 grid with most cells being 0 (white)."
    - "Two separate objects of color 8 (azure):"
      - "Object 1: A vertical line of two cells at position (1,1) and (2,1)."
      - "Object 2: A horizontal line of two cells at position (3,4) and (4,4)."
  output_grid:
    - "7x7 grid, mostly identical to the input grid."
    - "Changes observed:"
      - "The azure object at (1,1) has color 1 (blue) put to its right at (2,1)"
      - "The azure object at (4,4) has color 1(blue) put to its left at (4,3) "
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Placement:**
    *   Check the surrounding cells to determine the relative position and shape of the objects:

    *   If there is an object that is an vertical line:
        *    Place a cell with color 1 (blue) immediately to the right of the top most point of the object.

    *    If there is an object that is a horizontal line:
        *   Place a cell with color 1 (blue) immediately to the left of the right most point of the object.
3.  **Preserve:** All other cells remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
