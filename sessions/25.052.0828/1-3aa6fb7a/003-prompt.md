Previous Code:
```python
"""
This program transforms the input grid as follows:
1. It identifies all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2. It determines the shape of these objects (vertical or horizontal line).
3. Based on the shape and position:
    - For a vertical line, a cell with color 1 (blue) is placed to the right of the object's top.
    - For a horizontal line, a cell with color 1 (blue) is placed to the left of the object's rightmost point.
4. All other cells remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
