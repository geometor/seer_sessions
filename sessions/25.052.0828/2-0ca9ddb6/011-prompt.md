"""
The transformation rule involves creating a yellow cross around each red cell and placing orange cells around each blue cell in the cardinal directions.

1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Find all red (2) and blue (1) cells in the input grid.
3. For each red cell:
    - Place a yellow (4) cell one position above, below, to the left, and to the right.
4. For each blue cell:
    - Place an orange (7) cell one position above, below, to the left, and to the right.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
