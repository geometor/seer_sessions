Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0, 3)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 2 (red)
        positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
        shape: single cells
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0, 3)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 2 (red)
        positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
        shape: single cells forming cross patterns centered on red cells
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [(2,1),(3,1), (3,3),(4,2), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
        shape: single cells surrounding blue cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be consistent with the previous example, with the added complexity of multiple instances of the red and blue cells.

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate all red (color 2) and blue (color 1) cells in the input grid.

2.  **Yellow Cross Creation:** For *each* red cell, create a cross pattern using yellow (color 4) cells.  The cross extends one cell in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, and right) from the red cell.

3.  **Orange Surround:** For *each* blue cell, place orange (color 7) cells around it, one cell away in each cardinal direction.

4.  **Preservation**: The azure cell, and all red and blue cells remain in the same place.

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is a generalization of the previous example. We apply the "decoration" rule around *every* red and blue cell.

1.  Copy all cells from the input to the output grid.

2.  For each red cell in the input grid:
    *   Place a yellow cell one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of the red cell's location.

3.  For each blue cell in the input grid:
    *   Place an orange cell one position above, below, to the left and to the right of the blue cell's location.
