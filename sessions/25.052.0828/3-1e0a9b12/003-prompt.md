Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves moving all colored cells down to the bottom row, maintaining their original column positions. If a cell is already in the bottom row, it remains unchanged.

    """
    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-zero colored cells to the bottom row,
    while keeping cells already on the bottom row unchanged.

    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each column
    for j in range(cols):
        # Find non-zero elements in the column
        non_zero_indices = np.nonzero(input_grid[:, j])[0]

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
