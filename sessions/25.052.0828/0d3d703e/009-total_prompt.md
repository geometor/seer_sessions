Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping or substitution. Each color in the input grid is consistently replaced by a different, specific color in the output grid:

*   Green (3) is replaced by Yellow (4).
*   Blue (1) is replaced by Gray (5).
*   Red (2) is replaced by Magenta (6).

The shape and position of the objects (vertical lines in this case) remain unchanged. The transformation only affects the color of the cells.

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** For each column (or vertical line of cells) in the input grid, identify its color.
2.  **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column by the corresponding color as follows:
    *   If color is Green (3), change to the column to Yellow (4)
    *   If color is Blue (1), change to the column to Gray (5)
    *   If color is Red (2), change to the column to Magenta (6)
3. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the shape of each column during transformation.

This transformation is memoryless. Previous states are irrelevant and all objects of the same type are treated the same.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing the initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Similar to the previous example, this transformation involves a color substitution. The positions and shapes of the objects (vertical lines) remain the same, but their colors change according to a consistent mapping:

*   Red (2) is replaced by Magenta (6).
*   Green (3) is replaced by Yellow (4).
*   Azure (8) is replaced by Maroon (9).

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** For each column (vertical line) in the input grid, identify its color.
2.  **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column based on the following mapping:
    *   If the color is Red (2), change the column to Magenta (6).
    *   If the color is Green (3), change the column to Yellow (4).
    *   If the color is Azure (8), change the column to Maroon (9).
3.  **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (columns) are maintained.

This transformation is memoryless. Previous states are irrelevant and all objects of the same type are treated the same.

3. **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the columns are maintained. The transformation only changes the colors.
