Transformation Rule:

1. **Identify Objects:** For each column (or vertical line of cells) in the input grid, identify its color.
2. **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column by the corresponding color as follows:
    *   If color is Green (3), change to the column to Yellow (4)
    *   If color is Blue (1), change to the column to Gray (5)
    *   If color is Red (2), change to the column to Magenta (6)
3. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the shape of each column during transformation.

Status: False
**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
