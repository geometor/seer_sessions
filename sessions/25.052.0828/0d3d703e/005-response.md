Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing the initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Similar to the previous example, this transformation involves a color substitution. The positions and shapes of the objects (vertical lines) remain the same, but their colors change according to a consistent mapping:

*   Red (2) is replaced by Magenta (6).
*   Green (3) is replaced by Yellow (4).
*   Azure (8) is replaced by Maroon (9).

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** For each column (vertical line) in the input grid, identify its color.
2.  **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column based on the following mapping:
    *   If the color is Red (2), change the column to Magenta (6).
    *   If the color is Green (3), change the column to Yellow (4).
    *   If the color is Azure (8), change the column to Maroon (9).
3.  **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (columns) are maintained.

This transformation is memoryless. Previous states are irrelevant and all objects of the same type are treated the same.

```python
"""
Transformation Rule:

1. **Identify Objects:** For each column (vertical line) in the input grid, identify its color.
2. **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column based on the following mapping:
    *   If the color is Red (2), change the column to Magenta (6).
    *   If the color is Green (3), change the column to Yellow (4).
    *   If the color is Azure (8), change the column to Maroon (9).
3. **Preserve Structure:** The shape and position of the objects (columns) are maintained.

    return output_grid
