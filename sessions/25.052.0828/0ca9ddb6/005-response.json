The cross extends one cell in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, and right) from the red cell.\n\n3.  **Orange Surround:** For *each* blue cell, place orange (color 7) cells around it, one cell away in each cardinal direction.\n\n4.  **Preservation**: The azure cell, and all red and blue cells remain in the same place.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule is a generalization of the previous example. We apply the \"decoration\" rule around *every* red and blue cell.\n\n1.  Copy all cells from the input to the output grid.\n\n2.  For each red cell in the input grid:\n    *   Place a yellow cell one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of the red cell's location.\n\n3.  For each blue cell in the input grid:\n    *   Place an orange cell one position above, below, to the left and to the right of the blue cell's location.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is a generalization of the previous example.
