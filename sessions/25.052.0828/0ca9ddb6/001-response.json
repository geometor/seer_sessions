These are our pivotal objects.\n\n2.  **Yellow Cross Creation:** Around the red cell, create a cross pattern using yellow (color 4) cells. The cross extends one cell above, below, to the left and to the right. Place yellow cells such that if the red cell were at the origin (0,0), the yellow cells would be in coordinates (-1,0), (1, 0), (0,1) and (0,-1). Notice we must apply a translation to the red dot coordinates to achieve this.\n\n3.  **Orange Surround:** Around the blue cell, place orange (color 7) cells. Create surrounding cells on every cardinal and diagonal positions. Place orange cells such that if the blue cell was at the origin (0,0) the orange cells would be in coordinates (-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0, 1). Notice we must apply a translation to the blue dot coordinates to achieve this. In the actual case, only 4 orange cells are surrounding the blue cell in the positions corresponding to the cardinal directions.\n\n4.  **Preserve original cells**: maintain the red cell and blue cell in their original positions.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation can be described as a \"decoration\" rule centered around the initial red and blue cells. The red cell gets a yellow cross, the blue cells are sorrounded by orange cells in the four cardinal directions.\n\n1. Copy the red and blue cells from the input grid.\n\n2. Create a yellow cross centered on the position of the red cell from the input grid, extending one cell in each cardinal direction.\n\n3. Create a set of four orange cells surrounding the blue cell in the input grid, one cell away in each cardinal direction.\n"
