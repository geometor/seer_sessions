Okay, let's analyze the provided example (`train_1`).

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a 4x4 grid containing three distinct colors: azure (8), magenta (6), and white (0).
2.  **Pattern:** The arrangement of azure and magenta strongly suggests a checkerboard pattern. If we start with azure (8) at the top-left `(0,0)`, the adjacent cells alternate to magenta (6) and back.
3.  **Anomaly:** There is a single white (0) pixel located at `(0, 2)`. This position breaks the expected checkerboard pattern. According to the pattern established by `(0,0)` being azure (8), the cell at `(0,2)` should also be azure (8), as `(0+2) % 2 == (0+0) % 2`.
4.  **Output Grid:** The output is a 1x1 grid containing only the color azure (8).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying the "incorrect" white pixel within the checkerboard pattern and replacing it with the color that *should* have been there according to the pattern rules. The output is simply this "correct" color.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid Properties:
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Unique Colors: [azure (8), magenta (6), white (0)]
  Pattern: Appears to be a checkerboard based on azure (8) and magenta (6).
  Reference Colors for Pattern:
    - Color A: azure (8) at (0,0)
    - Color B: magenta (6) at (0,1)
  Anomaly:
    - Type: Single pixel deviating from the pattern
    - Color: white (0)
    - Location: (row=0, column=2)

Output Grid Properties:
  Dimensions: 1x1
  Unique Colors: [azure (8)]
  Content: [[8]]

Transformation Rule:
  1. Identify Pattern: Recognize the checkerboard pattern defined by the two dominant non-white colors (azure and magenta).
  2. Identify Anomaly: Locate the single white (0) pixel.
  3. Determine Expected Color: Calculate the color that should be at the anomaly's location based on the checkerboard rule (parity of row+column index determines the color relative to the color at (0,0)).
  4. Generate Output: Create a 1x1 grid containing the expected color determined in step 3.

Relationship:
  - The output color corresponds to the color required to restore the checkerboard pattern at the location of the single white pixel in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify the two primary non-white colors forming an alternating pattern (let's call them `color_at_origin` found at `(0,0)` and `alternate_color` found adjacent to it).
2.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the single white (0) pixel.
3.  Calculate the parity of the sum of the white pixel's coordinates: `parity = (r + c) % 2`.
4.  If `parity` is 0 (even, same as `(0+0)%2`), the expected color is `color_at_origin`.
5.  If `parity` is 1 (odd), the expected color is `alternate_color`.
6.  Construct a 1x1 output grid containing this expected color.
```python
import numpy as np
import collections

"""
Identify the two primary non-white colors forming an alternating (checkerboard) pattern in the input grid.
Find the location (row, col) of the single white (0) pixel.
Determine the color that should be at the white pixel's location based on the checkerboard pattern rule:
  - The color depends on the parity of the sum of the row and column indices (row + col).
  - Compare the parity of the white pixel's location with the parity of a reference non-white pixel's location.
  - If the parities match, the expected color is the same as the reference pixel's color.
  - If the parities differ, the expected color is the other non-white color.
Return a 1x1 grid containing this expected color.
