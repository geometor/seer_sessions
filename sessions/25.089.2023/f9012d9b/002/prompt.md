"""
Identify the two primary non-white colors forming an alternating (checkerboard) pattern in the input grid.
Find the location (row, col) of the single white (0) pixel.
Determine the color that should be at the white pixel's location based on the checkerboard pattern rule:
  - The color depends on the parity of the sum of the row and column indices (row + col).
  - Compare the parity of the white pixel's location with the parity of a reference non-white pixel's location.
  - If the parities match, the expected color is the same as the reference pixel's color.
  - If the parities differ, the expected color is the other non-white color.
Return a 1x1 grid containing this expected color.
