Okay, let's analyze the provided example (`train_1`).

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a 4x4 grid containing three distinct colors: azure (8), magenta (6), and white (0).
2.  **Pattern:** The arrangement of azure and magenta strongly suggests a checkerboard pattern. If we start with azure (8) at the top-left `(0,0)`, the adjacent cells alternate to magenta (6) and back.
3.  **Anomaly:** There is a single white (0) pixel located at `(0, 2)`. This position breaks the expected checkerboard pattern. According to the pattern established by `(0,0)` being azure (8), the cell at `(0,2)` should also be azure (8), as `(0+2) % 2 == (0+0) % 2`.
4.  **Output Grid:** The output is a 1x1 grid containing only the color azure (8).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying the "incorrect" white pixel within the checkerboard pattern and replacing it with the color that *should* have been there according to the pattern rules. The output is simply this "correct" color.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input Grid Properties:
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Unique Colors: [azure (8), magenta (6), white (0)]
  Pattern: Appears to be a checkerboard based on azure (8) and magenta (6).
  Reference Colors for Pattern:
    - Color A: azure (8) at (0,0)
    - Color B: magenta (6) at (0,1)
  Anomaly:
    - Type: Single pixel deviating from the pattern
    - Color: white (0)
    - Location: (row=0, column=2)

Output Grid Properties:
  Dimensions: 1x1
  Unique Colors: [azure (8)]
  Content: [[8]]

Transformation Rule:
  1. Identify Pattern: Recognize the checkerboard pattern defined by the two dominant non-white colors (azure and magenta).
  2. Identify Anomaly: Locate the single white (0) pixel.
  3. Determine Expected Color: Calculate the color that should be at the anomaly's location based on the checkerboard rule (parity of row+column index determines the color relative to the color at (0,0)).
  4. Generate Output: Create a 1x1 grid containing the expected color determined in step 3.

Relationship:
  - The output color corresponds to the color required to restore the checkerboard pattern at the location of the single white pixel in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify the two primary non-white colors forming an alternating pattern (let's call them `color_at_origin` found at `(0,0)` and `alternate_color` found adjacent to it).
2.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the single white (0) pixel.
3.  Calculate the parity of the sum of the white pixel's coordinates: `parity = (r + c) % 2`.
4.  If `parity` is 0 (even, same as `(0+0)%2`), the expected color is `color_at_origin`.
5.  If `parity` is 1 (odd), the expected color is `alternate_color`.
6.  Construct a 1x1 output grid containing this expected color.
