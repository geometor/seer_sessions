Input Grid Properties:
  Dimensions: 4x4
  Unique Colors: [azure (8), magenta (6), white (0)]
  Pattern: Appears to be a checkerboard based on azure (8) and magenta (6).
  Reference Colors for Pattern:
    - Color A: azure (8) at (0,0)
    - Color B: magenta (6) at (0,1)
  Anomaly:
    - Type: Single pixel deviating from the pattern
    - Color: white (0)
    - Location: (row=0, column=2)

Output Grid Properties:
  Dimensions: 1x1
  Unique Colors: [azure (8)]
  Content: [[8]]

Transformation Rule:
  1. Identify Pattern: Recognize the checkerboard pattern defined by the two dominant non-white colors (azure and magenta).
  2. Identify Anomaly: Locate the single white (0) pixel.
  3. Determine Expected Color: Calculate the color that should be at the anomaly's location based on the checkerboard rule (parity of row+column index determines the color relative to the color at (0,0)).
  4. Generate Output: Create a 1x1 grid containing the expected color determined in step 3.

Relationship:
  - The output color corresponds to the color required to restore the checkerboard pattern at the location of the single white pixel in the input grid.
