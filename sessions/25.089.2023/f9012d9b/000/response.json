            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided example (`train_1`).\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a 4x4 grid containing three distinct colors: azure (8), magenta (6), and white (0).\n2.  **Pattern:** The arrangement of azure and magenta strongly suggests a checkerboard pattern. If we start with azure (8) at the top-left `(0,0)`, the adjacent cells alternate to magenta (6) and back.\n3.  **Anomaly:** There is a single white (0) pixel located at `(0, 2)`. This position breaks the expected checkerboard pattern. According to the pattern established by `(0,0)` being azure (8), the cell at `(0,2)` should also be azure (8), as `(0+2) % 2 == (0+0) % 2`.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output is a 1x1 grid containing only the color azure (8).\n5.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve identifying the \"incorrect\" white pixel within the checkerboard pattern and replacing it with the color that *should* have been there according to the pattern rules. The output is simply this \"correct\" color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify Pattern: Recognize the checkerboard pattern defined by the two dominant non-white colors (azure and magenta).\n  2. Identify Anomaly: Locate the single white (0) pixel.\n  3. Determine Expected Color: Calculate the color that should be at the anomaly's location based on the checkerboard rule (parity of row+column index determines the color relative to the color at (0,0)).\n  4. Generate Output: Create a 1x1 grid containing the expected color determined in step 3.\n\nRelationship:\n  - The output color corresponds to the color required to restore the checkerboard pattern at the location of the single white pixel in the input grid.\n```"

Scan the input grid to identify the two primary non-white colors forming an alternating pattern (let's call them `color_at_origin` found at `(0,0)` and `alternate_color` found adjacent to it).\n2.  Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the single white (0) pixel.\n3.  Calculate the parity of the sum of the white pixel's coordinates: `parity = (r + c) % 2`.\n4.  If `parity` is 0 (even, same as `(0+0)%2`), the expected color is `color_at_origin`.\n5.  If `parity` is 1 (odd), the expected color is `alternate_color`.\n6.  Construct a 1x1 output grid containing this expected color."
