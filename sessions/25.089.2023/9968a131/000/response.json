The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output (4x4 for train_1, 6x6 for train_2).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Colors used are orange (7), green (3), azure (8) in train_1, and white (0), gray (5), orange (7) in train_2. The output uses the same set of colors as the input.\n3.  **Transformation Scope:** The transformation appears to operate row by row. Some rows are modified, while others remain identical.\n4.  **Pattern Recognition (train_1):**\n    *   Input rows alternate: `[7, 3, 8, 7]` and `[7, 8, 3, 7]`.\n    *   Output rows alternate: `[7, 3, 8, 7]` and `[7, 7, 8, 3]`.\n    *   Only rows matching `[7, 8, 3, 7]` are changed. The change involves the subsequence `[8, 3, 7]` (at indices 1, 2, 3) becoming `[7, 8, 3]`.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition (train_2):**\n    *   Input rows alternate: `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` and `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`.\n    *   Output rows alternate: `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` and `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`.\n    *   Only rows matching `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` are changed. The change involves the subsequence `[5, 0, 7]` (at indices 0, 1, 2) becoming `[7, 5, 0]`.\n6.  **Core Transformation:** In both examples, a specific 3-element subsequence `[A, B, C]` found at a particular starting index within certain rows is transformed into `[C, A, B]`. This is a right cyclic shift of the three elements.\n7.  **Conditionality:** The transformation is conditional. It only applies if a row contains the specific target subsequence at the specific starting index identified in the examples.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.\n3.  For the current row, identify the specific 3-element target subsequence `[A, B, C]` and its required starting index `i` (these are determined by analyzing the training examples - e.g., `[8, 3, 7]` at index 1 for train_1, `[5, 0, 7]` at index 0 for train_2).\n4.  Check if the elements in the current row at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` exactly match the target subsequence `[A, B, C]`.\n5.  If they match, modify the corresponding row in the output grid by replacing the elements at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` with the cyclically shifted sequence `[C, A, B]`.\n6.  If they do not match, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (as it was initially copied from the input).\n7.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid."
