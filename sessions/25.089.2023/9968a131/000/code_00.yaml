task_description: Processes grid rows based on specific subsequence patterns.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same height and width as the input.
  - color_palette_preserved: True # Output grid uses the same colors as the input.
row_processing:
  - scope: Independent # Each row is processed independently.
  - conditional: True # Transformation depends on matching a specific pattern within the row.
transformation_rule:
  - type: Subsequence Replacement
  - subsequence_length: 3
  - operation: Right Cyclic Shift # The identified 3-element subsequence [A, B, C] is replaced by [C, A, B].
  - specificity:
      - The specific target subsequence (e.g., [8, 3, 7] or [5, 0, 7]) must be identified.
      - The specific starting index of the target subsequence within the row (e.g., index 1 or index 0) must be identified.
      - Only rows containing the target subsequence at the specified index are modified.
example_specifics:
  - train_1:
      - target_subsequence: [azure(8), green(3), orange(7)]
      - start_index: 1
      - transformed_subsequence: [orange(7), azure(8), green(3)]
  - train_2:
      - target_subsequence: [gray(5), white(0), orange(7)]
      - start_index: 0
      - transformed_subsequence: [orange(7), gray(5), white(0)]
