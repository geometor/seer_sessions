Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output (4x4 for train_1, 6x6 for train_2).
2.  **Color Palette:** Colors used are orange (7), green (3), azure (8) in train_1, and white (0), gray (5), orange (7) in train_2. The output uses the same set of colors as the input.
3.  **Transformation Scope:** The transformation appears to operate row by row. Some rows are modified, while others remain identical.
4.  **Pattern Recognition (train_1):**
    *   Input rows alternate: `[7, 3, 8, 7]` and `[7, 8, 3, 7]`.
    *   Output rows alternate: `[7, 3, 8, 7]` and `[7, 7, 8, 3]`.
    *   Only rows matching `[7, 8, 3, 7]` are changed. The change involves the subsequence `[8, 3, 7]` (at indices 1, 2, 3) becoming `[7, 8, 3]`.
5.  **Pattern Recognition (train_2):**
    *   Input rows alternate: `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` and `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`.
    *   Output rows alternate: `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` and `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`.
    *   Only rows matching `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` are changed. The change involves the subsequence `[5, 0, 7]` (at indices 0, 1, 2) becoming `[7, 5, 0]`.
6.  **Core Transformation:** In both examples, a specific 3-element subsequence `[A, B, C]` found at a particular starting index within certain rows is transformed into `[C, A, B]`. This is a right cyclic shift of the three elements.
7.  **Conditionality:** The transformation is conditional. It only applies if a row contains the specific target subsequence at the specific starting index identified in the examples.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Processes grid rows based on specific subsequence patterns.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same height and width as the input.
  - color_palette_preserved: True # Output grid uses the same colors as the input.
row_processing:
  - scope: Independent # Each row is processed independently.
  - conditional: True # Transformation depends on matching a specific pattern within the row.
transformation_rule:
  - type: Subsequence Replacement
  - subsequence_length: 3
  - operation: Right Cyclic Shift # The identified 3-element subsequence [A, B, C] is replaced by [C, A, B].
  - specificity:
      - The specific target subsequence (e.g., [8, 3, 7] or [5, 0, 7]) must be identified.
      - The specific starting index of the target subsequence within the row (e.g., index 1 or index 0) must be identified.
      - Only rows containing the target subsequence at the specified index are modified.
example_specifics:
  - train_1:
      - target_subsequence: [azure(8), green(3), orange(7)]
      - start_index: 1
      - transformed_subsequence: [orange(7), azure(8), green(3)]
  - train_2:
      - target_subsequence: [gray(5), white(0), orange(7)]
      - start_index: 0
      - transformed_subsequence: [orange(7), gray(5), white(0)]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index.
3.  For the current row, identify the specific 3-element target subsequence `[A, B, C]` and its required starting index `i` (these are determined by analyzing the training examples - e.g., `[8, 3, 7]` at index 1 for train_1, `[5, 0, 7]` at index 0 for train_2).
4.  Check if the elements in the current row at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` exactly match the target subsequence `[A, B, C]`.
5.  If they match, modify the corresponding row in the output grid by replacing the elements at indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` with the cyclically shifted sequence `[C, A, B]`.
6.  If they do not match, the corresponding row in the output grid remains unchanged (as it was initially copied from the input).
7.  After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.
