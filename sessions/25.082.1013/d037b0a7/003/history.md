1.  **Identify the starting point:** Find all values in the right-most column.
2.  **Horizontal Propagation:** For each starting cell, copy the cell's value to all the cells to the left of it in the same row *up until* another non-zero is encountered.
3.  **Vertical propagation**: For the last row and right-most cell, fill upwards and leftwards respectively (until the first non-zero pixel)
4.  **Downward Propagation:** Starting from the top row and down, and left to right in each row, propagate each non-zero pixel directly down to the bottom of the grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was partially correct, focusing on horizontal and downward propagation. However, it's clear from the results that the horizontal propagation logic is too aggressive (example 1) and sometimes initiated from incorrect positions (example 2), and it missed some of the critical nuances of when to terminate the horizontal fill. There seems to be interaction between the horizontal fill and the vertical downward propagation, but vertical downward propagation appears to be universally applied which, based on the second example, isn't always correct.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Horizontal Propagation:** Carefully analyze *when* and *how far* the horizontal filling occurs. Focus on what triggers and *stops* it. The stopping condition isn't just encountering a non-zero value, otherwise in the first case the '4' should have stopped the '6'.
2.  **Refine Vertical Propagation:** example 2 suggests that the vertical propagation isn't universal.
3. **Establish Precedence:** Determine the priority between these operations. It looks like in the first example horizontal happens first, then the downward.
4.  **Object Identification:** Consider if identifying connected regions of color will help, instead of thinking only row by row and column by column.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels with a value other than 0.
2. **Conditional Horizontal Propagation** If a non-zero pixel is found, fill that pixel's value horizontally leftwards in that row. This leftward spread stops at the left edge of the input, or if any non-zero pixels are in the way.
2.  **Vertical Propagation:** For *every* non-zero pixel in the input grid, propagate its value downwards to the bottom of the grid.
