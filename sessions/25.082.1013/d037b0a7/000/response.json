The transformation seems to involve a directional fill or expansion of non-zero values. It appears as if non-zero values on the right \"drag a copy\" to the left, cascading across the other non-zero values. A single non-zero value expands downwards, and adjacent values propagate downwards. The rule appears to be a combination of these and requires more investigation\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
