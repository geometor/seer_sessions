The input grids appear to have a common structure: a single non-zero color embedded within a field of zeros. The output grids seem to be a condensed representation, showing only the non-zero color from the input, repeated a number of times that relates to its occurrences or positions in the input. The size of output grid doesn't match the size of input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
