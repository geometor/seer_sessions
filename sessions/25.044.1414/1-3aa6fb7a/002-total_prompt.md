**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Corner '8's:** Locate cells in the input grid that contain the value '8' and have exactly two neighboring cells that also contain the value '8'. These '8' cells are considered the corners of potential "L" shapes.

2. **Find '8'-Neighbors:** For each identified corner '8', determine its two neighboring cells that contain '8'.

3. **Calculate Missing Corner Position:**  Using the coordinates of the corner '8' cell and its two '8'-neighbor cells, calculate the coordinates of the 'missing corner' that would complete a 2x2 square. The formula for calculating the missing corner coordinates (row_missing, column_missing) is:
   `row_missing = row_neighbor1 + row_neighbor2 - row_corner`
   `column_missing = column_neighbor1 + column_neighbor2 - column_corner`
   where (row_corner, column_corner) are the coordinates of the corner '8', and (row_neighbor1, column_neighbor1), (row_neighbor2, column_neighbor2) are the coordinates of its two '8'-neighbors.

4. **Check and Fill:** Examine the cell in the input grid at the calculated 'missing corner' coordinates. If this cell contains the value '0', then in the output grid, change the value of this cell to '1'.

5. **Maintain Unchanged Cells:** For all other cells in the grid that are not modified in step 4, their values in the output grid remain the same as they were in the input grid.

This program effectively identifies "L" shapes formed by '8's and fills in the 'missing corner' with a '1' if it was originally a '0'.
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
