Okay, here's the natural language program and the corresponding Python code based on the provided example and images.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of value '8'.
2.  **Locate Specific Occurrences:** Find '8's that have another '8' immediately to their right.
3.  **Change Value:** Change the value of the identified '8' (the left one in the horizontal pair) to '1'.
4. **Iterate:** Apply these steps to every object
