Okay, here's a natural language description of the transformation observed between the input and output grids, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (cyan).

2.  **Locate Specific Occurrences:** Find the '8' that is immediately to the left of another '8' horizontally.

3.  Change Color Right Diagonal:
    If There is a blue pixel to the right, then replace by a '1'.

4.  **Apply to All Instances:** Repeat this process for every instance of an '8' that satisfies the specified condition.

**Step-by-step explanation of the example provided:**
1. We see two set of cyan ('8') in the grid.
2. Locate the number '8' that is next to another '8' at its right. In the first set, the first '8' is located at the coordinates (1,1), with the second at (1,2). In the second set, The first element is at (3,4) and the second at (3,5).
3. The '8' at coordinate (1,1) changes to '1'.
4. The '8' at coordinate (4,5) changes to '1'.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
