There are exactly two such 8's\n    in sample 1, one in the input and another in the output.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The digit directly to the right of the top-left corner of a 2x1 area with 8 as color is set to '1'.\n    *   The digit directly above the bottom-right corner of a 2x1 area with 8 as color is changed to '1'.\n    *   All the rest are not changed.\n\n**Step By Step**\n1. Input has a 2x1 area composed by 8 in color.\n2. Change the number at the right of up-corner to 1\n3. Input has another 2x1 area compsed by 8 in color.\n4. Change the number above down-corner to 1.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies specific '8's which are part of two 1x2 areas in color eight.\nThe '8' at right of the top-left is changed to '1'.\nThe '8' above bottom-right is changed to '1'.\n"
