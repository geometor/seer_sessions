  general:
    - input_grid_size: 5x5
    - output_grid_size: 5x5
    - transformation:  For each non-white pixel in the input, a diagonal cross of the same color is created in the output, centered on the original pixel's location.
    - diagonal_directions: up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right
    - background: white (0)
