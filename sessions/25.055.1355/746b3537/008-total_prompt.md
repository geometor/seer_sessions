## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 4 6
3 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212680>

**output:**
```
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x64 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored squares (pixels) to another, smaller grid. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x3 grid. The colors and their corresponding numerical values (3, 4, and 6) are preserved, but their spatial arrangement changes. The output grid seems to represent the top row of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 3
        color: green
        position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
        position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x3
    elements:
      - value: 3
        color: green
        position: (0,0)
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        position: (0,1)
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
        position: (0,2)
  - relationship:
      - output_grid elements correspond to the first row elements of the input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts the top row of the input grid and creates a new grid with that row. The height of output is one, and the width of the output is the same as the width of the input. The values and their order in the selected row are preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
