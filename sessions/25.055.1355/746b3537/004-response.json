The test results clearly show this is insufficient, as it only works correctly when the output grid is supposed to be just the first column of the input. The core problem is that the initial natural language program and the resulting code failed to capture the actual transformation rule, which is much simpler than originally anticipated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe transformation is now very clear: the output grid always consists of the first column of the input grid, and nothing else. It doesn't involve complex object manipulation, spatial reasoning, or anything beyond basic array slicing. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine the natural language program**: Update the program to correctly and concisely describe taking only the first column.\n2.  **Regenerate Code:** The next code generation step should be trivial based on this simple rule.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis:**\n\nI'll use a code block to print information about input/output, but I don't believe extensive analysis is required here, as the transformation logic is consistent across all provided examples.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\nexamples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]],\n        \"output\": [[5], [5], [5]],\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]],\n        \"output\": [[1], [1]],\n    },\n    {\n         \"input\": [[3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3]],\n         \"output\": [[3], [3], [3], [3]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4]],\n        \"output\": [[4], [4], [4], [4], [4]],\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[7],[7],[7]],\n        \"output\": [[7],[7],[7]]\n    }\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    input_grid = example[\"input\"]\n    output_grid = example[\"output\"]\n    input_shape = np.array(input_grid).shape\n    output_shape = np.array(output_grid).shape\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input Shape: {input_shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Output Shape: {output_shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Input first column: {[row[0] for row in input_grid]}\")\n    print(f\" output: {output_grid}\")\n\n```"
