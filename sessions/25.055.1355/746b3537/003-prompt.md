Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed into a single-column grid by taking the values from each row of the input and placing them in a single cell, preserving the vertical order. The output grid has the same number of rows as the input, but only one column.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Initialize the output grid as a list of lists (to build it dynamically)
    output_grid = []
    
    # Iterate each row in input
    for i in range(rows):
        # Append each complete row array to the output list.
        output_grid.append([input_grid[i][0]])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
