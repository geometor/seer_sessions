Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the top row of the input grid and creates a new grid with that row. The height of output is one, and the width of the output is the same as the width of the input. The values and their order in the selected row are preserved.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Initialize the output grid with dimensions 1 x cols.
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, cols), dtype=int)

    # Copy the first row of the input grid to the output grid.
    output_grid[0, :] = input_grid[0, :]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were overly simplistic. While they correctly handled the first training example, they failed on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the initial program *only* considered the first row. The actual transformation rule is more complex and involves identifying specific objects and their spatial relationships.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input/output pair, noting the colors, shapes, and relative positions of objects. I'll use a combination of visual inspection and code execution to gather precise data about sizes, colors, and positions.
2.  **Object Identification:** Identify consistent "objects" across the examples. An object, as per the priors, is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
3.  **Relationship Analysis:** Determine how these objects relate to each other in the input and how these relationships dictate the transformation to the output.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified objects, relationships, and transformations, I will rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the rule. This description will be much more detailed than the initial one.
5.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing the key facts about the transformation, like identified object, and the spatial relations.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Analysis (Conceptual - will be done in separate prompt execution):**

I'll create a notebook and do the following for *each* training example:

*   Display the input and output grids visually.
*   Calculate the dimensions of the input and output grids.
*   Identify and list all distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same color) in both input and output. This will involve writing functions to:
    *   Find connected components.
    *   Calculate bounding boxes for each object.
    *   Determine the color of each object.
* Use the generated report and create a summary of information to use for the
  responses.

**Example-Specific Analysis and Metrics (Illustrative - based on visual inspection of provided images):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: One row of blue and one row of gray
    *   Output: only blue row
    *   Initial program works, because the blue row is first.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Three rows. Gray, then blue and gray together, then gray.
    *   Output: only the blue and gray row.
    *   Initial code fails: It only takes the top (all gray) row.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 4 rows, last one has a small red and a larger blue object.
    *    Output: only the red and blue objects are preserved, same row.
    *   Initial code fails completely.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: Contiguous blocks of single colors.
  - property_of_interest: Color, Shape, Size, Relative position.
transformation_rule: |
    Locate objects in the same row as objects of blue and/or red.
    If the input contains any rows with blue and/or red objects, extract that row.
    Output contains only the selected row, and the order of objects are preserved.
    If no blue and/or red on any row, output is an empty 1x1 grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan** the input grid row by row.
2.  **Identify** a row where there's at least one object colored blue or red.
3.  **Extract** the entire row if the condition in step 2 is met.
4. **Preserve**: The order of objects and their color in the selected row are
   preserved in the output
5.  If no such row is found (no blue or red objects present), return an empty
    grid with dimensions 1x1 and the default value of 0.
6.  If the row is found, create a new grid that has a height of 1 and the width that matches the original input grid. Copy all values from the selected row into the new grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
