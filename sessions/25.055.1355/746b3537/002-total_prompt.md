## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
2 2 2
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213DF0>

**output:**
```
1
2
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements**

*   The input is a 3x3 grid.
*   The output is a 3x1 grid (a single column).
*   The values in the grids represent colors (1=blue, 2=red).
*   The output grid seems to be a vertically compressed version of the input grid, preserving the vertical order of the rows but eliminating the horizontal dimension.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    dimensions: 3x1
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - observation: The output grid maintains the vertical order of the input.
  - observation: The horizontal dimension is removed in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid, which is 3x3.
2.  Collapse each column of the input grid into a single cell in the output grid. The new grid will have the same number of rows, but each row will contain data of a single cell.
3. The output grid will have a height equal to the input, but be only one cell wide.

In simpler term: Convert the input 2D grid to the output 1D grid by taking each row of data from the input and making each to one cell in order to create the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
