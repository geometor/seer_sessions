## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 3 3 8 1
2 3 3 8 1
2 3 3 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C160>

**output:**
```
2 3 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x64 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input is a 3x5 grid, and the output is a 1x4 grid. The colors in the output grid appear to be a subset of the colors present in the input grid. The input grid consists of repeating rows. The transformation seems to involve extracting unique elements based on columns and removing duplicates based on some criteria. One observation is that there are two '3's and we don't just take unique numbers as 3 is presented in the output once.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x5
      output: 1x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [2, 3, 8, 1] # red, green, azure, blue

actions:
  - type: select_columns
    description: Selects specific columns from the input grid.
  - type: remove_duplicate_columns
    description: remove duplicate adjacent color from a column

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Input grid rows are identical.
  - type: transformation
    description: Output is derived from the unique sequence of colors from columns of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2.  **Deduplication:** Since all rows are identical pick only the first row to represent each column.
3. **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by combining each element.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
