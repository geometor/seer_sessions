## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 8 0
8 8 0
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB6D0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x64 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 1x4 grid. The colors present are white (0) and azure (8). The input grid contains both azure and white pixels, while the output grid contains only azure pixels. The number of azure pixels in the input grid appears to match the number of azure pixels in the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
  - observation: Output is a 1x4 grid.
    type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 4]
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 8 (azure).
    type: color_presence
    colors: [0, 8]
  - observation: Output grid contains only pixels of color 8 (azure).
    type: color_presence
    colors: [8]
  - observation: The number of azure pixels in the input (4) equals the number of azure pixels in the output (4).
    type: quantity
    color: 8
    input_count: 4
    output_count: 4
  - object: azure_pixels
    color: 8
      
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Find all pixels with the color azure (8) in the input grid.
2.  **Count**: Count the number of azure pixels.
3. **Construct**: Create a new 1 x N grid, where N is the number of azure colored pixels in the input grid.
4. **Populate**: Fill all cells of the new grid with the value 8 (azure).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
