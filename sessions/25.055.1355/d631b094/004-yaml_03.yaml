facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid consistently contains only one pixel.
  - observation: |
      The color of the output pixel is always blue (1).
  - observation: |
     The input grid can contain multiple colors.
  - observation: |
      The presence of blue (color 1) in the input, regardless of position or count, results in a blue (color 1) output.
  - observation: |
     The input can contain other colors like 2 and 4.
  - action: |
      If color 1 (blue) exists anywhere in the input grid, create output grid [[1]], otherwise the output should probably be an empty grid or all zeros.
