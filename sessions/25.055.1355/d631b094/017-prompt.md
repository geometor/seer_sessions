"""
1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value.
2.  **Determine Output Size:** The size of the output is not always 1x1. It should be derived from the arrangement of the non-zero colors in each example.
3.  **Determine Output Colors:** Determine which of the input non-zero pixels are present in the output, and their colors. Note which colors are not present, or are new.
4. **Determine Output Pixel Positions:** Determine the position in the output grid of each of the non-zero pixels.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the specified dimensions, filled with zeros (black).
6.  **Populate Output:** Place the identified non-zero pixels, with the correct colors, into the output grid at the specified positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
