## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7DCBFF5DB6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The blue pixels in the input grid seem to be the focus, while the white pixels are ignored. The output grid's dimensions (1x2) correspond to the number of blue pixels in the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - action: count
    target: blue_pixels
    in: input_grid
  - action: create_grid
    dimensions:
      height: 1
      width: number_of_blue_pixels
    elements:
      value: 1
      color: blue
  - relationship: number_of_blue_pixels_equals_output_grid_width
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Count:** Examine the input grid and count the number of blue pixels (value 1).
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a height of 1 and a width equal to the number of blue pixels counted in the previous step.
3.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill all cells of the newly created output grid with blue pixels (value 1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
