The input grid contains the value '0' (white) and '5' (gray). The output grid contains '3'(green), '4' (yellow), and '2'(red). The spatial arrangement of the pixels is preserved; that is, the transformation seems to affect only the *values* of the pixels, not their positions. The transformation appears to be a one-to-one mapping, meaning each input color is consistently replaced by a specific output color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
