The input grid contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid contains red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3). The key seems to be the replacement of specific colors based on their initial position or surrounding context.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
