facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids consistently have identical dimensions. The transformation maintains the grid structure.
  - object_property: |
      Each pixel in the grid can be treated as an individual object, with its value representing a color.
  - transformation_rule: |
      There's a one-to-one mapping between input pixel values and output pixel values. The mapping isn't limited to just 0->3 and 5->4; it appears to be a more general rule. It looks like a cyclical decrement or cyclic increment.
  - transformation_type: value_substitution
  - input_output_relationship: |
      The output grid is a direct transformation of the input grid, with each pixel's value potentially changed according to a consistent rule, but the spatial arrangement of pixels remains the same.
