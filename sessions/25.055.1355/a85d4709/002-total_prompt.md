## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B4E50>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B7DF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the value '0' (white) and '5' (gray). The output grid contains '3'(green), '4' (yellow), and '2'(red). The spatial arrangement of the pixels is preserved; that is, the transformation seems to affect only the *values* of the pixels, not their positions. The transformation appears to be a one-to-one mapping, meaning each input color is consistently replaced by a specific output color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are both 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The positions of the pixels remain constant between input and output.
  - observation: |
     Input grid contains values '0' and '5'
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves changing pixel values (colors).
  - observation: |
      Output grid contains values '2', '3', and '4'.
  - mapping_rule: |
    '0' in the input maps to a '3' in the output.
  - mapping_rule: |
    '5' in the input maps to '4' in the output.
  - observation: |
      The mapping is consistent across the entire grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: [0, 5]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: [3, 4, 2]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Value Mapping:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's value is 0, change it to 3.
    *   If the pixel's value is 5, change it to 4.
    *   All other values are changed to 2, although in this specific example there are no other values.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

In essence, the program performs a simple color substitution based on a fixed mapping, preserving the grid structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
