facts:
  - observation: "The input grids contain only two colors: gray (5) and white (0)."
  - observation: "The output grids contain only two colors: green (3) and yellow (4)."
  - pattern: "The transformation follows a checkerboard pattern."
  - rule: "Pixels at even row + column indices are transformed differently than pixels at odd row + column indices."
  - detail:  "If (row + col) % 2 == 0: gray (5) becomes green (3), and white (0) becomes yellow (4)."
  - detail: "If (row + col) % 2 != 0: gray (5) becomes yellow(4) and white(0) becomes green(3)."
  - object_constancy: "The overall grid dimensions remain constant."
