## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D7B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid has a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of pixels of a single color (yellow, represented by the digit '4'). The key seems to be identifying a dominant or significant color in the input, which then becomes the uniform color of the output. The input example shows multiple appearances of '4'.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)

  - type: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same size.
    properties:
      - input: multi-colored grid
      - output: single-color grid

  - type: color_dominance
    description: The color '4' (yellow) appears multiple times in the input.
    properties:
      - target_color: '4'
      - output_color: '4'
      - rule: "The output grid is filled entirely with a color existing in the input"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target:** Identify a color that appear on the input grid. In this example '4' can be found on the input.
3. **Transform:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Fill:** Fill every pixel of the output grid with the target color identified. In this example all pixels on the output grid are yellow('4')

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
