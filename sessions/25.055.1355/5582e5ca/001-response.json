The input grid has a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of pixels of a single color (yellow, represented by the digit '4'). The key seems to be identifying a dominant or significant color in the input, which then becomes the uniform color of the output. The input example shows multiple appearances of '4'.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
