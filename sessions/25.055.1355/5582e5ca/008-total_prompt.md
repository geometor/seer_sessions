## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C160>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (maroon, represented by the digit 9). The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x3). The key seems to lie in identifying a specific color or characteristic within the input that dictates the uniform color of the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells:
        - value: int (0-9)  # Represents color
          color:  # Corresponding color name
            - magenta (6)
            - azure (8)
            - maroon (9)
            - blue (1)
            - yellow (4)
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells:
        - value: 9
          color: maroon
    role: output

actions:
  - type: replace_all_cells
    agent: system
    target: output grid
    parameters:
      replacement_color: maroon (9)

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    subject: input grid
    object: output grid
    rule: "All cells in the input grid are replaced with the color maroon (9)."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Observe the input grid.
2. **Determine output color**: The example shows the ouput color is maroon (9).
3.  **Replace:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. Fill every cell of the output grid with maroon (9).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
