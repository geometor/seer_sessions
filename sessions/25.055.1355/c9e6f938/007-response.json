The primary colors involved are white (0) and orange (7). The input grid appears to be smaller in dimensions than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve expanding the original shape horizontally.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case there is one, in the center row.\n2.  **Determine Expansion Axis:** The expansion occurs horizontally.\n3. **Measure original size**: Determine the width of original orange shape, it occupies two cells.\n4. **Expand shape**: Duplicate the width of the colored shape. Copy the original shape and paste beside itself.\n5. **Maintain Unchanged:** The white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n6. **Construct the output**: Create output based on shape expansion and maintaining background.\n\nIn summary, the program identifies the orange shape within the input grid, measures its size horizontally, then stretch the colored shape along that dimension. The background of white pixels are unchanged.\n"
