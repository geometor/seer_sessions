Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0) and orange (7). The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 3x6 matrix. The transformation seems to involve expanding the original grid, specifically by duplicating columns containing the orange (7) pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      cells: nested_list_of_pixel_values
      colors: [white, orange]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer_value_or_color_name
      position: [row_index, column_index]

actions:
  - name: duplicate_column
    description: Replicate a column based on the presence of a specific color.
    parameters:
      color: target_color_for_duplication

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Adjacency of pixels within the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description:  Input grid maps to output grid through column duplication.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid. If a column contains at least one orange (7) pixel, mark it for duplication.

2.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid. Iterate through the input grid columns.

3.  **Duplicate Columns**: if a column does contains at least one 7, then output two of this same column. Otherwise just output the original column once.

4.  **Final Output:** The resulting grid is the output.
