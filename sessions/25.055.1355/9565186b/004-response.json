However, it failed to generalize a more complex rule present in the second example, where the position and surrounding context influence the transformation. The third example, being an identity transformation, didn't provide additional constraints but confirms that the existing rule doesn't incorrectly modify grids where no changes are intended.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this should involve:\n\n1.  **Re-examining the second example:** The key is understanding why *some* 1s and 8s change to 5, and not others. This likely involves considering their positions or neighbors.\n2.  **Conditional Logic:** The natural language program, and subsequently the code, needs more sophisticated conditional logic. It's not a simple color-to-color mapping; it's a context-aware transformation.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We might need to make a hypothesis, test it, and refine it based on the results, possibly multiple times.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n```python\n# Simulated execution and analysis\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Mockup of the provided example data (replace with actual data)\ntrain_examples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2], [8, 8, 2]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[5, 5, 2], [5, 5, 2], [5, 5, 2]])\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 1, 2]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[0, 5, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [5, 9, 5, 2]])\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]])\n    }\n]\n\ndef analyze_example(example):\n    input_grid = example[\"input\"]\n    output_grid = example[\"output\"]\n    changed_pixels = []\n\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            if input_grid[i, j] != output_grid[i, j]:\n                changed_pixels.append({\n                    \"row\": i,\n                    \"col\": j,\n                    \"input_color\": int(input_grid[i, j]),\n                    \"output_color\": int(output_grid[i, j]),\n                    \"neighbors\": get_neighbors(input_grid, i, j)\n                })\n\n    return changed_pixels\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    neighbors = {}\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if row > 0:\n        neighbors[\"up\"] = int(grid[row-1, col])\n    if row < rows - 1:\n        neighbors[\"down\"] = int(grid[row+1, col])\n    if col > 0:\n        neighbors[\"left\"] = int(grid[row, col-1])\n    if col < cols - 1:\n        neighbors[\"right\"] = int(grid[row, col+1])\n    return neighbors\n\nanalysis_results = []\nfor i, example in enumerate(train_examples):\n    changes = analyze_example(example)\n    analysis_results.append({\n        \"example\": i + 1,\n        \"changes\": changes\n    })\n\nprint(analysis_results)\n\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (0,0)\n      actions:\n        change_color: gray (5)\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (0,1)\n      actions:\n        change_color: gray(5)\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n            color: light_blue(8)\n            location: (2,0)\n      actions:\n        change_color: gray(5)\n  transformation_rule: \"Blue and light blue pixels turn to gray.\"\n\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (0, 1)\n        neighbors: {left: 0, right: 2, down: 5}\n      actions:\n        change_color: gray (5)\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n        color: blue (1)\n        location: (2, 2)\n        neighbors: { left: 9, up: 6, right: 2}\n      actions:\n        change_color: gray (5)\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n        color: light_blue (8)\n        location: (2, 0)\n        neighbors: {right: 9, up: 4}\n      actions:\n        change_color: gray (5)\n  transformation_rule: \"Some blue and light blue pixels become gray.

Looking at the neighbors, we can observe the following patterns that result in a pixel changing from blue or light_blue to gray\n      - blue(1) pixels at the top edge surrounded on 3 sides\n      - blue(1) or light_blue(8) that have neighboring cells on 2 adjacent sides\n\n3.  **Preservation:** Other colors remain unchanged. Specifically, red (2), green (3) pixels, and any other colors present in the grid are not altered by the transformation.\n\n4. **Identity case**: If an input grid consists only of colors other than blue or light-blue, the grid is unchanged.\n"
