## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C160>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The transformation seems to involve a change in color of specific pixels based on their initial color. The surrounding pixels appear to influence, or at a minimum correlate with, the transformation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input and output grids are both 3x3.
  - observation: The input grid contains pixels of colors red (2), blue (1), and azure (8).
  - observation: The output grid contains pixels of colors red (2) and gray (5).
  - observation: The red (2) pixels in the input grid remain red (2) in the output grid.
  - observation: The blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the input are all gray(5) in the output.
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: varies (1, 2, 8)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: varies (2, 5)
  - relationship: "pixels of color 1 and 8 in the input grid become color 5 in the output grid"
  - relationship: "pixels of color 2 in the input grid remain color 2 in the output grid"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   If a pixel's color is red (2), it remains unchanged.
    *   If a pixel's color is blue (1) or azure (8), change its color to gray (5).
3.  **Output:** The result is the transformed 3x3 output grid.

In essence, the rule could be simplified to: "Change all blue (1) and azure (8) pixels to gray (5). Keep red (2) pixels the same."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
