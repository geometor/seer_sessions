observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - middle_row:
          description: The row at the vertical center of the grid.
          index: input_grid.shape[0] // 2
          content: variable, may contain different colors.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: same as input_grid
      - width: same as input_grid
      - rows: all rows are identical copies of the transformed middle row.
    transformation:
      - step_1: Identify the middle row of the input_grid.
      - step_2: Create a temporary row, a copy of the input's middle row.
      - step_3: Modify the temporary row:
        - Iterate through each pixel in the temporary row.
        - If a pixel is not yellow (4), change it to grey (5).
      - step_4: Copy the modified temporary row to all rows of the output_grid.
