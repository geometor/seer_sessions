## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC23B9A0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
5 5 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF112F50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains red (2) and azure (8) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5) pixels. The azure pixels in the input are replaced by gray pixels in the output. The red pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values:
          - 2 (red)
          - 8 (azure)
          - 5 (gray)

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    input_color: 8 (azure)
    output_color: 5 (gray)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grid maintains the same spatial arrangement of pixels; only the color of specific pixels changes.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the color value 8 (azure).
2.  **Replace with Gray:** Change the color value of these identified pixels to 5 (gray).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (in this case, the red ones) retain their original color values.
4. The structure of the grid doesn't change, only the values.

In essence, the transformation rule is: "Replace all azure pixels with gray pixels, leaving all other pixels unchanged."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
