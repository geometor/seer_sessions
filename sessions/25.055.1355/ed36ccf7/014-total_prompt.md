## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 9
0 0 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D7B0>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
0 0 9
0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C160>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two distinct colors: white (0) and maroon (9). The output grid also contains the same two colors, but their positions are changed. The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of some kind.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]]
      - color: maroon (9)
        positions: [[0,2], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: The grid appears to be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  The relative positions of the colors change, maintaining a connected maroon 'L' shape and a white 2x2 square.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.  Specifically:

1.  The maroon pixels in the input at positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0) become, the top row of the output grid: positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2) , (2,2) respectively.
2.  the white pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) shift and are at (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)

Or, more concisely: Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
