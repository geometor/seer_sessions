Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: white (0) pixels in the input grid shift down by one row, wrapping around from the bottom row to the top. Maroon (9) pixels remain in their original positions. Other color pixels are unaffected by the white pixel movement.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule: white pixels shift down one row, wrapping around.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the input grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Apply transformation based on current pixel above
            if r == 0:
                above = input_grid[rows-1,c]
            else:
                above = input_grid[r-1,c]

            if above == 0:
                output_grid[r,c] = 0
            elif input_grid[r, c] == 0:
                output_grid[r,c] = above

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
