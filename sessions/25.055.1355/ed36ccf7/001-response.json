The input grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels.  The output grid also contains maroon and white pixels, but their positions have changed. The most obvious change is a shift in the position of the white pixels. It appears the transformation involves some form of movement or rearrangement of existing pixels, rather than introducing new colors or complex calculations.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If a white pixel in input is in row index `r`, and column index `c`, the new location will be row `r+1` and column `c`.\n3.  If a pixel is at the bottom row before a move, it moves to the top row and is inserted at the same column. So, for a white pixel in input at row index 2 (the bottom row), and column index `c`, after the transformation, it will be at row index 0, and column index `c`.\n4.  All other pixels (maroon (9)) remain in their original positions. *or*, are shifted as needed to fill the remaining spaces in the grid.\n\nEssentially, the white pixels \"cycle\" downwards, wrapping from the bottom row to the top. The maroon pixels stay in place, or passively fill the empty spaces.\n"
