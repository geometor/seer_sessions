Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Copy the first row of the input grid to the first row of the output grid.
2. Copy the second row of the input grid to the second row of the output grid.
3. Find the central pixel(s) of the second row of the output grid. If the grid width is even, there will be two central pixels; if odd, there will be one.
4. Replace the color(s) of the central pixel(s) of the second row of the output grid with the color(s) of the central pixel(s) of the *first* row.
5. Copy the modified second row of the output grid to the third row of the output grid.
6. Set all rows from the forth row on to be all black/empty/zeros

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, capturing a significant portion of the transformation. However, the validation against the training examples reveals discrepancies, specifically in how the subsequent rows are handled after the third row. The original program assumed all rows after the third would be black (zeros), which is not always the case. The errors indicate that a more nuanced approach is needed, possibly involving pattern continuation or conditional copying based on row position relative to the center.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To accurately assess the transformation, I'll describe each example and it's result from running `transform`.

*   **Example 1:** Input (3x3), Output (3x3) - *Success*. The code correctly handles the central pixel replacement and row copying.
*   **Example 2:** Input (5x5), Output (5x5) - *Partial Success*. First three rows are correctly constructed, the 4th and 5th rows are incorrect, and should mirror the second and first rows.
*   **Example 3:** Input (7x7), Output (7x7) - *Partial Success*. First three rows are correctly constructed, subsequent rows are all zeros. The intended logic likely mirrors rows from rows 1 and 2 to complete the output grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

      subsequent_rows: all_zeros
      result: partial_failure

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the first row of the input grid to the first row of the output grid.
2.  Copy the second row of the input grid to the second row of the output grid.
3.  Find the central pixel(s) of the second row of the output grid. If the grid width is even, there will be two central pixels; if odd, there will be one.
4.  Replace the color(s) of the central pixel(s) of the second row of the output grid with the color(s) of the central pixel(s) of the *first* row.
5.  Copy the modified second row of the output grid to the third row of the output grid.
6.  For rows beyond the third:
    *   The fourth row should be a copy of the second row (before modification).
    *   The fifth row should be a copy of the first row.
    *   This pattern (second row, first row) repeats for subsequent rows. If the output would become bigger than the input, stop.

This revised program incorporates the observed symmetry in the example outputs, where rows after the third appear to mirror the first and second rows in an alternating pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
