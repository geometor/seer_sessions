The input grid transforms into an output grid. The colors are represented by integers 0-9. The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), orange (7), and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve replicating a row. The input has three distinct rows while output has two identical rows at the bottom. The middle element of center row in the input is the same as middle element of the top row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
