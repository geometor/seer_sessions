The initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. The transformation rule appears to be more complex and potentially involves different operations depending on the input grid's characteristics. Further analysis of failing examples is needed. Based on visual inspection, it *might* involve identifying specific shapes/objects within the grid and applying different rotational transformations to them individually, or potentially mirroring operations. The provided examples suggest that the transformation might also be dependent on the size or arrangement of certain colored regions. The current code only performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation, so let's adapt the `transform` function.

Based on further review, this task appears too complex for a single, consistent transformation.

    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
