## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC29B1F0>

**output:**
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC299180>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer representing a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the cells/pixels, maintaining their original colors. It appears to be a rotation or reflection of some kind.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
  - transformation: spatial
    type: rearrangement
    details: "Elements are permuted within the grid."
    possible_operations:
      - rotation
      - reflection

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid to produce the output grid. Specifically:

1.  Consider the input grid.
2.  Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.  The top row becomes the rightmost column, the middle row becomes the middle column, and the bottom row becomes the leftmost column.
3. The rotated grid is the output grid.

Alternatively, you could describe the transformation rule by listing how the coordinates map from input to output as a table, with index 0,0 at top left:

| Input Coordinate | Output Coordinate |
|---|---|
| (0, 0) | (0, 2) |
| (0, 1) | (1, 2) |
| (0, 2) | (2, 2) |
| (1, 0) | (0, 1) |
| (1, 1) | (1, 1) |
| (1, 2) | (2, 1) |
| (2, 0) | (0, 0) |
| (2, 1) | (1, 0) |
| (2, 2) | (2, 0) |

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
