Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple rotation of colors in a counter-clockwise manner, specifically targeting corner and adjacent pixels. This assumption proved too narrow, as evidenced by the test results on the full training set. The provided code only works for the first example and fails to generalize to other examples. The core issue is that the initial observation was overly specific to the first example's geometry and didn't capture the underlying general rule. The rule is not a simple rotation of colors in fixed positions. Rather, it is a cyclical color swap amongst a *specific set* of colors.

My strategy to resolve this is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Results**: Examine all input/output pairs to identify consistent color transformations.
2.  **Identify the Color Cycle**: Determine the precise sequence of colors that are being swapped. The original program did not describe a color transformation, but a pixel position rotation.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program**: Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the cyclical color substitution.
4. **Prepare for Code modification**: I will use observations from all examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the color transformations, I will manually inspect the input/output grids for each example and record the mappings.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input: `[[1, 8, 8], [8, 2, 8], [8, 8, 3]]`
    *   Output: `[[2, 8, 8], [8, 3, 8], [8, 8, 1]]`
    *   Observed color changes: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1.  8 remains unchanged.

*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input: `[[2, 8, 3], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Output: `[[3, 8, 1], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Observed color changes: 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 1 is not present. 5 and 8 are unchanged.

*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 3], [8, 1, 2], [3, 2, 8]]`
    *   Output: `[[3, 1, 1], [8, 2, 3], [1, 3, 8]]`
    *    Observed color change: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, and 3 -> 1. 8 remains unchanged

* **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `[[3, 3, 3, 2], [3, 3, 8, 3], [8, 3, 3, 3], [1, 8, 3, 3]]`
    *   Output: `[[1, 1, 1, 3], [1, 1, 8, 1], [8, 1, 1, 1], [2, 8, 1, 1]]`
    *   Observed color changes: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1. 8 remains unchanged

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties: 2D array of color values
    actions: elements change color values
  - object: colors
    properties: represented by integers 0-9
    actions: specific colors are replaced by other specific colors in a cyclical manner.
  - observation: The colors 1, 2, and 3 are involved in a cycle.
  - observation: Color 8 always remains unchanged.
  - observation: Colors other than 1, 2, 3, and 8 are unchanged.
  - color_cycle: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If the pixel's color is 1, change it to 2.
3.  If the pixel's color is 2, change it to 3.
4.  If the pixel's color is 3, change it to 1.
5.  Leave all other colors unchanged.
6. The output is the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
