Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input and Output Grids:** Both input and output are 3x3 grids. The values within the grids represent colors.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain the colors red (2), grey (5), and magenta (6).
*   **Color Changes:** Some colors change between the input and output, while others remain the same. The most notable is magenta changing to red in the first output

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        values: [2, 5, 6]  # Red, Grey, Magenta

actions:
  - type: color_change
    details: Conditional color swap based on initial color and position.

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The input grid transforms into the output grid according to a specific rule.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  The colors are rotated in place in counter-clockwise manner.
