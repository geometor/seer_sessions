## Example 3

**input:**
```
9 9 5
5 5 8
5 8 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CAF50>

**output:**
```
9 5 5
9 5 8
5 8 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1061D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input and output grids are very similar, suggesting a subtle transformation. The most noticeable change is in the top-left corner and the adjacent cell to the right.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a 2D array of colored pixels.

properties:
  - name: color
    values: represented by integers 0-9
    mapping: see COLOR_MAP in the instructions

actions:
  - name: swap
    description: Exchanges the values of two specified cells.
    parameters:
      - cell1: (row, column) coordinates
      - cell2: (row, column) coordinates

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
    elements:
        - adjacent: cells sharing a side
        - diagonal: cells sharing only a corner.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves a single swap of two adjacent cell values. Specifically, the value of the top-left cell (0, 0) and the value of the cell immediately to its right (0, 1) are exchanged. All the other values in the grid are un-changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
