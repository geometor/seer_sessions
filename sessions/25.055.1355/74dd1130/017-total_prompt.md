Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code was based on observations from the first training example, and it seems to have captured some, but not all, aspects of the transformation. The errors in Examples 2 and 3 indicate that the transformation rule needs to be more precise. It appears there's an issue related to the specific positions where changes are applied, potentially involving a more complex pattern than initially assumed. Specifically, only some of the gray pixels at the edges are changing, not all.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Comparison:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output for each example, focusing on the differences.
2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for patterns in the indices where errors occur. Are they related to row/column position, proximity to other colors, or some other geometric property?
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the error patterns, adjust the initial hypothesis about the transformation rule.
4.  **Natural Language Program Update:** Re-express the refined hypothesis as a clear and concise natural language program.
5.  **Metrics**: use code execution to collect the necessary information to be sure we have documented the patterns

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Bottom Edge:** Focus only on the last row (row index 7) of the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Swapping on the Bottom Edge:** Starting from the second element and going up to the last element of the last row: swap the azure(8) and grey(5) colors

**Reasoning for the Updated Program:**

The initial program likely assumed a simple global swap or a swap based on adjacency without considering specific row/column constraints. The error analysis clearly shows that changes only happen on the bottom row (row 7). Furthermore, there is an alternating swapping of azure and gray color on the last row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
