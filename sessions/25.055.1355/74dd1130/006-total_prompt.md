Previous Code:
```python
"""
The initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. The transformation rule appears to be more complex and potentially involves different operations depending on the input grid's characteristics. Further analysis of failing examples is needed. Based on visual inspection, it *might* involve identifying specific shapes/objects within the grid and applying different rotational transformations to them individually, or potentially mirroring operations. The provided examples suggest that the transformation might also be dependent on the size or arrangement of certain colored regions. The current code only performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation, so let's adapt the `transform` function.

Based on further review, this task appears too complex for a single, consistent transformation.

    A more sophisticated analysis and transformation logic is required to solve the task.

    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided training examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is demonstrably incorrect, as evidenced by the failures in multiple test cases. The transformation is significantly more complex and likely involves a combination of operations, potentially including:

1.  **Object Recognition:** Identifying distinct shapes or regions within the input grid based on color and connectivity.
2.  **Conditional Transformations:** Applying different transformations (rotations, reflections, translations) to different objects *or* based on grid properties.
3.  **Spatial Relationships:** Considering the relative positions of objects within the grid.

The strategy to resolve the errors involves iterative refinement:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on how specific objects or regions are transformed.
2.  **Hypothesis Generation:** Formulate more nuanced hypotheses about the transformation rules, incorporating object recognition and conditional logic.
3.  **Code Modification:** Adapt the `transform` function to implement the revised hypotheses. Start with smaller, simpler transformations and test.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the modified code against all training examples, identify failure points, and repeat the process.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution)**

I need to develop some tools to gather information about grids, but as the dreamer, I don't have access to the `execute_code` capability. I'll have to make visual observations and list the information I *would* gather if I could execute code.

**Example 1: (Passed)**

*   Input: 3x3, single orange (7) square.
*   Output: 3x3, single orange (7) square.
*   Observation: A single pixel remains in the same relative location after a 90 degree rotation. A single pixel *is* a rotation.

**Example 2: (Failed)**

*   Input: 7x7, 'L' shape of orange (7), and single blue (1)
*   Output: 7x7, reverse 'L' and blue (1) in different location
*   Desired Metrics:
    *   Bounding box of the orange 'L'.
    *   Relative position of the blue pixel to the 'L'.
    *   How does the L change? Mirror? Rotation of part of it?
    *  Where does the single blue pixel move to?
*   Observation: The transformation is NOT a simple rotation. It involves a change in the 'L' shape (likely a reflection or partial rotation) and a movement of the blue pixel relative to the 'L'.

**Example 3: (Failed)**

*   Input: 10x10, two separate configurations of orange(7).
*   Output: 10x10, orange in different configurations
*   Desired Metrics:
    *   Identify the two orange objects (bounding boxes).
    *   Analyze the transformation of each object independently.
    *   Look for symmetries, reflections, or rotations within each object.
* Observation: It appears that each of the distinct orange components is being manipulated independently. The lower three-pixel line is mirrored vertically.

**Example 4: (Failed)**

*   Input: 11x11, various shapes of orange (7) and a single blue (1) pixel.
*   Output: 11x11, transformed orange shapes, blue in new place
*   Desired Metrics:
    *   Identify individual orange objects/clusters.
    *   Determine the transformation applied to each object.
    *   Analyze the movement of the blue pixel.
*   Observation: Complex rearrangement of orange, almost certainly at the individual "object" level.

**Example 5: (Failed)**

*   Input: 2x2, all orange (7).
*   Output: 2x2, all orange (7).
*   Observation: Passes trivially since a 90 degree rotation of a square 2x2 will return it to its original configuration.

**YAML Facts**

example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: single pixel
      position: (1,1)
  output_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: single pixel
      position: (1,1)
  transformation: no_change # a single pixel is it's own rotation
example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: 'L'
      bbox: (1:4, 0:3) # hypothetical - would get from code
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      position: (0,6) #hypo
  output_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: reverse 'L'
      bbox: (3:6, 4:7)
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      position: (6,0)
  transformation: complex_rearrangement # more specific transformation needed

example_3:
   input_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: '3-pixel line'
    - color: orange
      shape: 'complex' #need to be more specific on shape

   output_objects:
    - color: orange
    - color: orange

   transformation: object_level_transformation

example_4:
   input_objects:
      - color: orange
      - color: blue
   output_objects:
      - color: orange
      - color: blue

   transformation: object_level_transformation

example_5:
  input_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: 2x2 square
  output_objects:
    - color: orange
      shape: 2x2 square
  transformation: no_change # due to rotation symmetry

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects. An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.  Connectivity is 4-way (not diagonal).
2.  **Individual Transformation:** Each object is transformed independently, as follows.
    * Orange 'L' shape is mirrored and rotated to the opposite side
    * Single orange pixels show no positional change
    * Other Orange shapes - TBD (need to identify specific rules)
3.  **Blue Pixel Movement:** Single blue pixels change their relative position to the orange shapes. (Need a precise rule for this movement – potentially relative to the bounding box of the orange objects.)
4. **Grid Preservation**: The size of the grid is constant

This program is still incomplete, especially concerning the transformation of orange objects that are not single pixels or a clear "L" shape. More detailed analysis and potentially more examples are needed to fully define those transformations. The movement of isolated blue pixels is also not completely defined.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
