The cells within the grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors. The input and output grids share a similar structure, but the arrangement and specific values of the colors differ. The black borders are not encoded in the input or output representation but are important for understanding the objectness of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
