The provided code correctly implements this logic. The test results indicate this rule perfectly applies to all given training examples. Therefore, no code revision is needed. The strategy is to confirm the existing rule works for all provided examples, and prepare to test the transformation on the test input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo confirm the correctness, I will use code execution to count the occurrences of colors 1, 2, and 3 in both the input and output grids for each training example. This will verify that the substitution is happening as expected and that no other colors are being unintentionally modified.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(task_data):\n    results = []\n    for example in task_data['train']:\n        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n        \n        # count colors in grids before transformation\n        input_counts = {color: 0 for color in range(10)}\n        for row in input_grid:\n          for pixel in row:\n            input_counts[pixel] += 1\n\n        # Count colors in actual output\n        output_counts = {color: 0 for color in range(10)}\n        for row in output_grid:\n          for pixel in row:\n            output_counts[pixel] += 1\n            \n        # run transformation and count colors\n        transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)\n        transformed_counts = {color: 0 for color in range(10)}\n        for row in transformed_grid:\n            for pixel in row:\n                transformed_counts[pixel] += 1\n\n        results.append({\n            'input_counts': input_counts,\n            'output_counts': output_counts,\n            'transformed_counts': transformed_counts\n        })\n    return results\n\n# this will be replaced with the actual task data:\nexample_task_data = {\n  \"train\": [\n    {\n      \"input\": [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]],\n      \"output\": [[2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"input\": [[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]],\n      \"output\": [[0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3], [0, 3, 3]]\n    },\n     {\n      \"input\": [[3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3]],\n      \"output\": [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nanalysis = analyze_results(example_task_data)\n\nfor i, result in enumerate(analysis):\n  print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n  print(f\"   Input Counts: {result['input_counts']}\")\n  print(f\"  Output Counts: {result['output_counts']}\")\n  print(f\"Transf.

All pixels with the color value 3 (green) are changed to color value 1 (blue).\n4.  Pixels with any other color value remain unchanged.\n"
