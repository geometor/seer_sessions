It correctly identifies the core transformation. The provided code implements this transformation and compares the actual output against the expected output, highlighting any discrepancies. The `analyze_grid_diff` function is helpful for debugging.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of what the code execution tells us, focusing on critical observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code correctly transforms the input. The shapes and relative positions of the azure (8) and white (0) pixels are maintained after the -90 degree rotation.\n*   **Example 2:** Works correctly. The transformation is simply identifying a -90 degree rotation.\n*   **Example 3:** Works correctly. The transformation is simply identifying a -90 degree rotation.\n*   **Example 4:** Works correctly. The transformation is simply identifying a -90 degree rotation.\n\nAll training examples provided match perfectly, which means the initial hypothesis works.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating it by -90 degrees.\n  - objects:\n      - grid: The entire 2D array of pixels.\n      - pixels: Individual cells within the grid, each with a color value (0-9).\n  - properties:\n      - grid_dimensions: The height and width of the grid (consistent within each example, but can vary between examples).\n      - pixel_color: The color value of each pixel.\n  - actions:\n      - rotate_grid: The grid is rotated -90 degrees (clockwise).\n  - validations:\n      - all_examples_passed: True. The rotation rule holds for all training examples.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n```\n1.  **Rotate the grid:** Rotate the entire input grid -90 degrees clockwise. This is equivalent to flipping the array vertically and then transposing it.\n```\nThe steps provided are an accurate and clear method for doing a -90 rotation.\n"
