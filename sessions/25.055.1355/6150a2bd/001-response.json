The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation. The colors (represented by the numbers) seem to be preserved, but their positions within the grid change. It's not a simple reflection along an axis, nor a 90-degree rotation. It appears to involve inverting rows and then transposing.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The top row becomes the bottom row, the middle row stays in the middle, and the bottom row becomes the top row.\n2.  **Transpose:** Swap the rows and columns of the grid. The element at position (row, col) moves to (col, row). This is equivalent to reflecting the grid across its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n\nCombining steps one and two is the equivalent of rotating the grid by -90 degrees.\n"
