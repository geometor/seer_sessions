facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating it by -90 degrees.
  - objects:
      - grid: The entire 2D array of pixels.
      - pixels: Individual cells within the grid, each with a color value (0-9).
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: The height and width of the grid (consistent within each example, but can vary between examples).
      - pixel_color: The color value of each pixel.
  - actions:
      - rotate_grid: The grid is rotated -90 degrees (clockwise).
  - validations:
      - all_examples_passed: True. The rotation rule holds for all training examples.
