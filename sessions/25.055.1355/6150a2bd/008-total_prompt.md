## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C4C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rotation and, potentially, color changes based on the original positions of colored pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description: 90 degrees clockwise?
    parameters:
      angle: 90 (needs verification)

  - type: recolor
    description: color of the pixel based on it's position
    parameters: none
    conditions:
        - if a new position is occupied by a color, the color is kept
        - else original colors are transfered

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
  - transformational: input grid is rotated and recolored to produce the output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate the Grid:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **recolor:** keep the new rotated colors on the board

To be more specific, the numbers in the input grid are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and placed in the new locations.
The colors (numerical values) from the input are rotated 90 degrees clockwise to form the output.

Example walkthrough:

*   Input (1,0) which has value 5, moves to Output (0,1), keeping the value.
*   Input(0,2) has color 2 rotates to Output(2,0) keeping the color 2
*   Input (1,0) has color 1 rotates to Output(0,1), and keeps the color 1

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
