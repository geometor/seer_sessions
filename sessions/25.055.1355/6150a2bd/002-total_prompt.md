## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C4C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation. The colors (represented by the numbers) seem to be preserved, but their positions within the grid change. It's not a simple reflection along an axis, nor a 90-degree rotation. It appears to involve inverting rows and then transposing.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_codes
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: The set of colors in the input grid is identical to the set of colors in the output grid.
  - observation: position_change
    description: The positions of the colors within the grid change between input and output.
  - hypothesis: transformation_type
    description: rotation/inversion and transposition
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Invert Rows:** Reverse the order of the rows in the input grid. The top row becomes the bottom row, the middle row stays in the middle, and the bottom row becomes the top row.
2.  **Transpose:** Swap the rows and columns of the grid. The element at position (row, col) moves to (col, row). This is equivalent to reflecting the grid across its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).

Combining steps one and two is the equivalent of rotating the grid by -90 degrees.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
