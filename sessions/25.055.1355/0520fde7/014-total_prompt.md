## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7DCBFF213340>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The dimensions of the input grid are 3x7, and the output grid is 3x3. The key feature seems to be the vertical gray stripe in the input which might have be related to the red pixels generated in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x7
    colors: [white, blue, gray]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [white, red]
  - object: gray_stripe
    type: object
    color: gray
    location: input_grid
    column: 4
  - object: red_pixels
    type: object
    color: red
    location: output_grid
    positions: [(2,1), (3,3)]  # Using 1-based indexing, consistent with row/col descriptions

  - observation: gray_stripe_width
    value: 1 # single column
  - observation: input_grid_height
    value: 3
  - observation: output_grid_height
    value: 3
  - observation: red_pixel_count
    value: 2
  - observation: relationship
    description: red pixels replace the blue pixels that are next to the vertical gray stripe on the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the gray stripe:** Locate the single vertical stripe of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Note its column index.
2. **Find adjacent blue pixels** Find blue pixels that are on the left and on the right of the gray stripe.
3.  **Create output grid**: Create an output grid with dimensions 3x3, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transform to red**: Change the color of cells in the output grid based on the blue pixels next to the grey stripe. The position of the new red pixels relative to the column could be described as follows:
    *   The row number remains the same
    *   The column number is relative to the blue pixel, so it should be the index / 2.
    *   If there is not blue pixel on the left, that is input row 1, then it should be the first column.

In summary the output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid. If there is a blue pixel to the left or the right of the grey stripe, it becomes red in the output grid in a column that depends on the index.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
