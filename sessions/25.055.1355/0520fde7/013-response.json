The input grid contains white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The dimensions of the input grid are 3x7, and the output grid is 3x3. The key feature seems to be the vertical gray stripe in the input which might have be related to the red pixels generated in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Note its column index.\n2. **Find adjacent blue pixels** Find blue pixels that are on the left and on the right of the gray stripe.\n3.  **Create output grid**: Create an output grid with dimensions 3x3, initially filled with white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Transform to red**: Change the color of cells in the output grid based on the blue pixels next to the grey stripe. The position of the new red pixels relative to the column could be described as follows:\n    *   The row number remains the same\n    *   The column number is relative to the blue pixel, so it should be the index / 2.\n    *   If there is not blue pixel on the left, that is input row 1, then it should be the first column.\n\nIn summary the output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid. If there is a blue pixel to the left or the right of the grey stripe, it becomes red in the output grid in a column that depends on the index.\n"
