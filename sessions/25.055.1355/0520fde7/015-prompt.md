Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location of a vertical gray stripe and adjacent blue pixels.

1.  **Identify the gray stripe:** Locate the single vertical stripe of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Note its column index.
2.  **Find adjacent blue pixels**: Find blue pixels that are on the left and on the right of the gray stripe.
3.  **Create output grid**: Create an output grid with dimensions 3x3, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Transform to red**: Change the color of cells in the output grid based on the blue pixels next to the grey stripe.
    *   The row number remains the same
    *   The column number is relative to the blue pixel, so it should be the index / 2.
    *   If there is not blue pixel on the left, that is input row 1, then it should be the first column.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
