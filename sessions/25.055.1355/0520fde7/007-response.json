There's a distinct vertical line of gray (5) in the center.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It contains white and red colors.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve extracting a specific region of the input and changing some colors. The output grid is significantly smaller.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, take the pixels one column to the left and one column to the right of the center column, and all three rows.\n3.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted 3x3 subgrid, change all blue (value 1) pixels to red (value 2).
