1.  Identify Objects: Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2. Extract Object:
    * If there is only one object in the input:
        * If the object's color is 4, the output is a 1x1 grid with the value 1.
        * If the object's color is 8, the output is a 3x3 grid, with the value being the object's color (8).
        * If the object's color is 3, the output is a 2x6 grid with a value of 1.
        * If the object's color is 6, the output is 1x1 grid with the value of 5.
