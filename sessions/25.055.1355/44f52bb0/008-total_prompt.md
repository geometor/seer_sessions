## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CAC20>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF3CBE20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing numerical values (0 and 2). These represent colors (0: white, 2: red). There are distinct regions of red (2) and white (0).
*   **Output:** A single numerical value (7) within what looks like a 1x1 grid, colored orange. The single value seems to represent something derived by calculation.
*  the output is orange, which is color 7.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    description: 3x3 grid with pixel values.
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 3
      - colors: [0, 2]  # white, red

  - type: output_grid
    description: 1x1 output
    properties:
      - colors: [7] #orange

  - type: objects
    description: red colored area in input
    properties:
       count: 3
       color: 2

  - type: transformation_hypothesis:
       type: count and map
       input: red pixels
       output: replace sum of count with color index

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red (value '2') pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Map**: replace this count with the color for orange.
3. **output**: Return the count calculated in a 1x1 grid.

In essence, the transformation involves counting specific colored pixels in the input and using that count to determine color. The result is then the index of the color..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
