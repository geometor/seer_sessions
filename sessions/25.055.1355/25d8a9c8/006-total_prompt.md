Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution. Each pixel in the input grid is replaced with a new color in the output grid based on the following mapping:

1.  Yellow (4) pixels in the input become Gray (5) pixels in the output.
2.  Red (2) pixels in the input become White (0) pixels in the output.
3.  Green (3) pixels in the input become White (0) pixels in the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid by applying a color mapping.
    """
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Apply color mapping
    output_grid[input_grid == 4] = 5  # Yellow becomes Gray
    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 0  # Red becomes White
    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 0  # Green becomes White

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a simple color substitution. While it correctly handles some color transformations, it's clear from the results of testing on other train set examples that the transformation rule is incomplete. The results indicate a consistent color mapping that was only partially captured by the initial natural language program. We need to identify the *complete* color mapping by examining all input/output pairs. Since every example demonstrates the same behavior, there is no change of behavior to consider.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine all Examples:** Carefully review each input/output pair in the training set to identify the complete set of color substitutions.
2.  **Code Execution for Metrics**: Use `code_execution` to evaluate expression that will help build up a model of the transformation.
3.  **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:** Based on the comprehensive color mapping, update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the complete transformation rule.

**Code Execution for Metrics & Observations:**

First, let's check distinct colors in input and output.

input_colors = set()
output_colors = set()

for example in train_ex:
    input_grid, output_grid = example
    input_colors.update(np.unique(input_grid))
    output_colors.update(np.unique(output_grid))

print(f"Input colors: {input_colors}")
print(f"Output colors: {output_colors}")
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
