## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 3 3
6 6 6
3 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CAB90>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CAF50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid seems to be a simplified version of the input, retaining only the middle row and changing those pixels to gray (5). All other pixels in the output are white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (0-9, mapped to color names)

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Select the middle row of pixels.
  - type: modification
    description: Change the color of selected pixels to gray (5).
  - type: replacement
    description: change all other cells to white (0)

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains original pixel colors.
  - output_grid: Contains modified pixel colors, simplified to gray and white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid (3x3).
2.  **Select** the pixels in the middle row.
3.  **Change** selected middle row the pixel colors to gray (value 5).
4. **Replace** all other pixels with white (0)
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
