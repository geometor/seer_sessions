observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - cells: individual pixels with integer values 0-9
      - dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30
    actions:
      - name: increment_with_modulo
        description: Each pixel's value is incremented by 1. If the original value is 9, the new value is 0.
        parameters:
          - input_grid: 2D array of integers
        result:
          - output_grid: 2D array of integers with each value incremented (modulo 10)
