## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 8 6
5 8 6
5 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D79D0>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer represents a specific color. The input grid and output grid have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to be a one-to-one mapping of input colors to output colors, i.e. a color substitution. The spatial arrangement of pixels remains unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers
    element_range: 0-9
    element_mapping: color_map
  - observation: input_grid
    description: Initial state of the grid
  - observation: output_grid
    description: Transformed state of the grid
  - transformation: color_substitution
    details: Each color in the input is replaced by a corresponding color in the output.
    mapping:
      5: 1  # gray -> blue
      8: 9  # azure -> maroon
      6: 2  # magenta -> red
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of integers, each representing a color.
2.  **Transformation:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the cell value is 5, replace it with 1.
    *   If the cell value is 8, replace it with 9.
    *   If the cell value is 6, replace it with 2.
    *   Otherwise, leave the cell value unchanged.
3.  **Output:** Return the modified 3x3 grid.

In essence, the program performs a simple color substitution based on the defined mapping, preserving the grid structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
