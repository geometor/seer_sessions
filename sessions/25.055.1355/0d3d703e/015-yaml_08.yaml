        - object_1: {shape: 3x3 grid, color: gray, value: 5}
      output_objects:
        - object_1: {shape: 3x3 grid, color: blue, value: 1}
      transformation: All gray (5) pixels become blue (1).
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - object_1: {shape: 3x3 grid, contains: [gray (5), azure (8)]}
      output_objects:
        - object_1: {shape: 3x3 grid, contains: [blue (1), maroon (9)]}
      transformation: Gray (5) pixels become blue (1), and azure (8) pixels become maroon (9).
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
       - object_1: {shape: 3x3 grid, contains: [magenta (6), gray (5), azure (8)]}
      output_objects:
       - object_1: {shape: 3x3 grid, contains: [red (2), blue (1), maroon (9)]}
      transformation: Magenta (6) pixels become red (2), gray (5) pixels become blue (1), and azure (8) pixels become maroon (9).
