observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      dimensions: variable
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      dimensions: same as input_grid
  - action: increment
    description: Each pixel value in the input_grid is incremented by 1.
    details: If the incremented value exceeds 9, it wraps around to 0 (modulo 10 operation).
