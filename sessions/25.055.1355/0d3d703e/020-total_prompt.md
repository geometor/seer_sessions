## Example 4

**input:**
```
9 4 2
9 4 2
9 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D79D0>

**output:**
```
8 3 6
8 3 6
8 3 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D4CD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color.
*   The spatial arrangement of cells is identical in the input and output; the grid structure itself doesn't change.
*   The transformation involves changing the color (digit) of each cell, suggesting a mapping or rule-based substitution.
*   The example shows a consistent change: 9 becomes 8, 4 becomes 3, and 2 becomes 6.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    properties:
      cells:
        type: list
        description: "2D array of cells"
        elements:
          type: cell
          properties:
            value:
              type: integer
              range: [0-9]
              mapping: "color code"
            position:
              type: tuple
              description: "(row, column)"

actions:
  - type: transform
    description: "Change cell values based on a mapping."
    input: grid
    output: grid
    rule: "color mapping"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Cells are arranged in a 3x3 grid."
  - type: transformation
    description: "Input grid cells map to output grid cells based on value."
    mapping:
      9: 8
      4: 3
      2: 6
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid where each cell contains a single-digit color code.
2.  **Transformation:** For each cell in the input grid, replace its value according to the following mapping:
    *   If the value is 9, change it to 8.
    *   If the value is 4, change it to 3.
    *   If the value is 2, change it to 6.
    *   Otherwise, leave unchanged // implicit rule
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the transformed cell values, maintaining the original grid structure.

In essence, the program is a simple color substitution rule applied uniformly to every cell in the grid. There are no detected object manipulations, movements or any complex geometry calculations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
