The input grid contains single-digit integers (2, 3, and 8), and the output grid contains single-digit integers (6, 4, and 9). The transformation appears to be a simple numerical operation applied to each corresponding cell in the input and output grids. The spatial arrangement of the cells seems irrelevant, as each cell is transformed independently. The colors represent the digits, and there are three distinct \"objects\" or pixel types because of the three input digits.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
