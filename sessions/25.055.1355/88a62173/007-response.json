The grids contain numerical values, which are visualized as colors (0: white, 1: blue). The primary operation seems to be some form of filtering or extraction of specific elements from the input grid. The positions of the '1' (blue) pixels appear to be significant. The presence of '0' (white) might indicate a background or absence of data in certain regions, or it might be a significant value, defining a boundary. The spatial relationships between the blue and white pixels in the input seem to dictate the structure of the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
