Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 5x5 grid containing two colors: white (0) and red (2).
*   The output is a 2x2 grid containing the same two colors: white (0) and red (2).
*   The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input grid, focusing on the top-left quadrant, but not a direct extraction. The colors seem to reflect somehow the most important information in the top-left of the input, but there are some transformations

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [5, 5]  # Input grid dimensions
      - colors: [0, 2]    # White and Red
    name: input_grid

  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [2, 2]   # Output grid dimensions
      - colors: [0, 2]     # White and Red
    name: output_grid

actions:
    - type: find
      input: input_grid
      description: Find a subsample of the input that represents information of input
      
relations:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid's content is related to the top-left quadrant of the input grid, the layout is somehow reflected in the output, at a different scale

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus:** Examine the top-left 2x2 region of the input grid.
2.  **Quadrant Summary**: Consider a 2x2 sub-grid
3.  **Populate Output**: Create an output grid of size 2x2. Populate the first three elements (reading order) from the 2x2 sub-grid. For the last position, place the color of that subgrid that occupies most positions.
