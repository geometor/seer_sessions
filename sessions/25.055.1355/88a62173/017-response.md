Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the idea of finding a 2x2 non-white subgrid, flipping it, and using that as the output. This approach works for the first training example but fails for others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally about finding *any* 2x2 non-white subgrid and rotating it. The other examples show different patterns and suggest a more targeted approach related to a *specific* non-white subgrid. The strategy should shift to correctly identifying the relevant subgrid (or object) and understanding the precise transformation applied to it, which isn't always a simple 180-degree rotation. It is important to distinguish between sub-grids (contiguous areas of specific shapes) and objects (contiguous areas of a single color)

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the failures, let's analyze each example pair. I'll use comments in a Python script to examine array shapes and values.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_examples(examples):
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(example['input']) # Use the provided transform function

        print(f"Example {i+1}:")
        print(f"  Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
        print(f"  Expected output shape: {expected_output_grid.shape}")
        print(f"  Predicted output shape: {np.array(predicted_output_grid).shape}") # Ensure predicted output is also a NumPy array
        print(f"  Input: \n{input_grid}")
        print(f"  Expected Output: \n{expected_output_grid}")
        print(f"  Predicted Output: \n{np.array(predicted_output_grid)}")
        print(f"  Correct Prediction? {np.array_equal(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid)}")
        print("-" * 20)

# Assuming 'train' is a list of dictionaries, each with 'input' and 'output'
examples = [
    {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[8, 8], [8, 8]]},

    {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]], 'output': [[8, 8], [8, 8]]}

**YAML Facts**

task: "d5d63629"
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - object_id: 1
        color: azure (8)
        shape: 2x2 square
        position: (4,4) # Top-left corner coordinates
        action: copy # This object is copied to the output
    output:
      - object_id: 1 #referring the object

      - object_id: 1
        color: azure (8)
        shape: 2x2 square

        action: copy
    output:
      - object_id: 1 #referring the object
        shape: 2x2 square

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - object_id: 1
        color: azure (8)
        shape: 2x2 square
        position: (7,6) # Top-left corner coordinates
        action: copy
    output:
      - object_id: 1 #referring the object
        shape: 2x2 square
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Find the largest contiguous block of azure (color 8) pixels that forms a 2x2 square.
2.  **Copy:** Create an output grid that is an exact copy of the 2x2 square.
3. **Output Result:** The identified 2x2 azure square is the output. If no such square exists, the current behavior of outputing a 1x1 white grid needs to be revised, we don't have enough information to determine this rule.

The key improvement is focusing on the *specific* azure 2x2 square, rather than any 2x2 non-white area. The transformation is a direct copy, not a rotation.
