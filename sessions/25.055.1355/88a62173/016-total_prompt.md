Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code focuses on extracting a 2x2 subgrid from the top-left non-white pixels and reversing it. This approach works for the first training example, but seems to fail, at least partially, on the others. The core issue is that the transformation rule is likely more complex and involves more than just extracting and flipping a 2x2 subgrid.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and proposed strategy:

1.  **Incorrect Subgrid Extraction:** The code assumes a 2x2 subgrid is always the relevant unit. This is not true for all cases. We need a more flexible way to identify the relevant "object" or region to be transformed.
2.  **Oversimplified Transformation:** Simply flipping the subgrid is not sufficient. The transformation may involve color changes, more complex spatial manipulations.
3. **Ignoring other colors.** The function is only looking for the first
   non-white and may be ignoring data.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs, paying close attention to *all* colors and their spatial relationships.
2.  **Object Identification:** Determine what constitutes an "object" in each example. It might be a connected region of a single color, a specific shape, or something else entirely.
3.  **Action Identification**: Look for all actions, flip may not be correct.
4.  **Refine Subgrid Extraction:** Develop a more robust method to identify the region/object to be transformed, it may not be appropriate to limit this to a 2x2.
5.  **Iterative Program Refinement:** Update the natural language program based on the observations, testing it against all examples after each refinement.

**Example and Results Metrics (using code execution where needed)**

To confirm the initial assessment, I'll summarize each example and the test results.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    description = f"Shape: {rows}x{cols}, Colors: {list(unique_colors)}"
    return description

def show_result(transform,example):
      i = example['input']
      o = example['output']
      p = transform(i)
      print(f'   input: {describe_grid(i)}')
      print(f'expected: {describe_grid(o)}')
      print(f'  output: {describe_grid(p)}')
      print(f'  equal?: {np.array_equal(o,p)}')
      print('')

def show_results(transform,task):
    for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
      print(f'example {i}')
      show_result(transform, example)
    print(f'test set')
    show_result(transform, task['test'][0])

from task_descriptions import task1
transform_function = transform # rename to avoid clashing with task in notebook
show_results(transform_function, task1)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
