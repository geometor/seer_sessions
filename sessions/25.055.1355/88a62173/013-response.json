The colors present in this specific example are azure (8) and white (0). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern, although it's not perfectly consistent. The output grid seems to extract a representative subset of the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the colors. The dimensions of the input grid are 5x5, and the output grid is 2x2.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
