## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>

**output:**
```
1 0
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values, which are visualized as colors (0: white, 1: blue). The primary operation seems to be some form of filtering or extraction of specific elements from the input grid. The positions of the '1' (blue) pixels appear to be significant. The presence of '0' (white) might indicate a background or absence of data in certain regions, or it might be a significant value, defining a boundary. The spatial relationships between the blue and white pixels in the input seem to dictate the structure of the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers (0 and 1).
    properties:
      height: 5
      width: 5
      elements: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
      shape: 5 x 5
      colors:
        1: blue
        0: white
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers (0 and 1).
    properties:
      height: 2
      width: 2
      elements:  [1, 0, 1, 1]
      shape: 2 x 2
      colors:
        1: blue
        0: white

  - relationship: transformation
    type: spatial_extraction
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a specific rule related to the positions of the '1' values.
    details: >
      The transformation focuses on extracting specific '1' values from the input grid and
      forming a new, smaller grid. The relative positioning, perhaps within blocks or using
      specific coordinates, seems to be the key.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value '1'.

2.  **Extract Top-Left Corners**: Consider a 2x2 moving window on the input grid. From a larger 2x2 square containing any number of `1`s, extract the original coordinates of the top left '1's within each distinct 2x2 area of the original image that has at least one '1'.

3. Construct the output grid by creating a grid of the extracted "top-left corners", replacing values with 0 if none exist.

4.  **Form Output:** Arrange the extracted pixels in a new 2x2 grid, preserving relative top-left positioning.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
