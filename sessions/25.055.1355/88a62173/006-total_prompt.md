```python
"""
1.  **Iterate:** Consider all possible, overlapping 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
2.  **Most Common Color:** For each 2x2 subgrid, find the most frequent color. If there are multiple colors with the same highest frequency, select the top-left pixel's color in that 2x2 subgrid.
3.  **Populate:** The 2x2 output uses the top-left value from each overlapping 2x2 square in the input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example, focusing on 2x2 subgrids and the most common color. The results across all training examples reveal that this hypothesis is too narrow. The core issue is that it hardcodes assumptions about the operation being applied only in a 2x2 region.

Here's the breakdown of the strategy:

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine the input/output pairs where the code failed. Identify the *true* underlying pattern or rule by visual inspection. Look for consistencies across *all* examples, not just the first one.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML-formatted observations to reflect the actual objects, properties, and actions that govern the transformation. Be more general and less specific to the 2x2 grid assumption.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation, incorporating insights from all examples.
4. Consider boundary conditions.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To provide accurate metrics, I'll use a simplified representation of the grids here, focusing on key features. I will describe some simple properties that will help.

*   **Input Shape:** (rows, cols) of the input grid.
*   **Output Shape:** (rows, cols) of the output grid.
*   **Correct Pixels:** Number of pixels in the generated output that match the expected output.
*   **Total Pixels:** Total number of pixels in the output grid.
*   **Accuracy:** Correct Pixels / Total Pixels.

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Correct Pixels | Total Pixels | Accuracy | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 2       | (16, 16)      | (2, 2)      | 4          |     4         |   1.0    | All correct |
| 3       | (3, 4)      | (2, 2)      | 3              | 4             | 0.75     | output[1][1] failed. The rest are correct.   |

    details:
      - The pixel at input_grid[0][0] is copied to output_grid[0][0].
      - The pixel at input_grid[0][1] is copied to output_grid[0][1].
      - The pixel at input_grid[1][0] is copied to output_grid[1][0].
      - The pixel at input_grid[1][1] is determined using the most_common_color_with_top_left_tiebreaker function

  - action: most_common_in_2x2
    description: Determines output_grid[1][1] using a 2x2 selection of the input.
    details: uses the most_common_color_with_top_left_tiebreaker function

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy:** The top-left, top-right and bottom-left pixels from the 2x2 subgrid at the top-left of the input grid and place in the output grid.
2.  **Subgrid:** Create a 2x2 subgrid using the top-left corner of the input.
3.  **Most Frequent Color:** Examine the 2x2 subgrid, determine the most frequent color. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, select the color of the top-left pixel of the subgrid.
4. **Bottom-Right:** Place the most frequent color (or tie-breaker) in the bottom-right pixel of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
