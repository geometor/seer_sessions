The input grid appears to have a single non-zero (colored) pixel, while the output grid has multiple non-zero pixels. The positions and colors of the output pixels seem unrelated to the position and color of the input pixel, in a direct, obvious sense. It seems to be an encoding or a symbolic transformation rather than a geometric or arithmetic one.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Note its value (color).\n2.  **Lookup Transformation:** Based on the value, perform a predefined symbolic mapping. This mapping dictates the values and positions of multiple pixels within the output grid. Based on the one input-output example, the red pixel (value 2) is mapped to the constant output shown. It is likely that other color inputs would map to unique, consistent output patterns.\n3.  **Create Output:** Construct the output grid, populating specified cells with values based on the map, and setting any undefined locations in the output map to be 0.\n\nEssentially, the transformation appears to function like a lookup table or a very small case statement (switch-case) where the input value determines the entire output grid configuration. More examples would be needed to clarify the mapping rules for all possible input values.\n"
