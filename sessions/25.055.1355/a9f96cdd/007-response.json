The input grid contains mostly white pixels (represented by '0') and a single red pixel (represented by '2'). The output grid is similar in structure to the input but with key changes: The red pixel in the input is replaced by a white pixel. A green pixel (represented by '3') appears one row above and one column to the left of the original red pixel's location. The overall dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x5).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
