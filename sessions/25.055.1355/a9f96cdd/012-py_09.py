1.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Scan the input grid to find the single red pixel (value '2'). Record its row and column.
2.  **Determine Relative Shift:** The green pixel appears in one of the four cardinally adjacent positions (up, down, left, or right) relative to the original red pixel's position.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white pixels (value '0').
4.  **Place the Green Pixel:** Place the green pixel (value '3') in the output grid, one cell away (up, down, left, or right) from the original red pixel's position. The exact offset is determined by observing the corresponding output grid.
5.  **Clear Red:** Ensure no red pixel is present in the output.
