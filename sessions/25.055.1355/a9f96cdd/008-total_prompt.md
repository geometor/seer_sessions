## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains mostly white pixels (represented by '0') and a single red pixel (represented by '2'). The output grid is similar in structure to the input but with key changes: The red pixel in the input is replaced by a white pixel. A green pixel (represented by '3') appears one row above and one column to the left of the original red pixel's location. The overall dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x5).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - subject: input_grid
    description: A 3x5 grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 5]
      - cell_values: integers representing colors (0-9)
  - subject: output_grid
    description: A 3x5 grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 5]
      - cell_values: integers representing colors (0-9)
  - subject: red_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the value 2.
    properties:
      - color: red
      - initial_position: [2, 4] (row, column)
  - subject: green_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the value 3.
    properties:
      - color: green
      - final_position: [1, 3] (row, column)
  - subject: transformation
    description: The process of converting the input grid to the output grid.
    actions:
      - find_red: Locates the red pixel in the input grid.
      - move_and_change_color:  Moves the non-white pixel one row up and one column to the left, and changes the pixel value from 2 to 3 (red to green).
      - clear_initial:  sets the initial position in the output grid to zero
  - subject: background
    description: All grid positions besides red and green are 0
    properties:
      - color: white
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Red Pixel:** Scan the input grid to locate the single red pixel (value '2'). Note its row and column coordinates.
2.  **Calculate New Position:** Determine the new position for a non-white pixel by subtracting 1 from the red pixel's row coordinate and 1 from its column coordinate.
3. **Create output grid:** create a grid the same size as the input grid.
4.  **Place the Green Pixel:** In the output grid, set the pixel value at the new position (calculated in step 2) to '3' (green).
5. **Clear initial position:** In the output grid set the value of the input grid's red pixel coordinates to '0'
6. **Fill Background:** In the output grid, all other grid positions should have a value of '0' (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
