The output grid replaces the red pixel with two pixels, azure (8) and orange (7) pixels. The non-zero pixels are in the second row. The azure pixel takes the previous x position, and the orange takes the subsequent position. It also appears all values are on row 2, the row of the original non-zero pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
