Both grids are 3x5 (rows x columns). The input grid contains a single non-zero pixel (colored red, value 2) located at (1, 3) - row 1, column 3 (using 0-indexing). The output grid contains four non-zero pixels, all with different colors and values, and all located on the edges of the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Four new pixels of different colors are generated around the anchor point.\n\n"
