Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed into the output grid by duplicating each column. This effectively doubles the width of the grid while maintaining the original height.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by duplicating each column.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a 2D list.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The transformed grid with duplicated columns.
    """
    # Convert the input list to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize an empty list to store the output.

    for row in input_array:
        # Initialize a new row for the output.
        new_row = []
        # Iterate through each column (pixel) in the current row.
        for pixel in row:
            # Duplicate each pixel and add it to the new row.
            new_row.extend([pixel, pixel])  # Add the pixel twice

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
