## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 1
6 1 1
1 1 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1048B0>

**output:**
```
6 8 1 1 8 6
6 1 1 1 1 6
1 1 6 6 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B5750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into a new grid. The input grid appears to be smaller (3x3) than the output grid (3x6). The colors in the input grid seem to be replicated and rearranged in the output grid. There's a clear expansion of the original pattern. The core concept seems to be mirroring or reflection, likely along a vertical axis. The shape changes from a square to a horizontal rectangle.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - subject: input_grid
    description: A 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - data_type: integer (0-9, representing colors)
  - subject: output_grid
    description: A 3x6 grid of colored pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - data_type: integer (0-9, representing colors)
  - subject: transformation
    description: The input grid is expanded horizontally.
    properties:
      - type: horizontal reflection
      - factor: 2 (the width doubles)
  - subject: colors
    relation: remain consistent
    description: the values from the input are present in the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:** Start with the input grid (3x3).
2. **Horizontal Reflection:** Create a mirrored copy of the input grid. The original input will form columns 1, 2, and 3. The mirror image of those columns will form columns 4, 5, and 6. Specifically do the following:
    *  Column 4 of output becomes a copy of Column 3 of input
    *  Column 5 of output becomes a copy of Column 2 of input
    *  Column 6 of output becomes a copy of column 1 of input
3. **Combine:** The output grid is the combination of the original input grid and its reflected copy, side-by-side. The output will be a 3 x 6 grid.

Essentially, the input grid is duplicated and mirrored horizontally to form the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
