## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 8 4
8 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x128 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
0 1 8 4 0
1 1 8 4 4
8 8 3 8 8
0 8 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x256 at 0x7DCBFF213340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be embedded within the output grid, and the output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with added padding and duplication of some elements. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. There's a clear geometric relationship between the input and output. The background or padding color appears to be 0 (white).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x3
      - elements: [1, 8, 4, 8, 3, 8] # blue, azure, yellow, azure, green, azure
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x5
      - elements: [0, 1, 8, 4, 0, 1, 1, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 8, 0] # Including padding

actions:
  - type: embed
    agent: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    details: "The input grid is placed within the output grid."
  - type: expand
    agent: input_grid
    details: "The input grid is expanded by duplicating certain rows and columns."
  - type: pad
    agent: output_grid
    details: "The output_grid is padded with 0 (white) to achieve the final dimensions"

relationships:
  - input_grid: "Is a subgrid of output_grid."
  - output_grid: "Contains the expanded and padded version of input_grid"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Embed:** Place the input grid inside a larger output grid, starting at the second row and second column (offset of 1,1).
2.  **Duplicate Row:** Duplicate the first row of the input grid and insert it directly above the original first row in the output grid.
3.  **Duplicate Column:** Duplicate the last column of the input grid and insert it directly to the right of the original last column in the output grid.
4.  **Pad:** Fill the remaining empty cells (first row, first column, last row and last column) of the output grid with the value 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
