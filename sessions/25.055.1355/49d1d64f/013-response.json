The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or replication of the original grid's elements. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid seem to be preserved and repositioned in the output grid. There's a clear geometric relationship, but it's not a simple scaling. The central element of the input (0, white) appears to be somewhat \"centered\" within the output, and the other elements fan out, almost like a \"mirrored cross\" of the original. The additional 0s seem to \"fill in\" areas with no mirrored counterpart.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Each non-center cell is mirrored, copying the color/value:\n    *   Horizontally across the central vertical axis.\n    *   Vertically across the central horizontal axis.\n    *    Across both center axes, copying diagonally\n3. **Padding with '0'**: Any remaining empty cells in the output grid that were not filled during the mirroring process are filled with the value '0' (white).\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the input grid, expands it by creating mirrored copies around a central vertical and horizontal axis, and fills in any leftover space with zeros.\n"
