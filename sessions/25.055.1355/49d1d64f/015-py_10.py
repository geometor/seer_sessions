# Hypothetical code_execution results - Example 1 (Correct)

# Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Expected Output: [[1, 2, 3, 0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 0, 4], [7, 8, 9, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 4, 7, 0, 1]]
# Actual Output: [[1, 2, 3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9, 8, 7], [4, 5, 6, 5, 4], [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]]

# Metrics:
#   - Input Shape: (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Expected): (5, 5)
#   - Output Shape (Actual): (5, 5)
#   - Correct Pixels: Some, including mirroring of content but zero padding is missing
#   - Incorrect Pixels: All the padding cells.

# Hypothetical code_execution results - Example 2 (Incorrect)

# Input: [[6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6]]
# Expected Output: [[6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6]]
# Actual Output: [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]

# Metrics:
#   - Input Shape: (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Expected): (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Actual): (5, 5)
#   - Correct Pixels: 9
#   - Incorrect Pixels: 16

# Hypothetical code_execution results - Example 3 (Incorrect)

# Input: [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]
# Expected Output: [[5]]
# Actual Output: [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
# Metrics:
#   - Input Shape: (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Expected): (1, 1)
#   - Output Shape (Actual): (5, 5)
#   - Correct Pixels: Some are correct (the mirrored 5s), but location and output size is wrong.
#   - Incorrect Pixels: Many
