## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 2
3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7DCBFC2D5000>

**output:**
```
0 1 2 0
1 1 2 2
3 3 8 8
0 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7DCBFC2D65C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (2x2) into a larger grid (4x4). The input grid consists of four distinct colored pixels, each represented by a unique digit (1, 2, 3, and 8). The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, where each original pixel is replicated in a 2x2 block within the larger grid.  The colors/digits are preserved in this expansion. Additionally, the output grid has cells that aren't part of the 2x2 blocks, they are at the top row, and leftmost and rightmost columns. These cells are colored white (represented by 0).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x2
      elements:
        - value: 1
          color: blue
        - value: 2
          color: red
        - value: 3
          color: green
        - value: 8
          color: azure
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements:
        - value: 0
          color: white
        - value: 1
          color: blue
        - value: 2
          color: red
        - value: 3
          color: green
        - value: 8
          color: azure

actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - type: fill
    description: fill in additional rows and columns with the white color (0)

relationships:
  - input grid elements map directly to 2x2 blocks of corresponding elements in the output grid.
  - The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
  - The additional cells in the grid are all colored in white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with dimensions double that of the input grid.

2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Replicate the pixel's value into a 2x2 block in the corresponding position of the output grid. Specifically, if the input pixel is at `(row, col)`, the 2x2 block in the output grid will start at `(row*2 + 1, col*2 + 1)` and fill cells `(row*2 + 1, col*2 + 1)`, `(row*2 + 1, col*2 + 2)`, `(row*2 + 2, col*2 + 1)`, and `(row*2 + 2, col*2 + 2)`.

3. **Fill Borders**:
    * set the value of cells in the first row to 0
    * set the value of cells in the last row to 0
    * set the value of cells in the first column to 0
    * set the value of cells in the last column to 0

Essentially, the program doubles the input grid, placing the expanded pixels in the "inner" 2x2 squares, starting the placement from the second row and second column, leaving the first and last row and first and last column to be filled by 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
