Previous Code:
```python
"""
Find the red pixel at row 3, last column and change it's color to blue.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = output_grid.shape[0]
    cols = output_grid.shape[1]

    # change output pixels
    #check if row 3 and last column exists
    if rows > 2 and cols > 0:
        # change the color of the pixel at row 3, last column from red(2) to blue (1)
        if output_grid[2, cols -1] == 2:
           output_grid[2, cols - 1] = 1

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was highly specific to the first training example, targeting a red pixel at a specific location (row 3, last column) and changing it to blue. This approach worked for the first example but failed on the others, as expected, because they have different configurations. The core issue is that the initial program was overly specific (hardcoded row and condition) and didn't generalize.

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Generalize the location:** Instead of hardcoding row 3, we need to dynamically find the red pixel, potentially in any row.
2.  **Generalize the condition:** Check for all red pixels, not only on row 3.
3. **Understand the general rule:** What is consistent across all successful examples?

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where applicable):**

Here's a breakdown of each example and result, with added insights:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid, red pixel at (2, 4).
    *   Expected Output: 5x5 grid, blue pixel at (2, 4), rest unchanged.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected.
    *   Notes: Initial code works as designed.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 6x5 grid, red pixel at (2,4).
    *   Expected Output: 6x5, blue pixel at (2,4), rest unchanged.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected.
    *   Notes: Initial code works as designed.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x3 grid, red pixel at (2, 2).
    *   Expected Output: 5x3 grid, blue pixel at (2,2), rest unchanged.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected.
    *   Notes: Initial code works as designed.

The code works perfectly fine with all 3 examples. We should keep the rule the same.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_dims: 5x5
      red_pixel_location: (2, 4) # row, col
      output_grid_dims: 5x5
      blue_pixel_location: (2, 4)
      action: "Change color of the red pixel to blue"
  - example_2:
      input_grid_dims: 6x5
      red_pixel_location: (2, 4)
      output_grid_dims: 6x5
      blue_pixel_location: (2, 4)
      action: "Change color of the red pixel to blue"
  - example_3:
      input_grid_dims: 5x3
      red_pixel_location: (2, 2)
      output_grid_dims: 5x3
      blue_pixel_location: (2, 2)
      action: "Change color of the red pixel to blue"

overall_rule: "Locate the red pixel in the last column of the third row and change its color to blue."
```

**Natural Language Program**

The program was already able to deal with the cases. No changes needed.

```
Find the red pixel at row 3, last column and change it's color to blue.
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
