The output appears to be a single-digit number within its own 1x1 grid. The input grid has a symmetrical pattern with '8' (azure) forming a cross shape and '0' (white) filling the remaining cells. The output is '2' (red). The core task seems to involve analyzing the input grid's structure and content to produce a single-digit output. The relationship between the input grid and the output '2' is not immediately obvious, but must involve counting, shape recognition, or a combination of operations on those elements. The color of the output (red) and the colors in the input (white and azure) will likely be significant, as they represent the integers.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
