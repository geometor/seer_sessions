The input grid seems to contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output is a single blue (1) pixel. The core challenge appears to be determining the rule that decides whether an output is generated based on the input grid's contents and arrangement.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

It could be a count of non-white pixels, or a specific arrangement, since the example uses gray and white.\n\n```"
