## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CB5B0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF3CA500>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a single-pixel grid. The input grid seems to contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output is a single blue (1) pixel. The core challenge appears to be determining the rule that decides whether an output is generated based on the input grid's contents and arrangement.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 3x3 grid of pixels.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains only gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output is a 1x1 grid.
  - observation: |
     The output contains a single blue (1) pixel.
  - relationship: |
      The output pixel's value (1) is not present in the input grid.
  - hypothesis: |
      The rule might involve counting specific colored pixels or analyzing their spatial arrangement.  It could be a count of non-white pixels, or a specific arrangement, since the example uses gray and white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Transform based on the count** If the count is greater than 0, and it is an odd number, the output is a 1x1 grid with single blue pixel.

Another possibility could be related to odd/even counts, or a spatial rule:
1. **Check for symmetry** Inspect if the input is symmetrical (horizontal, vertial or diagonal)
2. **Transform**: if the count is symmetrical the output is blue.

I lean towards to the "count" program but need to see other examples to be certain.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
