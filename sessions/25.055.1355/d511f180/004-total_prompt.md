Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find all pixels of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Invert and Swap:**
    *   Change any identified color 8 (azure) pixels to color 5 (gray).
    *   Change any color 5 (gray) pixels to color 8 (azure)

3. **Selective Swap.**
    *   Change any identified color 6 (magenta) pixel to color 8 (azure) if its immediate left neighbor is color 5 (gray).

4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels retain their original colors.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules."""
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Change color 8 (azure) to 5 (gray)
            if input_grid[r, c] == 8:
                output_grid[r, c] = 5
            # Change color 5 (gray) to 8 (azure)
            elif input_grid[r, c] == 5:
                output_grid[r, c] = 8
            # Change color 6 (magenta) to 8 (azure) if left neighbor is 5 (gray)
            elif input_grid[r, c] == 6:
                if c > 0 and input_grid[r, c-1] == 5:
                    output_grid[r, c] = 8

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code correctly handles the swap of colors 8 (azure) and 5 (gray). It also correctly handles the conditional swap of color 6 (magenta) to 8 (azure) when the left neighbor is 5 (gray). However, it's crucial to examine all provided examples to ensure all rules and edge cases are captured. The provided results will highlight if the logic applies universally or needs modification based on other training examples. If there are discrepancies, we will need to identify the specific scenarios where the current logic fails and adapt the natural language program and subsequent code accordingly.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To help with analysis, I will perform these actions in my report:

- compare input and output dimensions.
- examine color changes, focusing on the counts before and after.

```tool_code
import numpy as np
from typing import Dict

def analyze_grid(grid: np.ndarray) -> Dict:
    """Analyzes a single grid and returns relevant metrics."""
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    return {
        "shape": grid.shape,
        "color_counts": color_counts,
    }

def compare_grids(input_grid: np.ndarray, output_grid: np.ndarray, predicted_grid: np.ndarray) -> Dict:
    """Compares input, output, and predicted grids, highlighting discrepancies."""
    input_analysis = analyze_grid(input_grid)
    output_analysis = analyze_grid(output_grid)
    predicted_analysis = analyze_grid(predicted_grid)

    return {
        "input": input_analysis,
        "output": output_analysis,
        "predicted": predicted_analysis,
        "match": np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid)
    }

def report_results(task_examples):
    reports = []
    for example in task_examples:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Use the provided transform function

        comparison = compare_grids(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid)
        reports.append(comparison)

    for i, report in enumerate(reports):
        print(f"Example {i+1}:")
        print(f"  Input Shape: {report['input']['shape']}")
        print(f"  Output Shape: {report['output']['shape']}")
        print(f"  Predicted Shape: {report['predicted']['shape']}")
        print(f"  Input Colors: {report['input']['color_counts']}")
        print(f"  Output Colors: {report['output']['color_counts']}")
        print(f"  Predicted Colors: {report['predicted']['color_counts']}")
        print(f"  Match: {report['match']}")
        print("-" * 20)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
