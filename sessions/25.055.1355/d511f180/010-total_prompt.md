Previous Code:
```python
"""
Swap the colors of the top-middle and middle-right cells of a 3x3 grid, keeping other cells unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Swap the colors of the specified cells.
    # Top-middle cell (0, 1)
    # Middle-right cell (1, 2)
    output_grid[0, 1], output_grid[1, 2] = output_grid[1, 2], output_grid[0, 1]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too specific, only swapping the top-middle and middle-right cells. This works for the first training example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule needs to be generalized. The provided examples suggest a color swap between *two specific cells*, but the positions of these cells are not always (0, 1) and (1, 2). We need to identify the general rule that determines *which* two cells are swapped, and it appears to involve identifying the colors that are to be swapped, no matter their position within the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs to identify the consistent pattern of the color swap. It's not about fixed positions but about the specific colors involved in the swap.
2.  **Identify Swapped Colors:** Determine the two colors that are swapped in *each* example.
3.  **Generalize the Rule:** Formulate a rule that describes the swap in terms of colors, not positions. For instance, "Swap all instances of color X with color Y."
4. **Update Program**: construct the yaml and natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_grids(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Analyzes the differences between input and output grids."""
    diff = input_grid != output_grid
    changed_indices = np.where(diff)
    changed_input_values = input_grid[changed_indices]
    changed_output_values = output_grid[changed_indices]

    print(f"Changed Indices: {changed_indices}")
    print(f"Input Values at Changed Indices: {changed_input_values}")
    print(f"Output Values at Changed Indices: {changed_output_values}")

# Example grids from the training set (replace with actual data)

example_grids = [
  (np.array([[5, 8, 5],[5, 5, 5],[5, 5, 5]]), np.array([[5, 5, 5],[5, 5, 8],[5, 5, 5]])),
  (np.array([[0, 1, 0],[0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0]]), np.array([[0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 1],[0, 0, 0]])),
  (np.array([[6, 0, 0],[0, 6, 0],[0, 0, 6]]), np.array([[0, 0, 0],[0, 6, 6],[0, 0, 0]])),
    (np.array([[0, 7, 0],[0, 7, 0],[0, 0, 0]]), np.array([[0, 0, 0],[0, 7, 7],[0, 0, 0]])),
]
#test grid provided
test_input = (np.array([[2, 0, 0],[2, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0]]),)

for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(example_grids):
    print(f"--- Example {i+1} ---")
    analyze_grids(input_grid, output_grid)
print(f"--- Test Input ---")
analyze_grids(test_input[0], transform(test_input[0]))

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
