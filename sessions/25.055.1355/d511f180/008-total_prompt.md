## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 5 1
4 5 8
2 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>

**output:**
```
3 8 1
4 8 5
2 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212680>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grids contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation appears to involve some kind of color swapping or manipulation based on position or neighboring colors. The most obvious change is between the grey (5) and azure (8) colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          color: integer (0-9)
          position: (row, column)
  - observation: "The colors in cells (0,1) and (1,2) swap, with the top middle color(5) becoming azure (8), and the right middle (8) becoming gray (5). Other colors are the same between input and output"
  - actions:
    - type: swap
      parameters:
        cell1: (0, 1)
        cell2: (1, 2)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** There are two 3x3 grids, input and output.
2.  **Locate:** Locate the cell in the top middle, (0,1) of the input. Note the color.
3.  **Locate:** Locate the cell in the middle right, (1,2) of the input. Note the color.
4.  **Swap:** the two colors with each other.
5.  **Preserve:** All other cells in the output grid remain the same color and in same location as the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
