    details: >
      Pixels in the first row and first column, *excluding* the top-left pixel, are
      candidates for swapping. The swap occurs based on the following rules:
        - The pixel at [1,0] swaps with the pixel at [0,1] if the pixel values are different.
        - If the pixel [0,1] exists (value is not gray) and [0,1] does not equal [1,0] 
          and if the pixel at [2,0] has the same value as [0,1], then swap [2,0] and [1,0]
        - The pixel at [2, 0] swaps with the pixel directly above it ([1, 0]) 
           IF the value of [2,0] is different from [1,0] and if [2,0] is the same color as [0,1].
        - The pixel at [2,0] will swap with pixel [0,1] if and only if [2,0] has the
          same color/value as [1,0].
