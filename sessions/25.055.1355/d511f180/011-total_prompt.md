Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identify two colors that, when swapped, transform the input grid to the output grid. The transformation involves finding the cells with these two distinct colors and exchanging their positions in the grid. The colors to be swapped are determined by comparing the input and output grids and identifying the colors that have changed positions between the two.

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the unique colors in the input grid.
    unique_colors = np.unique(input_grid)

    # Iterate through all possible pairs of distinct colors.
    for color1 in unique_colors:
        for color2 in unique_colors:

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
