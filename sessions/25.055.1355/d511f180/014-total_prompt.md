## Example 3

**input:**
```
6 5 3
5 7 5
8 8 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
6 8 3
8 7 8
5 5 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a single digit value (0-9) representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or swapping of colors between specific positions within the grid. The core concept relates to objectness where colors at specific co-ordinates swap each other, numbers and counting as well as basic geometry (grid), are relevant priors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9
  - observation: specific pixel colors are swapped
    details:
      - top-middle and left-middle swap
      - bottom-middle and bottom-left swap
      - center, top-left, top-right, bottom-right are unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the colors (represented by digits) in the input grid.
2.  **Swap** the color of the pixel at the top-middle position with the color of the pixel at the left-middle position.
3. **Swap** the color at the bottom-middle position with the color at the bottom-left position.
4.  **Keep** the colors of all other pixels the same.
5.  **Output** the resulting grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
