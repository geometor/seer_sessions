My strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mismatches:** Carefully examine *each* input, expected output, and predicted output. I need to understand *why* the prediction failed. Was it a misidentification of objects, an incorrect transformation, or a missed condition?\n2.  **Refine the Object Model:** Based on the errors, update the `YAML` description of objects. This might involve adding new object types, properties, or relationships. The key is to build a robust representation of the *relevant* elements in the input grids.\n3.  **Iteratively Update the Natural Language Program:** The natural language program is the core of my understanding. I'll revise it step-by-step to incorporate the new information gleaned from analyzing the incorrect predictions. I'll focus on making the instructions precise and unambiguous. The goal is to make the natural language program describe a function that is generally correct.\n4. **Use Code Execution for Reporting**: Use the `report_results` function to understand the specific differences between the output and predicted grids.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution - Hypothetical, since I don't have the actual input/output data)**\nI am going to assume that you are passing in the example and test data from the prompt.\n\n```tool_code\n# This is a placeholder. In a real interaction, I would have access to the\n# actual 'inputs', 'outputs', and 'predicted_outputs' from the previous code\n# execution.  I'm simulating that here to demonstrate the process.\n# I will use data from the json included in the next message\n\n# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)\nexample_inputs = [\n    np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]),  # Example Input 1\n    np.array([[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]),          # Example Input 2\n    np.array([[3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3]]),        # Example Input 3\n]\n\nexample_outputs = [\n    np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]), # Example Output 1 (Matches Input 1)\n    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),          # Example Output 2 (Different from Input 2)\n    np.array([[3, 3], [3, 3], [0, 0]])         # Example Output 3\n]\npredicted_outputs = [\n    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]), # Example Predicted Output 1 (all 0)\n    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),       # Example Predicted Output 2 (all 0)\n    np.array([[3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3]])              # Example Predicted Output 3 (same as input)\n]\n\nreport_results(example_inputs, example_outputs, predicted_outputs)\n\n#calculate the difference between the predicted and expected output.\ndiffs = []\nfor i in range(len(example_outputs)):\n    diffs.append(example_outputs[i] - predicted_outputs[i])\nprint(f\"{diffs=}\")\n\n```"
