## Example 5

**input:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212680>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two distinct colors (yellow and green, represented by 4 and 3, respectively). The output grid uses gray and white (5 and 0) where gray seems to replace one instance of each of the input colors, located diagonally. The consistent size of the grids (3x3) suggests this might be a constraint or inherent to the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            3: green
            4: yellow
            5: gray

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    details:  Replace specific color instances on grid

relations:
   - input_colors_become_gray_on_diagonal
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Identify the distinct colors present in the input grid. In this case, yellow (4) and green (3).
2. **Locate Diagonal:** Imagine/draw a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
3.  **Replace with Gray:** For each of the colors identified, replace the color on the diagonal line with Gray (5).
4.  **Other pixels to white:** Fill any other position in the grid with white (0)

Essentially, the rule seems to be a combination of color and position: for all colors on the diagonal, change to gray, otherwise, make the pixels white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
