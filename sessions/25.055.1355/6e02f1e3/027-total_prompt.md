Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identify distinct colors in the input grid. Replace one instance of each color, specifically those lying on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), with gray (5). Fill the remaining cells with white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid according to the described rule.
    """
    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions, filled with white (0)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find unique colors in the input grid
    unique_colors = np.unique(input_grid)

    # Iterate through the grid's main diagonal
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for color in unique_colors:
          if input_grid[i,i] == color:
            output_grid[i,i] = 5 # set to grey
    
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
