Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid filled with yellow (4) pixels into a 3x3 output grid where the first row is gray (5) and the remaining two rows are white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.  This ensures
    # it's the same size and type.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Change the color of the first row to gray (5).
    output_grid[0, :] = 5

    # Change the color of the second and third rows to white (0).
    output_grid[1:, :] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
