## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC23B790>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC23BB20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of pixels of one color into a grid of pixels of two different colors. The input grid is composed entirely of yellow pixels (represented by the number 4). The output grid has the top row changed to gray pixels (represented by the number 5), and the remaining two rows changed to white pixels (represented by the number 0). The dimensions of the grid (3x3) remain constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is a 3x3 matrix filled with a single color (yellow/4).
  - observation: |
      The output grid is a 3x3 matrix with two colors.
  - observation: |
      The top row of the output is gray (5).
  - observation: |
      The remaining rows of the output are white (0).
  - relationship: |
      The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.
  - action: |
      The color of the pixels in the input grid is changed based on their row index.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      color: yellow (4)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
     dimensions: 3x3
     colors:
        row_1: gray (5)
        rows_2_3: white (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid filled with yellow pixels (color code 4).
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Change the color of all pixels in the first row (row index 0) to gray (color code 5).
    *   Change the color of all pixels in the second and third rows (row indices 1 and 2) to white (color code 0).
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid where the first row is gray, and the second and third rows are white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
