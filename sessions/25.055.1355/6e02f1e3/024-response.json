A contiguous line is defined as a set of green pixels where each pixel (except the topmost) is directly below another green pixel.\n2. **Top Row Transformation:** For each identified object, change the color of the topmost green pixel to gray (5).\n3. **Remaining Rows Transformation:** For each identified object, change the color of all green pixels *below* the topmost pixel to white (0).\n4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the identified green vertical lines should retain their original color.  (This is implicit in the examples, but good to state explicitly).\n5. **Output Dimensions:** the output grid dimensions are identical to the input.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_vertical_lines(grid, color=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous vertical lines of a specified color in a grid.\n    Returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the (row, col)\n    coordinates of pixels belonging to a single vertical line.\n    \"\"\"\n    lines = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_line):\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_line.append((r, c))\n\n        # Check the cell below\n        next_r = r + 1\n        if is_valid(next_r, c) and grid[next_r, c] == color and (next_r, c) not in visited:\n            dfs(next_r, c, current_line)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_line = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_line)\n                lines.append(current_line)\n\n    return lines\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Find all vertical lines of green (3) pixels\n    vertical_lines = find_vertical_lines(output_grid, color=3)\n\n    # Process each vertical line\n    for line in vertical_lines:\n        # Find the topmost pixel's coordinates\n        topmost_pixel = min(line, key=lambda p: p[0])\n\n        # Change the topmost pixel to gray (5)\n        output_grid[topmost_pixel[0], topmost_pixel[1]] = 5\n\n        # Change the remaining pixels in the line to white (0)\n        for r, c in line:\n            if (r, c) != topmost_pixel:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 0\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
