## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 3 3
4 2 2
4 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2DCA60>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC23BB20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of various colors (represented by digits), while the output grid seems to predominantly feature white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The positions of non-white/gray pixels in the output seem to correlate with specific color arrangements in the input. It appears that the transformation might involve replacing certain colors with either white or gray based on their original position or their relationship with neighboring pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [3, 4, 2] # green, yellow, red
    output_colors: [0, 5] # white, gray
  - observation: "The output grid is mostly white, with gray pixels appearing in specific locations."
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: int  # Integer representing the color
      position: (row, col) # Tuple representing row and column index
  - action: color_replacement
    description: "Pixels of certain colors are replaced with either white (0) or gray (5)."
  - potential_rule: "The original colors may determine whether a pixel becomes white or gray, possibly based on position or neighborhood."
  - relationship: "Corner and center pixels might be treated differently."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3. **Color shift**:
    -  If the pixel is in the input and the value is:
        -  3 (green) in the top row -> become 0(white), except if it is in the last column -> become 5(grey)
        -  4 (yellow) in the left column -> become 0(white), except if it is in the last row -> become 5(grey)
        -  2 (red) in the last two rows -> become 0(white), except it is in the last row, or top right -> become 5(grey)
4.  **Output:** Create a new 3x3 grid with these transformed pixel values.

Essentially, this transforms the input by taking colors that have an object boundary with the edge of the frame and setting the output cell in the reflected position, except the object created is along the opposite edge and colored grey.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
