The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in a checkerboard pattern. The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (2 rows x 6 columns).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

(green/3)\n    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, set the cell color to the color of the corresponding cell on the second row of the original input grid.
