"""
The transformation rule is to repeat the input grid vertically. Specifically, the entire input grid is duplicated once and placed directly below the original grid, creating an output grid with twice the height of the input grid.

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid by concatenating the input grid with itself along the vertical axis (axis=0)
    output_grid = np.concatenate((input_grid, input_grid), axis=0)

    # No further pixel changes are needed as the concatenation already achieves the desired transformation.
