## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 1 4
9 1 4
2 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B4370>

**output:**
```
9 1 4
9 1 4
2 1 1
2 1 1
9 1 4
9 1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7DCBFC2B5FF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, where each color is represented by a single digit integer. The input grid appears to be transformed into a larger output grid. The output grid seems to be a vertically elongated version of the input grid, suggesting some form of repetition or duplication.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of single-digit integers representing colors.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [9, 1, 4, 2] # maroon, blue, yellow, red
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x3
      - colors: [9, 1, 4, 2] # maroon, blue, yellow, red
  - action: vertical_repetition
    description: The input grid is repeated vertically.
    details:
     - The input grid appears twice in the output, stacked on top of each other.
  - relationship:
      type: transformation
      description: input_grid is transformed into output_grid by vertical repetition.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to repeat the input grid vertically. Specifically, the entire input grid is duplicated once and placed directly below the original grid, creating an output grid with twice the height of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
