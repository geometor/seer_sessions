## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 8 4
7 6 7
8 7 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B5FF0>

**output:**
```
4 8 4
7 6 7
8 7 8
8 7 8
7 6 7
4 8 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7DCBFC2B6830>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares, each represented by a single digit. The input grid appears to be transformed into a larger output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reflection or mirroring of the input grid. The colors and their spatial arrangement are preserved in the transformation, with the output being a vertically mirrored and concatenated version of the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (input)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
      - arrangement: 2D array
    relations:
      - elements form rows and columns

actions:
  - type: reflection
    properties:
      - axis: horizontal (vertical mirroring)
  - type: concatenation
      properties:
          - direction: vertical

output:
   -type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x3
      - elements: single-digit integers, same as input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of digits representing colored squares.
2.  **Mirror:** Create a vertically mirrored copy of the input grid. This means flipping the input grid along the horizontal axis. Row 1 becomes Row 3, Row 3 becomes Row 1.
3.  **Concatenate:** Append the mirrored copy to the bottom of the original input grid.
4. **Output:** Return new grid. The new grid has twice the height and same width as the original input grid.

Essentially, the program takes the input grid, flips it vertically, and then stacks the flipped version below the original.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
