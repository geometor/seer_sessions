Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed into the output grid by swapping elements on the anti-diagonal using the following detailed instructions:
    - The element at position (0,0) swaps with (0,1), so the top left and top center swaps position
    - The element at position (2,0) swaps with position (2,1), so the bottom left and bottom center swaps position
    - The element at (0,2) swaps with (1,1), so the top right and center values are swapped
    - The element at position(2,1) swaps with (1,1), so the bottom center and center values are swapped
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Swap elements (0,0) and (0,1)
    output_grid[0, 0], output_grid[0, 1] = output_grid[0, 1], output_grid[0, 0]

    # Swap elements (2,0) and (2,1)
    output_grid[2, 0], output_grid[2, 1] = output_grid[2, 1], output_grid[2, 0]
    
    # Swap elements (0,2) and (1,1)
    output_grid[0, 2], output_grid[1, 1] = output_grid[1, 1], output_grid[0, 2]
    
    # The last specified swap would result in (2,1) getting overwritten, and therefore not correct.
    # Therefore it needs to be removed from code.
    
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
