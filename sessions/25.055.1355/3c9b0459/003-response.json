            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect for at least some of the examples. The provided code implements this rotation, and the test results confirm the mismatch with the expected outputs. The strategy needs to shift from confirming a simple rotation to identifying the *actual* transformation rule, which may be more complex. We need to analyze all examples, not just the first, and derive information on the properties of objects.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Visually inspect all examples:** Carefully examine the input and output pairs of each example, not just the first one. Look for patterns beyond simple rotation.\n2.  **Object Identification**: Identify consistent \"objects\" within the grids. Consider contiguous regions of the same color as potential objects.\n3. **Property and Relation Analysis:** List any properties of the transformation.\n3.  **Hypothesis Generation:** Based on the visual inspection and object analysis, formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation rule. It might involve different operations on different objects or regions within the grid.\n4.  **Natural Language Program Refinement:** Update the natural language program to reflect the new hypothesis. Be specific about which objects are affected and how.\n5. **Fact Documentation:** Create a YAML block.\n6. **Inform Next Code Iteration** Use the natural language program to inform the generation of a revised Python function.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nSince I cannot directly execute code, I will describe what *should* be done and the kind of information that needs to be extracted. I will provide a hypothetical, text based report.\n\n*Example 1*\ninput:\n[[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]\noutput:\n[[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]\nresult:\n[[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]\nassessment:\nthe result and output are the same.\n\n*Example 2*\ninput:\n[[6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6]]\noutput:\n[[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]\nresult:\n[[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]\nassessment:\nthe result and the output are the same.\n\n*Example 3*\ninput:\n[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\noutput:\n[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]\nresult:\n[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]\nassessment:\nthe result and output are the same.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            color: gray\n            shape: rectangle\n            size: 3x3\n            position: (0,0)\n      output_objects:\n         - object_1:\n            color: gray\n            shape: rectangle\n            size: 3x3\n            position: (0,0)\n      transformation: Input is transposed\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            color: magenta\n            shape: rectangle\n            size: 3x4\n            position: (0,0)\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            color: magenta\n            shape: rectangle\n            size: 4x3\n            position: (0,0)\n      transformation: Input is transposed\n  - example_3:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            color: azure\n            shape: rectangle\n            size: 3x6\n            position: (0,0)\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            color: azure\n            shape: rectangle\n            size: 6x3\n            position: (0,0)\n      transformation: Input is transposed\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is to transpose the input grid. The number of rows in the input becomes the number of columns in the output, and vice-versa. The values within the grid maintain their relative positions according to the transposition.\n"
