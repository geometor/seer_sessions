facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
    dimensions: [3, 3]
  - type: element
    description: Grid cells contain single-digit integers (0-9).
    values: [1, 2, 8] # observed values
  - type: transformation
    description: The transformation rearranges pixel positions.
    properties:
      - color_preserving: True # colors in output are same set as input
      - spatial: True # a spatial rearrangement, not a color substitution
  - type: observation
    description: potential symmetry operation
    details: Seems like either a rotation or reflection
