            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code implements a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The core concept is correct, but the application shows some discrepancies. My initial assessment of the successful results is that I correctly perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation. I need to verify each example.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Results**: I will meticulously examine each input-output pair and the 'Result' to pinpoint the nature of any errors, noting that my initial assumption is that I'm always correct.\n2.  **Object Identification**: For each example, I'll identify distinct objects within the input and output grids. Objects are contiguous blocks of the same color.\n3.  **Property and Action Analysis**: I'll analyze object properties (size, color, position) and how actions (rotation, movement, etc.) affect these properties. I will be tracking this in the YAML block.\n4.  **Natural Language Program Refinement**: Based on the analysis, I will progressively refine the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with various colors.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid, rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   Result: \"Passed\"\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid.\n    *   Output: 5x5 rotated grid.\n    *   Result: \"Passed\"\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *  Input: 8x11\n    *  Output: 11x8\n    *  Result: \"Passed\"\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - object_1:\n              color: green\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (0,0)\n          - object_2:\n              color: blue\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (0, 1)\n          - object_3:\n              color: red\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (0, 2)\n        \n          - object_4:\n              color: yellow\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (1, 0)\n\n          - object_5:\n              color: green\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (1, 1)\n          - object_6:\n              color: blue\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (1, 2)\n        \n          - object_7:\n              color: red\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (2, 0)\n\n          - object_8:\n              color: yellow\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (2, 1)\n          - object_9:\n              color: orange\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (2,2)\n\n      output:\n        objects:\n           - object_1:\n              color: red\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (0,0)\n          - object_2:\n              color: yellow\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (0, 1)\n          - object_3:\n              color: orange\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (0, 2)\n        \n          - object_4:\n              color: green\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (1, 0)\n\n          - object_5:\n              color: blue\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (1, 1)\n          - object_6:\n              color: red\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (1, 2)\n        \n          - object_7:\n              color: yellow\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (2, 0)\n\n          - object_8:\n              color: green\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (2, 1)\n          - object_9:\n              color: blue\n              shape: 1x1\n              position: (2,2)\n      action: 90-degree clockwise rotation\n\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        objects: \"5x5 grid\"\n      output:\n        objects: \"5x5 rotated grid\"\n      action: 90-degree clockwise rotation\n\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n         objects: \"8x11 grid\"\n      output:\n        objects: \"11x8 grid\"\n      action: 90-degree clockwise rotation\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid. The dimensions of the grid are swapped (height becomes width, and width becomes height) during the rotation. Each pixel in the input grid maps to a new position in the output grid based on the rotation.\n"
