## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CB580>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CA500>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids of single-digit integers, representing colored pixels. The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions.  The transformation doesn't seem to involve simply changing colors, but rather a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid's contents. A visual inspection suggests a possible rotation or reflection. The colors themselves are maintained; it's their positions that change.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
    dimensions: [3, 3]
  - type: element
    description: Grid cells contain single-digit integers (0-9).
    values: [1, 2, 8] # observed values
  - type: transformation
    description: The transformation rearranges pixel positions.
    properties:
      - color_preserving: True # colors in output are same set as input
      - spatial: True # a spatial rearrangement, not a color substitution
  - type: observation
    description: potential symmetry operation
    details: Seems like either a rotation or reflection
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid to produce the output grid. Alternatively, the transformation can be interpreted as reflecting the grid along the diagonal going from top-left to bottom right, and subsequently reflecting it across the central vertical axis. The simpler explanation will be utilized for future work.

1.  **Rotate:** Take the input grid and rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. Each element moves to its new position based on this rotation.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
