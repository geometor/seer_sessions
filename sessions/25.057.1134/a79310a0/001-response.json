The primary change appears to be a color swap between specific regions. A 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels in the input becomes a 2x2 square of red (2) pixels in the output. The position of this 2x2 square is shifted down one row. The rest of the grid, which is filled with white (0) pixels, remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
