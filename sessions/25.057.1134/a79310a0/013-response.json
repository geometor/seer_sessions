The input grid has a horizontal line of three '8's (azure) in the second row. The output grid has a horizontal line of three '2's (red) in the third row. All other cells in both grids are '0' (white). The azure line seems to be replaced with a red line, and moved down by one row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
