Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Find:** Locate a 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Remove:** Change the color of this identified 2x2 azure square to white (0).
3.  **Move:** Calculate a new position one row down from the original location of the azure square.
4.  **Create:** At this new position, create a 2x2 square of red (2) pixels.
5. **Preserve:** Ensure all other pixels in the output grid remain the same as in the input grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
