facts:
  - observation: "The initial code transforms green (3) pixels to azure (8)."
  - assumption: "The complete transformation rule likely involves multiple single-pixel color changes."
  - assumption: "The transformation rule does not create new objects or merge existing objects."
  - assumption: "The transformation is limited to modifying existing pixels."
  - task: "Determine the complete set of color transformations from input to output."
