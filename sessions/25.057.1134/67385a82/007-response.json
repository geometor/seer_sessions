The input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change observed is the replacement of some '3' (green) pixels with '8' (azure) pixels. The location of the replaced pixels seems significant. Specifically, it appears to be the green pixels that are part of a horizontal contiguous block.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
