Train Set Results:
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improvement, metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment**

The initial approach of focusing on maroon pixels and their bounding box is partially correct, but it's incomplete. The prediction consistently includes the maroon pixel, when it should not. The output grid's dimensions and content are directly related to the position of the maroon pixels in the input, but the current code doesn't correctly capture the transformation logic, specifically changing the maroon to a red and removing all other maroon pixels from the output. It appears there is an assumed relationship that moving or translating the maroon pixel is the solution - this should be refined.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors**

1.  **Shift Focus:** Instead of just finding the bounding box, focus on the *individual locations* of the maroon pixels.
2.  **Output Size:** The code must accurately determine the output size.
3.  **Color Transformation:** Specifically address changing maroon (9) in the input to red (2) in the output.
4. **Eliminate Extranous Pixels**: Remove all other maroon pixels.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution & Review)**

Here are specific observations after reviewing the given python execution output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid. Maroon pixels at (1,1) and (3,3).
    *   Output: 3x3 grid. Red pixel at (0,1).
    *   Error: Prediction has maroon pixel.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid. Maroon pixel at (2,3).
    *   Output: 3x3 grid. Red pixel at (1,2).
    *   Error: Prediction has maroon pixel.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid. Maroon pixel at (0,0).
    *   Output: 1x1 grid. Red pixel at (0,0).
    *   Error: Prediction has maroon pixel and is wrong dimension.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9 (all examples)
      colors:
        - 0: white
        - 9: maroon
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions:
          - example_1: 3x3
          - example_2: 3x3
          - example_3: 1x1
      colors:
        - 2: red
        - 0: white #some examples
  - object: maroon_pixels
    type: list of coordinates
    properties:
      input_positions:
        - example_1: [(1, 1), (3, 3)]
        - example_2: [(2, 3)]
        - example_3: [(0, 0)]
  - action: transform
    description: Converts maroon pixels in input to red pixels in output, determining output size.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rules:
      - rule_1:  The output grid appears to represent a scaled down view of the
                 position of the first maroon pixel.
      - rule_2: Maroon pixels are changed to red.
      - rule_3: Other maroon pixels are eliminated.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Maroon Pixels:** Identify the coordinates of all maroon (value 9) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Process First Maroon Pixel:** Select the first maroon pixel found using the row-major order of `np.argwhere()`.
3. **Determine output grid size and map the pixel:**
    *   If the row and column of the first maroon pixel are both less than or equal to 2. The size will be 3x3.
    *   If the row and column of the first maroon pixel are both 0, then the output is 1x1.
    *   Divide the row/col by 3. The result of the division will be the output row/col coordinates.
4.  **Create Output:** Create a new grid of the determined dimensions, initialized with all white (0) pixels.
5.  **Transform Color:** Change the value in the new grid, at the coordinates determined above to red (value 2).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
