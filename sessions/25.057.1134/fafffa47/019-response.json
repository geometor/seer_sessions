The colors in the input grid are white, maroon, and blue. The output grid contains only white and red. It seems like specific regions of the input grid are being summarized or represented in the output grid. The output grid appears to capture a specific color from the input grid, focusing on maroon.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider them as cells of a 3x3 grid.\n2. **Define:** The order of the 2x1 blocks are read from left to right, top to bottom. The first 2x1 block is the top left block, etc.\n3.  **Inspect:** Check each of these 2x1 regions:\n    *   If any of them contains a maroon (9) pixel, and zero blue (1), output a red (2) pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n    *   If not, output a white (0) pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the program checks for the presence of maroon color in specific 2x1 regions of the input and represents those regions with red in the output. If no maroon is in that section it is white.\n"
