## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 9 0
9 0 9
9 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CB804D0>

**output:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9C7D50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (6x3) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains three colors: white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid contains two colors: white (0) and red (2). It appears the transformation involves some form of object extraction and color replacement. Specifically, maroon (9) pixels are replaced by red (2), and blue (1) pixels, along with some white (0) pixels, disappear, resulting in a smaller grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 6x3
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_colors:
    - white: 0
    - maroon: 9
    - blue: 1
  - output_colors:
    - white: 0
    - red: 2
  - object_identification:
      - maroon_pixels:  #object
        color: 9   #property
        becomes: red #action, property
  - spatial_transformation:
      - description: "Input grid is reduced in size."
        type: size reduction #action
      - description: blue and some white pixels are removed, leaving 3x3 structure
        type: pixel removal #action
  - color_replacement:
      - original: 9 #maroon
        replacement: 2 #red

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color maroon (9) in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** the color of these identified pixels with red (2).
3. **Remove** all blue pixels and some white pixels to get a compressed 3x3 grid. There are two maroon colored objects on the top left. The transformation seems to be taking the 3x3 area of the grid that starts on the top left and contains those two original maroon colored objects, and substituting the color of those objects.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
