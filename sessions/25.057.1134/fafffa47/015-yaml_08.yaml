      input:
        dimensions: [9, 9]
        maroon_objects: 2

      output:
        dimensions: [3, 3]
        colors: [white, red]
        transformation: "Maroon pixels within the bounding box are changed to red. The output grid is a subgrid defined by the corners of the bounding box around the orginal positions of the maroon pixels"
