## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 9 0
0 9 9
0 9 9
0 0 0
1 1 1
1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CB81850>

**output:**
```
2 0 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB83450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x3 grid containing two distinct objects composed of different colors, and with different sizes. The first one is maroon (9) and blue (1) colored pixels. The output is a 3x3 grid, smaller than the input, and focuses on representing a simplified version related to the maroon object, now represented with red(2) color. It appears that one of the input objects (maroon) is extracted and simplified, while the other input (blue) object is completely removed. The background remains the same, white(0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  input_grid:
    size: 6x3
    objects:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        shape: irregular
        position: top-left, spanning multiple rows and columns
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: irregular, similar to horizontal line
        position: bottom, spanning across the grid width
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills the empty space between maroon and blue object
        position: background, surrounding the other objects
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: two pixels
        position: corners of the top row
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: fills entire grid except where there is red color present
        position: background, surrounding the other objects

  transformation:
    - object_selection: maroon (9) object from input is selected.
    - object_simplification:  The shape of the object changes.
    - color_change: color of selected object changes from maroon (9) to red (2).
    - size_reduction: The overall grid size is reduced.
    - object_removal: blue (1) object removed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels with value other than 0.
2.  **Select Target Object:** Select the maroon (9) object.
3.  **Remove other objects:** The blue object is discarded.
4.  **Reduce Grid Size:** Create a new 3x3 output grid.
5.  **Simplify and Reposition Selected Object**: If in the original image, at least one pixel of the selected object appears on the first row in any of the three leftmost, or three rightmost pixels. Place a red pixel in the output grid at [0,0] if any of the three leftmost pixels is part of the object, and another pixel in the [0,2] position if any of the rightmost three pixel is part of the object.
6.  **Fill Background:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
