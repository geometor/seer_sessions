Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information, an analysis of the results, and a plan to refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial approach focused on identifying regions containing the color maroon (9) and its relationship with blue (1). The code analyzes 2x1 regions in input and checks the presence of 9 and 1 within those. The output seems to be placing red (2) pixels based on some relation with location of 9 in the input. However it's now clear the whole input must be used.

The core strategy should shift from analyzing predefined regions to a more flexible approach that considers the entire grid, and relationships between *all* the pixels, not just those in predefined regions. The connection between input and output must account for position and use.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

The provided code already does a great job of calculating relevant metrics. I've included the output here. Key observations are highlighted below:

```
Example 1:
  Input Shape: (6, 3)
  Output Shape: (3, 3)
  Regions with 9: 3
  Regions with 9 and 1: 0
  Regions with 9 without 1: 3
  Output Red Count: 2
  Output Red Coordinates: [(0, 1), (1, 1)]
--------------------
Example 2:
  Input Shape: (6, 3)
  Output Shape: (3, 3)
  Regions with 9: 3
  Regions with 9 and 1: 3
  Regions with 9 without 1: 0
  Output Red Count: 3
  Output Red Coordinates: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2)]
--------------------
Example 3:
  Input Shape: (6, 3)
  Output Shape: (3, 3)
  Regions with 9: 3
  Regions with 9 and 1: 3
  Regions with 9 without 1: 0
  Output Red Count: 2
  Output Red Coordinates: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1,2)]
--------------------
Example 4:
  Input Shape: (6, 3)
  Output Shape: (3, 3)
  Regions with 9: 0
  Regions with 9 and 1: 0
  Regions with 9 without 1: 0
  Output Red Count: 0
  Output Red Coordinates: []
--------------------
```

**Key Observations and Inferences:**

*   **Input vs. Output Size:** The input grid is always 6x3, and the output grid is always 3x3.  This suggests a halving of the input's height.
*   **Maroon (9) and Red (2) Relationship:** The number of output red pixels appears correlated but not a simple count of maroon regions.
*   **Blue (1) Influence:** The presence or absence of blue (1) alongside maroon (9) seems to play a role, but not in a way that's captured by simple region counting.
*   **Example 4 (No Maroon):** This is a crucial case. When there's no maroon in the input, there are no red pixels in the output. This confirms that maroon is *essential* for red to appear.
*   **Red Placement:** The red is always in the top half of the output - same columns, but different rows.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is consistently 6x3, and the output grid is 3x3.  This indicates a vertical dimension reduction.
  - observation: |
      Red (2) pixels appear in the output only when Maroon (9) pixels are present in the input.
  - observation: |
      The output red pixels always appear above the dividing horizontal mid-line.
  - observation: |
      The horizontal positions (columns) of the input Maroon (9) cells seem to influence the positions of output Red (2) cells.
  - observation: |
      The presence of Blue(1) in a 2-cell vertical group with Maroon(9) might have an effect, either enabling or modifying the transformation to red(2).
  - observation: |
    Input maroon (9) is always in the second or fourth row and first or second column.
  - rule: |
      Input maroon (9) in row 2 of the input results in red (2) in row 1 of the output.
      Input maroon (9) in row 4 of the input results in red (2) in row 2 of the output.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Reduction:** The input grid (6x3) is vertically halved to produce a 3x3 output grid.

2.  **Maroon Detection:** Identify all cells in the input grid containing the color maroon (9).

3.  **Red Placement Rule:**
    *   If a maroon (9) pixel is found on the *second* row of the input, a red (2) pixel is placed in the *first* row of the output, in the *same* column.
    *   If a maroon (9) pixel is found on the *fourth* row of the input, a red (2) pixel is placed in the *second* row of the output, in the *same* column.

4.  **No Maroon, No Red:** If no maroon pixels are found in the input, the output grid remains all black (or the background color, 0).
5. Blue is ignored.

**Next Steps for Coder Phase**

The coder will need to implement this logic, paying close attention to the row-based rule for transforming maroon to red. The code should iterate through the input grid, focusing on rows 2 and 4, and directly map maroon positions to red positions in the output based on the rules above. The existing region analysis should be discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
