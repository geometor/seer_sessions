## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
0 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CB6CDD0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid appears to contain two distinct rectangular shapes, one maroon (9) and one blue (1), on a white (0) background. The output grid is smaller than the input, containing only one object of red color. It may include some shape extraction.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 6x3
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_objects:
    - color: maroon (9)
      shape: rectangle
      position: top-left
      dimensions: 3x3
    - color: blue (1)
      shape: rectangle
      position: bottom-right
      dimensions: 1x3
  - output_objects:
    - color: red (2)
      shape: partial rectangle?
      position: top-left
      dimensions: 2x1

  - background_color: white (0)
  - actions:
    - object extraction: Extracting something related to a certain color from the input
    - resizing: changing size to fit the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the maroon (9) object within the input grid.
2.  **Extract** the top two rows.
3.   **Change** maroon color (value 9) to red (value 2)
4.   Fill remaining area of the output grid with white (value 0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
