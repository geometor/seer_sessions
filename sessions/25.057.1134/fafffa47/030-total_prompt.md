Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels with value other than 0.
2.  **Select Target Object:** Select the maroon (9) object.
3.  **Remove other objects:** The blue object is discarded.
4.  **Reduce Grid Size:** Create a new 3x3 output grid.
5.  **Simplify and Reposition Selected Object**: If in the original image, at least one pixel of the selected object appears on the first row in any of the three leftmost, or three rightmost pixels. Place a red pixel in the output grid at [0,0] if any of the three leftmost pixels is part of the object, and another pixel in the [0,2] position if any of the rightmost three pixel is part of the object.
6.  **Fill Background:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made some specific assumptions, particularly about object selection (maroon) and placement of red pixels based on the object position in the top row. The additional training examples reveal that these assumptions are too narrow. The code correctly identifies contiguous objects and can isolate specific color. The basic structure of the output grid (3x3, filled with white initially) is consistent with the examples. We need to adapt our approach for positioning the red pixels within the result. The core issue is generalizing the placement rule to work with multiple inputs. Instead of focusing on the 3 leftmost, and 3 rightmost pixels, the logic will be generalized.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the patterns, let's define some helper functions and examine properties of the input and output grids for each example. We'll focus on:

1.  The presence and location of the maroon (9) object.
2.  The relationship between the input maroon object's position and the red pixels in the output.

```python
def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    objects = find_objects(input_grid)
    maroon_object = None
    for obj in objects:
        if obj['color'] == 9:
            maroon_object = obj
            break

    output_red_pixels = []
    if output_grid is not None:
      for r in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
          for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
              if output_grid[r, c] == 2:
                  output_red_pixels.append((r, c))

    analysis = {
        'maroon_object_exists': maroon_object is not None,

      maroon_object:
        exists: True
        pixels: [(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5)]

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels with a value other than 0.
2.  **Select Target Object:** Select the maroon (9) object. Discard all the other objects.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).
4. **Determine Red Pixel Column:** Check the horizontal position of the maroon object within the input image. If the object is in the left third of the input grid, place a red pixel at `[0, 0]` of the output grid. If the object is in the middle third, place a red pixel at `[0, 1]`. If the object is in the right third, place it on `[0,2]`.

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning**
*   **Object Selection**: The maroon object is consistently the target.
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid is created.
*  **Simplified Rule**: We've removed any special rule about the first row, and instead the position of the red pixel depends exclusively on columns. If the object is in the left third columns of the grid, the red pixel goes in the left column of the output grid. If the object is in the middle third columns of the input, the red pixel goes in the middle column of the output. Same logic for right third.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
