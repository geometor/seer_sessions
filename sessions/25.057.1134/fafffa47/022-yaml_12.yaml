facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is consistently 6x3, and the output grid is 3x3.  This indicates a vertical dimension reduction.
  - observation: |
      Red (2) pixels appear in the output only when Maroon (9) pixels are present in the input.
  - observation: |
      The output red pixels always appear above the dividing horizontal mid-line.
  - observation: |
      The horizontal positions (columns) of the input Maroon (9) cells seem to influence the positions of output Red (2) cells.
  - observation: |
      The presence of Blue(1) in a 2-cell vertical group with Maroon(9) might have an effect, either enabling or modifying the transformation to red(2).
  - observation: |
    Input maroon (9) is always in the second or fourth row and first or second column.
  - rule: |
      Input maroon (9) in row 2 of the input results in red (2) in row 1 of the output.
      Input maroon (9) in row 4 of the input results in red (2) in row 2 of the output.
