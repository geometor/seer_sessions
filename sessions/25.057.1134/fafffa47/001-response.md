Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid appears to contain two distinct rectangular shapes, one maroon (9) and one blue (1), on a white (0) background. The output grid is smaller than the input, containing only one object of red color. It may include some shape extraction.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 6x3
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_objects:
    - color: maroon (9)
      shape: rectangle
      position: top-left
      dimensions: 3x3
    - color: blue (1)
      shape: rectangle
      position: bottom-right
      dimensions: 1x3
  - output_objects:
    - color: red (2)
      shape: partial rectangle?
      position: top-left
      dimensions: 2x1

  - background_color: white (0)
  - actions:
    - object extraction: Extracting something related to a certain color from the input
    - resizing: changing size to fit the output
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the maroon (9) object within the input grid.
2.  **Extract** the top two rows.
3.   **Change** maroon color (value 9) to red (value 2)
4.   Fill remaining area of the output grid with white (value 0).
