## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CE102D0>

**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x74AF1CC2E450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, broken down into perceptions, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program.

**Perceptions:**

*   The input is a 5x5 grid with cells containing the values 0, 1, or 2, which correspond to white, blue, and red, respectively.
*   The output is a 2x2 grid containing only the values 1 and 2 (blue and red).
*   The output grid seems to be derived from a specific region of the input grid, focusing on the colors blue (1) and red (2). Whites (0) are absent.
*   The output size is significantly smaller than the input.
*   The upper-left 2x2 blue and red area of input gets extracted to be the output

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 5x5 grid.
    type: grid_property
    values: [5, 5]
  - observation: Output is a 2x2 grid.
    type: grid_property
    values: [2, 2]
  - observation: Input grid contains values 0, 1, and 2.
    type: value_property
    values: [0, 1, 2]
  - observation: Output grid contains values 1 and 2.
    type: value_property
    values: [1, 2]
  - observation: Value 0 represents white.
    type: color_mapping
    values: {0: white}
  - observation: Value 1 represents blue.
    type: color_mapping
    values: {1: blue}
  - observation: Value 2 represents red.
    type: color_mapping
    values: {2: red}
  - observation: The output grid appears to select a region from the input.
    type: spatial_relationship
    values: [selection]
  - action: extract
    parameters: [top_left, 2, 2]
    description: Extract the 2 x 2 subgrid from the top left corner.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region:** Focus on the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid**: extract the focused subgrid
3.  **Output**: output the subgrid


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
