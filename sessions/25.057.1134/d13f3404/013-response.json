            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, assuming a 3x3 core replication and rotation. The provided results indicate this assumption holds true for all given training examples. The code successfully transforms all training inputs to their expected outputs. Since there are no errors, our strategy is to simply confirm the existing logic and provide the requested deliverables, focusing on a clear and accurate description of the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nSince the code is 100% correct on train data, I will manually construct the observations\ninstead of code execution.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n-   **Input Size:** 3x3\n-   **Output Size:** 6x6\n-   **Transformation:** The 3x3 input is replicated four times, with each replica rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the previous one. These are arranged in a 2x2 grid to form the 6x6 output.\n- **Result**: correct\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n-   **Input Size:** 3x3\n-   **Output Size:** 6x6\n-   **Transformation:** Same as Example 1.\n- **Result**: correct\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n-   **Input Size:** 3x3\n-   **Output Size:** 6x6\n-   **Transformation:** Same as Example 1.\n- **Result**: correct\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: core_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      size: 3x3\n      colors: [0-9] # Assuming all colors can be present\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      size: 6x6\n      colors: [0-9]\n\nactions:\n  - name: replicate\n    description: The core_grid is replicated four times.\n    agent: system\n    target: core_grid\n\n  - name: rotate\n    description: Each replicated core_grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise relative to the previous one.\n    agent: system\n    target: replicated core_grid\n\n  - name: arrange\n    description: The original core_grid and its three rotated replicas are arranged in a 2x2 grid to form the output_grid.\n    agent: system\n    target: [core_grid, rotated core_grids]\n    result: output_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core:** The input grid is a 3x3 grid, which we'll call the \"core.\"\n\n2.  **Replicate and Rotate:** Create four copies of the core.\n    *   The first copy is the original core.\n    *   The second copy is the core rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   The third copy is the core rotated 180 degrees clockwise (or, equivalently, the second copy rotated 90 degrees clockwise).\n    *   The fourth copy is the core rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or, equivalently, the third copy rotated 90 degrees clockwise).\n\n3.  **Arrange in 2x2 Grid:** Arrange the four core copies in a 2x2 grid:\n    *   Top-left: Original core.\n    *   Top-right: 90-degree rotated core.\n    *   Bottom-left: 180-degree rotated core.\n    *   Bottom-right: 270-degree rotated core.\n\n4.  **Output:** The resulting 6x6 grid is the output.\n"
