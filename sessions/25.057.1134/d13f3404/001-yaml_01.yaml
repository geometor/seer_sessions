facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3, output grid is 6x6.
  - observation: Output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
  - object: Input grid pixels with colors.
  - property: Pixel color (magenta=6, blue=1, green=3, white=0).
  - property: Pixel position (row, column).
  - action: Replication of colored pixels.
  - action: Diagonal arrangement of replicated pixels.
  - relationship:  Each non-white pixel in the input grid generates a diagonal line of the same color, starting at the pixel's doubled position in the output, extending to the bottom-right.
  - observation: The origin or top-left corner of the input grid corresponds with the top-left of the output grid.
