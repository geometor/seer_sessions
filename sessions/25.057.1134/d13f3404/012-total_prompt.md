## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 6
1 3 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CAD3350>

**output:**
```
0 0 6 0 0 0
1 3 0 6 0 0
0 1 3 0 6 0
0 0 1 3 0 6
0 0 0 1 3 0
0 0 0 0 1 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1C9EC150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The smaller grid appears to be replicated and rotated to form the larger grid. The non-zero values seem to maintain their relative positions within each replicated sub-grid. The zero values also seem important and define where and how the sub-grid gets placed and expanded to the right and below.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - relationship: output_grid is a scaled and rotated expansion of the input_grid
  - observation: non-zero values in input_grid are preserved in output_grid, forming a diagonal pattern
  - observation: zeros appear to function as placeholders/padding that guide the expansion and rotation
  - action: rotation (90 degrees clockwise)
  - action: replication of sub-grid (input_grid)
  - property: The sub-grid structure is 3x3
  - property: The output grid is always square
  - property: The dimensions of the output grid are twice the dimensions of the sub-grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Treat the input grid as a 3x3 "core" sub-grid.

2.  **Replicate and Rotate:**
    *   The core is replicated to construct a 2x2 arrangement of cores.
    *   Each time the core is replicated, the copy is rotated 90 degree clockwise.

3.  **Construct Output:** Arrange these replicated cores to create the final 6x6 grid.

In other words. The input grid creates a sub-grid that gets rotated and replicated to construct a 2 x 2 arrangement.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
