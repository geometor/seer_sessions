Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed into an output grid with double the dimensions. Each non-white pixel in the input grid generates a single-pixel diagonal line of the same color in the output grid. The diagonal starts at the doubled coordinates of the input pixel. The direction of the diagonal varies depending on the example.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first example, assuming a simple doubling of dimensions and a down-right diagonal extension for non-white pixels. However, the subsequent examples demonstrate variations in the diagonal direction (down-right, down-left, up-right). The current `determine_direction` function attempts to address this by using the `example_index`, but a more general, data-driven approach is needed instead of hardcoding the direction. The overall strategy should be to identify a consistent rule for diagonal direction based on properties of input.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations and potential reasoning:

*   **Example 0:**
    *   Input: 3x3, single orange pixel at (0,0)
    *   Output: 6x6, orange pixel at (1,1) - down right
    * code execution: success

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 4x4, single green pixel (0, 2)
    *   Output: 8x8, green pixel (1, 5)
    * code execution: success

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7, single blue pixel (4,3)
    *   Output: 14x14, blue pixel (9, 6)
    * code execution: success

* **Example 3:**
    * input: 5x5 single blue pixel(4,2)
    * output: 10 x 10 single blue pixel (7,5)
    * code execution: success

    All non-white pixels produce an output pixel that's either down and to the
    right, down and to the left, or up and to the right from the starting position.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - content: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: double the input_grid dimensions (2*height, 2*width)
      - content: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - object: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - location: (row, col) in input_grid
      - color: integer value (1-9)
    actions:
      - name: double_dimensions
        description: The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's.
      - name: create_diagonal
        description: Each non-white pixel in the input grid creates a single
          corresponding same color pixel in output grid, where the location is
          based on the doubled starting pixel coordinates. The position
          relative to the starting position depends on the example.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The output grid has dimensions exactly double that of the input grid (twice the height and twice the width).

2.  **Iterate through Input:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.

3.  **Non-White Pixel Handling:**
    *   If a pixel is *not* white (color value is not 0):
        *   Double Input Pixel Coordinates to calculate a starting location: Multiply both the row and column indices of the input pixel by 2. This is the initial location for a corresponding output pixel.
        *   Based on the position in the input, the coordinate of the output pixel relative to the starting location varies:
            * output is down and to the right
            * output is down and to the left
            * output is up and to the right

4. **Output:** return output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
