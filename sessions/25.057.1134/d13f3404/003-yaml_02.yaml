task: 6d75e8bb
objects:
  - description: non-white pixels in the input grid
    properties:
      color: varies (determined by input)
      position: (row, col) in input grid
  - description: diagonal lines in the output grid
    properties:
      color: same as the corresponding input pixel
      start_position: (2 * row, 2 * col) of the input pixel
      direction:
        example_1: down-right
        example_2: down-right (truncated)
        example_3: down-left (truncated)
        example_4: up-right (truncated)
      length: varies (determined by truncation rules, to be defined)
actions:
  - description: doubling grid dimensions
    details: output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both rows and columns
  - description: creating diagonal lines
    details: for each non-white pixel in input, a diagonal line of the same color is created in the output grid, starting at the doubled coordinates. Direction and length are not consistent and require further rules.
