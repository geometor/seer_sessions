Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. The core idea of doubling the dimensions and replicating non-zero pixels diagonally is correct. However, the provided examples and test results reveal that this initial implementation needs refinement to handle cases beyond first example.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results**: I need to go through each training example and its associated test result. I have access to code execution to generate a report comparing the expected and actual outputs.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies**: The results from code execution will give me structured insight into where the current implementation works and where it doesn't and that will let me determine which parts of the natural language program require adjustments.
3.  **Refine Program**: Based on the discrepancies, update the YAML and, more critically, the natural language program description to reflect the observed behavior accurately.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I will now use a `report` to check the results.
