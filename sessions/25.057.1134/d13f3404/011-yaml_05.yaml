facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - relationship: output_grid is a scaled and rotated expansion of the input_grid
  - observation: non-zero values in input_grid are preserved in output_grid, forming a diagonal pattern
  - observation: zeros appear to function as placeholders/padding that guide the expansion and rotation
  - action: rotation (90 degrees clockwise)
  - action: replication of sub-grid (input_grid)
  - property: The sub-grid structure is 3x3
  - property: The output grid is always square
  - property: The dimensions of the output grid are twice the dimensions of the sub-grid
