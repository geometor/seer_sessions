observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - content: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: double the input_grid dimensions (2*height, 2*width)
      - content: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - object: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - location: (row, col) in input_grid
      - color: integer value (1-9)
    actions:
      - name: double_dimensions
        description: The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's.
      - name: create_diagonal
        description: Each non-white pixel in the input grid creates a single
          corresponding same color pixel in output grid, where the location is
          based on the doubled starting pixel coordinates. The position
          relative to the starting position depends on the example.
