The smaller grid appears to be replicated and rotated to form the larger grid. The non-zero values seem to maintain their relative positions within each replicated sub-grid. The zero values also seem important and define where and how the sub-grid gets placed and expanded to the right and below.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
