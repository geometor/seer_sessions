Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a swap of color, based on the location.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 5
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: cell
    properties:
       color: integer values from input

actions:
  - type: swap
    description: Changes the color values of 2 specific colors from position to position.

relationships:
  - adjacency: Cells are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
  - row_position: relationship of cell position within a row
  - col_position: relationship of cell position within a column
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** The input grid has two colors which change values, blue (1) and gray (5). All the cells containing white (0) remain unchanged.

2. **Color swap:** Swap blue (1) and gray (5) in the input grid, the output grid will be changed.

In simple terms the location of 1 and 5 from the input will be where 5 and 1 in the output appear.
