"""
The transformation rule involves identifying two pixels of different colors within the same column. The pixel located higher in the grid swaps its color with the pixel located lower in the grid. The row difference between the two pixels can vary, and the column difference is always 0. The colors of the pixels involved in the swap are not fixed; they change from one example to the next. The transform involves exactly two pixels.
