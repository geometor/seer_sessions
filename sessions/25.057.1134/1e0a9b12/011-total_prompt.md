Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rearranges the non-zero pixels in the last column of the input grid to the last column of the output grid, preserving their relative order from bottom to top.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid, but with all last column values set to 0
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    output_grid[:, -1] = 0

    # Get the last column of the input grid
    last_column = input_grid[:, -1]

    # Extract non-zero pixels from the last column
    non_zero_pixels = last_column[last_column != 0]

    # Get the number of rows in the grid
    num_rows = input_grid.shape[0]

    # Calculate the starting row index for placing non-zero pixels in the output grid, which depends on the grid size, and number of non-zero pixels
    start_row = num_rows - len(non_zero_pixels)

    # Place the non-zero pixels in the last column of the output grid
    if len(non_zero_pixels) > 0:
      output_grid[start_row:, -1] = non_zero_pixels
    

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
