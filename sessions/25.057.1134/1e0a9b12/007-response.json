These digits correspond to different colors. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rearrangement of certain colored pixels, specifically those that are not white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The maroon (9) pixel is moved to the final row in its existing column, the azure (8) pixel that was in the second row is moved to the 5th row. Yellow and orange pixels maintain original positions, only non white pixels in the last column get rearranged. All other pixels stay the same.\n"
