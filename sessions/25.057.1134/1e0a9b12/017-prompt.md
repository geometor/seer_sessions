Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Pixels:** Examine each non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2. **Check for Movability:** For each pixel, determine if it can move down. A pixel can move down *only if* the cell directly below it is either:
   - Empty (value 0).
   - Occupied by a non-zero pixel (of any color), AND the pixel below is not part of the same 'original' cluster as the pixel being checked.
3. **Move Down:** If a pixel is movable, move it down *as far as possible* until:
    -It hits another pixel of any color.
    -It reaches the bottom row.
4. **Merge:** If a pixel moves down and becomes adjacent to another non-zero pixel, consider them merged into a single cluster (this is implicit in the positioning).
5.  **Fill empty spaces:** If a space is not occupied, fill it with zero.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
