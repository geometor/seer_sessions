## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 4 0 9
0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0
1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x74AF1CB81150>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x74AF1C88F4D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 4x4 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. Most cells are white (0), but some contain other colors. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the non-zero elements. The output grid has a different structure for the non-zero elements compared to the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object_property: color
    mapping: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - observation: non-zero elements are re-arranged
  - observation: the output has all non zero elements in the bottom row
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero elements in the input grid.
2.  **Collect** these non-zero values.
3.  **Place** these collected values, in order of their original appearance in the input (reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom), into the last row of the output grid, starting from the bottom-leftmost cell.
4.  **Fill** all other cells in the output grid with zeros (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
