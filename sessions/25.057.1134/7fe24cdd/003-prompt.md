Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input 3x3 grid is expanded into a 6x6 output grid. The original 3x3 grid becomes the top-left quadrant of the output grid. The output grid is then completed by reflecting the top-left quadrant horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a 6x6 array filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=int)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Copy the input grid to the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    output_grid[:rows, :cols] = input_grid

    # Horizontal reflection: Copy the top-left quadrant to the top-right quadrant.
    output_grid[:rows, cols:] = np.fliplr(input_grid)

    # Vertical reflection: Copy the top-left quadrant to the bottom-left quadrant.
    output_grid[rows:, :cols] = np.flipud(input_grid)

    # Diagonal reflection (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):
    output_grid[rows:, cols:] = np.fliplr(np.flipud(input_grid))

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
