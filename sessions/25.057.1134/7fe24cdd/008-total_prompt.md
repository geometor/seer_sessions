## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 8 2
3 2 2
8 5 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB832D0>

**output:**
```
3 8 2 8 3 3
3 2 2 5 2 8
8 5 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 5 8
8 2 5 2 2 3
3 3 8 2 8 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CB14DD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors/numbers in the input grid seem to be replicated and rearranged in the output grid, suggesting a pattern of reflection or mirroring, along with some form of repetition or expansion. The output grid is exactly double the dimensions of the input grid and appears to be composed of reflected copies of the input placed adjacently.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relationship: output_grid_is_derived_from: input_grid
  - operation: reflection
    type: geometric
    axis: both horizontal and vertical
  - operation: expansion
    factor: 2
    direction: both width and height
  - object: quadrants
    type: derived
    description: The output grid is formed by 4 copies of the input grid.

        Q1 Q2
        Q3 Q4
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create a 2x2 grid of the input:** The output grid can be considered as four adjacent copies of the original 3x3 input with transformations applied.

2.  **Top-Left (Q1):** Copy the input grid to the top-left quadrant of the output grid as is.

3.  **Top-Right (Q2):** Copy the input grid to the top-right quadrant. Then perform a horizontal reflection (flip along the vertical axis - i.e. each row becomes reversed).

4.  **Bottom-Left (Q3):** Copy the input grid the bottom-left quadrant. Perform a vertical reflection (flip along the horizontal axis - i.e. each column becomes reversed).

5.  **Bottom-Right (Q4):** Copy the input grid to the bottom-right quadrant. Perform both horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).

In short, the input grid expands to 2x2 copies, and the copies are mirrored versions of the original input, generating quadrants.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
