## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 3 0
6 6 6
0 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81150>

**output:**
```
0 3 0 0 6 0
6 6 6 3 6 3
0 3 0 0 6 0
0 6 0 0 3 0
3 6 3 6 6 6
0 6 0 0 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1C9C69D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors present are white (0), green (3), and magenta (6). The transformation appears to be a form of expansion or replication, where each pixel in the input grid is somehow influencing a larger area in the output grid. The spatial relationships between the colors in the input seem to be preserved, but also altered, in the output. The output grid appears to interweave the input grid with a mirrored/rotated version of the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 3, 6]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 3, 6]

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - name: replicate_and_rotate
    description: >
      Elements of the input grid are possibly replicated, rotated, or mirrored to create new elements in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: >
      The spatial relationships between colors in the input are
      partially preserved and partially altered in the output. Specifically a mirrored structure.
  - type: size
    description: The output grid is larger than the input grid.
  - type: color_preservation
    description: >
       The colors in the input grid are the same as the
      colors in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty 6x6 output grid.

2.  **Cross Replication:** For each cell (x, y) in the 3x3 input grid,
    copy its value to the output grid at positions: (x,y) and also add the
    original row and column to the output grid forming a cross.

3.  **Mirror:** Complete the output by mirroring each input pixel.
    specifically the output is the result of copying the input,
    interleaved with a 90-degree rotated copy of the input.

In simpler terms: Each pixel in the input grid "creates" a 2x2 block. Then, that block is positioned by copying the row and col in the output grid, and the spaces between the 2x2 blocks are created by another copy of the input grid rotated 90 degrees.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
