            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example and correctly identified the core concept: creating a 2x2 grid where each quadrant is a reflection of the original input. However, the provided code perfectly reproduces ALL of the training examples, so this is more of a \"verification\" that the generated code matches expectations. Therefore I will not change the natural language program.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince the code passes all tests, the main strategy is to solidify the description and ensure all observations are accurately documented in both the YAML facts and the natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nSince I do not have the ability to execute code, I will have to assume based on the \"Train Set Results\" prompt. I will assume that the provided code, when executed on the provided inputs creates the described outputs.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input (3x3), Output (6x6) - Perfect Match\n*   **Example 2:** Input (3x3), Output (6x6) - Perfect Match\n*   **Example 3:** Input (5x5), Output (10x10) - Perfect Match\n*   **Example 4:** Input (2x2), Output (4x4) - Perfect Match\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)\n      - content: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: (2*rows x 2*cols) - double the input grid\n      - content: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n      - structure: 2x2 arrangement of transformed input_grid\n  - transformation: reflection\n    types:\n      - horizontal: input_grid mirrored across vertical axis\n      - vertical: input_grid mirrored across horizontal axis\n      - combined: input_grid mirrored across both axes (180-degree rotation)\n  - quadrant: top_left\n    transformation: identity (no change)\n    source: input_grid\n  - quadrant: top_right\n    transformation: horizontal reflection\n    source: input_grid\n  - quadrant: bottom_left\n    transformation: vertical reflection\n    source: input_grid\n  - quadrant: bottom_right\n    transformation: combined horizontal and vertical reflection\n    source: input_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe output grid is constructed as a 2x2 arrangement, where each section (quadrant) is a reflected version of the input grid.\n\n1.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is identical to the input grid. No transformation is applied.\n\n2.  **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a horizontally reflected copy of the input grid. The input is mirrored along its vertical axis.\n\n3.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is a vertically reflected copy of the input grid. The input is mirrored along its horizontal axis.\n\n4.  **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is both horizontally and vertically reflected, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation of the input grid. The input is mirrored along both its vertical and horizontal axes.\n\nThe output grid's dimensions are always double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.\n"
