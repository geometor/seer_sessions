The colors/numbers in the input grid seem to be replicated and rearranged in the output grid, suggesting a pattern of reflection or mirroring, along with some form of repetition or expansion. The output grid is exactly double the dimensions of the input grid and appears to be composed of reflected copies of the input placed adjacently.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Then perform a horizontal reflection (flip along the vertical axis - i.e. each row becomes reversed).\n\n4.  **Bottom-Left (Q3):** Copy the input grid the bottom-left quadrant. Perform a vertical reflection (flip along the horizontal axis - i.e. each column becomes reversed).\n\n5.  **Bottom-Right (Q4):** Copy the input grid to the bottom-right quadrant. Perform both horizontal and vertical reflection (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).\n\nIn short, the input grid expands to 2x2 copies, and the copies are mirrored versions of the original input, generating quadrants.\n"
