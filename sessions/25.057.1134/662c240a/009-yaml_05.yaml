    general_rule: "The output is a 3x3 square subgrid extracted from the input grid. The subgrid corresponds to the location of the single 3x3 colored square found in the input. If multiple 3x3 colored square of different colors are present, only one is used as a rule, based on training set order. Other colored squares and variations can be ignored"
