## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 9 8
9 8 8
8 8 8
2 2 1
2 2 1
1 1 2
4 4 4
4 4 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1C9C7450>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9C7ED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to contain multiple distinct rectangular regions of uniform color.  The output grid seems to be a subset of the input grid, specifically the lower-right corner. It appears there is a selection or cropping process involved, focusing on the lower right section of the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x3 (input), 3x3 (output)
      - elements: pixels
      - colors: [8, 9, 2, 1, 4, 3] (input), [4, 3] (output)
    relations:
      - output_is_subset_of: input

actions:
  - type: selection/cropping
    description: "A 3x3 subgrid is selected from the input grid."
    parameters:
        selection_area: lower-right corner
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
2.  **Locate the Region:** This 3x3 region is extracted from the lower-right corner of the input grid.
3. **Extract and Output** Extract the identified target region to create the output grid.

In essence, the transformation rule is to crop the input grid to a 3x3 area at the bottom right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
