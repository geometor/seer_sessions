## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 5 5
5 1 1
5 1 1
3 3 3
3 6 3
3 6 6
7 7 7
7 2 2
7 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1C9EDC50>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
3 6 3
3 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9EEBD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares (pixels). The input grid appears to be larger than the output grid. The output grid seems to be a specific section extracted from the input grid. The colors in the output grid match the corresponding colors in the input grid, implying a selection or cropping operation rather than a color transformation. The key seems to be identifying which subsection of the input grid is selected for the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid, 9x3, with integer values representing colors.
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid, 3x3, with integer values representing colors.
  - relation: spatial
    description: The output grid is a sub-region of the input grid.
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: Colors of corresponding pixels in the input and output grids are identical.
  - observation: size_reduction
    description: Output is smaller. input height = 9, output height = 3. input width = 3, output width = 3.
  - observation: position
    description: The output grid is located in the input grid starting from input row index 3 to 5 and all the columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the 3x3 sub-grid within the input grid that starts at row 4 (index 3) and extends to rows 5 and 6 (indexes 4 and 5). The subgrid columns begin at index 0 to 2.
2.  **Extract the Sub-grid:** Extract the pixel values within the specified target region.
3.  **Form the Output Grid:** Construct the output grid using the extracted pixel values, preserving their original colors and relative positions.

In simpler terms: The program extracts a 3x3 section from the middle rows (rows 4, 5, and 6) of the input grid to form the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
