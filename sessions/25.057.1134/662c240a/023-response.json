            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. The core idea of dividing the input grid vertically into three sections was correct. However, the selection criterion based solely on the `example_number` is incorrect and needs to be revised. The results show that the program works for the first three examples, because of the example number, but fails on the fourth. This is a clear indication that the selection logic is flawed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs to identify the *true* selection rule, and the general context of the task.\n2.  **Focus on object properties and actions**: We are likely looking for a simple rule that is general to the task, and involves concepts related to the priors.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately describe the transformation.\n4.  **Metrics and YAML:** Produce the requested metrics and YAML documentation, using code execution for the reporting.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nI'll analyze the results to find common rules for grid transformation.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef
