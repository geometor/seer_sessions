## Example 4

**input:**
```
8 8 4
4 4 4
4 4 8
1 1 3
1 3 3
3 3 1
6 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1CCD9450>

**output:**
```
8 8 4
4 4 4
4 4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB164D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors. The output grid appears to be a simplified or filtered version of the input grid. The input grid is 9x3 and the output grid is 3x3. It seems some sections of the input grid are selected or combined into the output grid. The output maintains relative positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: [9, 3]
  - output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]
  - input_cell_values: integers 0-9
  - output_cell_values: integers 0-9
  - relationship: "output is a reduced representation of input"
  - operation: "Sub-grid extraction"
  - transformation_type: "Lossy - information is discarded"
  - spatial_relationship: preserved
  - rows_considered:
    - start: 0
      stop: 3
    - start: 3
      stop: 6
    - start: 6
      stop: 9
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide** the input grid vertically into three equal-height sections. Each section will have a height of input_grid_height / 3. In this example a height of 3.
2.  **Extract** each of these subgrids, considering only rows from 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8.
3. **Output** the extracted subgrids, they comprise the complete output grid.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the top 3x3 subgrid, the middle 3x3 subgrid and the bottom 3x3 subgrid to form the final output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
