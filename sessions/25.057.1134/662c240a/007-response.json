The input grid appears to be larger than the output grid. The output grid seems to be a specific section extracted from the input grid. The colors in the output grid match the corresponding colors in the input grid, implying a selection or cropping operation rather than a color transformation. The key seems to be identifying which subsection of the input grid is selected for the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
