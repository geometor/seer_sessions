The transformation rule is to crop the input grid to a 3x3 area at the bottom right.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts the 3x3 subgrid from the lower-right corner of the input grid.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier slicing
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Get the dimensions of the input array
    rows, cols = input_array.shape
    
    # Calculate the starting indices for the 3x3 subgrid

```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a simple 3x3 cropping operation from the bottom-right corner. This works for the first example, but the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation is more complex and doesn't always involve a 3x3 crop. The other examples show that, the output grid's dimension depends on where the non-white colored pixels are. So, the initial hypothesis is incorrect. We need to shift our focus from simple cropping to identifying a different pattern or rule that explains all the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We'll use code execution to meticulously analyze each input-output pair. This involves:
    *   Determining the dimensions of input and output grids.
    *   Identifying the colors/values present.
    *   Observing spatial relationships (if any) that remain consistent.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, we will try to identify a common pattern governing all input-output transformations, the output grid depends on the location of the non-white pixels.
3.  **Natural Language Program Update:** Once a consistent pattern is identified, we will articulate the refined transformation rule in a clear, concise natural language program.
4.  **YAML documentation:** Describe the transformation, keeping the ARC prior of "objectness" in mind.

**Code Execution & Metrics:**

    output_dims = output_array.shape

    input_colors = np.unique(input_array)
    output_colors = np.unique(output_array)

    print(f"Input Dimensions: {input_dims}")
    print(f"Output Dimensions: {output_dims}")
    print(f"Input Colors: {input_colors}")
    print(f"Output Colors: {output_colors}")

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify the Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the input grid that contains all the non-white (non-zero) pixels. This is equivalent to finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices where non-white pixels exist.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box. This subgrid becomes the output grid.

In simpler terms, imagine drawing the tightest possible rectangle around all the colored pixels. The content of that rectangle is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
