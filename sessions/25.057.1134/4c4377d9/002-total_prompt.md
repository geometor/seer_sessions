## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x74AF1CE112D0>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x384 at 0x74AF1CB833D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input and Output:** Both input and output are grids (2D arrays) of digits. The digits represent colors.
*   **Colors:** The example primarily uses maroon (9) and gray (5).
*   **Shapes:** While individual digits can form implicit shapes, the prominent interaction seems to be at the level of individual cells rather than composite shapes.
*    **Size changes:** The output is larger than the input

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: [3,6]  # Number of rows in input, output
      columns: [4,4] # Number of columns in input, output
      elements: [digit] #cell values

  - type: digit
    properties:
      values: [9, 5] # maroon, gray
      locations:
        9: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,0], [2,2], [2,3]]   # Locations in the input grid (row, col)
        5: [[0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [2,1]]          # Locations in the input grid

actions:
  - type: replicate #expand, copy
    target: input grid
    parameters:
      vertical: 2       # copies of rows
      description: input grid rows are replicated to create 2 sets of the original rows
      

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of the digits within the input grid are maintained in the output grid, the pattern is repeated.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x4 grid of digits (maroon and gray).
2.  **Replication:** The entire input grid is replicated vertically once.
3. **Output:** A 6x4 grid that copies the input at the top, with the same pattern repeated below.

In essence, the transformation rule is a vertical replication of the input grid. The input grid is duplicated and placed below the original.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
