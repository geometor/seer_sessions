The colors are represented by single digits. The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve some kind of repetition or mirroring of the input pattern. Specifically it seems to involve the creation of a bigger grid with a copy of the input, flipped horizontally, and then stacking it with the original input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
