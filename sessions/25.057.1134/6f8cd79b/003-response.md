Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program and understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which it handled correctly. However, the subsequent tests reveal a crucial limitation: the code assumes a fixed 3x3 grid and only modifies the surrounding pixels, leaving the center pixel unchanged. The other examples show that the rule isn't limited to 3x3 grids and applies to subgrids within larger grids. The core concept of identifying a "center" and its surroundings is valid, but the implementation needs to be generalized to handle arbitrary grid sizes and to identify and transform all 3x3 subgrids, not just the single, overall grid center.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify Dimensions and Centers:** Use code execution to check the dimensions of each input grid and identify the center pixel(s) if we were looking at the whole grid.
2.  **Analyze Subgrids:** Recognize that the transformation applies to *all* possible 3x3 subgrids within the larger grid.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the subgrid-based transformation, clearly stating that *every* 3x3 subgrid within the input is subject to the rule (center pixel unchanged, surrounding pixels become azure).
4. **Gather Metrics**: Use code to determine pass/fail, number of subgrids, etc.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

        rows, cols = input_grid.shape
        is_3x3 = rows == 3 and cols == 3
        passed = np.array_equal(predicted_output, output_grid)

        # Calculate the expected number of 3x3 subgrids
        num_subgrids = (rows - 2) * (cols - 2) if rows >= 3 and cols >= 3 else 0
