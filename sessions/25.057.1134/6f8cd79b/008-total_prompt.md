## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x74AF1CB81150>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x74AF1C88F9D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid consists entirely of 0s (white). The output grid retains the central 0s, but the surrounding pixels are changed to 8s (azure).  The core concept seems to be identifying the boundary or "frame" of the grid and changing its color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      shape: rectangular
      size: 3x3
      content: initially all 0s
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      shape: rectangular
      size: 3x3
      content: outer frame is 8s, inner pixels are unchanged 0s
  - action: color_transformation
    subject: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    operation: change color of boundary pixels
    parameters:
      boundary_color: 8
      inner_color: unchanged (0)
  - relationship: boundary
      pixels: input_grid[(0,0):]
      selection: outer "frame" consisting of all pixels not completely surrounded
                 by other grid pixels.
  - constant: shape_invariance
    details: input and output grids maintain the same dimensions

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:** A 3x3 grid filled with 0s.
2.  **Define the boundary:** The boundary consists of all pixels that are *not* the center pixel. For a 3x3 grid, the boundary pixels are any pixel that is not located at row index 1, column index 1.
3. **Preserve the original:** Copy the grid to not edit the original
4.  **Transform the boundary:** Change the color (value) of all boundary pixels to 8 (azure).
5.  **Output:** The modified grid, where boundary is azure and the inner pixels (only one in this example) remain 0 (white).

Essentially, the program creates an azure frame around the original white grid, leaving the central pixel white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
