  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      shape: rectangular
      size: 3x3
      content: outer frame is 8s, inner pixels are unchanged 0s
  - action: color_transformation
    subject: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    operation: change color of boundary pixels
    parameters:
      boundary_color: 8
      inner_color: unchanged (0)
  - relationship: boundary
      pixels: input_grid[(0,0):]
      selection: outer "frame" consisting of all pixels not completely surrounded
                 by other grid pixels.
  - constant: shape_invariance
    details: input and output grids maintain the same dimensions
