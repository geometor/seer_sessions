## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB805D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid also contains pixels of white (0), as well as a new color, red (2). The transformation seems to involve a change of color based on the original color and its position.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - object: Pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
      position: (row, column)
  - action: Color change
    conditions:
      - if: Pixel is blue (1) and in first row.
        then: Change to red (2).
      - if: Pixel is blue (1) and adjacent to another blue pixel that changed to red
        then: change to red (2)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **First Row Rule, apply to blue pixels**: If a blue pixel is in the first row, change its color to red.
3. **Adjacent to changed**: Then, if a pixel is now red, all blue pixels that were originally next to it are also changed to red
4.  **All other pixels:** Maintain their original color.

Essentially the rule changes blues ones at the top to red, and other adjacent blues to red as well.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
