facts:
  - observation: "Each input grid contains at most one non-zero pixel."
  - observation: "Each output grid contains at most one non-zero pixel."
  - observation: "The non-zero pixel in the output grid is always located at the top-left corner (0, 0)."
  - observation: "The color of the non-zero pixel in the output grid matches the color of the non-zero pixel in the input grid."
  - observation: "All other pixels besides the top-left one are zero (white) in the output grid."
  - rule: "A single pixel is moved from its original location to the top-left corner."
  - rule: "The moved pixel's color is preserved during the move."
  - rule: "If the input is all zeros, return the same all zero grid"
