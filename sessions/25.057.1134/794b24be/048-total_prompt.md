```python
"""
Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
Check neighbors. Examine the colors in the input grid.
    If the pixel is blue (1) and any horizontally or vertically adjacent pixel is also blue (1), change the pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid. If the current pixel has no blue neighbors it is not changed.
    If all of a blue pixel's neighbors are white, it remains blue.
Copy Unchanged: If a pixel is white (0) in the input grid, it remains white (0) in the output grid.
Top Row: Copy only the top row if the left most, middle and right most pixels are all blue.
Middle Row: If the center pixel is white with a blue pixel to its left, it changes to red.
Bottom Row: If bottom left and right corner pixels are blue, they are changed to white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example.  The tests on subsequent examples reveal that the initial program is incomplete and makes incorrect assumptions.  It correctly handles some blue pixels adjacent to other blue pixels (changing them to red), but it includes specific row/column logic (middle pixel, bottom row) that are specific to the training example 1 and do not generalize. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example and incorporated details irrelevant to the general rule. It missed the broader, simpler rule governing the transformation.

The strategy to resolve the errors is:

1.  **Eliminate Overfitting:** Remove the hard-coded row and column conditions (middle pixel rule, bottom row rule). These are clearly not universal.
2.  **Focus on the General Rule:** Re-examine all examples to identify the *consistent* rule that applies to *all* blue pixels.
3.  **Simplify:** The correct rule is likely much simpler than the initial attempt. ARC tasks often have elegant solutions.
4. **Objectness:** We need to identify the objects and their interactions. In this example it seem that the input is converted to output based on the color and the neighboring cells.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

To get precise metrics, I'll use numpy to compare the generated outputs with the expected outputs for each example. I need to see exactly where the discrepancies are.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)
# Input grids for examples 1 to 3
input_grids = [
    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]),  # Example 1 Input
    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),  # Example 2 Input
    np.array([[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]),  # Example 3 Input
]

# Expected output grids for examples 1 to 3
expected_output_grids = [
    np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0]]),  # Example 1 Output
    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),  # Example 2 Output
    np.array([[0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]),  # Example 3 Output
]
# Transform grids using current function
transformed_grids = []

def get_neighbors(grid, row, col):
    """Get the neighbors of a pixel."""
    neighbors = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    if row > 0:
        neighbors.append(grid[row - 1, col])  # Up
    if row < rows - 1:
        neighbors.append(grid[row + 1, col])  # Down
    if col > 0:
        neighbors.append(grid[row, col - 1])  # Left
    if col < cols - 1:
        neighbors.append(grid[row, col + 1])  # Right
    return neighbors

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each pixel in the input_grid
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            # Get the current pixel's color
            current_color = input_grid[row, col]
            # Get the neighboring pixels' colors
            neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col)

            # Apply the transformation rules
            if current_color == 1:  # If the pixel is blue
                if 1 in neighbors:  # and any neighbor is blue
                  output_grid[row,col] = 2

            if row == 1 and col == 1: # center pixel
                if input_grid[row, col-1] == 1 and current_color == 0:
                    output_grid[row, col] = 2

            if row == rows - 1:
                if (col == 0 or col == cols -1) and current_color == 1:
                    output_grid[row, col] = 0
    return output_grid

for grid in input_grids:
  transformed_grids.append(transform(grid))

# Compare transformed grids with expected outputs
comparison_results = []
for i in range(len(expected_output_grids)):
    comparison = transformed_grids[i] == expected_output_grids[i]
    comparison_results.append(comparison)
    print(f"Example {i+1} Comparison (Transformed == Expected):\n{comparison}\n")
    print(f"Number of mismatches: {np.sum(~comparison)}")

```

Example 1 Comparison (Transformed == Expected):
```
[[ True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True]
 [ True False  True]]

Number of mismatches: 1
```
Example 2 Comparison (Transformed == Expected):
```
[[ True  True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True  True]]

Number of mismatches: 0
```
Example 3 Comparison (Transformed == Expected):
```
[[ True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True]
 [ True  True  True]]

Number of mismatches: 0
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: blue_pixel
    property: color=blue (1)
    action: change_color_to_red (2)
    condition: adjacent_to_another_blue_pixel
  - object: white_pixel
    property: color = white(0)
    action: no_change
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the current pixel's color.
3.  **If** the current pixel is blue (1) *and* any of its immediate horizontal or vertical neighbors is also blue (1), **then** change the current pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid.
4. **Otherwise**, copy input grid pixel to output grid

The key improvement is removing the extraneous rules and focusing solely on the relationship between a blue pixel and its immediate neighbors. The "otherwise" clause covers all the cases where the first condition is not true, this is more accurate to cover the copy operation that the previous version did explicitly.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
