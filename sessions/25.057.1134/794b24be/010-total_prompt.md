Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **First Row Rule, apply to blue pixels**: If a blue pixel is in the first row, change its color to red.
3. **Adjacent to changed**: Then, if a pixel is now red, all blue pixels that were originally next to it are also changed to red
4.  **All other pixels:** Maintain their original color.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on the transformation of blue pixels to red. However, the initial logic only considered blue pixels in the first row and their immediate neighbors. The additional training examples reveal a more comprehensive rule: the transformation propagates outwards from the initial red pixels, converting *all* connected blue pixels to red. The code's `changed_pixels` list was attempting to handle this, but needs revision. Essentially, we're dealing with a "flood fill" or "connected component" coloring scenario, starting from the initial red pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Focus on Connectedness:** The core issue is ensuring that *all* blue pixels connected (orthogonally or diagonally) to the initially transformed pixels are also changed. The current code only checks immediate neighbors once.

2.  **Iterative or Recursive Approach:** We need an iterative or recursive process to handle the spreading nature of the transformation. A simple loop that rechecks neighbors of *all* changed pixels in each iteration until no more changes occur is a good solution.

3.  **Keep using changed_pixels list:** This list is essential to the approach,
    and should be used to add any changed pixel, and should be cleared after it
    is complete

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's an analysis of the code execution results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with blue pixels in the first row.
    *   Expected Output: All blue pixels in the first row, and those adjacent, are red.
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   **Assessment:** The initial code correctly handles this simple case, which helped establish the starting point.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with blue pixels in a connected shape spanning multiple rows, with some in the first row.
    *   Expected Output: The entire connected blue shape is turned red.
    *   Actual Output: Only the blue pixels in the first row and their direct neighbors changed to red. The rest of the connected shape remained blue.
    *   **Assessment:** This highlights the core flaw. The transformation doesn't propagate fully.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid with multiple disconnected blue regions, and some blue pixels on the first row.
    *   Expected Output: Only the blue regions connected to the first-row blue pixels are turned red. Other blue regions remain unchanged.
    *   Actual Output: Only a small portion of the correct region is changed.
    *   **Assessment:** Further confirms the propagation issue and demonstrates that disconnected regions are handled correctly (i.e., they are *not* transformed).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output images.

  - name: check_first_row

      Extend the color change to all blue pixels that are
      orthogonally or diagonally connected to a red pixel.
  - name: find_neighbors
    description: get the locations of pixels next to a pixel
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a copy of the input grid as the output grid.

2.  **First Row Transformation:** Identify all blue pixels (value 1) in the first row of the input grid. Change these pixels to red (value 2) in the output grid.

3.  **Iterative Propagation:**
    *   Create an empty list, `changed_pixels`
    *   Iteratively, until no more changes occur:
        *   Add the coordinates of each pixel changed to red to a list called `changed_pixels`
        *    For each changed pixel in `changed_pixels`:
                Find all neighboring pixels (orthogonal and diagonal).
            *   If a neighbor is blue in the input grid, change it to red in the output grid and add its coordinates to `changed_pixels`.
        *   Clear the `changed_pixels` list after each iteration

4.  **Final Output:** The output grid now represents the transformed image. All other pixels remain their original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
