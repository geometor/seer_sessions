## Example 7

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CC2F6D0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CE10650>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid also has a 3x3 dimension. The transformation involves looking at the top row of the input. Where the pixels on the top row of input are blue (1) in the, the corresponding output pixels at the top are red(2). where the pixels on the top row of input are white (0), the output pixels at the top row are red(2). The remaining rows of the grid are all white(0).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements:
    0: white
    1: blue
output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements:
    0: white
    2: red
observations:
  - The top row of the output grid is determined by the top row of the input grid.
  - input blue becomes output red.
  - The other rows in output are all white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the top row of the input grid.**
2.  **Create output, if the corresponding input pixel is blue(1), set output pixel to red(2); if the corresponding input pixel is white(0), output pixel to red(2)**
3. **The remaining rows in the output are all white.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
