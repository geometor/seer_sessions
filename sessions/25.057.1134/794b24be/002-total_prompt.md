## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains a single blue pixel (value 1) in the second row, first column, with the rest being white pixels (value 0). The output grid contains a single red pixel (value 2) in the first row, first column, and the rest are white pixels (value 0). The transformation seems to involve a change in both the color and position of the non-zero pixel.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - object: non_zero_pixel
    properties:
      input_color: blue (1)
      input_position: [1, 0]  # (row, col) indexing starts at 0
      output_color: red (2)
      output_position: [0, 0]
  - action: move_pixel
    parameters:
      from: [1, 0]
      to: [0, 0]
  - action: change_color
      parameters:
          from_color: blue
          to_color: red
  - relationship: input_grid_size equals output_grid_size

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2.  Change the color of this pixel from blue (1) to red (2).
3.  Move the pixel from its original location (row 1, column 0) to the top-left corner (row 0, column 0).
4.  All other pixels in the grid remain white (0).

Essentially, we are changing the color of single non-zero cell to red and it in the top left cell, everything else becomes zero.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
