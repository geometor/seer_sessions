Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which led to an oversimplified transformation rule. The code correctly mirrors blue pixels and changes them to red, but only for cases where such mirroring results in a change. The core issue is that the initial program assumed *all* blue pixels would be mirrored and changed to red. The additional examples reveal this isn't always the case. The failing cases highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of *when* the mirroring and color change occur. It appears that the operation is related to the dimensions of the grid. It's not a simple mirror operation for all blue pixels, but likely contingent on the grid's dimensions and perhaps on some other unidentified object property.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Dimensions:** Execute code to determine the dimensions of each input and output grid in the training examples. This will be crucial for discerning the pattern.
2.  **Object-Specific Behavior:** Re-examine the examples, paying close attention to how blue pixels are treated in different contexts (different grid sizes).
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The revised natural language program will likely need conditional statements (if-then) to describe the transformation accurately. The conditions might depend on the dimensions.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test updated code and refine again after looking at the test set.

**Code Execution for Metrics:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)
examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]),
    }
]

def get_grid_dimensions(grid):
  return grid.shape

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
  input_dims = get_grid_dimensions(example["input"])
  output_dims = get_grid_dimensions(example["output"])
  print(f"Example {i+1}: Input Dimensions = {input_dims}, Output Dimensions = {output_dims}")
```

**Code Execution Results:**

```text
Example 1: Input Dimensions = (3, 4), Output Dimensions = (3, 4)
Example 2: Input Dimensions = (3, 3), Output Dimensions = (3, 3)
Example 3: Input Dimensions = (3, 4), Output Dimensions = (3, 4)
Example 4: Input Dimensions = (3, 4), Output Dimensions = (3, 4)
Example 5: Input Dimensions = (3, 4), Output Dimensions = (3, 4)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the `input_grid` with a value of '1' (blue).

2.  **Check Grid Dimensions:**
    *   If the input grid has an *even* number of columns, mirror each blue pixel across the Y-axis and change its color to '2' (red). The new column index for a blue pixel at column `c` is calculated as `number_of_columns - 1 - c`.
    * If the input grid has an *odd* number of columns, check the x coordinate.
      * If the blue pixel at column c where c == (number_of_columns-1)//2, change the pixel to red
      * Otherwise, do not change the input

3.  **Output:** Create an output grid where the transformed blue pixels (now red) are placed in their new positions, and all other pixels are '0' (white).

**Explanation and Reasoning for changes**
The key distinction between the examples that worked and the one that failed
is the width of the grid. The initial 3 examples had widths of 4, while the
example that did not work had a width of 3. Looking at the other failed
examples, we can see that the operation only happens when the grid has an
even width, or when the x coordinate is equal to the midpoint of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
