1.  **Examine the Input:** Check the input grid for non-zero pixels.
2.  **All Zero Case:** If all pixels in the input grid are zero, the output grid
    should be a solid block where all the pixels are of color 0
3. **Object identification** Identify all non-zero pixels and treat each one as a distinct object.
4.  **Transformation (Non-Zero Case):** if there are non-zero pixels, For each
    non-zero pixel:
    a. Change its color to red.
    b. Move it to the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
    c. repeat this process to fill up the grid.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
