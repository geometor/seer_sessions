Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains pixels of color white (0) and blue (1). The output grid contains pixels of color white (0) and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a color change based on specific criteria. The core concept is replacing certain colors based on their initial value.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of color white (0) and blue (1).
  - observation: Output grid contains pixels of color white (0) and red (2).
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3).
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [0, 1]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [0, 2]
  - action: color_transformation
    description: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid are changed to red (2) in the output grid.
  - action: color_preservation
    description: White (0) pixels in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid.
  - relationship: element-wise_correspondence
    description: Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a pixel at the same location in the output grid.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If the pixel's value is 0 (white), keep the value as 0 (white) in the corresponding position in the output grid.
3.  If the pixel's value is 1 (blue), change the value to 2 (red) in the corresponding position in the output grid.
4. The output grid should be the same shape as the input.
