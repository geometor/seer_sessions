Previous Code:
```python
"""
Finds the top-most row in the input grid that contains at least one blue pixel, and replaces all pixels in that row of the output grid with red.
The rest of the output grid pixels are set to white.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid, but all white.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find the top-most row with at least one blue pixel.
    top_blue_row = -1
    for i, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        if 1 in row:
            top_blue_row = i
            break  # Stop after finding the first row with a blue pixel

    # If a blue row was found, replace all elements in that row of the output grid with red (2).
    if top_blue_row != -1:
        output_grid[top_blue_row, :] = 2

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
