## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 1 0
0 0 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9C7D50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the colored pixels based on their position and/or color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    input_colors: [0, 1]  # White, Blue
    output_colors: [0, 2] # White, Red

actions:
  - type: color_change
    conditions:
      - input_color: 1 # Blue
        output_color: 2 # Red
        location: top row and adjacency to 0 in same row

relationships:
 - type: adjacency
   description: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally, vertically.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  Check if the current pixel is blue (1).
3.  If a pixel is blue (1), find how many adjacent pixels in the same row are white (0).
4.  If there are any white (0) pixels adjacent to a blue one (1), change all the blue pixels in the top row to Red (2).
5.  If not leave the value as is.
6.  Return the modified grid

Essentially, Blue pixels on the top row become Red if there's at least one White pixel in the row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
