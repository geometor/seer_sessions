Previous Code:
```python
"""
Locate the colored pixel in the input. Change its color to red (2) and move it to the top-left corner of the grid. Ensure all other pixels are white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def find_colored_pixel(grid):
    # Find the indices of the non-zero elements
    indices = np.nonzero(grid)
    # Return the coordinates as a tuple
    if len(indices[0]) > 0:
        return (indices[0][0], indices[1][0])
    else:
        return None # Return None if no non-zero pixel

def transform(input_grid):

    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find the colored (non-zero) pixel in the input grid
    colored_pixel_location = find_colored_pixel(input_grid)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
