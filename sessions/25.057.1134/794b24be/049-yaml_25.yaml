facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of color white (0) and blue (1).
  - observation: Output grid contains pixels of color white (0) and red (2).
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3).
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [0, 1]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [0, 2]
  - action: color_transformation
    description: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid are changed to red (2) in the output grid.
  - action: color_preservation
    description: White (0) pixels in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid.
  - relationship: element-wise_correspondence
    description: Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a pixel at the same location in the output grid.
