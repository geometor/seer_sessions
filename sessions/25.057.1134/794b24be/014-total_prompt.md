## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB805D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid in both the input and output. The input grid contains '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The output grid contains '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a color change based on the position and value of specific pixels in the input grid. Specifically, blue pixels seem to turn red, and some white pixels seem to be removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1]  # Values represent colors (white, blue)
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2]  # Values represent colors (white, red)
  - id: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      color: [white, blue, red] # Possible color values
      position: (row, col)  # Position within the grid

actions:
  - name: color_change
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: "Change blue (1) pixels to red (2), based on relative position"
    conditions:
      - if input_grid.pixel.color == blue:
        - output_grid.pixel.color = red
        - output_grid.pixel.position = input_grid.pixel.adjusted_position #see program

relationships:
  - type: element_of
    subject: pixel
    object: input_grid
  - type: element_of
    subject: pixel
    object: output_grid
  - type: transformation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the `input_grid` with a value of '1' (blue).

2.  **Mirror Blue Pixels across Y Axis** For each identified blue pixel:
    *   If it is in column index `c`, map it to `3 - 1 - c` in output

3.  **Change to Red:**  Set color of mapped pixel to `2` (red).

4.  **All unmapped positions are set to zero**

5.  **Everything Else:** All other pixels in the `output_grid` remain '0' (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
