## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 0 3 3 0
4 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x74AF1CE01BD0>

**output:**
```
6 6 0
6 0 0
0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a pattern involving yellow (4), green (3), and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has magenta (6) and white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain consistent (3x6 in this example). It seems the transformation involves replacing specific colors based on some underlying rule, and the positions relative to each other.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of integers representing colored pixels.
  - dimensions:
      input: 3x6
      output: 3x6
    note: Dimensions remain consistent.
  - input_colors:
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
      - color: green
        value: 3
      - color: white
        value: 0
  - output_colors:
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
      - color: white
        value: 0
  - transformation:
      type: color_replacement
      rule: "Yellow (4) and Green (3) are each replaced with Magenta (6)"
  - spatial_relationship:
      description: The relative positions of the pixels remain unchanged. The transformation is a direct color mapping at each position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Receive an input grid of dimensions 3x6, where each cell contains an integer representing a color.
2.  **Color Mapping:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    *   If the cell's value is 4 (yellow) or 3 (green), replace it with 6 (magenta).
    *   If the cell's value is 0 (white), retain the value as 0.
3.  **Output:** Return the modified grid, maintaining the original 3x6 dimensions.

In simpler terms: The transformation replaces all yellow and green pixels with magenta pixels, while leaving white pixels unchanged. The spatial arrangement of the pixels is preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
