## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x74AF1CC7EE50>

**output:**
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C88ECD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of single-digit integers, representing colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger, more detailed version of the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified or "compressed" version of the input, retaining only a subset of the original pixels and potentially reducing the overall dimensions. The core transformation seems to involve a reduction in both the number of columns and the overall size of the grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - width: 9
      - height: 3
      - color_variety: contains colors 1, 4, and 5 (blue, yellow, gray)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 3
      - color_variety: contains colors 1, 4, and 5 (blue, yellow, gray)
  - relationship: output_grid is a reduced version of input_grid
  - operation: column_reduction
    details: input_grid width is reduced by a factor of 3
  - operation: pixel_selection
    details: only specific pixels from the input_grid are retained in the output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2. **Column Reduction:** Divide the input grid's width by three. The new output will only contain every third column starting from the first column.
3. **Pixel Selection/Retention:** Create the output grid, which has the same number of rows as the input grid. Fill the output grid by taking the values from the selected columns in step 2. Specifically the columns that will be used from input are column 0, column 3, and column 6.
4. **Output:** The resulting, smaller grid is the output.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts every third column from the input grid, starting with the first column, and uses those to create a new, smaller grid. The row count does not change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
