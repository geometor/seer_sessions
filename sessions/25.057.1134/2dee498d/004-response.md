Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (not shown, but implied) likely focused on a simple pattern extraction from the first example, which seems to involve extracting a subgrid. However, the provided test results indicate that this initial approach is too simplistic and doesn't generalize to all examples. The strategy now is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the dimensions, colors, and spatial relationships.
2.  **Identify common transformations**: Determine if there's a consistent rule or set of rules that apply across all examples. It's possible the transformation involves identifying a repeating pattern or a specific region of interest.
3.  **Refine the natural language program**: Based on the analysis, update the program to accurately reflect the transformation logic.
4. **Refine code**: Update code to perform metrics, observations, NL program generation

**Metrics and Observations**

To gain deeper insights, I need information available in the previous context. I will perform code execution on the results, so they need to be in a form where they can be parsed into input and output pairs.

Here are the metrics and observations.

*Example 1:*

```
input_grid = [[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]]
```

*   Input shape: (5, 11)
*   Output shape: (5, 4)
*   Colors present: magenta (6), white (0)
*   The output appears to be the first four columns of the input.

*Example 2:*

```
input_grid = [[6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6]]
```
*   Input shape: (6, 10)
*   Output shape: (6, 4)
*   Colors present: magenta (6), white (0)
*   The output appears to be the first four columns of the input.

*Example 3:*

```
input_grid = [[6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]
```
*   Input shape: (6, 12)
*   Output shape: (6, 4)
*   Colors present: magenta (6), white (0)
*   The output appears to be the first four columns of the input.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      colors: [magenta, white]
      shape: rectangular
    transformations:
      - type: column_selection
        description: The first four columns of the input grid are selected to form the output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is to select the first four columns of the input grid to produce the output grid. The height of the output grid is the same as the height of the input grid. The width of the output grid is always 4.
