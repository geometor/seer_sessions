Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be wider than the output grid. The colors and their corresponding numerical values are consistent with the provided `COLOR_MAP`. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the width of the grid, specifically collapsing or selecting columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - width: 6
      - height: 2
      - colors: [red, blue, green]
      - values: [2, 1, 3]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - width: 2
      - height: 2
      - colors: [red, blue, green]
      - values: [2, 1, 3]

  - type: transformation
    description: width reduction
    details: >
      The input grid's width is reduced from 6 to 2.
      The output grid retains the height of the input grid.

  - type: pattern
    description: column selection
    details: >
        The first and second column of the input are preserved in output.
        Every other pairs of columns are removed.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid, noting its dimensions and the color/value of each pixel.
2.  **Select** the first two columns from input.
3.  **Create** a new grid (the output grid) with the selected columns.
4. The height of output grid is same as the input.

In essence, the transformation extracts the first two columns of the input grid to create the output grid.
