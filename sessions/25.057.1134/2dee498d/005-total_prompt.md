Previous Code:
```python
input_grid = [[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]]
output_grid = transform(input_grid)

print(f"expected_output: {expected_output}")
print(f"output_grid    : {output_grid}")

input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
rows, cols = input_grid.shape
expected_grid = np.array(expected_output)
expected_rows, expected_cols = expected_grid.shape
output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
output_rows, output_cols = output_grid.shape

print(f"input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"output shape: {expected_grid.shape}")
print(f"result shape: {output_grid.shape}")
print(f"result matches expected: {np.array_equal(output_grid, expected_grid)}")

```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (not shown, but implied) likely focused on a simple pattern extraction from the first example, which seems to involve extracting a subgrid. However, the provided test results indicate that this initial approach is too simplistic and doesn't generalize to all examples. The strategy now is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the dimensions, colors, and spatial relationships.
2.  **Identify common transformations**: Determine if there's a consistent rule or set of rules that apply across all examples. It's possible the transformation involves identifying a repeating pattern or a specific region of interest.
3.  **Refine the natural language program**: Based on the analysis, update the program to accurately reflect the transformation logic.
4. **Refine code**: Update code to perform metrics, observations, NL program generation

**Metrics and Observations**

To gain deeper insights, I need information available in the previous context. I will perform code execution on the results, so they need to be in a form where they can be parsed into input and output pairs.

Here are the metrics and observations.

*Example 1:*

```
input_grid = [[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]]
```

*   Input shape: (5, 11)
*   Output shape: (5, 4)
*   Colors present: magenta (6), white (0)
*   The output appears to be the first four columns of the input.

*Example 2:*

```
input_grid = [[6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6]]
```
*   Input shape: (6, 10)
*   Output shape: (6, 4)
*   Colors present: magenta (6), white (0)
*   The output appears to be the first four columns of the input.

*Example 3:*

```
input_grid = [[6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]]
expected_output = [[6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]
```
*   Input shape: (6, 12)
*   Output shape: (6, 4)
*   Colors present: magenta (6), white (0)
*   The output appears to be the first four columns of the input.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      colors: [magenta, white]
      shape: rectangular
    transformations:
      - type: column_selection
        description: The first four columns of the input grid are selected to form the output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is to select the first four columns of the input grid to produce the output grid. The height of the output grid is the same as the height of the input grid. The width of the output grid is always 4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
