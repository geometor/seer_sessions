Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    shape = grid.shape
    colors = np.unique(grid)
    return f"Shape: {shape}, Colors: {colors}"

examples = task_data['train']
for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input: {describe_grid(input_grid)}")
    print(f"  Output: {describe_grid(output_grid)}")

    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
    print(f"  Predicted: {describe_grid(predicted_output)}")

    #Check for match
    match = "yes" if np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_output) else "no"
    print(f"  Output Match: {match}")
    
    #inspect column 1 of input
    print(f"  Input column 1: {input_grid[:,1]}")
    #inspect added rows of output
    if (input_grid.shape[0] < output_grid.shape[0]):
        print(f"  Output added rows:\n{output_grid[input_grid.shape[0]:,:]}")
    else:
        print("  no rows added")

```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples and results to refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (extending the second column and adding a row of yellow below) was too specific to the first example. The subsequent examples demonstrate that this rule doesn't hold universally. The core concept seems to involve extending a column, but the color and potentially other aspects are variable. It appears we are not simply replicating existing columns, but using the information to create mirrored or inverted information. A critical error seems to be assuming only the *second* column mattered. We need to consider all input columns as potential input to the rule. Also, simply mirroring is incorrect - the values are being changed. The examples appear to use symmetry (mirroring) as well as value changes in the transformation.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden Scope:** Instead of focusing solely on the second column, analyze all columns and their relationship to the output.
2.  **Identify the Pattern:** Look for a consistent relationship between *a specific* input column and its extended version in the output, taking into account any color transformations. Consider mirroring and value replacement in output.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The rule might involve conditions based on the input grid's properties (e.g., dimensions, colors).
4.  Re-evaluate row additions. The examples seem to perform column extension.
5. The input is small and the output is large - there is likely some type of
   pattern repetition.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

I will write some code to generate a report for analysis, and include the output below:

```python
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    shape = grid.shape
    colors = np.unique(grid)
    return f"Shape: {shape}, Colors: {colors}"

task_data = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[3, 3, 3], [3, 8, 3], [3, 3, 3]],
            "output": [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 8, 3, 8, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 8, 3, 8, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]],
            "output": [[1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[8, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [5, 0, 6]],
            "output": [[8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [5, 0, 6, 0, 5], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8]],
        },
        {
             "input": [[7, 0, 7, 7], [7, 0, 8, 0], [7, 2, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7]],

        }
    ]
}

for i, example in enumerate(task_data['train']):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input: {describe_grid(input_grid)}")
    print(f"  Output: {describe_grid(output_grid)}")

    # Analyze column relationships
    for col_idx in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        print(f"  Input Column {col_idx}: {input_grid[:, col_idx]}")

    print(f"Output columns 0 to {output_grid.shape[1]-1}:")
    for col_idx in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
        print(f"  Output Column {col_idx}: {output_grid[:, col_idx]}")

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns:** The input grid consists of a series of columns.
2.  **Mirror and Extend:** The output grid is created by mirroring the input columns. This includes:
    *   The leftmost column is extended to the right.
    *   Each internal column is duplicated, mirrored, and extended.
    *   The rightmost column is extended to the left.
3. **Central Column:** The central column provides the core pattern.
4.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid will have a width equal to 2 * (input width) - 2 + 1, and a height equal to 2 * (input height) - 2 + 1.

In summary, the transformation takes each input column, and creates mirrored columns in the output. If there are 'n' input columns, there are 2n-1 output columns. If there are 'r' input rows, there will be '2r-1' output rows. The center column of the input is also the center column of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
