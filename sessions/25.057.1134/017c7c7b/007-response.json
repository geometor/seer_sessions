The input grid has alternating white (0) and blue (1) pixels in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid has a similar checkerboard pattern, but with white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is also one row taller than the input grid. The height seems to have increased, and the blue color has been changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
