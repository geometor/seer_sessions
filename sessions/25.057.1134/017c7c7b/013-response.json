The blue pixels form a contiguous vertical line.\n2.  **Color Mapping:**  All blue (1) pixels in the input grid are changed to red (2) pixels. The white (0) remain white(0).\n3. **Elongation/Expansion**: Add three rows to extend the grid vertically.\n4. **Placement**: The original input shape, now all red and white, starts at the top. The new rows are filled. The inserted rows maintain the pattern established in the original image.\n5.  **Output:** The resulting output grid consists of red pixels in the same positions as the original blue pixels and is three rows taller and filled.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation takes a grid with a blue line, changes the blue line to red, and adds three rows at the bottom of the grid which continues the pattern - white, white, red, red.\n"
