## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CE007D0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1CC2F850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid has alternating white (0) and blue (1) pixels in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid has a similar checkerboard pattern, but with white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is also one row taller than the input grid. The height seems to have increased, and the blue color has been changed.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid has a checkerboard pattern of white and blue pixels.
  - observation: Output grid has a checkerboard pattern of white and red pixels.
  - observation: Input color blue (1) is replaced by red (2) in the output.
  - observation: 'The output grid is maintains the 3xN structure of the input grid'
  - observation: 'The output grid has a repeating checkerboard pattern for the N rows of the input'
  - observation: The output grid adds another repeat of the pattern.
  - relationship: The output grid's height is increased by 3 rows, maintaining the checkerboard, relative to the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Recognize the checkerboard pattern in the input grid, specifically the alternating white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Color Substitution:** Replace all instances of blue (1) with red (2).
3.  **Extend Grid:** Increase height by 3 repeating rows.
4. **Maintain Pattern**: the increased rows continue the input checkerboard pattern
5. **Output**: present new checkerboard pattern


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
