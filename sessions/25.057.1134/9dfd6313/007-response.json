Non-zero values seem to represent distinct objects or elements within the grid. The positions of these non-zero elements change between the input and output grids.  The zero-value cells (white) represent the background. The core colors involved are grey (5), magenta (6), yellow (4) and white/background (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
