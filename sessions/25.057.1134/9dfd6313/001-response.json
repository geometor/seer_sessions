The transformation appears to involve rearranging the positions of these integers/colors within the grid. The colors white (0) and gray (5) seem to maintain their positions along the main diagonal. The green (3) seems to shift from the input's middle-left to the output's top-middle.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Its old position in input is row 1, column 0. Its new position is row 0, column 1. All other non-diagonal elements that aren't green(3) is white (0).\n\nIn essence, it is a very constrained rearrangement. Other than the diagonal, all are white except one value and its transpose.\n"
