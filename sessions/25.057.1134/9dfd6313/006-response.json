Preserve the First Row: The entire first row of the input grid is copied to the output grid without any changes.\n2.  Preserve the Main Diagonal: The elements on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the input grid are preserved in the output grid.\n3.  Clear Other Elements: All other elements in the output grid, except those in the first row and on the main diagonal, are set to 0.\n\nIn essence, the transformation preserves the first row and the main diagonal and sets all other cells to 0.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
