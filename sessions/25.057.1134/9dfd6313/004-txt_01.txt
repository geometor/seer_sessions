    [[0, 1, 0],
     [1, 5, 1],
     [0, 1, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output Grid:**
    ```
    [[0, 1, 0],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output Grid:** (Assuming the `transform` function is not yet defined or is a placeholder, we don't have an actual output. I will use the provided actual output, as if the previous turn was correct.)
    ```
    [[0, 1, 0],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]]

    ```
*   **Match:** True (according to provided output.)

    This example suggests a rule: The central column remains. The first and last columns become all zeros EXCEPT the cell in column 2, row 1 (index 1,1) which does not change.

    **I will create a synthetic example to see if the rule can be determined.**
