## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0
8 8 5 0 0
0 2 0 5 0
0 2 0 1 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CAD3050>

**output:**
```
5 0 8 0 0
0 5 8 2 2
0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 5 1
0 0 0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CAD36D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation isn't a simple, uniform change (like color substitution). Certain elements are moved, and others are seemingly created or duplicated. It appears spatial relationships and the values of neighboring cells play a key role. The grey (5) seems to be an important element that is preserved and probably influences moving objects.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 5x5 grids.
    elements: Single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
  - type: observation
    description: The grey color (5) appears to act as a "landmark" or "anchor," retaining its position in most cases.
  - type: movement
    description: The azure (8) object moves from row 3 to row 1, maintaining column position.
  - type: movement
    description: One red object (2) moves and duplicates.
  - type: observation
    description: The moving/splitting appears to occur along columns where (5) gray is adjacent.
  - type: action
    description: duplication of red object (2).
  - type: location
    description: The movement destinations are empty (0/white) cells.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Anchors:** Locate all grey (5) cells. These generally remain in their original positions.

2.  **Propagate Left to Right**.  Consider each non-grey and non-white cell, moving it along the row as follows:
    *   Iterate through all non-grey and non-white cells in reading order (left to right, top to bottom)
    *  If a non-grey, non-white pixel has a grey (5) pixel anywhere above it in the same column, move it to first empty cell on the same column, directly above the nearest grey (5).
    *   If a non-grey, non-white pixel has a grey (5) pixel anywhere below it in the same column, move it to first empty cell on the same column, directly below the nearest grey (5).
    *   When a pixel is moved on row to above a gray, check the right adjacent pixel of its orginal position and if not 0, move the value to above the neighboring grey as well.

3. Copy any not moved non-grey and non-white to the output.

In simpler terms - non-white and non-grey objects "gravitate" to locations directly above or below the nearest grey object in the same column. If no grey (5) pixels, preserve the original cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
