The transformation isn't a simple, uniform change (like color substitution). Certain elements are moved, and others are seemingly created or duplicated. It appears spatial relationships and the values of neighboring cells play a key role. The grey (5) seems to be an important element that is preserved and probably influences moving objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Copy any not moved non-grey and non-white to the output.\n\nIn simpler terms - non-white and non-grey objects \"gravitate\" to locations directly above or below the nearest grey object in the same column.
