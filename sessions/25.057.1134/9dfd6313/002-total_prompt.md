## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 0 0
3 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB14650>

**output:**
```
5 3 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB175D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation appears to involve rearranging the positions of these integers/colors within the grid. The colors white (0) and gray (5) seem to maintain their positions along the main diagonal. The green (3) seems to shift from the input's middle-left to the output's top-middle.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: color_pixel
    values: [0, 3, 5] # white, green, gray
    properties:
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: move_pixel
    description: Changes the position of a color pixel within the grid.
    constraints:
      - diagonal_elements_fixed: 0 and 5 on the main diagonal remain in place.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Positions of the color pixels relative to each other.
  - type: positional_change
    description: change from position in the input to position in the output, and the inverse
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Recognize the 3x3 input grid and the color values (0, 3, and 5) of its cells.
2.  **Preserve Diagonal:** Maintain the positions of white (0) and gray (5) pixels that lie on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
3. **Move Non-Diagonal:** The green (3) moves. Its old position in input is row 1, column 0. Its new position is row 0, column 1. All other non-diagonal elements that aren't green(3) is white (0).

In essence, it is a very constrained rearrangement. Other than the diagonal, all are white except one value and its transpose.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
