    description: output grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - color: red (2)
        location: (0,0)
      - color: yellow (4)
        location: (0,1)
      - color: red (2)
        location: (1,0)
      - color: gray (5)
        location: (1,1)
  - observation:
      description: output grid colors are present in the input grid.
  - observation:
      description: output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation:
      description: colors in the output seem to represent colors from each quadrant of input
  - action: derive_output_grid_top_left:
    input: sub-grid of Input, top-left quadrant, coordinates(0:3, 0:3)
    description: select top-left most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (0,0)
  - action: derive_output_grid_top_right:
      input: sub-grid of Input, top-right quadrant, coordinates(0:3, 4:7)
    description: select top-right most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (0,1)
  - action: derive_output_grid_bottom_left:
      input: sub-grid of Input, bottom-left quadrant, coordinates(4:7, 0:3)
    description:  select bottom-left most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (1,0)
  - action: derive_output_grid_bottom_right:
      input: sub-grid of Input, bottom-right quadrant, coordinates(4:7, 4:7)
    description:  select bottom-right most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (1,1)
