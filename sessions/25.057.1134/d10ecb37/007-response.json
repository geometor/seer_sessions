The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid. There's a clear reduction in size, suggesting some form of summarization or pattern extraction. The output grid appears to be a 2x2 grid. The specific colors present in the output (red, yellow, gray) also exist in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
