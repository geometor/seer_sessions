Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expands the input grid into a 9x4 output grid, replicating a pattern and adding white lines.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as 9x4 filled with red (2)
    output_grid = np.full((9, 4), 2)

    # Get input grid dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Place white (0) in the first and last columns
    output_grid[:, 0] = 0
    output_grid[:, 3] = 0
    
    # Find white pixels in input
    white_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 0)

    # Iterate through white pixels and perform expansion and placement of the white
    for r, c in white_pixels:
      if r - 1 >=0:
        output_grid[r*3, c*3] = 0
      output_grid[r*3 + 2, c * 3] = 0
      output_grid[r*3 + 3, c*3] = 0

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
