The input grid contains only two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with repetitions of the input's elements both horizontally and vertically. The gray pixels seem to define a kind of \"cross\" or \"+\" shape in how they expand and relate to other gray colored cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
