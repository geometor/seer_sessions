objects:
  - id: gray_region
    color: gray (5)
    description: Contiguous region of gray pixels.  Shape and size vary.
    initial_position: Varies in each example.
    behavior: Expands or replicates to form a larger gray region in the output.

transformation_rules:
  - rule_1: Identify the 'gray_region' in the input.
  - rule_2: Create new output array, at least doubling the dimensions of the input.
  - rule_3: The input gray region is expanded and possibly replicated, becoming the core of the output.
  - rule_4: There is often additional rows and/or colums of 0-color pixels surrounding the main gray shape.

grid_properties:
    input_height:  [3, 2, 3, 3, 3] # height of each example
    input_width: [6, 3, 3, 2, 3]  # width of each example
    output_height: [9, 4, 9, 9, 9]
    output_width: [8, 5, 4, 4, 4]
