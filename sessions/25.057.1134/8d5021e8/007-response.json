The reds form a vertical line on the left, and there's a single white pixel in the top right and another in the bottom right.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 9x4 grid. It appears the original input has been somehow expanded or replicated. The output consists primarily of red (2) pixels. White (0) pixels appear in vertical columns, forming two vertical lines on the first and last column of the grid.\n* The input pattern is not directly copied, translated or rotated to create the output pattern.\n* The output grid is constructed out of combining colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
