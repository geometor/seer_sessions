## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0
0 5
5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x74AF1CAD3650>

**output:**
```
0 5 5 0
5 0 0 5
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
5 0 0 5
0 5 5 0
0 5 5 0
5 0 0 5
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x74AF1CC2E450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 3x2 grid into a larger 9x4 grid. The input grid contains only two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with repetitions of the input's elements both horizontally and vertically. The gray pixels seem to define a kind of "cross" or "+" shape in how they expand and relate to other gray colored cells.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x2 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Output grid is 9x4 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Input grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - observation: Output grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - object: Input_Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 2
      colors: [0, 5]
  - object: Output_Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      rows: 9
      columns: 4
      colors: [0, 5]
  - relationship: Output_Grid is an expansion of Input_Grid.
  - action: Input_Grid elements are replicated in Output_Grid.
  - pattern: Gray (5) pixels in the input grid expand to 2x2 blocks in the output grid, except when adjacent at a corner where they form a shared 2x1 or 1x2 block.
  - pattern:  White (0) pixels expand to fill in empty spaces.
  - geometry: Corner-adjacent gray pixels create a form of overlap or merge in the created blocks, avoiding full 2x2 expansion in the direction of adjacency.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of size 9x4, initially filled with white (0).

2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel in the 3x2 input grid:
    *   If the input pixel is gray (5):
        *   Check for adjacent gray pixels.
        * Create a 2x2 block of gray at a corresponding x, y coordinate in the output grid.
            * scale x by a factor of `output column count / input column count` (4/2 = 2)
            * scale y by a factor of `output row count / input row count` (9/3 = 3)
        * If a corner neighbor is gray, only fill up to the shared edge to create 2x1 or 1x2 blocks that connect along the side or top/bottom (but not a diagonal connection)
    *   If the input pixel is white (0), it will not be directly expanded, but the space is filled.

3.  **Space Filling:** The remaining cells will default to value set in initialization, and remain white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
