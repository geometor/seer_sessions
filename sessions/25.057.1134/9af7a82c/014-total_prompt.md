## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 8 2
3 8 8
3 3 4
3 3 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x74AF1CAD3150>

**output:**
```
3 8 4 2
3 8 4 0
3 8 0 0
3 8 0 0
3 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x320 at 0x74AF1C9EC650>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, broken down into perceptions, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of numerical values, representing colors.
*   **Colors:** Multiple colors are present (represented by digits). The mapping isn't given here, but I know it from the general problem definition.
*   **Shapes:** There appear to be rectangular regions of uniform color in both input and output.
*   **Change in Size and Shape:** The overall grid dimensions change from 4x3 in the input to 5x4 in the output, and the color regions also get redistributed.
*   **Column-wise Preservation with Modification:** It seems like color information might be preserved in some form along columns, but with additions and replacements by 0 (white).
*    One column seems to be reordered and moved to the first column (column of 3s).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    dimensions: 4x3
    elements: color_values
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    dimensions: 5x4
    elements: color_values
  - type: object
    description: colored_regions
    properties:
      - color: integer_value
      - shape: rectangular
      - location: row, column
  - type: transformation
    description: "column_reordering_and_filling"
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    operations:
      - reorder:
          description: "Move the first column to the leftmost position"
      - extend:
          description: "add rows to the bottom filled with 0"
          rows: 2
      - extend:
          description: "add columns to the right"
      - fill:
          description: fill with the color values from top to bottom, then fill with 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns:**  Treat each column of the input grid as a separate unit.
2.  **Reorder Columns:** Move the first column of the input grid (containing all 3s) to become the first column of the output grid.
3.  **Extend Rows:** extend existing columns down by filling with 0.
4.  **Extend Columns:** Extend existing columns to the right.
5. **Column-wise Fill:** For each of the remaining original columns, create an output column. Start filling the output column from top to bottom with color values from that column and fill the rest of the cells in that column with 0 (white).
6.  **Result:** The output is a 5x4 grid resulting from these operations.

Essentially, the transformation appears to involve taking the colors from each column of the input grid, preserving their order, and placing these color values in the output grid and extends down and to the right, filling remaining space with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
