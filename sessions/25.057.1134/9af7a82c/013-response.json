The mapping isn't given here, but I know it from the general problem definition.\n*   **Shapes:** There appear to be rectangular regions of uniform color in both input and output.\n*   **Change in Size and Shape:** The overall grid dimensions change from 4x3 in the input to 5x4 in the output, and the color regions also get redistributed.\n*   **Column-wise Preservation with Modification:** It seems like color information might be preserved in some form along columns, but with additions and replacements by 0 (white).\n*    One column seems to be reordered and moved to the first column (column of 3s).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Start filling the output column from top to bottom with color values from that column and fill the rest of the cells in that column with 0 (white).\n6.  **Result:** The output is a 5x4 grid resulting from these operations.\n\nEssentially, the transformation appears to involve taking the colors from each column of the input grid, preserving their order, and placing these color values in the output grid and extends down and to the right, filling remaining space with 0.\n"
