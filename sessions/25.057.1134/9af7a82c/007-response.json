The output grid uses colors corresponding to the values 0(white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).\n* **Spatial Relationship**: There is no simple 2x vertical expansion - look at how colors appear to move and disappear.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

The number of rows of output grid is double the rows of input grid plus the number of row that include at least a value of 4.\n\n2.  **Column-wise Processing:** Iterate through each column of the input grid, from left to right (column 0 to 3).\n\n3.  **Color Mapping/Replacement:**\n    *   Within each column, examine the input grid.\n    *   Create a sequence of the unique colors that are present, maintaining their relative order from the input.\n    *   Starting from the top of each column of the output grid, sequentially place the input color until it is exhausted.\n    *   Fill remaining cells in the column of the output grid as `0`\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The resulting 6x4 output grid represents the transformation.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves iterating over the input grid's columns, performing color sorting/replacement in each column, and using 0 as a \"blank\" fill. The original colors are kept, and then 'shifted down' into the larger output array one column at a time.\n"
