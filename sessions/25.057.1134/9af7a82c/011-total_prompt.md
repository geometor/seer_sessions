Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation operates on each column independently. The output grid's height
is the input height + the number of rows in the input.  The top cell of each output
column is filled with color 2 (red). The remaining colors from the corresponding
input column are placed in the output column, shifted down by one position.
Empty spaces are left as color 0.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_height = input_grid.shape[0] + input_grid.shape[0] # input_height + input_rows
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, input_grid.shape[1]), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels
    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        # Place color 2 at the top of each column
        output_grid[0, j] = 2

        # Shift the input column down by one position in the output column
        for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
            output_grid[i + 1, j] = input_grid[i, j]

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
