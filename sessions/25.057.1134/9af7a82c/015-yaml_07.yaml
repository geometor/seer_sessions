observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - structure: rows and columns
  - object: column
    properties:
       - part_of: grid
       - ordered: elements maintain input order in the output
       - action: stacking non-zero values

transformation_rule:
  - process: column-wise extraction and stacking
  - input: input_grid (2D array)
  - output: output_grid (2D array)
  - steps:
    - For each column in the input grid:
      - Extract all non-zero (non-white) values, preserving their order.
      - Place these extracted values into the corresponding column of the output grid, starting from the top row.
      - if input column count > output column count:
        - combine the extracted values into a single column in order
    - The number of columns in output should match the number of columns in the input that have non-zero values.
    - The number of rows in output should match total number of non-zero values across all columns in input.
