## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 1 1 4
2 2 2 4
4 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x74AF1CB81950>

**output:**
```
4 2 1 3
4 2 1 0
4 2 0 0
4 0 0 0
4 0 0 0
4 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x384 at 0x74AF1C9EE050>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x4 grid of colored squares (represented by single-digit integers).
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x4 grid, seeming to be derived from and related to the input.
*   **Colors:** The input grid uses colors corresponding to the values 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow). The output grid uses colors corresponding to the values 0(white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
* **Spatial Relationship**: There is no simple 2x vertical expansion - look at how colors appear to move and disappear.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x4 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 6x4 grid.
  - observation: Input colors include 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
  - observation: Output colors include 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are related to input grid dimensions, but are not a direct scaling. Output height is double the input height + number of rows with color 4. Output width is same.
  - object: Input grid cells.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (1-4)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: Output grid cells.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-4)
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: Column-wise color replacement in output grid.
  - action: If color present in a column, shift color in next row in order and fill the cell with color from input grid.
  - action: If color not present, set output to zero (white)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same number of columns as the input grid. The number of rows of output grid is double the rows of input grid plus the number of row that include at least a value of 4.

2.  **Column-wise Processing:** Iterate through each column of the input grid, from left to right (column 0 to 3).

3.  **Color Mapping/Replacement:**
    *   Within each column, examine the input grid.
    *   Create a sequence of the unique colors that are present, maintaining their relative order from the input.
    *   Starting from the top of each column of the output grid, sequentially place the input color until it is exhausted.
    *   Fill remaining cells in the column of the output grid as `0`

4.  **Final Output:** The resulting 6x4 output grid represents the transformation.

In summary, the transformation involves iterating over the input grid's columns, performing color sorting/replacement in each column, and using 0 as a "blank" fill. The original colors are kept, and then 'shifted down' into the larger output array one column at a time.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
