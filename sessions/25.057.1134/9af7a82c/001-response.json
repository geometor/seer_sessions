The input grid seems to have a simpler, more \"blocky\" structure, while the output grid has a more elongated, vertical structure and introduces the color white (0). There's a sense of \"sorting\" and \"re-arranging\" based on color. The sizes of the grids change, specifically changing to 3x3 for the input, and 5x3 for the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
