facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x4 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 6x4 grid.
  - observation: Input colors include 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
  - observation: Output colors include 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are related to input grid dimensions, but are not a direct scaling. Output height is double the input height + number of rows with color 4. Output width is same.
  - object: Input grid cells.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (1-4)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: Output grid cells.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-4)
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: Column-wise color replacement in output grid.
  - action: If color present in a column, shift color in next row in order and fill the cell with color from input grid.
  - action: If color not present, set output to zero (white)
