## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 3 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CE10650>

**output:**
```
1 2 3
1 2 0
1 2 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x74AF1CB83450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a simpler, more "blocky" structure, while the output grid has a more elongated, vertical structure and introduces the color white (0). There's a sense of "sorting" and "re-arranging" based on color. The sizes of the grids change, specifically changing to 3x3 for the input, and 5x3 for the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
    input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      colors: [1, 2, 3]
      color_names: [blue, red, green]
      structure: blocky
    output_grid:
      dimensions: [5, 3]
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3]
      color_names: [white, blue, red, green]
      structure: vertical_elongated
    color_mapping:
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      0: white
    observations:
      - color_sorting: Apparent vertical sorting by color.
      - color_addition: Introduction of white (0).
      - dimension_change: Input is 3x3, output is 5x3.
      - column_order: The columns of the input end up ordered as columns in the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns:** Treat each column in the input grid as a separate object.
2.  **Sort Columns:** Sort the columns from the original image to be in order from left to right 1, 2, 3
3. **Stack:** Take each object and stack the colors vertically downwards, extending the object down until row five.
4. **Fill the rest:** Insert white (0) to the right as padding to make 3 columns

In essence, the transformation takes columns of colors, sorts those columns, stacks the identified colors vertically, and fills the remaining spaces with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
