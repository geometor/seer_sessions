## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 0 3 0 0
8 6 5 6 0
3 6 3 0 0
0 0 0 5 9
5 0 9 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF37938F50>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 5 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1C9ADD50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid is mostly white (0), with a single vertical column containing non-white pixels. The colors and positions of the non-white pixels in the output seem to be derived from the input. Specifically, it looks like only the pixels in the central column of the input that are not white are retained, maintaining their row and original color but shifted to the center column in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    dimensions: 5x5
    values: integers representing colors (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      position: row and column index within the grid
  - observation: central_column_selection
    description: Only the pixels in the center column of the input are potentially relevant.
  - observation: non_white_filtering
    description: Only non-white (non-zero) pixels from the input's central column are kept.
  - observation: position_shift
    description: Selected pixels maintain their original row index.
    new_column: All selected pixels are moved to the center column in the output grid.
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: selected pixels maintain their original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central column:** Determine the middle column of the input grid. In this 5x5 case, it's the 3rd column.
2.  **Filter central column pixels:** Iterate through the pixels in the identified central column of the input grid.
3.  **Check for non-white pixels:** For each pixel in the central column, check if its value is not 0 (white).
4.  **Preserve and reposition:** If a pixel is not white, keep its original color and row index. Place this pixel in the output grid at the same row index but in the central column (3rd column).
5.  **Fill remaining with white:** All other pixels in the output grid, not populated by step 4, are set to 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
