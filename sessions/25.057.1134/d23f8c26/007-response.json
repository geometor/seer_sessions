The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid is mostly white (0), with a single vertical column containing non-white pixels. The colors and positions of the non-white pixels in the output seem to be derived from the input. Specifically, it looks like only the pixels in the central column of the input that are not white are retained, maintaining their row and original color but shifted to the center column in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
