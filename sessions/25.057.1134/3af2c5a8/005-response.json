            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved expanding azure (8) pixels into 2x2 blocks. However, the other training examples have revealed that this rule may only be a component of the complete transformation, not a sufficient program. Running the code against all the examples provided critical feedback. The next step is to revise the natural language program, use it to update the transform function, and retest the code against the training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results of the `transform` function:\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[8 8 0]\n     [8 8 0]\n     [0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output (from code):**\n    ```\n    [[8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [8 8 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n    Result: correct\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[0 8 8]\n     [0 8 0]\n     [0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 8 8 8 8]\n     [0 0 8 8 8 8]\n     [0 0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output (from code):**\n    ```\n     [[0 8 8 8 8]\n     [0 8 8 8 8]\n     [0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n    ```\n    Result: incorrect\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0]\n     [0 8 0]\n     [0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output (from code):**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 8 8 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n    Result: correct\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The output grid is always double the height and width of the input grid.\n  - object_identification: |\n      Azure (8) pixels in the input grid are treated specially.\n  - object_transformation: |\n      Each azure pixel expands into a 2x2 block of azure pixels in the output grid.\n  - coordinate_mapping: |\n     The top-left corner of each 2x2 block corresponds to the original azure pixel's position multiplied by two in each dimension (row, column).\n  - background:\n      Pixels that are not azure in the input may or may not exist in the output. The rule for other pixels has not been fully determined. The current code removes all non-azure pixels.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. Initialize all its cells to black (0).\n\n2.  **Azure Pixel Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid:\n    *   If the pixel is azure (8), then in the output grid, create a 2x2 block of azure pixels.\n    *   The top-left corner of this 2x2 block will be at coordinates (row \\* 2, column \\* 2), where 'row' and 'column' are the coordinates of the original azure pixel in the input grid.\n    *   do nothing with non-azure pixels, leave the background black.\n\n"
