## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 3 3
0 3 0 3
3 3 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x74AF1D56B950>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0
0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0
3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3
3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3
0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0
0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid also contains the same colors and expands upon the input. The spatial arrangement of colors seems key, with the output appearing to be an inflated, mirrored, or repeated version of the input, with some kind of symmetry.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x4
    colors: [0, 3] # white, green
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x8
    colors: [0, 3] # white, green
  - observation: output_dimensions_are_double_input
    details: Output grid dimensions are exactly twice the input grid dimensions (height x2, width x2).
  - observation: color_preservation
    details: The colors present in the input grid are the same as those in the output grid.
  - observation: pattern_expansion
    details: The output grid's pattern appears to be a mirrored and expanded version of the input grid's pattern. There's a horizontal and vertical symmetry.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions are twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.

2.  **Quadrant Creation:** Conceptually divide both the input and output grids into four equal quadrants.

3.  **Top-Left Quadrant Replication**:
    - The input grid's pattern forms the basis and is directly copied into the top-left quadrant of the output grid.

4.  **Horizontal Reflection (Top-Right Quadrant)**:
   - Create the top-right of the output by horizontally flipping the cells of top-left quadrant.

5.  **Vertical Reflection (Bottom-Left Quadrant)**:
    -  Create the bottom-left of the output by vertically flipping the cells of top-left quadrant

6.  **Diagonal reflection( Bottom-Right Quadrant).**
    -  Create the bottom-right quadrant of the output by mirroring, first horizontally from top-left, and then vertically. OR first vertically from top-left, and then horizontally.

In essence, the transformation inflates the input grid by a factor of two in both dimensions, creating a mirrored, symmetrical pattern in the output grid based on the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
