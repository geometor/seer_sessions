## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0
0 8 0 8
0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x74AF1CA46AD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x74AF1D56B950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit (0-9). The input grid transforms into a larger output grid. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels appear to form a pattern, and this pattern is expanded in the output. The core transformation seems related to duplicating the azure pixels and potentially shifting them to create a larger, more complex pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - height: 3
      - width: 4
      - dominant_colors: [0, 8]

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - height: 6
      - width: 8
      - dominant_colors: [0, 8]
    relationship: derived_from: input_grid

  - action: expansion
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The input grid is expanded to double its height and width.

  - action: pixel_duplication
    input: azure_pixels (8)
    description:  Azure pixels are duplicated horizontally and vertically.
    details: each azure is surrounded by azure in cardinal directions

  - object: azure_pixels
    value: 8
    property: key_element_in_transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a new output grid that is double the width and double the height of the input grid. Fill the output grid with white pixels (0).

2.  **Azure Pixel Expansion**: For each azure (8) pixel in the input grid, perform the following:

    *    Place an azure pixel in the output grid at the corresponding, scaled position (multiply original row and col by 2).

    *   Also, fill the neighbor positions: down, right, and down+right, to the original position.

3.  **Output:** The resulting output grid represents the transformed pattern.

In essence, each original Azure pixel "expands" to a 2 X 2 square of the azure pixels in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
