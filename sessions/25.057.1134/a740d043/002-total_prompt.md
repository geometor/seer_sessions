## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 3 1 1 1
1 1 1 2 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x74AF1CA46AD0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
2 2 3
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9B16D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input is a grid of colored pixels, primarily blue (1), with some red (2) and green (3).
*   The output is a smaller grid of colored pixels, seemingly a condensed or extracted version of the input.
*   The output grid retains some of the colors from the input grid (red and green), but also introduces white (0).
*   The spatial relationship between the colors in the input appears to be important for determining their presence and position in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - colors: [blue, red, green]
      - dimensions: [5, 7] # [height, width]
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - colors: [red, green, white]
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
  - type: object
    description: contiguous_red_region
    properties:
      - color: red
      - shape: irregular
      - input_location: [[1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]
      - output_location: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]]

  - type: object
    description: green_pixel
    properties:
      - color: green
      - input_location: [2,3]
      - output_location: [1,2]
  - type: relationship
    description: The output grid appears to be a 3x3 subgrid centered on either of the input.
  - type: observation
    description: blue pixels in the input are replaced with white, except with pixels adjacent to red and green.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the largest contiguous region of red (2) pixels and the location of any green (3) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Establish Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
3. **Center:** Determine a center point for the area of the input grid that will fill the output.
4.  **Transfer Colors:**
    *   Copy the red and green pixels from the focused part of input to their corresponding relative positions within the output grid.
    *   Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).

Essentially, the transformation extracts a centered 3x3 sub-grid focused either in the red area or the whole grid, preserving the relative positions of red and green pixels, and replacing other colors (in this case, blue) with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
