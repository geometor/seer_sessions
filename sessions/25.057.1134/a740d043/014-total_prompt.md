## Example 3

**input:**
```
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 5 5 1 1 1
1 5 5 1 1 1
1 6 6 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x448 at 0x74AF37873250>

**output:**
```
5 5
5 5
6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x74AF1CC7D8D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The input grid contains a large area of blue (1) pixels, with a small 2x2 square of gray (5) pixels and an adjacent 2x2 square of magenta (6) pixels.  The output grid only contains the gray and magenta pixels, effectively cropping out the blue pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 7x6 (rows x columns)
      - colors: [blue, gray, magenta]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 3x2
      - colors: [gray, magenta]
  - type: object
    properties:
      - name: gray_square
      - color: gray (5)
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - location: (row 3, column 2) in input_grid
  - type: object
    properties:
     - name: magenta_square
     - color: magenta (6)
     - dimensions: 2x2
     - location: (row 5, column 2) in input_grid
actions:
  - type: crop
    description: Remove the blue pixels surrounding the colored squares.
relationships:
   - gray_square is adjacent to magenta_square
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-blue colored contiguous blocks (objects) within the input grid. In this specific instance there will be two objects (a 2x2 gray block and a 2x2 magenta block)
2.  **Combine Objects:** Combine every detected object into a new grid.
3. **Cropping** Remove all rows and columns containing only blue pixels, effectively cropping the grid to the bounding box containing the identified objects.

Essentially, the transformation extracts/crops the regions of non-blue pixels and presents them as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
