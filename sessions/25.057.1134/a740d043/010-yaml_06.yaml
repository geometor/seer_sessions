task_description: |
  The task involves extracting non-blue (non-1) colored clusters from the input grid and arranging them vertically in the output grid.  The clusters maintain their original colors and relative widths.  A single row of black (0) pixels separates each cluster in the output.  The output grid's height is determined by the sum of the heights of the extracted clusters plus the number of separators.

objects:
  - name: cluster
    description: A contiguous group of non-blue pixels.
    properties:
      - width: The number of pixels in the horizontal direction.
      - height: The number of pixels in the vertical direction.
      - color: The color of the pixels within the cluster (represented by an integer).
      - bounding_box:  The smallest rectangle containing the cluster.
  - name: separator
    description:  A row of black pixels.
    properties:
      - width:  Same as output width.
      - height: 1
      - color: 0
