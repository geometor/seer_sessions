## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CAD3050>

**output:**
```
0 5 0 0 5 0
5 5 2 5 5 2
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x74AF1CAD2FD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid that is double the width. The pattern of the input grid seems to be replicated horizontally in the output. The colors (represented by numbers) are maintained during the transformation. The height of grid stays the same.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (input), 3x6 (output)
      - elements: pixels
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - action: horizontal_replication
    description: The input grid is duplicated and placed adjacent to the original, effectively doubling the width.
  - relationship:
      - input_grid: original pattern
      - output_grid: horizontally_duplicated pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid's dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Create** a new grid with the same height as the input grid but double its width.
3.  **Copy** each pixel from the input grid to the corresponding position in the new grid.
4.  **Repeat** the process, copying each pixel from input into a new position in the output grid, starting at an x\_offset of the original width.

In essence, the transformation rule is to duplicate the input grid horizontally.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
