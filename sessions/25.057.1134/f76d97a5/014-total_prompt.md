## Example 3

**input:**
```
9 5 9 9 9
9 9 5 5 9
9 5 9 9 9
9 9 5 9 9
9 9 9 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CB16CD0>

**output:**
```
0 9 0 0 0
0 0 9 9 0
0 9 0 0 0
0 0 9 0 0
0 0 0 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CB17950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains maroon (9) and gray (5) pixels, while the output grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some pixels. The positions of the maroon pixels in the output grid correspond to the positions of some of the maroon and gray pixels on the input. All other pixels in the output is white.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - cell_values: [0-9]  # Representing colors
    input_state:
      - colors: [maroon, gray]
      - pattern: Alternating pattern of maroon and gray, but not strictly consistent.
    output_state:
      - colors: [maroon, white]
      - pattern: Maroon pixels appear where either maroon OR gray was present, any gray is replaced by maroon.
  - action: replace
    description: Selectively replaces gray and maroon pixels with other colors
    parameters:
      - condition: "if the input pixel is maroon keep it, if it is grey, keep as maroon, if it is anything else, it becomes white"
      - replacement: "maroon or white"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement, part 1 (Maroon):** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is maroon, keep as maroon.
3. **Conditional Replacement, part 2 (Grey):** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is gray, keep as maroon.
4.  **Conditional Replacement, part 3 (other):** All the other pixels become white.
5. **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

In summary, the transformation rule is to "keep and reposition the maroon pixels in the input grid and set all other pixels to white". The gray and the maroon are set to the position of the maroon.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
