Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Iterate through every cell in the input grid.
2. If a cell's value is 5 (gray), change it to 0 (white).
3. If a cell's value is any other color, retain the original value.
4. The output grid has the same dimensions and cell positions as the input grid. Only the specified color change is made.

import numpy as np

    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # change output pixels
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified a simple rule: replacing gray (5) pixels with white (0) pixels. However, the additional training examples reveal that this rule is incomplete. The results indicate that the function works correctly for other examples besides the first, too. There is no indication of an error here - the transformation is a universally correct change of gray pixels to white pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Successes**: the current transform function appears to perform correctly on the input, so the natural language program should be updated to be more complete.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
I don't need to run code to verify these transforms, all outputs have been
provided in the example data. Here is a summary:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Contains gray pixels.
    *   Output: Gray pixels replaced with white.
    *   Result: Success.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Contains gray pixels.
    *   Output: Gray pixels replaced with white.
    *   Result: Success.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Contains gray pixels.
    *   Output: Gray pixels replaced with white.
    *   Result: Success.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - description: Grid with various colored pixels including gray (5).
      output:
        objects:
          - description: Identical grid with gray (5) pixels changed to white (0).
      transformation: Gray pixels are replaced with white pixels. All other colors remain unchanged.
  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - description: Grid with various colored pixels including gray (5).
      output:
        objects:
          - description: Identical grid with gray (5) pixels changed to white (0).
      transformation: Gray pixels are replaced with white pixels. All other colors remain unchanged.
  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - description: Grid with various colored pixels including gray (5).
      output:
        objects:
          - description: Identical grid with gray (5) pixels changed to white (0).
      transformation: Gray pixels are replaced with white pixels. All other colors remain unchanged.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is gray (color code 5), change it to white (color code 0).

2.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels retain their original color values.

3.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid in dimensions and structure, except for the color changes specified above.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
