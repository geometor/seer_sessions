Previous Code:
```python
"""
Keep maroon pixels, replace grey pixels with maroon, and replace all other colors with white.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid, but with all white.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell of the input_grid
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            # If the pixel is maroon, keep as maroon in the output grid.
            if input_grid[i, j] == 9:
                output_grid[i,j] = 9
            # If the pixel is gray, keep as maroon in the output grid
            if input_grid[i, j] == 5:
                output_grid[i, j] = 9

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
