The colors in the input grid seem to be irrelevant except for one specific color (orange/7). The output grid appears to be a 3x3 extraction, and the positioning of the '7' (orange) color in the output grid seems to be important. Specifically, I recognize the following high-level concepts:\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 2D array of colored pixels.\n*   **Output Grid:** A smaller 2D array of colored pixels.\n*   **Color Significance:** Orange (7) is the key color.\n*   **Extraction/Selection:**  The output is derived by selecting a specific region from the input.\n*   **Fixed Size:** The output size is always a 3 x 3 grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
