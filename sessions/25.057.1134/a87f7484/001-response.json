The input grid appears to contain three distinct 3x3 blocks of color, each with a different solid color border (magenta, yellow, and azure) and a white (0) pixel somewhere inside. The output grid corresponds precisely to the bottom 3x3 block in the input. The core transformation seems to be identifying and extracting a specific region based on some criteria.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
