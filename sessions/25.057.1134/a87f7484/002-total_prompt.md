## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 0 6
0 6 6
6 0 6
4 0 4
0 4 4
4 0 4
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1CE10650>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CE01BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to contain three distinct 3x3 blocks of color, each with a different solid color border (magenta, yellow, and azure) and a white (0) pixel somewhere inside. The output grid corresponds precisely to the bottom 3x3 block in the input. The core transformation seems to be identifying and extracting a specific region based on some criteria.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 regions combined in a larger grid
      - colors: [magenta, white, yellow, azure]
      - borders: 3x3 colored borders contain cells of all the same value
  - type: sub-grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - extracted_from: larger grid

actions:
  - type: identification
    description: Locate a specific 3x3 region within the input grid.
  - type: extraction
    description: Copy the identified 3x3 region to the output.

relationships:
   - input_contains_multiple: sub-grids
   - output_is: one specific sub-grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the 3x3 region in the input grid that is bordered by azure (color 8) pixels.
2.  **Extract** this 3x3 region.
3.  The extracted region becomes the output grid.

In short, the transformation rule is to simply output the 3x3 block of the input grid which has an azure border.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
