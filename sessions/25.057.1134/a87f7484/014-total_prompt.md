## Example 3

**input:**
```
3 0 0 4 0 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 0
0 3 3 4 4 4 0 2 2 0 8 8 0 1 1
0 3 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x192 at 0x74AF1CE007D0>

**output:**
```
4 0 4
4 4 4
4 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CCD9550>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid.  The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on a specific color and its arrangement. The most prominent feature is the extraction of the yellow (4) pixels and their spatial relationship. Other colors seem to be irrelevant to the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8] # white, blue, red, green, yellow, azure
      - dimensions: [3, 15]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 4] # white, yellow
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
  - name: yellow_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: 4 # yellow
      - shape_in_input: forms a 3x3 square if connected

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extract a specific part of the input grid.
  - type: color_filtering
    description: Only keep yellow and white pixels.

relationships:
   - input_grid contains yellow_pixels
   - output_grid represents yellow_pixels_arrangement

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Target Object:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the color yellow (value 4).

2. **Spatial Analysis:** Determine the bounding box or smallest rectangle that contains the yellow colored objects. If the yellow pixels were connected they would form a 3x3 square.

3. **Extraction:** Extract the 3x3 area defined in step 2

4.  **Output:** The extracted section becomes the output grid. Other colored pixels from the input grid are not part of the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
