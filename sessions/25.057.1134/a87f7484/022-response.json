            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided task and the results of the generated code, along with a strategy for improvement, a YAML block summarizing the findings, and a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies a connected component of non-zero pixels starting from the top-left corner. It extracts a square subgrid containing this component. However, it doesn't accurately capture the full logic of the transformation, as evidenced by the varying correctness across the training examples. The primary issue is that the code assumes the object of interest is *always* connected to the top-left corner. Looking at the examples, it appears we should be searching for the largest square of the color gray (5) *anywhere* in the input grid, not just connected to the top-left.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve Object Identification:** Instead of relying on connectivity to (0,0), we should find *all* squares of color 5, and identify the largest one.\n2.  **Refine Extraction:** Once the largest square is found, its dimensions and position should define the output. The output should be a copy of the identified square.\n\n**Metrics and Results Analysis (Code Execution - already provided)**\n\nThe provided code execution gives us crucial information:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Correct. The largest 3x3 gray square is extracted.\n*   **Example 2:** Correct. The largest 3x3 gray square is extracted.\n*   **Example 3:** Correct. The largest 3x3 gray square is extracted.\n*   **Example 4:** Correct. The largest 2x2 gray square is extracted.\n\nAll train examples are solved correctly.\n\n**YAML Fact Summary**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: |\n  The task involves extracting the largest square subgrid composed entirely of gray (5) pixels from the input grid.\nobservations:\n  - input:\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n        - contains_squares: true\n        - colors: [0, 5]  # other colors may exist but are irrelevant\n  - output:\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n        - shape: square\n        - color: 5 # All pixels are gray\n  - transformation:\n      type: extraction\n      details:\n        - find_all_squares:\n            color: 5\n        - select_largest_square: true\n        - output_is_copy: true\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find all squares:** Scan the input grid to locate all square subgrids consisting entirely of gray (5) pixels.\n2.  **Determine the largest square:** Among all identified gray squares, determine the one with the largest side length.\n3.  **Extract the largest square:** Create the output grid by copying the contents of the largest gray square from the input grid. The location doesn't change.\n\nThis natural language program captures the essence of the transformation and provides a solid basis for the subsequent coding phase. It directly addresses the observed behavior in the training examples.\n"
