Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Color:** The key color is orange (represented by the value 7).

2.  **Locate the central cluster** Find every instance of a horizontal or vertically contiguous key color cluster and compute the x,y of the center of this cluster. Note, a "cluster" can be a single pixel, or any number of pixels, and there can be one or many clusters in the input.

3.  **Extract 3x3 Output** Select a square region from the input, centered at the center of one of the key clusters.

4. **Return the selection**: Return the selection as the output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
