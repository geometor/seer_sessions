## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x74AF1CB82C50>

**output:**
```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x74AF1C73AA50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (4x4 in this example). The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid, as the spatial arrangement of colors changes, but the set of colors present remains the same. Specifically, it appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [1, 2, 6, 7] # Colors present (blue, red, magenta, orange)

actions:
  - type: rotation
    properties:
      direction: clockwise
      degrees: 90

relationships:
  - type: element-wise_correspondence
    description: Each pixel in the input grid maps to a corresponding pixel in the output grid after rotation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. This means that the top-left element of the input becomes the top-right element of the output, and the bottom row of the input becomes the leftmost column of the output. In summary, the rows of the input matrix become the columns of the output matrix in the reversed order.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
