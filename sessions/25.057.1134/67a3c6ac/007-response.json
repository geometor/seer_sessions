The transformation appears to be a mirroring or reflection of the grid, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The colors seem to be preserved, and the relative positions of pixels are changed in a specific, symmetrical way. It looks like the transformation might be a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
