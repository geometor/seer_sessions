The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation or reflection, as the spatial arrangement of the numbers changes, but the set of numbers remains the same, suggesting colors are preserved. It's not a simple 90 or 180-degree rotation. It resembles more a reflection, potentially combined with some other operation or a complex rotation on a non-standard axis.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The combination of these steps appears to match the observed input/output.\n\nAlternative interpretation, which ends up with the same result:\n\n1.  **Mirror Image:** Take the mirror image across the main diagonal (\\).\n"
