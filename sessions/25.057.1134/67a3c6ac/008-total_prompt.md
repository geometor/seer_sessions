## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 7 7 6 6 6 2
6 7 1 1 7 7 1
7 7 2 1 2 6 6
2 2 7 7 7 2 2
7 2 7 1 2 7 2
6 6 6 2 2 1 1
6 2 6 6 6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x74AF1CB82C50>

**output:**
```
2 6 6 6 7 7 7
1 7 7 1 1 7 6
6 6 2 1 2 7 7
2 2 7 7 7 2 2
2 7 2 1 7 2 7
1 1 2 2 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6 2 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The transformation appears to be a mirroring or reflection of the grid, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The colors seem to be preserved, and the relative positions of pixels are changed in a specific, symmetrical way. It looks like the transformation might be a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
    dimensions: 7x7
    colors: [1, 2, 6, 7] #blue, red, magenta, orange
  - type: transformation
    description: The transformation preserves colors.
    details: "Pixels maintain their original color after transformation."
  - type: reflection
    description: The output appears to be a reflection of the input.
    axis: "Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)."
    details: "Pixel at (r, c) in input moves to (c, r) in output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is a reflection of the grid across the main diagonal.  This means that for every pixel in the input grid at row `r` and column `c`, its new position in the output grid will be at row `c` and column `r`. The color of the pixel remains unchanged during the transformation.

Essentially, we are transposing the input grid to generate the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
