The input and output grids have the same dimensions (4x4 in this example). The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid, as the spatial arrangement of colors changes, but the set of colors present remains the same. Specifically, it appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In summary, the rows of the input matrix become the columns of the output matrix in the reversed order.\n"
