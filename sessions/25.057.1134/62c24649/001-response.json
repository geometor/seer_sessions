The input grid appears to be \"expanded\" or \"inflated\" in the output. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are maintained in the output grid, but their positions and the overall grid dimensions change. The specific transformation seems to involve creating a border of the edge colors and duplicating the inner pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Copy the values of the outer edges of the input grid to create a border on the outside of the output grid.\n\n2.  **Center Expansion**: For each pixel *not* on the edge of the *input* grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels with the same color in the *output* grid. Each of original pixel maps to a 2 x 2 square of the same color. The mapping occurs at index * 2 of the original. That is, an input pixel at `(i,j)` maps to the top-left corner of its expansion at output index `(i*2, j*2)`.\n\nIn other words. The output image doubles the input and adds a border.\n"
