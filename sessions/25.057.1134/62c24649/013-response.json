The input grid seems to be embedded within the center of the output grid, and then mirrored outwards both horizontally and vertically. The colors (represented by numbers) in the original input grid are preserved in the output. The output grid essentially creates a symmetrical pattern based on the input grid. The outside border appears to be a reflection of the inside.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, the 3x3 input is placed within a 6x6 output grid, meaning the top-left corner of input is moved to output\\[0,0].\n2.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Duplicate the input grid to the right in output\\[0:3, 3:6], and make them mirrored by column, swap col 0 with col 2.\n3.  **Mirror Vertically:** Duplicate the existing rows, input\\[0:3, 0:6], mirror them by row, to create output rows at output\\[3:6, 0:6].\n4. The result is the mirrored image of the input.\n\n"
