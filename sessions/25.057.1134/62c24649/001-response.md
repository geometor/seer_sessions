Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be "expanded" or "inflated" in the output. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are maintained in the output grid, but their positions and the overall grid dimensions change. The specific transformation seems to involve creating a border of the edge colors and duplicating the inner pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    relations:
      - contains: input_pixels
  - object: input_pixels
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: int (0-9)
      - position: (row, col)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    relations:
      - contains: output_pixels
  - object: output_pixels
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: int (0-9)
      - position: (row, col)
  - action: expansion
    description: The input grid is expanded to create the output grid.
    details:
      - border_creation: a one pixel border is added by taking the value from input edge.
      - center_duplication: center input pixels are duplicated in a 2x2 formation.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Border Creation**: Create a new, empty grid that is twice the size of the original input grid (if input is NxN, output is 2Nx2N). Copy the values of the outer edges of the input grid to create a border on the outside of the output grid.

2.  **Center Expansion**: For each pixel *not* on the edge of the *input* grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels with the same color in the *output* grid. Each of original pixel maps to a 2 x 2 square of the same color. The mapping occurs at index * 2 of the original. That is, an input pixel at `(i,j)` maps to the top-left corner of its expansion at output index `(i*2, j*2)`.

In other words. The output image doubles the input and adds a border.
