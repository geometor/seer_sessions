Previous Code:
```python
"""
Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Then create a 'cross' shape by mirroring
the scaled grid horizontally and vertically.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Scale the input grid
    scaled_grid = np.repeat(np.repeat(input_grid, 2, axis=0), 2, axis=1)
    
    # Create horizontal mirror
    horizontal_mirror = np.fliplr(scaled_grid)
    
    # Concatenate scaled grid and its horizontal mirror
    top_row = np.concatenate((scaled_grid, horizontal_mirror), axis=1)

    # Create vertical mirror
    vertical_mirror = np.flipud(scaled_grid)

    # Create bottom of cross using vertical mirror of top
    vertical_mirror_hm = np.fliplr(vertical_mirror)
    bottom_row = np.concatenate((vertical_mirror, vertical_mirror_hm), axis=1)

    # Concatenate top and bottom rows to create the final output
    output_grid = np.concatenate((top_row, bottom_row), axis=0)

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
