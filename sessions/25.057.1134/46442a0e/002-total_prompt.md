## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 6
6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x74AF1CC2F6D0>

**output:**
```
8 6 6 8
6 8 8 6
6 8 8 6
8 6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x74AF1CC2F0D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 2x2 grid into a larger 4x4 grid. The input grid consists of four cells, each with a single digit number (either 6 or 8) and a specific background color (either azure or magenta). The output grid appears to be a tiled version of the input, with a specific arrangement of the input cells. The colors and numbers in the output grid directly correspond to the input grid. The size relationship between the input (2x2) and the output (4x4) suggests a doubling or replication in both dimensions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      cells:
        properties:
          value: integer (6 or 8)
          color: string (azure or magenta)
    instances:
      input_grid:
        dimensions: [2, 2]
        cells: [[8, 6], [6, 8]] #top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
      output_grid:
        dimensions: [4, 4]
        cells: [[8, 6, 6, 8], [6, 8, 8, 6], [6, 8, 8, 6], [8, 6, 6, 8]]

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: Duplicate the input grid in both dimensions.
  - name: arrange
    description: arrange the input cells in a 2x2 mirrored configuration

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a 2x2 tiling of a mirrored version of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Mirror Input**:  Create a mirrored version of the 2x2 input grid. Horizontally flip to make a new 2x2 grid.
2. **Combine**: treat the input grid and the mirrored version as tiles
3. **Tile**: create a 2x2 grid using the input in the top-left and bottom-right. Use the flipped tile in the top-right and bottom-left.

Essentially, the output grid is formed by replicating the input grid, mirroring it, and combining them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
