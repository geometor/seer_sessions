            # Create a 2x2 block in the output grid with the same color

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a simple 2x2 scaling, where each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output. This approach works for some, but not all, of the examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally a 2x2 scaling. Some examples might involve different scaling factors, or more complex transformations.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the input pixels map to the output pixels.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Determine where the current 2x2 scaling rule fails to accurately describe the transformation. Look for patterns in how the scaling is applied and if any other factors, or changes, apply.
3.  **Quantify Observations:** Use code execution (where permitted) to calculate precise scaling factors or other relevant metrics. For instance, I'll compare input and output grid dimensions.
4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the discrepancies and quantified observations, I will modify the natural language program to encompass the observed transformation rules. The updated program should be more general and capable of handling all training examples.
5. **Focus on factors, not just scaling**: I will keep an open mind about additional changes that may be happening in the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations**

To help with organization and review, for each example, I will capture these metrics:

*   **Input Dimensions:** (rows, cols) of the input grid.
*   **Output Dimensions:** (rows, cols) of the output grid.
*   **Horizontal Scaling Factor:** Output cols / Input cols.
*   **Vertical Scaling Factor:** Output rows / Input rows.
*   **Success:** Whether the current code correctly transforms the input to the output.

Here is the gathering of those metrics, presented as a table, and accompanied by more specific, qualitative, observations when useful:

| Example | Input Dims | Output Dims | H. Scale | V. Scale | Success | Observations                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is:

"Scale up the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block of pixels of the same color in the output grid."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
