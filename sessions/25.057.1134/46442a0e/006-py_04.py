"""
The transformation rule involves replicating the input grid to create an output grid. The output grid's dimensions are exactly double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width. The input grid is tiled directly without any mirroring or rotation. All colors and relative positions of pixels within the input are preserved in the output.
