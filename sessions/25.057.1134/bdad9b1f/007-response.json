The input grid contains two distinct colored objects: an azure (8) object in the top left and a red (2) object in the middle right. The output grid introduces changes: the azure object appears to have expanded downwards, and the red object has expanded to the left and right, with a new yellow (4) pixel appearing in the center of the expanded red object. The background remains white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
