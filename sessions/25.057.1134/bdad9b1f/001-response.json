The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6x6 in this case). There are distinct colored regions (objects) in both input and output. The transformation seems to involve extending existing objects and potentially creating new ones based on spatial relationships.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this case, the vertical azure (8) object.\n3. **Horizontal Extension**: Extend the identified horizontal object, if any, to the right.\n4. **Meeting Point:** The extending stops when it encounters an object.\n5. **New Object Creation:** When extension stops, a yellow (4) is created on the extended object's last position\n6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with the default value of 0 (white).\n"
