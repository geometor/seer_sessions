Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Azure Object:** If an azure (8) object exists (initially a vertical line), extend it downwards. The extension stops at the bottom of the grid OR until one row before a red object. If no red object is present, extend to the bottom.

2.  **Red Object:** If a red (2) object exists (initially a horizontal line), find its original leftmost x coordinate. Replace the leftmost red pixel with a yellow (4) pixel.

3.  **Red Object Expansion (Conditional):** Then, extend the red object to the left and right edges of the grid *on the same row*.

4. **Handle Missing Objects**: Ensure that the transformation handles cases where either the azure or red object (or both) are not present in the input.

5.  **Background:** All other pixels remain white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
