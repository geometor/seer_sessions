Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous colored regions (objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Unchanged Objects:** Copy any objects from input that do not interact with other to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and colors. In this case, the vertical azure (8) object.
3. **Horizontal Extension**: Extend the identified horizontal object, if any, to the right.
4. **Meeting Point:** The extending stops when it encounters an object.
5. **New Object Creation:** When extension stops, a yellow (4) is created on the extended object's last position
6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with the default value of 0 (white).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the first pass of the `transform` function and refine our natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs reasonably well on the first example, capturing the horizontal extension and the addition of the yellow (4) pixel upon encountering another object. However, the subsequent examples reveal limitations:

1.  **Multiple Horizontal Objects**: The current logic only extends *one* horizontal object. We need to handle multiple horizontal objects independently.
2. **Object Color**: Object that is extended could be of multiple colors.

The strategy will be to:

1.  Refine the object identification to correctly categorize multiple horizontal objects of potentially different colors.
2.  Iterate through *each* identified horizontal object and apply the extension logic.
3. ensure extension logic works correctly for objects of any color.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

To understand the specifics, let's use `code_execution` to get detailed reports on each example. I'll focus on properties of objects, their interactions, and how the output differs from the expected output.

```tool_code
def grid_to_string(grid):
    return '\n'.join(''.join(str(cell) for cell in row) for row in grid)

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Different Shapes"
    diff = grid1 != grid2
    if not np.any(diff):
        return "Identical"
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    diff_str = ""
    for r, c in zip(*diff_indices):
        diff_str += f"Row: {r}, Col: {c}, Expected: {grid2[r, c]}, Got: {grid1[r, c]}\n"
    return diff_str

examples = task_data['train']
reports = []
for i, example in enumerate(examples):
  input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
  expected_output = np.array(example['output'])
  actual_output = transform(input_grid)
  comparison = compare_grids(actual_output, expected_output)
  reports.append(
      f"""
Example {i + 1}:
Input:
{grid_to_string(input_grid)}
Expected Output:
{grid_to_string(expected_output)}
Actual Output:
{grid_to_string(actual_output)}
Comparison:
{comparison}
"""
    )
print("\n---\n".join(reports))
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
