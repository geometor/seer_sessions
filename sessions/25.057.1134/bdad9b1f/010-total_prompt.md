Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Azure Object Extension:** The azure (8) object, initially a vertical line of two pixels, extends downwards. The final length of the azure object occupies available space.

2.  **Red Object Expansion and Modification:** The red (2) object, initially a horizontal line of two pixels, expands. A single yellow (4) pixel is inserted into the center of the red object. The red object is then extended to the left and right edges of the grid.

3.  **Background:** Pixels that are not part of the azure or red objects remain white/background (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program captured some key aspects of the transformation, specifically the extension of the azure object and the expansion of the red object. However, the code has a few issues and misses:

1.  **Yellow Pixel Placement:** The yellow pixel placement logic is too simplistic. It always places the yellow pixel at `cols // 2`, which is only correct if the red object is centered. It doesn't correctly identify the center of the _original_ red object. Also, the yellow pixel is overwriting the correct placement of the extended red object
2.  **Red object expansion direction:** the program assumes the expansion is always on the first row where the red object is, when this is not always the case.
3. **Azure object extension** some examples show the azure object doesn't extend to the full height
4. **Red object may not be present** in the input

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Yellow Pixel Logic:** We need to determine the center of the original red object based on its initial coordinates, *before* expansion.
2.  **Refine the red object expansion:** Determine the precise row of expansion.
3. **Refine azure object:** determine how far down the azure object should expand.
4. **Handle cases without red or azure**: guard against errors when the colors do not exist

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To better understand the patterns, let's use a more structured approach by examining object properties before and after the transformation. I'll focus on positions, sizes, and how they change, providing key information in my report.

**YAML Facts and Observations:**

```yaml
example_0:
  input:
    azure_object: { exists: true, type: vertical_line, initial_y: [0,1], initial_x: 5, initial_height: 2, final_height: 10 }
    red_object: { exists: true, type: horizontal_line, initial_y: 4, initial_x: [3, 4], initial_width: 2, final_width: 11 }
    yellow_object: {exists: true, initial_y: null, initial_x: null, final_y: 4, final_x: 5 }
  output:
    azure_object: { final_y: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], final_x: 5 }
    red_object: { final_y: 4, final_x: [0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10] }
    yellow_object: { final_y: 4, final_x: 5}
example_1:
  input:
    azure_object: { exists: true, type: vertical_line, initial_y: [0,1], initial_x: 7, initial_height: 2, final_height: 5 }
    red_object: { exists: true, type: horizontal_line, initial_y: 2, initial_x: [8,9], initial_width: 2, final_width: 20 }
    yellow_object: { exists: true, initial_y: null, initial_x: null, final_y: 2, final_x: 8}
  output:
    azure_object: { final_y: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], final_x: 7 }
    red_object: { final_y: 2, final_x: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19] }
    yellow_object: {final_y: 2, final_x: 8}
example_2:
  input:
    azure_object: { exists: true, type: vertical_line, initial_y: [0,1], initial_x: 2, initial_height: 2, final_height: 6 }
    red_object: { exists: false }
    yellow_object: { exists: false}
  output:
      azure_object: { final_y: [0,1,2,3,4,5], final_x: 2 }
example_3:
    input:
      azure_object: { exists: false}
      red_object: {exists: true, type: horizontal_line, initial_y: 8, initial_x: [1,2], initial_width: 2, final_width: 5}
      yellow_object: {exists: true, initial_y: null, initial_x: null, final_y: 8, final_x: 1}
    output:
      red_object: {final_y: 8, final_x: [0, 2, 3, 4]}
      yellow_object: {final_y: 8, final_x: 1}
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Azure Object:** If an azure (8) object exists (initially a vertical line), extend it downwards. The extension stops at the bottom of the grid OR until one row before a red object. If no red object is present, extend to the bottom.

2.  **Red Object:** If a red (2) object exists (initially a horizontal line), find its original leftmost x coordinate. Replace the leftmost red pixel with a yellow (4) pixel.

3.  **Red Object Expansion (Conditional):** Then, extend the red object to the left and right edges of the grid *on the same row*.

4. **Handle Missing Objects**: Ensure that the transformation handles cases where either the azure or red object (or both) are not present in the input.

5.  **Background:** All other pixels remain white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
