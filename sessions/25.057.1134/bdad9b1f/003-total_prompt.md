Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous colored regions (objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Unchanged Objects:** Copy any objects from input that do not interact with other to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and colors. In this case, the vertical azure (8) object.
3. **Horizontal Extension**: Extend the identified horizontal object, if any, to the right.
4. **Meeting Point:** The extending stops when it encounters an object.
5. **New Object Creation:** When extension stops, a yellow (4) is created on the extended object's last position
6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with the default value of 0 (white).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
