            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the second provided input-output example, building upon the previous analysis and refining the understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example further reinforces the hypothesis of color substitution based on adjacency, specifically involving azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. The previous natural language program and Python code are good starting points, but it's clear that the rule for placing the blue pixel needs adjustment. The initial code incorrectly placed blue pixels *next* to azure pixels, whereas the correct behavior involves *replacing* certain azure pixels with blue ones.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection):**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains three distinct azure (8) colored objects.\n    *   Object 1: A 2x2 square on the top right.\n    *   Object 2: A 2x1 vertical rectangle on the mid-left.\n    *   Object 3: A 2x2 L shape on the bottom right.\n*   **Output:**  Azure objects are retained in terms of general shape, but some azure pixels *within* the objects are replaced by blue (1) pixels. The placement of the blue pixels seems to depend on the adjacent pixels *within* each azure object and empty spaces.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This is crucial for matching the observed output.\n*   **Within Object Context:**  The adjacency check (right and below) must be performed *within the context of the identified azure objects*. This ensures that only azure pixels that are part of defined objects are considered for replacement. This prevents accidental modification of pixels outside the intended objects.\n*   Removed Edge conditions since we are only considering pixels inside the objects.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nThe python code in the next step needs to have the transform function adjusted. The find_objects should be appropriate.\n"
