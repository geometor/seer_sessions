Okay, here's my assessment of the provided input-output example, along with a plan to decipher the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The input and output grids are both 3x3. The input grid consists of the numbers 3, 1, and 2 (blue, white, and red respectively), arranged in a repeating horizontal pattern. The output grid mirrors this structure but with values 4, 5, and 6 (yellow, gray, and magenta). This strongly suggests a simple numerical mapping or increment operation. The strategy will be to first, confirm the dimensions and then to analyze the relationship between corresponding cell values in the input and output.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use python to load the grids and confirm their properties:



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [3, 1, 2],
    [3, 1, 2],
    [3, 1, 2]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [4, 5, 6],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [4, 5, 6]
])

print(f"Input grid shape: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"Output grid shape: {output_grid.shape}")
print(f"Input grid values: {np.unique(input_grid)}")
print(f"Output grid values: {np.unique(output_grid)}")

# Check the difference between corresponding cells
diff = output_grid - input_grid
print(f'{diff=}')
print(f'{np.unique(diff)=}')

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```
Input grid shape: (3, 3)
Output grid shape: (3, 3)
Input grid values: [1 2 3]
Output grid values: [4 5 6]
diff=array([[1, 4, 4],
       [1, 4, 4],
       [1, 4, 4]])
np.unique(diff)=array([1, 4])

```
**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
input:
  shape: 3x3
  values: [3, 1, 2] # blue, white, red
  pattern: horizontal repetition
output:
  shape: 3x3
  values: [4, 5, 6] # yellow, gray, magenta
  pattern: horizontal repetition
transformation:
  type: element-wise addition
  details:
      - input value 3 maps to 4:  add 1
      - input value 1 maps to 5:  add 4
      - input value 2 maps to 6:  add 4
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule involves adding to each cell a number. The number to be added depends on the original number on the cell. Add 1 to cells with 3, 4 to cells with 1 and cells with 2. The spatial arrangement of pixels remains constant; only their values are modified based on the described mapping.

    # Apply the transformation: Add 1 to cells that are 3(green).

    # Apply the transformation: Add 4 to cells that are 1(blue).
    output_grid[input_grid == 1] += 4

    output_grid[input_grid == 2] += 4

    return output_grid

Okay, here's my assessment of the second provided input-output example, along with a plan to decipher the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The input and output grids are both 3x3. The input grid consists of the numbers 2, 3, and 8 (red, green and azure), arranged in a repeating horizontal pattern. The output grid mirrors this structure but with values 6, 4, and 9 (magenta, yellow and maroon). This, like the previous example, suggests a numerical mapping or increment operation, but the specific mapping is different.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use python to load the grids and confirm their properties:



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [2, 3, 8],
    [2, 3, 8],
    [2, 3, 8]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [6, 4, 9],
    [6, 4, 9],
    [6, 4, 9]
])

print(f"Input grid shape: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"Output grid shape: {output_grid.shape}")
print(f"Input grid values: {np.unique(input_grid)}")
print(f"Output grid values: {np.unique(output_grid)}")

# Check the difference between corresponding cells
diff = output_grid - input_grid
print(f'{diff=}')
print(f'{np.unique(diff)=}')

```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```
Input grid shape: (3, 3)
Output grid shape: (3, 3)
Input grid values: [2 3 8]
Output grid values: [4 6 9]
diff=array([[4, 1, 1],
       [4, 1, 1],
       [4, 1, 1]])
np.unique(diff)=array([1, 4])

```

The transformation rule involves adding to each cell a number. The number to be added depends on the original number on the cell. Add 4 to cells with 2, and 1 to cells with 3 or 8. The spatial arrangement of pixels remains constant; only their values are modified based on the described mapping.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
