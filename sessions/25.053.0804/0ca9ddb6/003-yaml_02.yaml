transformations:
  - copy azure pixel:
      - the azure pixel is copied to the same location

  - create yellow pixels:
      - description: "Yellow pixels are created based on the position of the red pixels."
      - relative_positions: "One row above and one column to the left and right.  And, one row below, one column to the left and right"
      - for_each: red pixel

  - create orange pixels:
      - description: "Orange pixels are created based on the position of the blue pixels."
      - relative_positions: "One row above, same column; Same row, one column left and right, one row below, same column"
      - for_each: blue pixel
