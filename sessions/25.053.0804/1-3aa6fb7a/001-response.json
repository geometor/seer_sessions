Specifically, some azure (8) pixels are changing, and the color blue(1) appears near the azure pixels. It seems to be an object-based task, with the azure regions being the primary objects of interest. My strategy is to precisely identify the azure objects, analyze their shapes and relative positions, and then determine the rule that dictates when a blue(1) is placed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection):**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains two distinct azure (8) colored objects.\n    *   Object 1: A 2x1 vertical rectangle on the left side.\n    *   Object 2: A 2x2 square on the right side.\n*   **Output:** The azure objects are retained, but some pixels change color. It looks like a blue pixel(1) is appearing inside the azure object based on some conditions, which seem to be related to adjacent neighbors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
