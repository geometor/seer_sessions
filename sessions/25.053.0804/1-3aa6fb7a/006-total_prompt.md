Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and focused on replacing azure pixels adjacent to empty space with blue pixels. It appears the logic is too restrictive and only considers immediate adjacency, also it must be bordered by an empty space AND another azure. It needs to be more general to capture the pattern across all examples. The errors highlight that simply checking for adjacent empty space AND adjacent azure is insufficient. We need to identify connected azure regions and, within those regions, identify which azure pixels border empty space.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** First, we must be able to find connected regions of azure pixels. This suggests a connected component analysis or flood fill approach would be appropriate.
2.  **Border Detection:** For each azure object, check the perimeter for adjacent empty (white) pixels.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If an azure pixel is part of an azure object AND borders an empty pixel, it *might* be replaced with a blue pixel, based on what we see in example 2, we can determine if there is a more complex rule or edge cases that we have to handle.

**Example Analysis & Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the proposed YAML and natural language program updates:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with two azure objects.
*   **Expected Output:** Two azure pixels changed to blue.
*   **Transformed Output:** No changes.
*   **Issues:** The code doesn't change any azure pixels to blue.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with three azure objects.
*   **Expected Output:** Three azure pixels changed to blue.
*   **Transformed Output:** No changes.
*   **Issues:** The code doesn't change any azure pixels to blue.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: azure (8)
    type: connected_region
    locations:
      - [1, 1]
      - [2, 1]
      - [2, 2]
    border_pixels: #Pixels on border next to 0
        - [1,1]
        - [2,2]

  - id: 2
    color: azure (8)
    type: connected_region
    locations:
        - [3, 4]
        - [3, 5]
        - [4, 5]
    border_pixels:
        - [3,4]
        - [4,5]

  - id: 3
    color: azure(8)
    type: connected_region
    locations:
        - [0,4]
        - [0,5]
        - [1,5]
    border_pixels:
      - [0,4]
      - [1,5]

  - id: 4
     color: azure(8)
     type: connected_region
     locations:
        - [2,2]
        - [3,2]
        - [3,3]
     border_pixels:
        - [2,2]
        - [3,3]

  - id: 5
    color: azure(8)
    type: connected_region
    locations:
        - [5,4]
        - [6,4]
        - [6,5]
    border_pixels:
      - [5,4]
      - [6,5]
actions:
  - type: color_change
    input_color: azure (8)
    output_color: blue (1)
    condition: "azure pixel is part of a connected azure region AND borders an empty (0) pixel, on the edge of the azure object"
    apply_to:
      - example_1: [[1, 2], [4, 4]] #indices where a pixel is changed to blue
      - example_2: [[1,4], [2,3], [5,3]]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Connected Azure Regions:** Find all connected regions (objects) where pixels are azure (8) and are adjacent (up, down, left, or right).
2. **Identify edge pixels** For each connected region of azure pixels, identify the set of edge pixels. An edge pixel has a neighboring pixel that is empty (value 0).
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of identified edge pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
