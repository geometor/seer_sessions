            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies azure (8) objects and attempts to change adjacent pixels to blue (1). However, it incorrectly extends blue pixels in *all* adjacent directions where there are empty spaces (0), rather than only in the direction of the immediately adjacent empty space that connects the azure pixels. The code also extends the blue coloring onto empty space, rather than only overwritting the azure.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Adjacency Rule:** The core issue is the overly broad application of the adjacency rule. We need to restrict the blue color change. Blue should only overwrite azure.\n\n2.  **Object Interaction:** It appears the transformation only works on connected azure objects, so we should remove any identification of non-connected objects.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a more precise description of the errors:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Two separate azure objects.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels added only to the edge of the object\n        where adjacent to the azure.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Blue fills the entire space, plus extends blue beyond\n        where the azure was.\n    *   **Errors:**\n        *   Incorrectly added blue to to areas that were not azure.\n        *   Blue color was drawn for more than one pixel when it shouldn't have.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Three azure objects.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels added to connect the azure objects,\n        replacing some of the azure\n    *   **Actual Output:** Blue fills the entire space, plus extends blue beyond\n        where the azure was.\n    *   **Errors:**\n        *   Incorrectly added blue to to areas that were not azure.\n        *   Blue color was drawn for more than one pixel when it shouldn't have.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: azure (8)\n    shape: irregular\n    transformation:\n      rule: \"replace with blue(1) based on adjacency to empty cells\"\n      details:\n        - \"if azure pixels are adjacent to empty pixels (0) and to each other, replace with blue(1)\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate contiguous regions of azure (8) colored pixels.\n\n2.  **Conditional Fill:** If azure shapes are connected, replace some of the\n    azure with blue (1).\n"
