**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation process operates on connected regions of color 8. For each such region:

1. **Identify the Target Cell:** Locate the cell within the region that is the bottom-most (largest row index). If there are multiple cells with the same largest row index, select the one that is right-most (largest column index).

2. **Check and Modify Cell Above:** Examine the cell immediately above the target cell.
   - **Condition:** If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is currently color 0 (white).
   - **Action:** Change the color of this cell to 1 (blue).
   - **Stop:** If the color is changed in this step, no further modifications are made for this region.

3. **Check and Modify Cell to the Left (if step 2 was skipped):** If the cell above was not modified (either the condition in step 2 was not met, or there was no cell above), then examine the cell immediately to the left of the target cell.
   - **Condition:** If this cell is within the grid boundaries and is currently color 0 (white).
   - **Action:** Change the color of this cell to 1 (blue).

4. **No Modification:** If neither the cell above nor the cell to the left is modified, then no changes are made for this particular region of color 8.

This process is applied independently to each connected region of color 8 present in the input grid.
