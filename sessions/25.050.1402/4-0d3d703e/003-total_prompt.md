**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, apply the following color transformations:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell in the input grid.
2. **Apply the transformation rule:**
   - If the color value is 3 (green), change it to 4 (yellow).
   - If the color value is 1 (blue), change it to 5 (gray).
   - If the color value is 2 (red), change it to 6 (magenta).
3. **Place the transformed color value** in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
4. **Repeat steps 1-3** for all cells in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

In essence, this task involves a direct color-to-color substitution based on a fixed mapping rule applied uniformly across the entire grid. Each instance of a specific color in the input is consistently replaced with another specific color in the output.
```python
"""
This program transforms the input grid to the output grid by applying the following color mapping:
- Color 3 (green) in the input grid is changed to color 4 (yellow) in the output grid.
- Color 1 (blue) in the input grid is changed to color 5 (gray) in the output grid.
- Color 2 (red) in the input grid is changed to color 6 (magenta) in the output grid.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
