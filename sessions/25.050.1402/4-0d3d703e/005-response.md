**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, apply the following color transformations based on its current color value:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell in the input grid.
2. **Apply the transformation rule:**
   - If the color value is 5 (gray), change it to 1 (blue).
   - If the color value is 8 (azure), change it to 9 (maroon).
   - If the color value is 6 (magenta), change it to 2 (red).
3. **Place the transformed color value** in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
4. **Repeat steps 1-3** for all cells in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

In simpler terms, this task involves a direct substitution of colors. Every instance of a specific color in the input grid is replaced by a new, predetermined color in the output grid. This substitution is consistent across the entire grid, meaning the same color in the input will always transform into the same color in the output, irrespective of its position.
