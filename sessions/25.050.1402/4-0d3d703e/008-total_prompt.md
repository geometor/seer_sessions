**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, apply the following color transformations:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell in the input grid.
2. **Apply the transformation rule:**
   - If the color value is 3 (green), change it to 4 (yellow).
   - If the color value is 1 (blue), change it to 5 (gray).
   - If the color value is 2 (red), change it to 6 (magenta).
3. **Place the transformed color value** in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
4. **Repeat steps 1-3** for all cells in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

In essence, this task involves a direct color-to-color substitution based on a fixed mapping rule applied uniformly across the entire grid. Each instance of a specific color in the input is consistently replaced with another specific color in the output.
```python

- Color 2 (red) in the input grid is changed to color 6 (magenta) in the output grid.

For each cell in the input grid, perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell.
2. **Apply a color substitution rule:**
   - If the color value is 2 (red), replace it with 6 (magenta).
   - If the color value is 3 (green), replace it with 4 (yellow).

3. **Place the new color value** in the same cell position in the output grid.
4. **Repeat** steps 1-3 for every cell in the input grid to generate the complete output grid.

This transformation is a direct color replacement. Each color present in the input grid is consistently mapped to a new color in the output grid, regardless of its position or context within the grid.

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

For each cell in the input grid, apply the following color transformations based on its current color value:

1. **Identify the color value** of the cell in the input grid.
2. **Apply the transformation rule:**
   - If the color value is 5 (gray), change it to 1 (blue).
   - If the color value is 8 (azure), change it to 9 (maroon).
   - If the color value is 6 (magenta), change it to 2 (red).
3. **Place the transformed color value** in the corresponding cell of the output grid.

In simpler terms, this task involves a direct substitution of colors. Every instance of a specific color in the input grid is replaced by a new, predetermined color in the output grid. This substitution is consistent across the entire grid, meaning the same color in the input will always transform into the same color in the output, irrespective of its position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
