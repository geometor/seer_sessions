            "text": "**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule operates on each column of the grid independently. For each column, the goal is to rearrange the numbers such that all non-zero numbers are moved to the bottom of the column, while the top positions are filled with zeros. The relative vertical order of the non-zero numbers within each column is maintained.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation:**\n\n1. **Process each column:** Iterate through the input grid column by column, starting from the leftmost column and moving to the right.\n\n2. **Identify non-zero objects in the column:** Within the current column, locate all cells containing non-zero numbers. These are the \"objects\" we are interested in.\n\n3. **Preserve and extract non-zero objects:**  As you scan the column from top to bottom, collect all the non-zero number objects in the order they appear. Imagine you are picking up the non-zero numbers from top to bottom in the column.\n\n4. **Count the non-zero objects:** Determine the total count of non-zero objects you've extracted from the current column. Let's say this count is 'N'.\n\n5. **Reposition non-zero objects at the bottom:** In the output grid's corresponding column, start from the bottom row and fill the bottom 'N' rows with the extracted non-zero objects, maintaining the order in which you collected them.\n\n6. **Fill top positions with zero objects:** For the remaining rows in the output column, above the positioned non-zero objects, fill them with zeros. These become \"zero objects\".\n\n7. **Repeat for all columns:** Continue steps 2-6 for every column in the input grid.\n\nBy applying this process to each column, we effectively \"push\" all the non-zero number objects in each column downwards to the bottom, stacking them up and filling the space above with zero objects. The original vertical order of the non-zero objects within each column is preserved during this transformation."
