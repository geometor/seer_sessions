**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to move all non-zero numbers in each column to the bottom of the column, filling the empty spaces at the top with zeros.  The order of the non-zero numbers within each column is preserved, although in this example each column contains at most one non-zero number.

**Step-by-step transformation:**

1. **Iterate through each column** of the input grid from left to right.
2. **For each column**, identify and extract all the non-zero numbers, maintaining their original order from top to bottom.
3. **Count the number of non-zero numbers** extracted for the current column. Let's call this count 'N'.
4. **In the corresponding column of the output grid**, fill the bottom 'N' rows with the extracted non-zero numbers, in the same order as they were extracted.
5. **Fill the remaining rows at the top** of the output column with zeros.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all columns.

This process effectively "pushes down" all the non-zero numbers in each column to the bottom.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
