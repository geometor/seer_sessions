The order of the non-zero numbers within each column is preserved, although in this example each column contains at most one non-zero number.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation:**\n\n1. **Iterate through each column** of the input grid from left to right.\n2. **For each column**, identify and extract all the non-zero numbers, maintaining their original order from top to bottom.\n3. **Count the number of non-zero numbers** extracted for the current column. Let's call this count 'N'.\n4. **In the corresponding column of the output grid**, fill the bottom 'N' rows with the extracted non-zero numbers, in the same order as they were extracted.\n5. **Fill the remaining rows at the top** of the output column with zeros.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all columns.\n\nThis process effectively \"pushes down\" all the non-zero numbers in each column to the bottom."
