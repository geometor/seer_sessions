In this specific example, overlaps are possible and do occur as seen in the top right area, and the bottom left area.\nThis process is applied to every cell in the input grid that is either red or blue.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col, diagonal=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the neighbors of a cell.\n    If diagonal is True, returns diagonal neighbors.\n    Otherwise, returns orthogonal neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    if diagonal:\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]:\n            if 0 <= row + dr < rows and 0 <= col + dc < cols:\n                neighbors.append((row + dr, col + dc))\n    else:\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            if 0 <= row + dr < rows and 0 <= col + dc < cols:\n                neighbors.append((row + dr, col + dc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is red (2)\n            if input_grid[row, col] == 2:\n                # Place yellow (4) cells at diagonal positions\n                for r, c in get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col, diagonal=True):\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 4\n            # If the cell is blue (1)\n            elif input_grid[row, col] == 1:\n                # Place orange (7) cells at orthogonal positions\n                for r, c in get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col, diagonal=False):\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 7\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
