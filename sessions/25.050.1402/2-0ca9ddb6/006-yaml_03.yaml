task_context: "The task involves modifying a grid by adding colored cells around existing non-zero colored cells based on their original color. Red cells get yellow diagonals, blue cells get orange orthogonals, and there's no rule specified for magenta cells, so they should remain unchanged."
objects:
  - red_cell:
      color: 2
      action: surround with yellow diagonals
  - blue_cell:
      color: 1
      action: surround with orange orthogonals
  - magenta_cell:
      color: 6
      action: none
predicates:
  - is_red: cell color is 2
  - is_blue: cell color is 1
  - is_magenta: cell color is 6
actions:
  - add_yellow_diagonals: place yellow cells at the four diagonal positions of the red cell
  - add_orange_orthogonals: place orange cells at the four orthogonal positions of the blue cell
transformation_rule: "For each red cell in the input grid, place yellow cells at its diagonal positions in the output grid. For each blue cell in the input grid, place orange cells at its orthogonal positions in the output grid. Magenta cells and all other cells remain unchanged, except where overwritten by the placement of new colors."
