Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,1]
          - top_left: [3,4]
    dimensions: [7, 7]
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
        positions:
          - top_left: [1,1]
          - top_left: [3,4]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: two separate 1x1 squares
        positions:
            - top_left: [1, 2]
            - top_left: [4, 5]
    dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two separate objects made of the color 8 (azure). Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle.

2.  **Preserve Existing:** The two azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. Their shapes and positions are the same.

3. **Detect Change**: We observe that a new color has appeared between the columns containing the existing azure color.

4.  **Add new objects:** A blue (color 1) pixel is placed to the immediate right of the rightmost column of the first azure object. Another blue pixel is placed to the immediate left of the leftmost column of the second object.

**Natural Language Summary**

The transformation preserves the two existing azure (8) vertical rectangles. The action performed is to add a new color, blue (1), in the column directly adjacent to the existing azure objects. A blue pixel appears immediately to the right of the top azure rectangle, and another blue pixel appears immediately to the left of the bottom one.
