These are of different shapes.\n\n2.  **Preserve Existing:**  All the azure (8) objects in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. Their shapes and positions remain the same.\n\n3.  **Detect Change:** We observe that the new color blue (1) appears in the output that was not there before.\n\n4. **Add New Object:** For each vertical or horizontal segment of the azure color, add blue (1) in an adjacent column.\n  - If we consider the top azure object starting at \\[0,4]. This object is horizontal so we add blue (1) immediately to its left or to its right. In the output, the blue appears to the left at \\[1,4].\n  - The vertical segment starting at \\[2,2]. Blue is added to its right at \\[2,3]\n  - The vertical segment starting at \\[5,5]. Blue is added to its left \\[5, 4]\n\n**Natural Language Summary**\n\nThe transformation preserves all existing azure (8) objects, adding a blue (1) pixel immediately adjacent to each of them. The new pixel is added either immediately to the left or right depending on the orientation of the existing azure object.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation preserves all existing azure (8) objects.
