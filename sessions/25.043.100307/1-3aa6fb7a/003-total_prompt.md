--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`. I need to describe the changes in a step-by-step natural language program. I will examine the provided input and output grids to determine the objects, their properties, and the actions that transform the input to the output.

Since I do not have the visual representations of the grid objects, I will create a placeholder description and highlight the areas where I need the visual information. I'll assume there *is* a transformation, and make my best guess about what it might be, and later, when presented with more examples, I will refine this.

Here's a potential NLP, assuming a simple transformation:

1.  **Identify the Largest Object:** Find the largest contiguous object in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same color. "Largest" is determined by the number of pixels.
2.  **Change its color:** Change the color of all pixels within this largest object to a specific, pre-determined color. *(Placeholder: Let's assume for now the color changes to blue. I would note the ACTUAL before and after colors here.)*
3. **Preserve other pixels**: All other pixels that are *not* part of the largest object maintain their original color.

**Missing information preventing the actual solution:**
*   **Visual representation of the input grid:**  I need to see the arrangement of colored pixels to determine the objects.
*   **Visual representation of the output grid:** I need to see the result of the transformation to check the logic and specific new color.

Once I have this data I will refine my NLP.

Okay, I'll generate the Python code based on my placeholder NLP. Since I don't have the actual grid data, I'll create a sample input and expected output that *could* fit my current hypothesis (largest object changes to blue). This will allow me to create the code structure, but the assertion will likely fail until I get the real data.

    # Placeholder input and output - these will almost certainly need to be changed
    input_grid = [
        [1, 1, 1, 2],
        [1, 1, 1, 2],

    assert transformed_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
```


The code implements a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find connected components (objects) and identify the largest one.  It then changes the color of the largest object to blue (represented by the number 3). The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block defines a *placeholder* input and expected output for demonstration. This needs to be replaced with real data for the code to be validated.

example_2_input = <geometor.arcprize.puzzles.grid.Grid object at 0x7f87d369c400>

example_2_output = <geometor.arcprize.puzzles.grid.Grid object at 0x7f87cf40e170>
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
