**NLP:**
['Okay, let\'s analyze the transformation from `example_1_input` to `example_1_output`. I need to describe the changes in a step-by-step natural language program. I will examine the provided input and output grids to determine the objects, their properties, and the actions that transform the input to the output.\n\nSince I do not have the visual representations of the grid objects, I will create a placeholder description and highlight the areas where I need the visual information. I\'ll assume there *is* a transformation, and make my best guess about what it might be, and later, when presented with more examples, I will refine this.\n\nHere\'s a potential NLP, assuming a simple transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Largest Object:** Find the largest contiguous object in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same color. "Largest" is determined by the number of pixels.\n2.  **Change its color:** Change the color of all pixels within this largest object to a specific, pre-determined color. *(Placeholder: Let\'s assume for now the color changes to blue. I would note the ACTUAL before and after colors here.)*\n3. **Preserve other pixels**: All other pixels that are *not* part of the largest object maintain their original color.\n\n**Missing information preventing the actual solution:**\n*   **Visual representation of the input grid:**  I need to see the arrangement of colored pixels to determine the objects.\n*   **Visual representation of the output grid:** I need to see the result of the transformation to check the logic and specific new color.\n\nOnce I have this data I will refine my NLP.\n\n']

================================================================================
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
