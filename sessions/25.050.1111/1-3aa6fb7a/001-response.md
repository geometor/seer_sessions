Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two L-shaped structures
      positions:
        - top-left corner of the first 'L': (1,1) # (row, col)
        - top-left corner of the second 'L': (3,4)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      positions:
        - all other cells

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two L-shaped structures (same as input)
      positions:
        - top-left corner of the first 'L': (1,1)
        - top-left corner of the second 'L': (3,4)
      
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cells
      positions:
        - (1,2)
        - (4,5)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      positions:
        - all other cells

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two "L"-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) against a background of color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Change:**
    -   Locate the uppermost and leftmost azure (8) cell of the first L-shaped object.
    -   Locate the uppermost and leftmost cell of the second L-shaped object.
    - The top-left cell is detected by finding the azure cell with the smallest row number. Among cells, the top-left is the one with the smallest column number.

3.  **Apply Transformation:**
    *   Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of the uppermost and leftmost cell of the first L shape to color 1(blue)
    *   Change the color of cell immediately above of the bottom-most azure (8) of the second L shape to color 1(blue)

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation preserves the azure (8) L-shaped objects. It adds blue cells adjacent to specific parts of the azure objects: A blue color 1 cell is placed immediately right of uppermost, leftmost cell of the first azure L, and a blue 1 is placed above the bottom most cell of the second azure L.
