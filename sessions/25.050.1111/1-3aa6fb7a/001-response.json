Among cells, the top-left is the one with the smallest column number.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of the uppermost and leftmost cell of the first L shape to color 1(blue)\n    *   Change the color of cell immediately above of the bottom-most azure (8) of the second L shape to color 1(blue)\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation preserves the azure (8) L-shaped objects. It adds blue cells adjacent to specific parts of the azure objects: A blue color 1 cell is placed immediately right of uppermost, leftmost cell of the first azure L, and a blue 1 is placed above the bottom most cell of the second azure L.\n"
