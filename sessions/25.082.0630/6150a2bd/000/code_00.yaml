facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The numbers in the input grid reappear in the output grid, but in different positions.
  - observation: "0" seems to act like a background/padding
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - relationship: input_grid is transformed to output_grid
  - action: Values are repositioned, possibly through rotation/reflection.
  - hypothesis: The transformation inverts row order
  - hypothesis: The transformation mirrors columns order
