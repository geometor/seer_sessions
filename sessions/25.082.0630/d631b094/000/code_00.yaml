facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3, output grid dimension varies.
  - object: pixels
    properties:
      color: integer value (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - action: extraction
    description: Non-zero pixels are extracted from the input.
  - action: replication
    description: The extracted non-zero pixels define the output grid size and are the color of the output grid's content.
  - relationship: "output_grid_size depends on count of non-zero input pixels."
  - relationship: "output_grid_content equals non-zero pixel color of the input."
