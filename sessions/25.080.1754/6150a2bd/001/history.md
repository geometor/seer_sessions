## train_1

**input:**

**output:**
```

0 7 3
8 3 3

## train_2

**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3 in both examples). The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the elements within the grid. It seems like a rotation or mirroring, with a consistent mapping of values from input to output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - transformation_type: re-arrangement (suspect rotation or reflection)
  - element_properties:
      color: mapped to integer value
      position: (row, column)
  - observations:
      - "The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise and mirrored."
      - in_example1: "3 at (0,0) moves to (2,2); 3 at (0,1) moves to (1,2); 8 at (0,2) moves to (0,2)"
      - in_example1: "3 at (1,0) moves to (2,1); 7 at (1,1) moves to (1,1); 0 at (1,2) moves to (0,1)"
      - in_example1: "5 at (2,0) moves to (2,0); 0 at (2,1) moves to (1,0); 0 at (2,2) moves to (0,0)"
      - in_example2: "5 at (0,0) moves to (2,1); 5 at (0,1) moves to (2,2); 2 at (0,2) moves to (2,0)"
      - in_example2: "1 at (1,0) moves to (1,2); 0 at (1,1) moves to (1,1); 0 at (1,2) moves to (1,0)"
      - in_example2: "0 at (2,0) moves to (0,0); 0 at (2,1) moves to (0,1); 0 at (2,2) moves to (0,2)"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The positions are then mirrored across a vertical axis that cuts through the center of the grid.

1.  **Rotation:** Rotate the entire grid by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
2. **Reflection**: Swap elements in the first and last columns.
