facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - transformation_type: re-arrangement (suspect rotation or reflection)
  - element_properties:
      color: mapped to integer value
      position: (row, column)
  - observations:
      - "The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise and mirrored."
      - in_example1: "3 at (0,0) moves to (2,2); 3 at (0,1) moves to (1,2); 8 at (0,2) moves to (0,2)"
