This is the cell with the minimum row index, and among cells with the same minimum row index, the minimum column index.\n2. Attempt to change the color of the cell immediately to the **right** of this topmost-leftmost cell to color 1, but only if:\n    a. The cell to the right is within the grid boundaries.\n    b. The cell to the right is currently color 0 in the input grid.\n    c. The cell to the right is not part of the same connected region of color 8.\n3. If the change in step 2 is not possible (because condition a, b, or c is not met), then attempt to change the color of the cell immediately **below** the topmost-leftmost cell to color 1, but only if:\n    a. The cell below is within the grid boundaries.\n    b. The cell below is currently color 0 in the input grid.\n    c. The cell below is not part of the same connected region of color 8.\n4. If the change in step 3 is not possible, then attempt to change the color of the cell immediately to the **left** of the topmost-leftmost cell to color 1, but only if:\n    a. The cell to the left is within the grid boundaries.\n    b. The cell to the left is currently color 0 in the input grid.\n    c. The cell to the left is not part of the same connected region of color 8.\n5. If the change in step 4 is not possible, then attempt to change the color of the cell immediately **above** the topmost-leftmost cell to color 1, but only if:\n    a. The cell above is within the grid boundaries.\n    b. The cell above is currently color 0 in the input grid.\n    c. The cell above is not part of the same connected region of color 8.\n6. If none of the above changes are possible, no change is made for this region.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef transform(input):\n    grid = np.array(input)\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    labeled_grid, num_labels = label(grid == 8)\n\n    for label_id in range(1, num_labels + 1):\n        component_indices = np.argwhere(labeled_grid == label_id)\n        min_row = np.min(component_indices[:, 0])\n        topmost_cells = component_indices[component_indices[:, 0] == min_row]\n        topleft_cell_row, topleft_cell_col = topmost_cells[np.argmin(topmost_cells[:, 1])]\n\n        # Try to change cell to the right\n        cell_r_row, cell_r_col = topleft_cell_row, topleft_cell_col + 1\n        if (0 <= cell_r_row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= cell_r_col < grid.shape[1] and\n            grid[cell_r_row, cell_r_col] == 0 and labeled_grid[cell_r_row, cell_r_col] != label_id):\n            output_grid[cell_r_row, cell_r_col] = 1\n            continue\n\n        # Try to change cell below\n        cell_b_row, cell_b_col = topleft_cell_row + 1, topleft_cell_col\n        if (0 <= cell_b_row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= cell_b_col < grid.shape[1] and\n            grid[cell_b_row, cell_b_col] == 0 and labeled_grid[cell_b_row, cell_b_col] != label_id):\n            output_grid[cell_b_row, cell_b_col] = 1\n            continue\n\n        # Try to change cell to the left\n        cell_l_row, cell_l_col = topleft_cell_row, topleft_cell_col - 1\n        if (0 <= cell_l_row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= cell_l_col < grid.shape[1] and\n            grid[cell_l_row, cell_l_col] == 0 and labeled_grid[cell_l_row, cell_l_col] != label_id):\n            output_grid[cell_l_row, cell_l_col] = 1\n            continue\n\n        # Try to change cell above\n        cell_a_row, cell_a_col = topleft_cell_row - 1, topleft_cell_col\n        if (0 <= cell_a_row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= cell_a_col < grid.shape[1] and\n            grid[cell_a_row, cell_a_col] == 0 and labeled_grid[cell_a_row, cell_a_col] != label_id):\n            output_grid[cell_a_row, cell_a_col] = 1\n            continue\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
