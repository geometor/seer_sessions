**Natural Language Description of Transformation:**

For each connected region of color 8 in the input grid:
1. Identify the topmost-leftmost cell of the region. This is the cell with the minimum row index, and among cells with the same minimum row index, the minimum column index.
2. Attempt to change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this topmost-leftmost cell to color 1, but only if:
    a. The cell to the right is within the grid boundaries.
    b. The cell to the right is currently color 0 in the input grid.
    c. The cell to the right is not part of the same connected region of color 8.
3. If the change in step 2 is not possible (because condition a, b, or c is not met), then attempt to change the color of the cell immediately below the topmost-leftmost cell to color 1, but only if:
    a. The cell below is within the grid boundaries.
    b. The cell below is currently color 0 in the input grid.
    c. The cell below is not part of the same connected region of color 8.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label

def transform_grid(input_grid):
    grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.copy(grid)
    labeled_grid, num_labels = label(grid == 8)

    for label_id in range(1, num_labels + 1):
        component_indices = np.argwhere(labeled_grid == label_id)
        min_row = np.min(component_indices[:, 0])
        topmost_cells = component_indices[component_indices[:, 0] == min_row]
        topleft_cell_row, topleft_cell_col = topmost_cells[np.argmin(topmost_cells[:, 1])]

        # Try to change cell to the right
        cell_right_col = topleft_cell_col + 1
        if (0 <= topleft_cell_row < grid.shape[0] and
            0 <= cell_right_col < grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[topleft_cell_row, cell_right_col] == 0 and labeled_grid[topleft_cell_row, cell_right_col] != label_id:
                output_grid[topleft_cell_row, cell_right_col] = 1
                continue # If right cell is changed, move to next component

        # If right cell cannot be changed, try cell below
        cell_below_row = topleft_cell_row + 1
        if (0 <= cell_below_row < grid.shape[0] and
            0 <= topleft_cell_col < grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[cell_below_row, topleft_cell_col] == 0 and labeled_grid[cell_below_row, topleft_cell_col] != label_id:
                output_grid[cell_below_row, topleft_cell_col] = 1
                continue # If below cell is changed, move to next component

    return output_grid.tolist()

# Example usage with input from problem description
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

output_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)
print("Output Grid:")
for row in output_grid:
    print(row)
```
