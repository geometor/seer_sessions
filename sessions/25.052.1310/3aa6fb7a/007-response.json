Two of them are 2x1 vertical rectangles, and one is a 1x2 horizontal rectangle. It could also be described as three azure objects that look like the number \"8\".\n2.  **Preserve Objects:** These three azure objects are preserved in their original locations in the output grid.\n3.  **Add Blue cell, first object:** A blue cell (color 1) is added to the output grid to the left of the top cell of the first vertical azure object.\n4.  **Add Blue cell, second object:** A blue cell (color 1) is added to the output grid to the left of the top cell of the horizontal azure object.\n5.  **Add Blue cell, third object:** A blue cell (color 1) is added to the output grid to the left of the top cell of the second vertical azure object.\n\n**Complete Natural Language Description**\n\nThe transformation rule is: The output preserves the azure colored objects and adds a blue pixel adjacent to each azure object, to the left of its top-left corner. This description is slightly different and more concise compared to the first example, and it should generalize.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe output preserves the azure colored objects and adds a blue pixel adjacent to each azure object, to the left of its top-left corner.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # find azure objects\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # add blue pixels\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        # sort object coordinates to find top-left\n        sorted_obj = sorted(obj, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n        top_left = sorted_obj[0]\n\n        #Add to the left of top left corner\n        if top_left[1] - 1 >= 0:\n            output_grid[top_left[0], top_left[1] - 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
