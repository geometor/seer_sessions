            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples and the partially successful Python code.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation involves identifying azure (color 8) objects in the input grid and adding a blue (color 1) pixel adjacent to each azure object, prioritizing the available directions in this order: Left, Right, Down, Up. Only one blue pixel should added adjacent to the object. The positioning of the blue pixel should be relative to the object.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (color 8) pixels. These are the \"azure objects.\"\n\n2.  **Iterate and Add Blue Pixel:** For each identified \"azure object\":\n    *   Check for an empty (color 0) cell immediately to the **left** of *any* pixel of the azure object. If found, change that cell to blue (color 1) and proceed the next object.\n    *   If no empty cell is found on the left, check for an empty cell to the **right** of *any* pixel of the object. If found, change that cell to blue, and proceed the next object.\n    *   If no empty cell is found on the left or right, check for an empty cell **below** *any* pixel of the object. If found, change that cell to blue, and proceed the next object.\n    *   If no empty cell is found on the left, right, or down, check for an empty cell on **above** *any* pixel of the object. If found, change that cell to blue, and proceed the next object.\n    * If no adjancent cells are found, move to next object.\n\n**Key Predicates and Actions:**\n\n*   **Predicate:** Azure object exists.\n*   **Predicate:** Empty (color 0) cell exists adjacent to the azure object.\n*   **Predicate:** Relative position of the empty cell (left, right, below, or above)\n*   **Action:** Change the color of the empty cell to blue (color 1).\n\n**Corrections and Improvements (compared to previous code)**\n\nThe previous code was adding on incorrect sides.\n\nI have revised the Natural Language program.\n"
