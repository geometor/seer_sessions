            "text": "Okay, I see the issue. My previous code was adding a blue pixel to the *left* of the top-left corner of each azure object. However, based on the expected outputs, the blue pixel should be added above, below, to the left, or the right of the *top-leftmost* pixel of the azure object. It's not always to the left. Looking closer at the examples clarifies the relative position. The blue pixel should be placed to the following locations:\n\n*   **Example 1:** A blue pixel appears to the *right* of the top-leftmost pixel of the *bottom* azure object and to the *left* of the top-leftmost pixel of the *top* azure object.\n*   **Example 2:** A blue pixel is added to the *left* of the top-leftmost pixel of each azure object.\n\nTherefore, my rule hypothesis must combine aspects of the prior and consideration for all example results.\n\nHere's the updated natural language program:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Find Top-Leftmost Pixel:** For each azure object, determine its top-leftmost pixel by sorting the coordinates.\n3.  **Add blue pixel adjacent to the top-leftmost azure pixel:** If the space to the left is available add the blue pixel there. Otherwise check to see if a blue pixel can be added to the right.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe output preserves the azure colored objects and adds a blue pixel (1) adjacent to each azure object. If a spot to the left of the object's top-left pixel is available, add the blue pixel there. Otherwise, if a pixel to the right of the top-left pixel is free, add the pixel there.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # find azure objects\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # add blue pixels\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        # sort object coordinates to find top-left\n        sorted_obj = sorted(obj, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n        top_left = sorted_obj[0]\n\n        # Add to the left of top left corner\n        if top_left[1] - 1 >= 0:\n            output_grid[top_left[0], top_left[1] - 1] = 1\n        # Add to the right of top left corner\n        elif top_left[1] + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n            output_grid[top_left[0], top_left[1] + 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
