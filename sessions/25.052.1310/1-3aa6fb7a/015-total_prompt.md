Okay, I see the issue. My previous code was adding a blue pixel to the *left* of the top-left corner of each azure object. However, based on the expected outputs, the blue pixel should be added above, below, to the left, or the right of the *top-leftmost* pixel of the azure object. It's not always to the left. Looking closer at the examples clarifies the relative position. The blue pixel should be placed to the following locations:

*   **Example 1:** A blue pixel appears to the *right* of the top-leftmost pixel of the *bottom* azure object and to the *left* of the top-leftmost pixel of the *top* azure object.
*   **Example 2:** A blue pixel is added to the *left* of the top-leftmost pixel of each azure object.

Therefore, my rule hypothesis must combine aspects of the prior and consideration for all example results.

Here's the updated natural language program:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Find Top-Leftmost Pixel:** For each azure object, determine its top-leftmost pixel by sorting the coordinates.
3.  **Add blue pixel adjacent to the top-leftmost azure pixel:** If the space to the left is available add the blue pixel there. Otherwise check to see if a blue pixel can be added to the right.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
"""
The output preserves the azure colored objects and adds a blue pixel (1) adjacent to each azure object. If a spot to the left of the object's top-left pixel is available, add the blue pixel there. Otherwise, if a pixel to the right of the top-left pixel is free, add the pixel there.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
