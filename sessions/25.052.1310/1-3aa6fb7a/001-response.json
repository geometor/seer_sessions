Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle.\n2.  **Preserve Objects:** These two azure objects are preserved in their original locations in the output grid.\n3.  **Add Blue cell, first object:** A blue cell (color 1) is added to the output grid, to the right of the top cell of the first azure object.\n4.  **Add Blue cell, second object:** A blue cell (color 1) is added to the output grid, to the left of the bottom cell of the second azure object.\n\n**Complete Natural Language Description**\nThe output preserves the azure colored object and adds a blue pixel adjacent to the azure object, to the right of its top-left corner, and one to the left of the bottom-right one.\n"
