Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n2.  Identify azure (color 8) colored cells.\n3.  For each azure object, locate specific corner or edge cells, and if there is a free space, paint that blue(1).\n     * Top Right Azure Square: If there's an azure square at the top-right, place a blue cell to the immediate left of the bottom-right corner element of the square.\n     *   Vertical Azure Object: If there's a vertical object, add a blue cell to the right of the bottom element of the vertical object.\n    *   Bottom Azure Square: If there's an azure object at the bottom, add a blue pixel to the left of the top right blue cell.\n"
