Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   Both input and output grids are 7x7.
*   The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical object in the second column, and the other is a 2x2 square object near the fifth and sixth columns.
*   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for two cells that have changed from color 0 (white) to color 1 (blue).
* These blue cells are located:
      *  One cell directly to the right of top part of the vertical azure object.
      *  One cell directly to the left of the bottom part of the square azure object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  Identify azure (color 8) colored cells.
3. For each continuous azure object found:
    * If the azure object is vertically oriented, paint color blue (1) on the right of its top.
    * If the azure object has elements on its right diagonal, paint color blue (1) on the left side of its bottom.

**Python Implementation:**

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
