Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   Both input and output grids are 7x7.
*   The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical object in the second column, and the other is a 2x2 square object near the fifth and sixth columns.
*   The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for two cells that have changed from color 0 (white) to color 1 (blue).
* These blue cells are located:
      *  One cell directly to the right of top part of the vertical azure object.
      *  One cell directly to the left of the bottom part of the square azure object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  Identify azure (color 8) colored cells.
3. For each continuous azure object found:
    * If the azure object is vertically oriented, paint color blue (1) on the right of its top.
    * If the azure object has elements on its right diagonal, paint color blue (1) on the left side of its bottom.

**Python Implementation:**

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
