Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles and an isolated cell."

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
      shape: "Same as input."
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
      shape: "Two isolated cells."
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe azure (color 8) colored pixels forming two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles and one isolated pixel.

2.  **Preserve Original Objects**: All of the original azure pixels remain unchanged in their locations and shapes.

3.  **Insert new object**: Find the vertically or horizontally closest pixel in the background (color 0, value = 0) to each of the two 2x1 rectangles. Change the color of each to blue.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation preserves the azure objects and adds a blue (color 1) pixel vertically or horizontally adjacent to each 2x1 azure rectangle. The isolated azure pixel is not changed.
