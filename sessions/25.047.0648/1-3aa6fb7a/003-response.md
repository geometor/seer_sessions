Okay, let's analyze the second example provided, following the same process.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
        positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
    - color: 1
        positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains multiple objects (contiguous regions) of color 8 (azure).

2. **Change color of one azure element:** Check the neighbor to the right. If the neighbor's has a value of 0, we will change color to 1.

**Natural Language Program**

```
For each azure colored cell:
    If there is an empty cell (color 0) immediately to its right:
        Change the color of the empty cell to 1 (blue).
```

The code does not need to be modified. The rule identified in the first example is general to predict the changes in the following examples.
