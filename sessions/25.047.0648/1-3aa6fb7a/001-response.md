Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical shapes and one 2x1 horizontal shape (if connected)."
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**
Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see objects of color 8 (azure). There are two groups of connected azure colored cells.

2.  **Change Color of one azure element:** At position x,y where we have the color azure, we go to x+1, and if the next position have color equals to 0, it is changed to 1.

**Natural Language Program**
```
For each group of azure colored cells:
   If the next position right is 0:
        Change color of the cell to 1.
```
