Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
      shape: "Two separate 1x2 vertical shapes and one 2x1 horizontal shape (if connected)."
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**
Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see objects of color 8 (azure). There are two groups of connected azure colored cells.

2.  **Change Color of one azure element:** At position x,y where we have the color azure, we go to x+1, and if the next position have color equals to 0, it is changed to 1.

**Natural Language Program**
```
For each group of azure colored cells:
   If the next position right is 0:
        Change color of the cell to 1.
```


*text:*
Okay, let's craft the Python code based on the transformation rule we've identified.



*text:*
```python
"""
Identify azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. For each azure object, check its neighbors to the right. If a neighbor is a 0, paint the neighbor by 1.
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)
    output_np = np.copy(input_np)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_np[r, c] == 8:
                if c + 1 < cols and input_np[r, c+1] == 0:
                    output_np[r, c+1] = 1
    return output_np.tolist()

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
