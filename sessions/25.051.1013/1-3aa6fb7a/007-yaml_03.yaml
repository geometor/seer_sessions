observations:
  - object_types:
      - L_shape: "Contiguous azure (8) regions forming a 2x2 block with one corner missing."
  - color_counts:
      - azure (8): "Variable, but defines the locations of interest."
      - blue (1): "Increases by the number of L shapes found."
  - geometric_properties:
      - L_shape: "Defined by a 2x2 block of azure (8) with one cell missing. The orientation matters for determining the corner."
  - spatial_relations:
    - "Blue pixels are always placed *inside* the 'concavity' of the azure L shapes, completing a 2x2 square."
