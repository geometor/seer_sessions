Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - objects:
        - description: Two separate azure (8) colored objects.
          shape: L-shape (3 cells each)
          positions:
            - Top-left corner of the first L-shape: (1,1)
            - Top-left corner of the second L-shape: (3,4)
    - background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    - objects:
      - description: Two separate azure (8) colored objects.
          shape: L-shape (3 cells each)
          positions:
            - Top-left corner of the first L-shape: (1,1)
            - Top-left corner of the second L-shape: (3,4)
      - description: Two blue (1) cells
          shape: single cells
          positions:
            - (2,2) between the arms of the first azure shape
            - (4,5) between the arms of the second azure shape
    - background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the step-by-step transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two separate "L"-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Preserve Objects:** The L-shaped objects are conserved in the output.

3.  **Add new cells:** In the output grid, new single blue (1) cells are added.

4. **Determine positioning:** Check the position of the added blue cell: it appears inside the corner formed by each azure object.

**Natural Language Program**

The program involves keeping every existing azure (8) object unchanged and adding a blue pixel (1) at the interior angle of each azure "L"-shaped object.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
