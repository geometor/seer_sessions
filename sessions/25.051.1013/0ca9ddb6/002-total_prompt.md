Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [(5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 6), (6,7)]
        shape: L-shape + single cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Locate the single red cell (color 2) and the single blue cell (color 1) in the input grid.

2.  **Red Cell Action:** The red cell remains in its original position. Two yellow cells are placed. The first is placed one row above and one column to the left. A second yellow cell, symmetrically to the first one, is placed one row above and one column to the right of the red one.

3.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around the blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and right of the blue cell.

4. **Orange Cells Addition**: The orange cell on the right is mirrored by adding a symmetric cell on the left, one row above and one column to the left of the blue cell.

In summary: The transformation involves keeping the original red and blue cells and adding yellow cells relative to the red and adding orange cells to the left, below, and right of the blue cell. Then a final orange cell is added by mirroring, relative to the blue cell, one of the already available orange cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
