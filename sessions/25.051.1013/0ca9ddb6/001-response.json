Two yellow cells are placed. The first is placed one row above and one column to the left. A second yellow cell, symmetrically to the first one, is placed one row above and one column to the right of the red one.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around the blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and right of the blue cell.\n\n4. **Orange Cells Addition**: The orange cell on the right is mirrored by adding a symmetric cell on the left, one row above and one column to the left of the blue cell.\n\nIn summary: The transformation involves keeping the original red and blue cells and adding yellow cells relative to the red and adding orange cells to the left, below, and right of the blue cell. Then a final orange cell is added by mirroring, relative to the blue cell, one of the already available orange cells.\n"
