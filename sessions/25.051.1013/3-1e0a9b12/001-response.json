These are at positions (3,0) ; (0,1) and (2,1) ; (2,2) and (0,3), respectively.\n\n2.  **Move Objects:** It first appears that all of the objects in the grid are moved to the bottom row.\n\n3. **Object order is preserved** If the objects were ordered 1,4,6,9 and moved to the bottom row, they would preserve the order.\n\n4. **Yellow object duplication**: After all of the colored tiles move down to the last row, the only exception to that transformation is color 4 (yellow) which also remains in its initial location.\n\n5. **Final Output:** The resulting output grid has all the non-zero colored cells in the bottom row, except the Yellow object, with their original colors maintained.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation involves moving all colored objects to the last row, the order of the objects, and the yellow objects is also duplicated in its initial position.\n"
