            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformations in the provided examples and refine the natural language program and Python code.\n\n**Analysis of Failures and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what went wrong in the previous attempts, and key observations from the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The yellow cells (4) were placed correctly relative to the red cell (2).\n    *   The orange cells (7) were mostly placed in an L-shape around the blue cell, but the \"extended\" L and mirroring parts were incorrect. The mirroring should always generate additional cells.\n    * There is no mirroring of orange cells with respect to the blue cell.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar issues with the orange L-shape around the blue cells. The L is sometimes too large.\n    *   Missing mirrored orange cell.\n    * The yellow cells are missing, but the position seems to be dependent on the existence of the red cells.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    The orange cells are misplaced and the L-shape is deformed.\n    * The yellow cells related to the red cell are ok.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a revised natural language program describing the transformation, incorporating the lessons learned:\n\n1.  **Preserve Existing Cells:** Keep all azure (8), red (2), blue (1), and magenta (6) cells from the input grid in the output grid.\n\n2.  **Red Cell Action (Yellow Diagonals):** For each red cell (2):\n    *   Place a yellow cell (4) diagonally up and to the left.\n    *   Place a yellow cell (4) diagonally up and to the right.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell Action (Orange L-Shape):** For each blue cell (1):\n    *   Place an orange cell (7) directly to the left.\n    *   Place an orange cell (7) directly below.\n    *  Place an orange cell (7) diagonally down and to the left.\n\n**Revised Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the positions of all single-cell objects of the specified color.\"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    # Convert to list of tuples\n    return [tuple(coord) for coord in coords]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find all red and blue cells\n    red_positions = find_objects(input_grid, 2)\n    blue_positions = find_objects(input_grid, 1)\n\n    # Red cell actions: add yellow cells for each red cell\n    for red_pos in red_positions:\n        if red_pos[0] - 1 >= 0 and red_pos[1] - 1 >= 0:\n            output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] - 1] = 4  # Up-Left\n        if red_pos[0] - 1 >= 0 and red_pos[1] + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n            output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] + 1] = 4  # Up-Right\n\n    # Blue cell actions: add orange cells in L-shape\n    for blue_pos in blue_positions:\n        if blue_pos[1] - 1 >= 0:\n            output_grid[blue_pos[0], blue_pos[1] - 1] = 7  # Left\n        if blue_pos[0] + 1 < output_grid.shape[0] and blue_pos[1] - 1 >= 0:\n            output_grid[blue_pos[0] + 1, blue_pos[1] - 1] = 7  # Down-Left\n        if blue_pos[0] + 1 < output_grid.shape[0]:\n            output_grid[blue_pos[0] + 1, blue_pos[1]] = 7 # Down\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Key Changes and Explanation**\n\n*   **Simplified Orange Cell Placement:** The code now directly places the orange cells in the correct L-shape (left, down, down-left) relative to each blue cell.  No mirroring or extra extensions.\n*   **Clearer Comments:** Added comments to indicate the relative positions (Up-Left, Up-Right, etc.) for better readability.\n* **Corrected Logic:** Removed the concept of the mirrored orange cell.\n\nThis revised code should accurately reflect the observed transformation rule and produce the correct outputs for all three training examples. I have eliminated edge cases that are unnecessary and focused the logic on the minimal operations described in the natural language program.\n"
