            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    size: 9x9\n    objects:\n      - color: 8 (azure)\n        position: (0, 3)\n        shape: single cell\n      - color: 2 (red)\n        positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]\n        shape: single cells\n      - color: 1 (blue)\n        positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]\n        shape: single cells\n    background_color: 0 (white)\n  output_grid:\n    size: 9x9\n    objects:\n     - color: 8 (azure)\n       position: (0, 3)\n       shape: single cell\n      - color: 2 (red)\n        positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]\n        shape: single cells\n      - color: 1 (blue)\n        positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]\n        shape: single cells\n      - color: 4 (yellow)\n        positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]\n        shape: single cells\n      - color: 7 (orange)\n        positions: [(2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6)]\n        shape: L-shapes + single cells\n\n    background_color: 0 (white)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Locate the single azure cell (color 8), the red cells (color 2) and the blue cells (color 1) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Azure Cell Action:** The azure cell remains in its original position.\n\n3.  **Red Cell Action:** The red cells remain in their original positions. Two yellow cells are placed relative to *each* red cell. The first is placed one row above and one column to the left of the red cell. The second is placed one row above and one column to the right of the red cell.\n\n4.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around *each* blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and to the right of the blue cell.\n\n5. **Orange Cells Addition**: An additional orange cell is placed by mirroring, relative to each blue cell, the orange cell at its right. That means one row above and one colum to the left of each blue cell.\n\nIn summary, this transformation generalizes the previous one. It keeps the single azure cell unchanged, and it applies the rules observed in the previous example to all red and blue cells: placing yellow cells relative to the red cells and orange cells around the blue cells.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves keeping the original azure, red and blue cells, and adding yellow cells relative to the red cells and adding orange cells to form an L-shape around the blue cells. Then a final orange cell is added by mirroring, relative to the blue cell, one of the already available orange cells.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the positions of all single-cell objects of the specified color.\"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    # Convert to list of tuples\n    return [tuple(coord) for coord in coords]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find all red and blue cells\n    red_positions = find_objects(input_grid, 2)\n    blue_positions = find_objects(input_grid, 1)\n\n    # Red cell actions: add yellow cells for each red cell\n    for red_pos in red_positions:\n        output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] - 1] = 4\n        output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] + 1] = 4\n\n    # Blue cell actions: add orange cells in L-shape and mirrored for each blue cell\n    for blue_pos in blue_positions:\n        output_grid[blue_pos[0] , blue_pos[1] - 1] = 7\n        output_grid[blue_pos[0] + 1, blue_pos[1] - 1] = 7\n        output_grid[blue_pos[0] + 1, blue_pos[1]] = 7\n        output_grid[blue_pos[0] + 1, blue_pos[1] + 1] = 7\n        output_grid[blue_pos[0] , blue_pos[1] + 1] = 7  # Mirrored cell\n\n    return output_grid\n```\nThe code has been updated to correctly handle multiple red and blue cells, applying the transformation rules to each instance of these colored cells. The `find_object` function has been replaced with `find_objects` to return a list of all occurrences.\n"
