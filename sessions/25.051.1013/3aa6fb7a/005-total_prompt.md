Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - objects:
        - description: Two separate azure (8) colored objects.
          shape: L-shape (3 cells each)
          positions:
            - Top-left corner of the first L-shape: (1,1)
            - Top-left corner of the second L-shape: (3,4)
    - background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    - objects:
      - description: Two separate azure (8) colored objects.
          shape: L-shape (3 cells each)
          positions:
            - Top-left corner of the first L-shape: (1,1)
            - Top-left corner of the second L-shape: (3,4)
      - description: Two blue (1) cells
          shape: single cells
          positions:
            - (2,2) between the arms of the first azure shape
            - (4,5) between the arms of the second azure shape
    - background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the step-by-step transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two separate "L"-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Preserve Objects:** The L-shaped objects are conserved in the output.

3.  **Add new cells:** In the output grid, new single blue (1) cells are added.

4. **Determine positioning:** Check the position of the added blue cell: it appears inside the corner formed by each azure object.

**Natural Language Program**

The program involves keeping every existing azure (8) object unchanged and adding a blue pixel (1) at the interior angle of each azure "L"-shaped object.


```python
"""

"""

import numpy as np

def find_l_shapes(grid, color):
    """
    Finds the coordinates of the interior corner of L-shaped objects of the specified color.
    """
    coords = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for i in range(rows - 1):
        for j in range(cols - 1):
            if grid[i, j] == color:
                # Check for L-shape (2x2 block with one missing corner)
                if grid[i+1, j] == color and grid[i, j+1] == color and grid[i+1, j+1] != color:
                    coords.append((i+1, j+1))
                elif grid[i+1, j] == color and grid[i, j+1] != color and grid[i+1, j+1] == color:
                    coords.append((i+1, j))
                elif grid[i+1, j] != color and grid[i, j+1] == color and grid[i+1, j+1] == color:
                    coords.append((i, j+1))
    return coords

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by adding a blue (1) pixel inside the corner of each azure (8) L-shaped object.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input
    
    # Find the coordinates of the corners of L-shaped azure objects
    l_shape_corners = find_l_shapes(output_grid, 8)

    # Add a blue pixel (1) at the corner of each L-shaped object
    for corner in l_shape_corners:
        output_grid[corner] = 1

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
