The primary difference between the input and output appears to be the introduction of the digit '1' (blue) in a few locations within the output grid, seemingly related to the placement of '8' (azure) in the input grid. The task involves understanding where and why the '1's are being placed. My strategy will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Data Representation:** Convert the input/output text grids into 2D numpy arrays. This will make it easier to analyze and manipulate.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Consider contiguous blocks of the same color as \"objects.\" In this case, it looks like the '8' (azure) pixels are key objects of interest.\n3.  **Relationship Analysis:** Analyze the spatial relationships between the '8' pixels in the input and the newly introduced '1' pixels in the output. Focus on metrics such as:\n    *   Distance: How far are the new '1's from the '8's?\n    *   Adjacency: Are the '1's directly next to '8's (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)?\n    *   Direction: Are the '1's placed in specific directions relative to the '8's (e.g., always to the left, right, above, below)?\n    *   Containment. Count the number of '8' pixels around the new '1's.\n4.  **Rule Hypothesis:** Based on the relationships, formulate a hypothesis for the transformation rule in plain, step by step, natural language.\n5. **Refinement** Refine, as needed.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\n"
