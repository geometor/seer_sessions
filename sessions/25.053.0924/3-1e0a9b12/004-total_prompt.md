# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x700776BFF3D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 9
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided example and a plan to figure out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid. The provided example shows one input-output pair. It seems likely to involve the movement, combination or modification of shapes, or alterations based on spatial relationships, colors, or some combination of these. It isn't immediately obvious what the rule is, so a careful examination of the pixel patterns is needed. The image jpegs are available, although the text representation is what's important for solving.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Data Inspection:** No need to perform any data loading or computation, we can see the text of the input and output data.

2.  **Object Identification:** Identify distinct "objects" within the grids. An object is likely a contiguous block of the same color.

3.  **Relationship Analysis:** Analyze the spatial relationships between objects in the input and how they change in the output.

4.  **Transformation Rule Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis about the transformation rule.

5.  **YAML Documentation:** Create the YAML doc of what we discover.

6.  **Natural Language Program:** Write out the transformation rule as a program.

**Metrics and Observations (without code execution):**

*   **Input Grid:** 6x6
*   **Output Grid:** 6x6 (same dimensions)
*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 9 (maroon), 8 (azure), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange)
*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 9 (maroon), 8 (azure), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange) (same colors)
*  **Notable Changes:**
    *   The maroon 9 in the top right corner of input moves to bottom right corner in the output
    * The azure 8 remains on row 5 in both, but combines with the orange 7.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [6, 6]
    colors: [0, 9, 8, 4, 7]
    objects:
      - color: 9
        position: [0, 5]
        shape: single pixel
      - color: 8
        position: [1, 3]
        shape: single pixel
      - color: 4
        position: [[4, 0], [5,0]]
        shape: vertical line
      - color: 7
        position: [5,2]
        shape: single pixel
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [6, 6]
    colors: [0, 9, 8, 4, 7]
    objects:
      - color: 9
        position: [5, 5]
        shape: single pixel
      - color: 8
        position: [4,3]
      - color: 4
        position: [[4, 0], [5,0]]
        shape: vertical line
      - color: 7
        position: [5,2]
        shape: single pixel

  transformations:
      - object: 9
        action: move
        from: [0, 5]
        to: [5, 5]
      - object: 8
        action: stays on row, but it appears to join with the 7, it seems there is insufficient information to determine the rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The maroon (9) pixel moves from the top-right corner (0, 5) to the bottom-right corner (5, 5).
2.  The yellow (4) vertical line remains unchanged.
3.  It is unclear what determines the final position of 8 - insufficient information to determine rule.

The provided example give insufficient detail to determine the full program.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
