# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 1 2
6 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x700776BFF3D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 1 0
6 3 0 1 2
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of the example input-output pair and a plan to figure out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The input and output are 5x5 grids with single-digit integer values representing colors. It appears that the transformation involves some kind of object movement or shifting, potentially based on adjacency or relative position. The colors and their arrangement seem important. My strategy is to first visually compare the grids to discern noticeable changes, then quantify those changes with metrics, formulate specific hypotheses, and finally create a natural language program to explain the rule.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use Python to analyze the grids and get some information.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 0, 1, 2],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 0, 1, 0],
    [6, 3, 0, 1, 2]
])

def grid_metrics(grid, name):
    print(f"--- Metrics for {name} ---")
    print(f"Shape: {grid.shape}")
    unique_values = np.unique(grid)
    print(f"Unique values: {unique_values}")
    for value in unique_values:
        count = np.sum(grid == value)
        print(f"Count of {value}: {count}")
    
    #find positions of unique values.
    print(f'Positions of Unique Values')
    for value in unique_values:
        positions = np.argwhere(grid == value)
        print(f'Value {value}: {positions}')

grid_metrics(input_grid, "Input Grid")
grid_metrics(output_grid, "Output Grid")


```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - value: 0  # White
    instances:
      input: 18
      output: 18
    notes: "Background color, no apparent change in count."

  - value: 1  # Blue
    instances:
      input: 2
      output: 2
    movement: "Shifts down and right by one row."

  - value: 2  # Red
    instances:
       input: 1
       output: 1
    movement: "Shifts down and right by two rows."

  - value: 3  # Green
    instances:
      input: 3
      output: 3
    movement: "Shifts down by two rows."

  - value: 6  # Magenta
    instances:
       input: 1
       output: 1
    movement: "Shifts down by one row."

actions:
 - shift_down:
    description: "Objects move down a certain number of rows."
 - shift_right:
     description: "some objects appear to also move right."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The non-zero pixels in the grid are considered objects. Each object is defined by its color (numerical value).
2.  **Observe Movement:** All objects of value 1, 2, 3 and 6 move down.
    *   Objects with value 3 shift down by two rows.
    *    Objects with value 6 and 1 shift down one row.
    *   The object of value of 2 shifts down by two rows.
    *   Objects of value 1 also move one column to the right.
    *   Object of value 2 also moves one column to the right.
3.  **Background:** The white pixels (value 0) remain unchanged.
4.  **Output:** Create the output grid by applying these shifts to the objects in the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
