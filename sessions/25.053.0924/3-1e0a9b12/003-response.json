            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided example and a plan to figure out the transformation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid. The provided example shows one input-output pair. It seems likely to involve the movement, combination or modification of shapes, or alterations based on spatial relationships, colors, or some combination of these. It isn't immediately obvious what the rule is, so a careful examination of the pixel patterns is needed. The image jpegs are available, although the text representation is what's important for solving.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Data Inspection:** No need to perform any data loading or computation, we can see the text of the input and output data.\n\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify distinct \"objects\" within the grids. An object is likely a contiguous block of the same color.\n\n3.  **Relationship Analysis:** Analyze the spatial relationships between objects in the input and how they change in the output.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis about the transformation rule.\n\n5.  **YAML Documentation:** Create the YAML doc of what we discover.\n\n6.  **Natural Language Program:** Write out the transformation rule as a program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (without code execution):**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** 6x6\n*   **Output Grid:** 6x6 (same dimensions)\n*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 9 (maroon), 8 (azure), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange)\n*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 9 (maroon), 8 (azure), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange) (same colors)\n*  **Notable Changes:**\n    *   The maroon 9 in the top right corner of input moves to bottom right corner in the output\n    * The azure 8 remains on row 5 in both, but combines with the orange 7.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
