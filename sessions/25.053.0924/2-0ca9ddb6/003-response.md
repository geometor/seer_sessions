Okay, here's a breakdown of the example input-output pair, including observations, metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The task appears to involve identifying specific colored pixels in the input grid and creating new shapes/objects around them in the output grid. The transformation isn't a simple one-to-one mapping of colors or positions, but rather seems to involve some kind of expansion or mirroring of the original pixels, with specific color changes. The output is larger and more complex.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Use code execution to precisely identify the locations and colors of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Analyze Output:** Similarly, analyze the output grid to identify non-zero pixels, their colors, and their spatial relationship to the input pixels.
3.  **Identify Relationships:** Determine the precise rules governing the transformation. This will likely involve analyzing distances, directions, and color changes.
4.  **Formalize Rules:** Express the transformation rules in a concise natural language program.
5.  **YAML Documentation**: Create a YAML block which capture facts, properties of objects, and any actions.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

            if value != 0:
                pixels.append((r, c, value))

    description: >
      Blue pixels are the center of a mirroring operation.
      An orange pixel is placed on either side of the original
      blue pixel in the row and column dimensions, but only if the
      mirrored position is within the bounds of the grid and is currently
      a black pixel.
  - name: "Create Yellow"
      description: >
        A yellow object is created around blue pixel by mirroring the action of a blue pixel.
        Two positions on the opposite side of red pixels in the same row.
        Two position on the opposite side of red pixels in the same column.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Existing Pixels:**  The azure pixel at (0, 3) and the red pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1) remain unchanged in their original positions.

2.  **Mirror Blue Pixels with Orange:** For each blue pixel:
    *   Create orange pixels by mirroring the blue pixel's position *horizontally* and *vertically*. Specifically, place an orange pixel one position to the left and one position to the right of the blue pixel in the same row, and one position above and one position below, if and only if these new locations are within the grid boundaries and are not currently occupied by a non-black (non-zero) pixel.

3. **Create Yellow Cross based on positions of Orange related to Red Pixels** For each blue pixel that generated orange pixels in step 2:
    * Create yellow pixels by mirroring, using the position *horizontally* and *vertically*. of the red pixels.
      * Place a yellow pixel two positions above the lowest red pixel
      * Place a yellow pixel two postions below the highest red pixel
      * Place a yellow pixel two position to the left of the rightmost red pixel.
      * Place a yellow pixel two position to the right of the leftmost red pixel.
