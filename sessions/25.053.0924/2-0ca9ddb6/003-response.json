            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the example input-output pair, including observations, metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe task appears to involve identifying specific colored pixels in the input grid and creating new shapes/objects around them in the output grid. The transformation isn't a simple one-to-one mapping of colors or positions, but rather seems to involve some kind of expansion or mirroring of the original pixels, with specific color changes. The output is larger and more complex.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Input:** Use code execution to precisely identify the locations and colors of non-zero pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Analyze Output:** Similarly, analyze the output grid to identify non-zero pixels, their colors, and their spatial relationship to the input pixels.\n3.  **Identify Relationships:** Determine the precise rules governing the transformation. This will likely involve analyzing distances, directions, and color changes.\n4.  **Formalize Rules:** Express the transformation rules in a concise natural language program.\n5.  **YAML Documentation**: Create a YAML block which capture facts, properties of objects, and any actions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\n"
