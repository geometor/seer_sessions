            "text": "Okay, here's my assessment of the example and a plan for figuring out the transformation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe input and output are grids of digits (0-9), likely representing colors. The transformation isn't immediately obvious, but there's a clear change in the output grid. Some digits remain the same (2, 6, 1), while others are added (4, 7), and some 0s are replaced. The spatial arrangement seems significant, and new numbers appear adjacent to existing ones. The appearance of 4 and 7 could be conditional or based on some local properties like neighbors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Inspect Values:** Determine the unique values in both input and output grids.\n2.  **Spatial Relationships:** Analyze the positions of unchanged digits (2, 6, 1). Look for patterns in their locations relative to the new digits (4, 7).\n3.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Focus on the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and possibly diagonals) of the changed pixels. Check if the new values (4 and 7) are related to the values of these neighbors.\n4.  **Object Identification**: If there are consistent clusters or shapes, consider them as objects.\n5.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Based on the above, create a tentative rule in plain English.\n6.  **Refine:** If necessary, adjust the hypothesis and repeat.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code):**\n\n"
