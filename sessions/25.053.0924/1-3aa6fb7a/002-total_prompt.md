# Example

**input:**
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x700776C31BA0>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example and a plan to figure out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numbers (representing colors) into another grid. The primary difference seems to be the introduction of the number '1' (blue) in the output grid, seemingly related to the position of '8' (azure) pixels in the input grid. My strategy is to meticulously analyze the positions of '8' and '1' to determine the relationship. I will focus on proximity and connectivity of '8's and where the 1s appear.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**

I'll use Python to analyze the provided grids, focusing on these metrics:

*   Coordinates of all '8' pixels in the input.
*   Coordinates of all '1' pixels in the output.
*   Dimensions of both grids.



*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

input_8_coords = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)
output_1_coords = np.argwhere(output_grid == 1)

print(f"Input grid dimensions: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"Output grid dimensions: {output_grid.shape}")
print(f"Coordinates of 8 in input: {input_8_coords}")
print(f"Coordinates of 1 in output: {output_1_coords}")


```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: 1
```
Input grid dimensions: (7, 7)
Output grid dimensions: (7, 7)
Coordinates of 8 in input: [[1 1]
 [2 1]
 [2 2]
 [3 4]
 [3 5]
 [4 5]]
Coordinates of 1 in output: [[1 2]
 [4 4]]

```
**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: azure_pixels
    value: 8
    input_coordinates: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
  - object: blue_pixels
    value: 1
    output_coordinates: [[1, 2], [4, 4]]
  - observation: "Blue pixels appear to the right of azure pixels and to the left of azure pixels"
  - observation: grids_same_size
    value: true

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of '8' (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Check to the immediate right:** For each azure pixel, examine the pixel directly to its right.
    *   If the pixel to the right exists (is not out of bounds) and is '0' (white), change that '0' to '1'(blue) in the output.
3.  **Check to the immedate left:** For each azure pixel, examine the pixel directly to its left.
    *   If the pixel to the left exists and is '0' (white), change that '0' to '1' (blue) in the output grid.
4. **Maintain other pixels:** All the other pixels keep their original value

This program describes a transformation where azure pixels induce a change in their neighboring white pixels, specifically one pixel to each side.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
