Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a limited observation (likely just the first example) and, as a result, it doesn't capture the full transformation rule. The core issue is that the initial code only considers horizontal adjacency (left and right). The results clearly show that vertical adjacency (above and below) also matters.  The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided input/output pairs to fully understand the rule. The provided test results are crucial.
2.  **Expand Adjacency:** Modify the natural language program, and subsequently the code, to include checks for adjacent pixels in *all four cardinal directions* (up, down, left, right).  This is the most significant flaw.
3.  **Consider Diagonals**: Based on the provided images and example results, verify the diagonal adjacency condition - are diagonals considered, or only up, down, left and right. The provided images have highlights on diagonals, this needs to be confirmed.
4. **Iterative refinement:**: After modifying the code based on this expanded understanding, re-run the tests and repeat the analysis until all training examples match perfectly.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example, focusing on what reveals the flaws in the current code:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** A few clusters of azure (8) pixels surrounded by white (0) pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** Shows white pixels *horizontally* adjacent to azure pixels changed to blue (1).
    *   **Transformed Output:**  Incorrectly changes *all* adjacent white pixels (including those above and below) to blue.
    *   **Key Insight:** The transformation needs to happen ONLY horizontally.  This example highlights that the initial code is *too broad* in its application of the rule. It is changing vertical neighbors, which the expected output does not do.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Another arrangement of azure and white pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** Again, only *horizontally* adjacent white pixels are changed to blue.
    *   **Transformed Output:** Same error as Example 1; vertical neighbors are incorrectly changed.
    *   **Key Insight:** Reinforces the finding from Example 1. The code is consistently wrong in the same way, confirming the adjacency issue.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
task_id: 002-py_01
objects:
  - name: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: int (number of rows)
      - cols: int (number of columns)
      - cells: list of lists (pixel values)

  - name: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - value: int (0-9, representing color)
      - row: int (row index)
      - col: int (column index)
      - adjacent_pixels: list of pixels (neighbors in all four directions)

actions:
  - name: identify_azure_pixels
    description: Find all pixels with a value of 8.
    input: grid
    output: list of pixel coordinates

  - name: check_adjacency
    description: For a given azure pixel, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    input: pixel, grid
    output: list of adjacent pixel coordinates

  - name: transform_white_to_blue
    description: Change the value of a white pixel (0) to blue (1).
    input: pixel
    output: modified pixel

transformation_rule: |
  For each azure pixel in the input grid, check its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right).
  If a neighbor is white (0), change it to blue (1). Do not change vertically or diagonally adjacent cells.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid. Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. This ensures we don't modify the original data.

2.  **Iterate through Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid, one by one.

3.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** For the current pixel, check if its value is 8 (azure).

4.  **Horizontal Adjacency Check:** If the pixel is azure:
    *   **Check Left Neighbor:** See if there's a pixel directly to the left (same row, previous column). If this neighbor exists and has a value of 0 (white), change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to 1 (blue).
    *   **Check Right Neighbor:** See if there's a pixel directly to the right (same row, next column). If this neighbor exists and has a value of 0 (white), change the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid to 1 (blue).

5.  **Skip other adjacencies:** Explicitly *do not* check or modify pixels above, below, or diagonal to the azure pixel.

6.  **Output:** After iterating through all pixels, the output grid contains the transformed image.
