            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input grid contains three distinct \"objects\" of color 8 (azure). One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the fifth and sixth columns starting at row 1. The second is a 1x1 rectangle in the third column and starting at row 3. The third is 2x2 rectangle in the third and fourth columns starting at row 6.\n\n*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of a single pixel of color 1 (blue) directly to the right of the top-most pixel of each separated azure object.\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    position: columns 5, 6, row 1\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 1x1 rectangle\n    position: column 3, row 3\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x2 rectangle\n    position: columns 3, 4, row 6\ntransformation:\n  - add_pixel:\n      color: 1\n      relative_position: right of top-most pixel\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  Identify all separated objects of color 8 (azure).\n2.  For each identified object, find the top-most pixel.\n3.  Place a pixel of color 1 (blue) immediately to the right of this top-most pixel.\n4.  If placing it to the right is not possible because that location does not exist, do not place any pixel.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n\n    def get_neighbors(r, c):\n        neighbors = []\n        if r > 0:\n            neighbors.append((r - 1, c))  # Up\n        if r < rows - 1:\n            neighbors.append((r + 1, c))  # Down\n        if c > 0:\n            neighbors.append((r, c - 1))  # Left\n        if c < cols - 1:\n            neighbors.append((r, c + 1))  # Right\n        return neighbors\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c):\n            if input_grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                dfs(nr, nc, current_object)\n\n    objects = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        top_most_row = rows  # Initialize with a large value\n        top_most_col = -1\n        for r, c in obj:\n            if r < top_most_row:\n                top_most_row = r\n                top_most_col = c\n\n        if top_most_col + 1 < cols:  # Check if adding to the right is possible\n           output_grid[top_most_row, top_most_col + 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\nThe natural language description and the code are consistent between the two examples.\n"
