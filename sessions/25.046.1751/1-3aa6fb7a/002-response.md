Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains two separate "objects" of color 8 (azure). One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the second column, and the other is a 2x2 square in the fifth and sixth columns.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of a single pixel of color 1 (blue) directly to the right of the top-most pixel of each azure object.

**YAML Summary:**




*text:*

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: column 2
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2 square
    position: columns 5 and 6
transformation:
  - add_pixel:
      color: 1
      relative_position: right of top-most pixel
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify all objects of color 8 (azure).
2.  For each identified object, find the top-most pixel.
3.  Place a pixel of color 1 (blue) immediately to the right of this top-most pixel.
4. If placing it to the right is not possible because that location does not exist, do not place any pixel.

**Python Implementation:**
