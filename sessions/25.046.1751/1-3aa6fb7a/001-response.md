Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure rectangles.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 azure rectangles.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: Two separate 1x1 blue squares.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical 2x1 rectangle at the coordinates (1,1) and the other one is a 2x1 object in position starting at (3,4).

2.  **Detect Changes:** Comparing to output we observe, the azure colored objects are unchanged. We also observe new occurrences of a blue pixel (color 1). One blue pixel appears to the immediate right of the top-left azure pixel of the first object. The other one appear to the immediate left of the bottom-right azure pixel of the second object.

3. **Transformation Rule:** For each separate azure object, we add a blue pixel at a specific location. The first blue pixel is added directly to the right of the topmost, leftmost azure pixel, whereas the second one is added directly to the left of the bottommost, rightmost pixel of the second object.
