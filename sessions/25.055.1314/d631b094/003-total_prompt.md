Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Blue Pixels: Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with a value of 1 (representing the color blue).
2. Count Blue Pixels: Count the total number of blue pixels found in the input grid.
3. Create Output Grid: Construct a new grid. Its width equals the count from Step 2, and height is one. Fill all cells in this new grid with blue pixel (value 1).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Count blue pixels (value 1)
    blue_pixel_count = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 1)

    # Create output grid: 1 row, width equal to the blue pixel count, filled with 1s.
    output_grid = np.ones((1, blue_pixel_count), dtype=int)

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
