## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915DDA6B0>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x749915DDB6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output is a 1x2 grid containing only 1s (blue). The transformation seems to involve extracting the blue pixels (value 1) from the input and creating a new grid. The size of this new grid appears to be determined by number of blue pixels and does not retain positional information.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - subject: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
    description: "The initial grid state."

  - subject: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
    description: "The resulting grid state."

  - action: extract_blue_pixels
    input: input_grid
    process: "Identify all pixels with a value of 1 (blue)."
    output: "A collection of blue pixels."

  - action: create_output_grid
    input: "Collection of blue pixels (from extract_blue_pixels)"
    process: "Create a new grid where the number of '1' elements equals to number of blue pixels found in the input, arranging them in a single row. Width is determined by the number of blue pixels."
    output: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with a value of 1 (representing the color blue).
2.  **Count Blue Pixels:** Count the total number of blue pixels found in the input grid.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a new grid. Its width equals the count from Step 2, and height will be one. Fill all cells in the output with the color of blue pixel (value 1).

Essentially, the program extracts all blue pixels from the input grid, discards their original positions, and creates a new grid consisting only of blue pixels, where the size of output is determined by the number of the identified blue pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
