            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided training examples and the results of the previously generated `transform` function.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial `transform` function (which I don't have, but can infer from the `analyze_example` function and the results) seems to be overly simplistic. It likely only considered the first example and didn't generalize well. The core issue is that the transformation isn't consistent across all examples. Some outputs have additional columns and objects than were originally implemented.\n\nThe `analyze_example` function provides helpful information. It correctly identifies objects using `skimage.measure.label` (with connectivity=1, meaning only orthogonally adjacent pixels of the same color form an object). It also calculates the shapes of the input objects. However, the link between input object characteristics and the output isn't properly modeled.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Careful Observation:** Meticulously examine each input/output pair, noting the colors, shapes, and positions of objects. Pay close attention to how many final objects are in the output.\n2.  **Identify Core Rule:** Hypothesize a transformation rule that *consistently* explains all provided examples, not just the first one.  The provided examples and debug info will test the accuracy of these observations\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the core rule, develop a clear, concise natural language program describing the transformation.\n4.  **Fact Gathering**: Produce YAML summarizing input shapes, colors, and actions and output shapes and colors\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**\n\nI will execute `analyze_example` to obtain metrics. Since I don't have prior code execution context, I will re-execute it using the same code provided, and summarize the relevant information here.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skimage.measure import label\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Placeholder -
