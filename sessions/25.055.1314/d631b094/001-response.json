The output is a 1x2 grid containing only 1s (blue). The transformation seems to involve extracting the blue pixels (value 1) from the input and creating a new grid. The size of this new grid appears to be determined by number of blue pixels and does not retain positional information.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Its width equals the count from Step 2, and height will be one.
