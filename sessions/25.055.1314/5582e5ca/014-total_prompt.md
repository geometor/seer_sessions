## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915C6D9F0>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915C6C4C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.  The input grid has a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (magenta, represented by the value 6). The key seems to be identifying a specific color within the input grid and using it to flood the entire output grid.  The crucial element is to determine *which* color from the input is selected for the output. It is present in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (0-9, representing different colors)

actions:
  - type: identify_color
    description: Select a specific color from the input grid.
  - type: flood_fill
    description: Replace all pixels in the grid with the selected color.

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains a set of colored pixels.
  - output_grid:  A uniform grid filled with a single color, taken from the input.
  - selection_rule: The magenta color (6) appears in the input at coordinates (0,1) (1,0) and (2,2)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Target Color:** Examine the input grid and find the color magenta (represented by the value 6).
2. **Flood Fill:** Create a new grid (output grid) of the same dimensions as the input grid. Fill the output grid entirely with color 6 (magenta).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
