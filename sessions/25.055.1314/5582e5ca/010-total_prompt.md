Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. If the number 9 exists in the input grid, the output grid is filled entirely with 9s.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.
    If 9 exists in input, output is all 9s.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Check if 9 exists in the input grid.
    if 9 in input_grid:
        # Create an output grid filled entirely with 9s.
        output_grid[:] = 9
    
    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handled the first training example, where the presence of the number 9 (maroon) in the input grid resulted in an output grid filled entirely with 9s. However, subsequent examples demonstrate that this rule is not universally applicable. Some examples do not contain 9, yet they involve transformations. Others do not produce an output of all 9s. It is necessary to incorporate more general transformation rules.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine all input-output pairs, not just the first one, to discern a more comprehensive pattern.
2.  **Identify conditions**: Determine the conditions under which different transformations occur, especially in cases that do not involve the number 9.
3.  **Refine the natural language program**: Update the natural language program to reflect a more accurate and complete set of rules, accommodating the variations observed in all training examples.

**Example Metrics and Observations (using a simplified representation):**

| Example | Input Summary             | Output Summary                        | Observation                                                                                                             |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Contains 9                | All 9s                                | Original rule (all 9s if 9 is present) holds.                                                                         |
| 2       | No 9, single 1            | All 1s                  | No 9 and output is all 1's                                                      |
| 3     | No 9, single 2            | All 2s               | No 9 in input, a single 2 and entire grid becomes 2.                                             |
| 4     | Contains 9                | All 9s          | Contains 9, becomes all 9s             |
| 5    | Contains 9                | All 9s          | Contains 9, becomes all 9s        |

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input: Contains maroon (9).
      output: Entire grid is maroon (9).
      rule: If 9 is present, the output grid is filled with 9.
  - example_2:
      input:  Contains a single azure(8).
      output: Entire grid is azure(8).
      rule: If only a single color other than 0, and is an 8, the entire grid is set to that color.
  - example_3:
      input:  Contains only one red (2).
      output: Entire grid is red (2)
      rule: if only a single color other than 0, and is a 2, the entire grid is set to that color
  - example_4:
      input: contains maroon(9)
      output: Entire grid is maroon (9).
      rule: If 9 is present, the output grid is filled with 9.
  - example_5:
      input: contains maroon(9)
      output: Entire grid is maroon (9).
      rule: If 9 is present, the output grid is filled with 9.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Check for the presence of the number 9 (maroon):** If the input grid contains the number 9, the output grid will be filled entirely with 9s.
2. **Check if there is only a single, unique color:** If there is only one color other than white(0) in the input grid, fill the output with the one color.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
