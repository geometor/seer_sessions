The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color (maroon, represented by the digit 9). The key seems to lie in identifying a specific characteristic within the input grid that dictates the output. In this instance it appears to be existence of the number.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
