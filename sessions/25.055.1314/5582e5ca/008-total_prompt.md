## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915B08880>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7499158D9090>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color (maroon, represented by the digit 9). The key seems to lie in identifying a specific characteristic within the input grid that dictates the output. In this instance it appears to be existence of the number.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  Transforms an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions, where all pixels in the output grid are of a single color determined by the input.

observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of digits (0-9), representing colored pixels.
  - dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 3x3
  - input_colors:
      - magenta (6)
      - azure (8)
      - maroon (9)
      - blue (1)
      - yellow (4)
  - output_color:
      - maroon (9)
  - rule_identifiers:
    - The digit 9, is present in the input grid.
    - The output consists entirely of digit 9.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Inspect the input grid:** Examine the input grid to determine if 9 exists.
2.  **Determine the output color:** Based on step one. If number nine exist set all the colors to 9.
3. **Construct the output grid:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the color determined in step 2.

Essentially it find the existance of 9 and replaces all number with 9.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
