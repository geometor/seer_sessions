Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the L
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the reverse-L
      size: 3
  dimensions: (7,7)

output_grid:
    objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the L
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the reverse-L
      size: 3
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
      size: 1

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects made of color 8 (azure). One is an "L" shape in the top-left corner, and the other is a "reverse-L" shape in the bottom-right corner.

2. **Detect Changes:** We can see the addition of the color 1(blue).

3.  **Transformation Rule:** Find the color 8 azure, then change the right-hand adjacent cell to the L shape object to color 1 blue, find the other separate color 8 azure, and then change the left-hand adjacent cell to the reverse-L shape object to color 1.

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (0, 4) # Top-left corner
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (2, 2) # Top-left corner
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (5,3)
      size: 3
  dimensions: (7, 7)

output_grid:
    objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (0, 4) # Top-left corner
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (2, 2) # Top-left corner
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (5,3)
      size: 3
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,4)
      size: 1
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (2,3)
      size: 1
       - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (5,3)
      size: 1
  dimensions: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three azure (color 8) objects. Two are "reverse-L" shapes, and one is an "L" shape.

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   For each "reverse-L" shaped object, if the space to the left of the top of the "reverse-L" is empty, change it to blue (color 1).
    *   For the "L" shaped object, if the space to the right of the top of the "L" is empty, change the color of the cell to blue (color 1).

The Python code provided in the first response already correctly implements this logic. The key improvement from the previous response's analysis is that it clarifies the conditions more precisely. Instead of simply saying "left" or "right", we're specifying "left of the *top* of the reverse-L" and "right of the top of the L." This disambiguates which cell should be changed. The `find_objects` function correctly identifies the "top-left" corner of each L and reverse-L shape, allowing for consistent application of this rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
