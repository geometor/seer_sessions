Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the L
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the reverse-L
      size: 3
  dimensions: (7,7)

output_grid:
    objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the L
      size: 3
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse-L-shape
      position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the reverse-L
      size: 3
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
      size: 1
      
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      position: (4,5)
      size: 1
  dimensions: (7,7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects made of color 8 (azure). One is an "L" shape in the top-left corner, and the other is a "reverse-L" shape in the bottom-right corner.

2. **Detect Changes:** We can see the addition of the color 1(blue).

3.  **Transformation Rule:** Find the color 8 azure, then change the right-hand adjacent cell to the L shape object to color 1 blue, find the other separate color 8 azure, and then change the left-hand adjacent cell to the reverse-L shape object to color 1.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
