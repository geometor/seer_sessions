Two are \"reverse-L\" shapes, and one is an \"L\" shape.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   For each \"reverse-L\" shaped object, if the space to the left of the top of the \"reverse-L\" is empty, change it to blue (color 1).\n    *   For the \"L\" shaped object, if the space to the right of the top of the \"L\" is empty, change the color of the cell to blue (color 1).\n\nThe Python code provided in the first response already correctly implements this logic. The key improvement from the previous response's analysis is that it clarifies the conditions more precisely. Instead of simply saying \"left\" or \"right\", we're specifying \"left of the *top* of the reverse-L\" and \"right of the top of the L.\" This disambiguates which cell should be changed. The `find_objects` function correctly identifies the \"top-left\" corner of each L and reverse-L shape, allowing for consistent application of this rule.\n"
