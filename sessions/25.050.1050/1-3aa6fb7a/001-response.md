Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects made of color 8 (azure). One is an "L" shape in the top-left corner and the other is a reverse "L" shape in the bottom right corner. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare each cell between input and output:
    *   All cells that contain the color `8` are unchanged.
    *   All cells that have the color `0` are unchanged, except the cells at coordinates `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`.

3. **Describe Transformation**:
    *   Find the cells on color `0` immediately to the right of an `8` colored cell that forms the corner of the L-shape. Replace `0` with a `1` (blue).

**Summary**: The transformation preserves the azure (8) colored L-shaped objects. For each L shape, it adds a blue (1) colored pixel to the direct right of the corner of the "L".
