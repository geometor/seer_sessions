Okay, let's analyze this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has three azure (8) colored objects, two reverse L-shapes and one L-shape.  The background is white (0).

2.  **Detect Changes:** Comparing the input and output grids, the azure (8) objects remain unchanged.  Three blue (1) pixels appear.

3.  **Describe Transformation:**
    *   Find cells with color `0` that are located to the right of corner of L-shapes of color `8`.
    *    Change those `0` color cells to `1` (blue).

**Summary**:  The transformation is identical to the previous example. It identifies the corner pixel of each 3-pixel L-shaped object (color 8).  It then places a blue pixel (color 1) immediately to the right of the corner pixel, if that space exists within the grid and is color `0`. The L-shapes can point in any direction.

The provided Python code from the first example correctly implements this logic, including identification of L-shapes, finding the "corner", and placing the blue pixel. No changes are needed.
