Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects made of color 8 (azure). One is an "L" shape in the top-left corner and the other is a reverse "L" shape in the bottom right corner. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare each cell between input and output:
    *   All cells that contain the color `8` are unchanged.
    *   All cells that have the color `0` are unchanged, except the cells at coordinates `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`.

3. **Describe Transformation**:
    *   Find the cells on color `0` immediately to the right of an `8` colored cell that forms the corner of the L-shape. Replace `0` with a `1` (blue).

**Summary**: The transformation preserves the azure (8) colored L-shaped objects. For each L shape, it adds a blue (1) colored pixel to the direct right of the corner of the "L".

Okay, let's analyze this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]
  background_color: 0

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8
      shape: reverse L-shape
      positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]
    - color: 1
      shape: single cell
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
  background_color: 0
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has three azure (8) colored objects, two reverse L-shapes and one L-shape.  The background is white (0).

2.  **Detect Changes:** Comparing the input and output grids, the azure (8) objects remain unchanged.  Three blue (1) pixels appear.

3.  **Describe Transformation:**
    *   Find cells with color `0` that are located to the right of corner of L-shapes of color `8`.
    *    Change those `0` color cells to `1` (blue).

**Summary**:  The transformation is identical to the previous example. It identifies the corner pixel of each 3-pixel L-shaped object (color 8).  It then places a blue pixel (color 1) immediately to the right of the corner pixel, if that space exists within the grid and is color `0`. The L-shapes can point in any direction.

The provided Python code from the first example correctly implements this logic, including identification of L-shapes, finding the "corner", and placing the blue pixel. No changes are needed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
