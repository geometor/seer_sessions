## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair, but can vary between examples. The dimensions appear related.
*   The digits (colors) in the input grid seem to be re-arranged in the output grid, but the overall count of the digits is conserved.
*   The arrangement transformation appears to involve a 90-degree rotation, with changes also in the values

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of digits (colors).
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output in each pair.
      - values: digits 0-9, representing colors.
  - type: transformation
    description: Digits are re-arranged and potentially mirrored.
    properties:
      - conservation: The number of each digit is the same in input and output.
      - rotation: input is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees
      - position: The positions of digits change systematically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.
2.  **Invert Columns**: After the rotation reverse the sequence of numbers to swap top to bottom.
