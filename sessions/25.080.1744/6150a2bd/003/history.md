Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed adjustments to the natural language program and code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation and then flips the grid vertically. This approach correctly transforms some aspects of the input but fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs in both examples. The pixel-level mismatches (pixels_off) and the visual differences in the transformed images indicate that the transformation rule isn't just a simple rotation and flip. We need to analyze the spatial relationships and color changes more closely to identify the precise rule.

The main issue is that the previous code *does not* perform the rotation and inversion of rows correctly.

Strategy is to focus on object transformation and position changes.
The outputs suggest a rotation, but not a typical matrix rotation. It's more like "rotating the *idea*" or content rather than the literal grid.

**Metrics and Observations (via Manual Analysis & Conceptual Understanding)**

I can't use code execution since I do not have interactive access to prior tools or outputs. I need to reason the transformation visually.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    3 3 8
    3 7 0
    5 0 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    0 0 5
    0 7 3
    8 3 3
    ```

*   **Transformed Output (from provided results):**
    
```
    3 3 5
    3 7 0
    8 0 0
    ```


*Observations*
1.  The input grid is 3x3, and so is output
2.  The colors in the input and output appear to be the same, only the location changes.
3.  The "Transformed output" appears to be a simple counter-clockwise 90 degree rotation.
4.  The "Expected output" is also rotated 90 degrees but the colors are "shifted"

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    
```
    5 5 2
    1 0 0
    0 0 0
    ```

*   **Expected Output:**
    
```
    0 0 0
    0 0 1
    2 5 5
    ```

*   **Transformed Output (from provided results):**
    
```
    5 1 0
    5 0 0
    2 0 0
    ```


*Observations*
1. The input grid is 2x3 and the output is 3x2.
2. The colors in input and output are the same.
3. The "Transformed output" appears to be a simple counter-clockwise 90 degree rotation.
4. The "Expected output" also seems to be a simple 90 degree rotation.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  example_1:
    input_shape: 3x3
    output_shape: 3x3
    colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    transformation_type: rotation_with_shift
    rotation_angle: 90_degrees_ccw
    shift_type: column_based_on_original_row
  example_2:
    input_shape: 2x3
    output_shape: 3x2
    colors: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    transformation_type: rotation
    rotation_angle: 90_degrees_ccw
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This means the top-left element of the input becomes the bottom-left element of the output, the top-right becomes the top-left, and so on. The new dimensions are transposed (rows become columns, columns become rows).

The current code *almost* works on both examples. The main failure is
example_1, where it appears that we need an extra "shift" after the rotation.

Let's examine example 1 closer:


```
Input:

3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```



```
Expected Output:

0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


After the rotation:

```
8 0 0
3 7 0
3 3 5
```

Flip vertically:

```
3 3 5
3 7 0
8 0 0
```


The rule could be described as: rotate 90 degrees, then "shift up" each
column based on it's index.

- column 0: no shift
- column 1: up 1
- column 2: up 2

This would give:

```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


This logic, while it works on example_1, does *not* work on example_2

It appears I need to modify the strategy.

The core idea is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
The error lies with example_1.

Let's consider that instead of shifting "up" by index, we shift right
based on index:

- column 0 = row 0: no shift
- column 1 = row 1: shift right 1
- column 2 = row 2: shift right 2

This would give us for example 1, the expected output. Let me use this
strategy.
