The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), azure (8), and blue (1). The output grid seems to be a simplified version of the input, retaining only the azure (8) pixels and setting all others to white (0).  The shapes and relative positions of the azure regions appear to be preserved, but the surrounding context (the green and blue regions) are removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
