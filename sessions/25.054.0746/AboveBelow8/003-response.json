However, it fails on all three training examples. The core issue is that the code *only* preserves a *complete* vertical column of the specified color. It does not consider partial columns or multiple sections of a column, and does not allow for the case where the column does not span the entire height of the grid. The strategy should be to make the column finding logic more robust, it should preserve all sections of a vertical azure column, regardless of contiguity of the column or the surrounding pixels.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, analyzing the discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The expected output shows an azure column that is not a complete column, and varies in height between the top and bottom sections. The transformed output is all grey because no complete azure column exists.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the azure sections of the expected output are partial columns that change height.\n*   **Example 3:** Same column height errors, but the azure 'column' does not have consistent positioning.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 002\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: mixed_color_region\n        color: varied\n        shape: irregular\n        azure_column_segments:\n          - x: 2, y_start: 3, y_end: 3\n          - x: 3, y_start: 3, y_end: 6\n          - x: 4, y_start: 7, y_end: 7\n          - x: 5, y_start: 8, y_end: 9\n          - x: 6, y_start: 10, y_end: 10\n\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: azure_column_segment\n        color: 8\n        shape: vertical_line\n        positions:\n          - x: 2, y: 7\n          - x: 3, y: 8\n          - x: 3, y: 9\n          - x: 3, y: 10\n    transformation:\n      type: extract_and_position\n      description: Extract vertical azure column segments, preserving the segments x-position.

A segment can be a single pixel, or multiple contiguous vertical pixels.\n3.  **Preserve and Position:** Copy each azure pixel to the same x, y coordinate in the output grid.\n4.  **Set Background:** All other pixels in the output grid that do not contain an azure pixel should be set to grey (color code 0).\n\nThe key improvement in this natural language program is identifying, preserving, and positioning *all* azure pixels. This will ensure that only parts of columns are preserved and reconstructed correctly, while maintaining original x, y positions.\n"
