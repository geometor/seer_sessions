            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the concept of \"interior pixels,\" defined as azure (8) pixels surrounded by other azure pixels in all four cardinal directions.  This concept worked for neither of the first three training examples, and the code transformation did not match the expected output. It seems the definition of \"interior\" needs to consider the color of the adjacent pixels that determine the \"interior\". It's not any azure, it is the color of a solid shape formed by the azure, as it appears in the expected output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the \"Interior\" Concept:**  The current definition of \"interior\" is too strict. We need to redefine it based on the shape that appears in the *output*, then find how it is related to an object or property in the input.\n2.  **Analyze Neighboring Pixels:** Consider different cases of neighboring pixels to determine which shapes are preserved and how they relate to the colors in the original input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations, comparing the results, and providing additional detail where needed.\nThe code was correct on the shape, but not the pixel colors, which means the comparison or iteration may be off.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**  Has multiple colored regions, including azure (8) regions.\n*   **Expected Output:** Contains azure shapes inside the input's larger azure shapes, but no others.\n*   **Transformed Output:**  All zeros (white). No azure pixels were preserved.\n*   **Observation:** The code failed to identify interior.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 12\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:**  Has multiple colored regions, including disconnected regions of azure (8) of various sizes.\n*   **Expected Output:** An azure border representing where some, but not all azure regions began, but only where a boundary existed.\n*   **Transformed Output:** All zeros (white).\n*   **Observation:** The code missed the subtle border.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 19\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:**  Has two main colored regions (blue and green) and areas with azure pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** Only retains a sub-shape, internal to the input.\n*   **Transformed Output:** All white.\n*   **Observation:** The code failed to identify a valid interior.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 8\n    *   `size_correct`: True\n    *   `color_palette_correct`: True\n    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n      shapes: [irregular]\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      colors: [0, 8]\n      shapes: [sub-shapes of input azure regions]\nactions:\n  - name: identify_interior_azure\n    description: Locate azure pixels that form the interior portions of azure regions in the input.\n    criteria:\n      - Surrounded by other azure on all four sides, *or*.\n      - Part of a contiguous azure region in the *output*.\n  - name: preserve_interior\n    description: Keep the correctly identified interior azure pixels.\n  - name: clear_other_pixels\n    description: Set all non-interior pixels to white (0).\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Regions:**  Examine the *input* grid and locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels.\n2.  **Identify Interior Azure Regions:** Examine the output grid. For each azure region, determine if it represents a boundary of an azure region in the *input*. If it is, then these azure pixels should appear in the output.\n3.  **Preserve and Clear:** Create the output grid. Copy the \"interior\" azure pixels to the output grid. Set all other pixels in the output grid to white (0).\n\nEssentially, the rule identifies if the output azure is identifying a 'boundary' or 'border' of an azure shape in the input.\n"
