Red Band Expansion: The transformation rule is to expand the red band downwards. Specifically, copy the existing row of the red band twice, placing the copies immediately below the original red band.\n3. Preservation: All pixels not modified by the expansion remain the same between the input and output. Thus all the white pixels, and the yellow pixels above the red band remain unchanged. The yellow pixels at the bottom are replaced.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_red_band(grid):\n    # Find the row indices where red pixels are present\n    red_rows = np.where(np.any(grid == 2, axis=1))[0]\n    if len(red_rows) > 0:\n        # Assuming the red band is contiguous, return the start and end row\n        return red_rows[0], red_rows[-1]\n    else:\n        return None, None\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find the red band\n    start_row, end_row = find_red_band(input_grid)\n\n    # If red band is not found just return the input.\n    if start_row is None:\n        return output_grid\n    \n    # Get red band row\n    red_band_row = input_grid[start_row, :]\n    \n    # Expand the red band downwards by 2 rows\n    for i in range(1, 3):\n      output_grid[end_row + i, :] = red_band_row\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
