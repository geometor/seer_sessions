Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Objects: Locate the rectangular band of red (2) pixels. Also, note the surrounding yellow (4) and white (0) areas.
2. Red Band Expansion: The transformation rule is to expand the red band downwards. Specifically, copy the existing row of the red band twice, placing the copies immediately below the original red band.
3. Preservation: All pixels not modified by the expansion remain the same between the input and output. Thus all the white pixels, and the yellow pixels above the red band remain unchanged. The yellow pixels at the bottom are replaced.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code worked perfectly for the first example, correctly identifying and expanding the red band. However, it failed on the second example due to an `IndexError`. This indicates that the code, as written, assumes the expanded red band will always fit within the original grid's dimensions. The second example reveals this is not always true, and it extends beyond the original bottom boundary. The solution must ensure the output grid expands and the original contents in the right place within the new sized grid.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 10)
    *   Output Shape: (8, 10)
    *   Red Band Start Row: 4
    *   Red Band End Row: 4
    *   Expansion Amount: 2 rows
    *   Result: Success (Match)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (9, 14)
    *   Output Shape: (9, 14)  *should be (10,14)*
    *   Red Band Start Row: 5
    *   Red Band End Row: 5
    *   Expansion Amount: 2 rows
    *   Result: Failure (IndexError: index 9 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 9) and would cause incorrect colors

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: red
          start_row: 4
          end_row: 4
          action: expand_down
          expand_rows: 2
        - type: background
          color: [white, yellow]
          action: preserve
      grid_change:
        height: same
        width: same
  - example_2:
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: red
          start_row: 5
          end_row: 7
          action: expand_down
          expand_rows: 2
        - type: background
          color: [grey, yellow]
          action: partially preserve
      grid_change:
        height: +1 # observation - needs to increase in height
        width: same
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the horizontal band of red (2) pixels. Note the presence and positions of other colored pixels (background).
2.  **Determine Expansion:** The red band expands downwards by two rows.
3. **Create new grid** If expanding the red band downward would exceed original row dimensions, create new larger output grid.
4.  **Red Band Expansion:** Copy the red band row. Place the first copy immediately below the original red band, and the second copy below the first copy.
5.  **Preserve and Position:** All pixels above the original red band in the input grid, remain at their original positions in the new grid. Pixels below the red band are overwritten by the expansion, and empty space created at bottom from expanding is the same color as those replaced.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
