Previous Code:

"""
1. Identify Objects: Locate the horizontal band of red (2) pixels. Note the presence and positions of other colored pixels (background).
2. Determine Expansion: The red band expands downwards by two rows.
3. Create new grid If expanding the red band downward would exceed original row dimensions, create new larger output grid.
4. Red Band Expansion: Copy the red band row. Place the first copy immediately below the original red band, and the second copy below the first copy.
5. Preserve and Position: All pixels above the original red band in the input grid, remain at their original positions in the new grid. Pixels below the red band are overwritten by the expansion, and empty space created at bottom from expanding is the same color as those replaced.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
