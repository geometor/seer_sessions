The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), red (2), and white (0). The input grid has a horizontal band of red pixels surrounded by yellow pixels, all bordered by white pixels. The output grid maintains the red band and expands it downwards, replacing some of the yellow pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also, note the surrounding yellow (4) and white (0) areas.\n2. **Red Band Expansion**: The transformation rule is to expand the red band downwards. Specifically, copy the existing row of the red band twice, placing the copies immediately below the original red band.\n3. **Preservation:** All pixels not modified by the expansion remain the same between the input and output. Thus all the white pixels, and the yellow pixels above the red band remain unchanged. The yellow pixels at the bottom are replaced.\n\n"
