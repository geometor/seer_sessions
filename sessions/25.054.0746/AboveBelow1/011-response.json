            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the need to preserve the top three rows and blank subsequent rows. It also introduces a crucial exception: preserving the first horizontal line encountered below the top three rows.  However, the code fails in Example 1 and Example 3 because it stops processing further rows *after* encountering the first horizontal line. It needs to blank all rows *below* that preserved horizontal line. Example 2 works correctly only because there are no other rows below the identified horizontal line. The core issue is the premature termination of the blanking process after finding a horizontal line. We need to blank all rows *after* the horizontal line is copied.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Horizontal Line Detection:** The `is_horizontal_line` function is correct and should be kept.\n2.  **Modify Blanking Logic:** Instead of stopping the loop after copying the horizontal line, the loop should continue, but *all* subsequent rows should be set to 0. The `found_horizontal_line` flag controls when the blanking starts.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_shape: [11, 12]\n    output_shape: [11, 12]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 4\n    notes: >\n      The code failed to blank the rows *after* the horizontal line. The 4\n      pixels that don't match are due to keeping rows that should be blanked\n      (specifically, the yellow and black pixels in rows 8-10. Row 3 is\n      correctly kept, and all subsequent rows are incorrectly kept)\n    objects:\n      - type: horizontal_line\n        color: yellow\n        row_index: 2\n      - type: horizontal_line\n        color: red\n        row_index: 6\n      - type: horizontal_line_like\n        color: yellow\n        row_index: 8\n      - type: horizontal_line_like\n        color: yellow\n        row_index: 9\n      - type: horizontal_line_like\n        color: yellow\n        row_index: 10\n\n  - id: 2\n    input_shape: [10, 16]\n    output_shape: [10, 16]\n    match: True\n    pixels_off: 0\n    notes: >\n      The code works correctly because the horizontal line is followed only by\n      rows that are already blank (or should remain blank).\n    objects:\n      - type: horizontal_line\n        color: green\n        row_index: 2\n\n  - id: 3\n    input_shape: [9, 16]\n    output_shape: [9, 16]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 8\n    notes: >\n      The horizontal line at row 3 is preserved correctly, but rows after it are not blanked.\n      The pixels on row 4 that should be blanked are not.\n    objects:\n      - type: horizontal_line\n        color: grey\n        row_index: 3\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy Top Rows:** Copy the first three rows (rows 0, 1, and 2) of the input grid to the output grid without modification.\n2.  **Find Horizontal Line:** Starting from row 3, search for the first horizontal line. A horizontal line is defined as a row where all pixels have the same non-zero color.\n3.  **Preserve Horizontal Line (if found):** If a horizontal line is found, copy that entire row from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid.\n4.  **Blank Subsequent Rows:**  All rows *below* the first three rows, are set to 0 (white).\n5. **Blank Rows After Horizontal Line (if present)**: All rows below the copied horizontal line are set to all 0 (white).\n"
