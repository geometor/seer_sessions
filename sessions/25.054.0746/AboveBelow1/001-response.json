The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), yellow (4), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve removing or deleting certain colored regions based on their shape and position. The overall context appears to be object deletion based on some criteria, in this instance shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
