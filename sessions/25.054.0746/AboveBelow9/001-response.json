Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4). The output grid appears to be a simplified or filtered version of the input grid. Specifically, the green (3) and some parts are removed, but the yellow remains.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
