The input grid contains horizontal and vertical stripes of red (2) and yellow (4) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels. The transformation appears to involve a selective replacement of some red pixels with yellow pixels, specifically at the intersections of the red stripes and the existing yellow stripe.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A stripe is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color along a row or column.\n2.  **Find Intersections:** Determine the points (pixels) where the red stripes intersect the yellow stripe. An intersection occurs where a red pixel in a red stripe is in the same row or column as a section of the horizontal yellow stripe.\n3.  **Color Replacement:** At each intersection point identified in step 2, change the color of the pixel from red (2) to yellow (4).\n4. **Preserve other:** All other pixels should not be changed.\n\nEssentially, the program overlays the red horizontal and vertical stripes. Where the red and yellow overlap, the pixel becomes/remains yellow.\n"
