"""
1. Identify Objects: Divide the input grid into distinct objects, where each object is a contiguous region of pixels of the same color.
2. Find Border Pixels: For each object, identify its border pixels. In this case, a border pixel is defined as a pixel within the object that has a horizontal neighbor (left or right) *that is part of a different object or the edge of the grid*.
3. Determine Trigger and Insert Colors: From the training set inputs and outputs, locate pairs of pixels that are horizontally adjacent. One pixel from each pair will be the *trigger*, and the other will be the *insert*. Record all unique trigger, insert pairs.
4. Conditional Insertion:
    * Iterate through all trigger, insert color pairs found in step 3.
    * Locate the border pixels of each object in the input_grid.
    * If a border pixel is a trigger color, check its immediate horizontal neighbors.
        *  If a horizontal neighbor is not the same as either the *trigger* or *insert* color, change that neighboring pixel's color to the *insert* color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
