Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identify diagonal lines in the input grid. A diagonal line is a sequence of one or more pixels of the same color, where each subsequent pixel is one row down and one column to the right of the previous pixel. For each identified diagonal line, extend the line downwards and to the right. Extension Rule: Add pixels of the *same color* as the original diagonal line. Add one pixel below the last pixel of the diagonal, and one to the right. Continue adding pixels one row down, one column right, until the edges of the grid are reached (either the bottom edge or right edge).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
