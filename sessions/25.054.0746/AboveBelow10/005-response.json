            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly handled the first example, which involved filling to the left of a top-left to bottom-right diagonal. However, the second example revealed a flaw: the filling logic after finding the \"bottom-left to top-right\" diagonal was not handled correctly. The extension logic to fill complete rows applied to all diagonals incorrectly. It should only occur after a bottom-left to top-right diagonal is filled to the right.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Diagonal Filling:** Make sure the filling is happening on the correct side of the diagonal by updating the natural language program and therefore the code.\n2.  **Conditional Extension:** The row extension (filling the remaining rows) should only be applied when the diagonal is from the bottom-left to the top-right, *and* filling is to the right.\n\n**Metrics and Reports:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (11, 14)\n    *   Output Shape: (11, 14)\n    *   Diagonal Direction: Top-Left to Bottom-Right\n    *   Fill Direction: Left\n    *   Color: Yellow (4)\n    *   Match: True\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (11, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (11, 12)\n    *   Diagonal Direction: Bottom-Left to Top-Right\n    *   Fill Direction: Right\n    *   Color: Green (3)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels off: Only rows after the diagonal were extended, the first line with the diagonal was not extended.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    objects:\n      - type: diagonal\n        color: yellow\n        direction: top_left_to_bottom_right\n        fill: left\n    transformation:\n      - fill_left_of_diagonal: yellow\n  - id: 2\n    objects:\n      - type: diagonal\n        color: green\n        direction: bottom_left_to_top_right\n        fill: right\n    transformation:\n      - fill_right_of_diagonal: green\n      - extend_fill_down: true\n\n```\n\n**Updated Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** Determine the target `color` for the diagonal, the `fill_direction` (left or right), and the `diagonal_direction` (top-left to bottom-right, or bottom-left to top-right).\n\n2.  **Locate the Diagonal:** Find the longest diagonal line of pixels matching the target `color` and `diagonal_direction`.\n\n3.  **Fill based on Direction:**\n    *   If `fill_direction` is \"left\", for each row, change all pixels to the *left* of the diagonal pixel in that row to the target `color`.\n    *   If `fill_direction` is \"right\", for each row, change all pixels to the *right* of the diagonal pixel in that row to the target `color`.\n\n4.  **Conditional Extension (Example 2):** If and *only if* the `diagonal_direction` is \"bottom-left to top-right\" AND the `fill_direction` is \"right\", then extend the filling to the bottom of the grid. This means, after filling to the right of the diagonal, continue filling all subsequent rows completely with the target `color`.\n"
