The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), orange (7), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a selective replacement or movement of colored pixels.  The most obvious change is that the second column changes, with a swap of the position of the orange (7).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
