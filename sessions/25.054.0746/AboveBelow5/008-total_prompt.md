**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7995F90382E0>

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of the same dimensions (9x9). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), orange (7), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a selective replacement or movement of colored pixels.  The most obvious change is that the second column changes, with a swap of the position of the orange (7).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    observations:
      - input: Contains a vertical line of yellow (4) pixels in the second column.
      - input: Contains an orange (7) pixel at position (3,2).
      - output: The orange pixel (7) is moved to position (1,2)
      - output: other yellow (4) in column two is at (2,2)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
       - color: yellow (4), orange (7), white (0)
    actions:
      - move:  The orange pixel changes from one y coordinate to another.
      - change: There's something like a swap, or selective fill

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find the orange (7) pixel within the second column of the input grid.
2.  **Move:** if the y position of the orange is > 1, then change the pixel to 7.
3. **Fill**: The yellow 4 fills the original position of the moved orange (7).

In essence, the transformation involves handling the position of an orange (7) pixel in the second column to the top-most available position, replacing its old location with the yellow(4).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
