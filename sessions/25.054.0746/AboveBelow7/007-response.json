The colors present are primarily white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The shapes formed by the azure and red pixels appear to be the primary objects of interest. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. There is a noticeable shift or rearrangement of the azure (8) colored sections.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Move the top-center azure region to the bottom right, adjacent to existing pixels.\n3.  **Red Region Stability:** The red region maintains its shape and relative position within the grid.
