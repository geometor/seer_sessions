Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identifies and isolates green (color 3) objects, setting the rest of the output grid to white (color 0). However, it fails in cases where green objects are not present (Example 2) or when other colored objects should be removed, but aren't considered part of the green objects. The core issue is that the code *only* considers green, it doesn't explicitly remove other non-green objects. The natural language description is partially correct, but needs to more generally describe the process when no green objects are present.

The strategy to address this is:
1.  **Refine object identification (if necessary):** While the current `find_objects` function works, future tasks might require true object finding (grouping any contiguous pixels of the same color). We will keep the current function.
2.  **Modify the transformation logic:** The transformation should explicitly clear all non-green objects.
3. **Improve Natural language program:** Be explicit about all object colors being reset to zero and the green object(s) being copied.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Multiple objects of colors yellow (4), blue (1), red (2), and green (3).
    *   **Expected Output:** Only the green object remains; the rest of the grid is white.
    *   **Actual Output:** Same as expected, *except* where other objects overlap the location of non-green objects.
    *   **Result:** Partially correct. The code correctly identified and placed the green object but didn't clear other parts of the output grid.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Contains objects of colors red (2), yellow (4) and green(3).
    *   **Expected Output:** Only green objects remain. Other pixels are set to white.
    *   **Actual Output:** Only green object remains. The pixels that were *not* green in the input are white.
    *   **Result:** Partially correct. The code correctly identified and placed the green object but didn't clear other parts of the output grid.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Contains objects of colors azure (8), orange (7) and green (3)
    *   **Expected Output:** Only Green objects remain. Other pixels are white.
    *   **Actual Output:** As expected.
    *   **Result:** Correct.

**YAML Block (Facts)**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 4  # Yellow
    present: true
    action: remove
  - color: 1  # Blue
    present: true
    action: remove
  - color: 2  # Red
    present: true
    action: remove
  - color: 3  # Green
    present: true
    action: keep
  - color: 8  # Azure
    present: true
    action: remove
  - color: 7  # Orange
    present: true
    action: remove
background:
  color: 0 # White

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify all objects** within the input grid. An object is defined as a contiguous region of pixels sharing the same color.
2.  **Initialize the output grid** to be the same dimensions as the input grid, and set all pixels to white (color 0).
3.  **Locate Green Objects**: Iterate through all objects found in the input grid. If an object is green (color value 3), copy it to the output grid in the same position.
4. All non-green objects are removed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
