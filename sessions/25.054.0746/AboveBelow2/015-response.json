            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic, only preserving green (3) pixels and setting everything else to white (0). While this worked perfectly for Example 3, it failed on Examples 1 and 2 because it did not preserve the existing background color.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is that the transformation should keep the green pixels and retain a white background. Example 1 has 18 extra white pixels (3x3 and 3x3 block). example 2 misses white, red, and azure pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has green, yellow, blue, and red objects on a white background.\n    *   The code correctly identified and preserved the green object.\n    *    The code did *not* preserve the background, but, coincidentally, the background is the same color as the background of the correct output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a green object, red object, and azure colored objects on a white background.\n    *   Output only contains the green object on white background.\n    *   The code correctly preserved the green object.\n    *   The code did *not* preserve the background, but, coincidentally, the background is the same color as the background of the correct output.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input contains a green object, azure colored objects, and orange colored objects on a white background.\n    *   Output contains only the green object.\n    *   The transformation was correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 014_keep_green_remove_others\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: blue\n        shape: rectangle    \n      - color: red\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: white\n        shape: background\n    output_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: white\n        shape: background\n    transformations:\n      - keep: green\n      - remove: others\n\n  - id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: red\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: white\n        shape: background\n    output_objects:\n        - color: green\n          shape: rectangle\n        - color: white\n          shape: background\n    transformations:\n      - keep: green\n      - remove: others\n\n  - id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: orange\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: white\n        shape: background\n    output_objects:\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n      - color: white\n        shape: background\n    transformations:\n      - keep: green\n      - remove: others\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. Consider these as distinct objects. One of these is the background.\n2.  **Find Green Objects:** Iterate through all the identified objects.\n3.  **Preserve Green, remove the others:** copy the green object to the output grid.\n4. **Set Background Color:** Fill any other pixels (the background) of the output with white (0).\n\nEssentially this is a \"keep only the green objects, and set the background to\nwhite\", or \"remove all objects that are not green, ensure background is white\".\n"
