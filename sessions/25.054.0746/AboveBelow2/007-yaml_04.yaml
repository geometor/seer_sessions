        property: Connected pixels of value 2
      - name: green_region
        color: green (3)

  - relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: |
          Objects are considered adjacent if they share a side (not just a corner).
          This is crucial for determining which objects are removed.
      - condition: red_green_adjacency
        description: The output is identical to the input, except the "red" and "green" regions adjacent to each other are removed.
      - condition: color_removal
        description: If yellow is adjacent to a color that is removed, yellow is also removed.
