The primary colors involved are red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and white (0). The input grid contains connected regions (objects) of these colors, while the output grid seems to be a simplified or filtered version of the input.  Specifically, some colored regions are removed, and their location seems important, as it's based on adjacency.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
