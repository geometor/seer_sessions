            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code focuses on removing adjacent red (2) and green (3) regions. However, the examples show more complex behavior:\n\n1.  **Example 1:** The initial description almost worked, but, it failed to remove the red and green regions correctly. It also include other colors not mentioned (yellow, blue).\n2.  **Example 2:** Shows that only red regions are removed.\n3.  **Example 3:** Illustrates that isolated green objects are kept, and non-green and non-red objects, are removed if no green and red are adjacent, like in this case.\n\nThe core issue is that the adjacency rule is too simplistic. It needs to account for the fact that only red are removed, and other colors will only be erased if no red and green adjacent regions exist.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Adjacency:** Improve the description of the adjacency.\n2.  **Prioritize Removal:** Clarify that only red and green are removed.\n3. **Output**: If no red and green regions are adjacent, only then other colors different to black should be removed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of each example, focusing on relevant details:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Objects: Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4), Blue (1) regions.\n    *   Red and green are adjacents.\n    *   Expected: Only Green(3), Yellow(4) and Black(0) remain.\n    *   Observed: Failed to remove Red and Green. Kept Yellow(4) and also Blue(1).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects: Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4) regions.\n    *   Red and Green regions are adjacents.\n    *    Expected: Keep only Green(3), Red(2) and Black (0).\n    *   Observed: Failed to remove Red(2). Kept Green(3), Yellow (4) and Black(0).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Objects: Green (3), Azure (8), and Maroon(7).\n    *   No red and green adjacency.\n    *   Expected: Keep only the Green(3) regions.\n    *   Observed: Failed to remove other colors (Azure and Maroon)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - color: 2  # Red\n      adjacent_to: 3  # Green\n    - color: 3  # Green\n      adjacent_to: 2  # Red\n    - color: 4 #yellow\n    - color: 1 #blue\n  action: remove_adjacent\n\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - color: 2  # Red\n      adjacent_to: 3  # Green\n    - color: 3  # Green\n      adjacent_to: 2 #red\n    - color: 4 #yellow\n  action: remove_adjacent\n\nexample_3:\n  objects:\n    - color: 3  # Green\n      adjacent_to: null\n    - color: 7 #maroon\n    - color: 8 #azure\n  action: remove_non_green_if_no_red_green_adjacent\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of red (2), green (3), and any other colors present in the grid.\n\n2.  **Check Red and Green Adjacency:** Determine if any red regions are directly adjacent (not diagonally) to any green regions.\n\n3.  **Conditional Removal (Red and Green):** If any red region is directly adjacent to any green region, remove *both* the red and green regions entirely.\n\n4.  **Conditional Removal (Other Colors):** If *no* red regions are directly adjacent to any green regions, remove all regions of colors other than green(3) and black(0).\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid contains: black (0), the green regions if no red and green are adjacent, and the other regions if red and green are adjacent.\n"
