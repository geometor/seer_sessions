            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies rectangular objects and filters based on color. However, it's too strict. It only *keeps* green and yellow, while the examples show it should keep green and *sometimes* yellow, or azure. In example 2, the yellow rectangle is removed when it should be. The consistent rule across all valid examples seems to be: Keep Green objects.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Color Filtering:** Modify the natural language program to focus solely on retaining green rectangles.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Object Definition:** Ensure the object finding is robust and handles various shapes, but currently, only rectangles are in the data, so focus on them.\n3. **Remove other colors**\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains red, blue, yellow, and green rectangles.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Only the green and one of the yellow rectangles are retained.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Green and both yellow rectangles are retained.\n    *   **Issue:** The program includes all yellow objects.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains red, yellow and green rectangles.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Removes all of the red and yellow rectangles and keeps only the green\n    *   **Actual Output:** Keeps the green rectangle, but also keeps a yellow rectangle.\n    *    **Issue:** The program includes yellow, when it should not.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains azure, orange, and green rectangles.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Only the green rectangle is retained.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Only the green rectangle is retained.\n    *   **Issue:** No issues, this example worked perfectly.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    objects_identified:\n      - color: red\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: blue\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: keep\n  - example: 2\n    objects_identified:\n      - color: red\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: keep\n  - example: 3\n    objects_identified:\n      - color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: orange\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: remove\n      - color: green\n        shape: rectangle\n        action: keep\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color (excluding white/0).\n2.  **Selective Retention:** Retain green rectangles.\n3.  **Removal:** Remove all other color rectangles.\n4.  **Output:** Produce a new grid with the selected color areas (green) retained and all others replaced with the background (white/0).\n"
