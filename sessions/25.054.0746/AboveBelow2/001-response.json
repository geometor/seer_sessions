The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). White (0) appears to act as a background or empty space. The output seems to retain some of the original colored rectangles while removing others. The decision of which to keep, and which to remove is not based on color, only the green and yellow remain.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
