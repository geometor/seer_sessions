The transformation rule is a color substitution cipher. Each pixel's color in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding color in the output grid according to a fixed mapping.  The mapping is as follows:

- Blue (1) becomes Gray (5).
- Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
- Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
- Yellow (4) becomes Green (3).
- Gray (5) becomes Blue (1).
- Magenta (6) becomes Red (2).
- Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).
- Maroon (9) becomes Azure (8).

The position of the pixel within the grid does not affect the transformation.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
