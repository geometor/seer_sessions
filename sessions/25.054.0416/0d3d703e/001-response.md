Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color (as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`). The transformation seems to involve incrementing each integer in the input grid by a fixed value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer value

actions:
  - type: increment
    target: grid elements
    properties:
      - amount: constant

relationships:
  - input grid elements map to output grid elements by increment
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Add 1 to each integer in the input grid.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of integers, where each value is the corresponding input value plus 1.

Essentially the transformation is very direct: Add one to every cell in the grid to get the output grid.
