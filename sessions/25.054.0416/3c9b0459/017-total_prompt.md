The transformation rule varies between the examples.

- Example 1: Swap the first and last rows of the input grid. Then reverse the first and last rows.
- Example 2: Reverse each row of the input grid.
- Example 3: Shift each row downwards cyclically. The first row becomes the last row, the second row becomes the first, and the third row becomes the second.
- Example 4: Swap the first and last rows of the input grid. Reverse the first and last rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
