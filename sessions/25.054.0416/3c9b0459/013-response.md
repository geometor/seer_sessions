Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colored pixels. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid. The colors involved are azure (8) and gray (5).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [5, 8]

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
 - subject: grid
   predicate: rotated
   object: rotated_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.
