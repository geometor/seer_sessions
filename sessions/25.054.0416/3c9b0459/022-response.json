            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information, an assessment of the results, and a strategy for moving forward, along with the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to analyze the differences between input, expected output, and a (currently incorrect) transformed output. However, the `transformed` output in each example is not actually a transformation of the input; it's just a variation of the original input, demonstrating that no actual transformation logic has been implemented yet. The `analyze_changes` function correctly identifies the differences, but that's all. The important next step is to use these differences to build a rule. It is also important to separate the diagonals.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on a Single Rule:** The primary goal is to find a *single* rule that consistently explains the transformation across *all* examples.\n2.  **Diagonals:** Recognize the importance of diagonals in this task. The transformation involves a specific type of reflection.\n3.  **Object Properties:** The core \"objects\" here are the individual pixels and their colors. The relationships are their positions within the grid.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** I need to formulate a hypothesis, describe it in natural language, translate that into a hypothetical `transform` function, and then compare the `transformed` output with the `expected` output.\n\n**Metrics and Reports:**\n\nSince the \"transformed\" results are incorrect, metrics based on them are not yet useful. The error information gives useful data.\n\n**Example 1**\n```\nCoordinates Changed in Expected Output:\n  (0, 0): Input=2, Expected=1\n  (0, 2): Input=1, Expected=2\n  (2, 0): Input=2, Expected=1\n  (2, 1): Input=8, Expected=2\n  (2, 2): Input=1, Expected=2\n\nCoordinates Changed in Transformed Output (Current Code):\n  (2, 0): Input=2, Transformed=8\n  (2, 1): Input=8, Transformed=2\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n```\nCoordinates Changed in Expected Output:\n  (0, 0): Input=9, Expected=2\n  (0, 1): Input=2, Expected=9\n  (0, 2): Input=4, Expected=2\n  (2, 0): Input=2, Expected=4\n  (2, 1): Input=9, Expected=2\n  (2, 2): Input=2, Expected=9\n\nCoordinates Changed in Transformed Output (Current Code):\n  (2, 0): Input=2, Transformed=9\n  (2, 2): Input=2, Transformed=2\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n```\nCoordinates Changed in Expected Output:\n  (0, 0): Input=8, Expected=5\n  (0, 1): Input=8, Expected=5\n  (0, 2): Input=8, Expected=8\n  (1, 0): Input=5, Expected=8\n  (1, 1): Input=5, Expected=5\n  (1, 2): Input=8, Expected=5\n  (2, 0): Input=8, Expected=8\n  (2, 1): Input=5, Expected=8\n  (2, 2): Input=5, Expected=8\n\nCoordinates Changed in Transformed Output (Current Code):\n  (2, 0): Input=8, Transformed=5\n  (2, 1): Input=5, Transformed=8\n  (2, 2): Input=5, Transformed=5\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n```\nCoordinates Changed in Expected Output:\n  (0, 1): Input=2, Expected=3\n  (0, 2): Input=9, Expected=2\n  (2, 0): Input=2, Expected=9\n  (2, 1): Input=3, Expected=2\n\nCoordinates Changed in Transformed Output (Current Code):\n  (2, 0): Input=2, Transformed=3\n  (2, 2): Input=3, Transformed=3\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The transformation involves reflecting the grid along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) *separately*.\n\n  - object_types:\n      - pixels: Individual cells in the grid, each with a color value.\n\n  - relationships:\n      - diagonal_symmetry:  Pixels equidistant from the main diagonal and anti-diagonal have their colors swapped *independently* for both diagonals.\n\n  - actions:\n    - reflect_main_diagonal: |\n        Pixels' colors are swapped across the main diagonal. The pixel at (r, c) swaps colors with the pixel at (c, r).\n    - reflect_anti_diagonal: |\n        Pixels colors are swapped across the anti-diagonal. The pixel at (r,c) swaps with the pixel at (N-1-c, N-1-r), where N is the size of the grid if square.\n  - constraints:\n      -  The transformation preserves the overall grid dimensions.\n      -  The number of pixels of each color may change.\n      -  The core transformation is a reflection along two different diagonals independently.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Diagonals:** The grid has a main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and an anti-diagonal(top-right to bottom-left).\n2.  **Reflect Main Diagonal:** For every pixel in the grid, swap its color with the color of the pixel that is its reflection across the *main* diagonal. The pixel at row `r`, column `c` swaps colors with the pixel at row `c`, column `r`.\n3. **Reflect Anti-Diagonal:** For every pixel in the grid, swap its color with the color of the pixel that is its reflection across the *anti* diagonal. The pixel at row `r`, column `c` swaps colors with the pixel at row `N-1-c`, column `N-1-r`, where `N` is the dimension of the square grid.\n4.  **Independent Operations**: Perform steps 2 and 3 independently. Do not make assumptions about order of operations, consider that reflection may occur for the same pixel on both diagonals.\n\nThe key insight here is separating the reflection into two distinct operations.\n"
