# Example

**input:**
```
8 8 8
5 5 8
8 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C764B880>

**output:**
```
5 5 8
8 5 5
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C76EEB60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colored pixels. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid. The colors involved are azure (8) and gray (5).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [5, 8]

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
 - subject: grid
   predicate: rotated
   object: rotated_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
