# Example

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C764B880>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C74737F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer represents a color. The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid, as the relative positions of the numbers change. Specifically, it appears the grid is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise. The colors (represented by integers) remain consistent between the input and output; only their positions change.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    transformation: rotation
    rotation_direction: counter-clockwise
    rotation_angle: 90 degrees
    input_corner_top_left:
        value: 2
        output_position: top_right
    input_corner_top_right:
        value: 1
        output_position: bottom_right
    input_corner_bottom_right:
        value: 1
        output_position: bottom_left
    input_corner_bottom_left:
        value: 2
        output_position: top_left

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  Each cell in the input grid maps directly to a corresponding cell in the output grid based on this rotation. The values within the cells (representing colors) are preserved during the transformation. No colors are added, removed, or changed, and the relative relationships, only its orientation, is changed.

That's my current assessment. It would be beneficial now to use the `tool_code` to see if these images are used in any other context, so I can confirm the structure of data used in all these tasks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
