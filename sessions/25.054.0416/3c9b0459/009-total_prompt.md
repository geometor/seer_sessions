Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid. Elements maintain their color, each moving to their corresponding new location as dictated by the rotation.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input list of lists to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise.  np.rot90 uses k=-1 for clockwise.
    output_np = np.rot90(input_np, k=-1)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_np.tolist()

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
