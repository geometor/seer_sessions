facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves reflecting the grid along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) *separately*.

  - object_types:
      - pixels: Individual cells in the grid, each with a color value.

  - relationships:
      - diagonal_symmetry:  Pixels equidistant from the main diagonal and anti-diagonal have their colors swapped *independently* for both diagonals.

  - actions:
    - reflect_main_diagonal: |
        Pixels' colors are swapped across the main diagonal. The pixel at (r, c) swaps colors with the pixel at (c, r).
    - reflect_anti_diagonal: |
        Pixels colors are swapped across the anti-diagonal. The pixel at (r,c) swaps with the pixel at (N-1-c, N-1-r), where N is the size of the grid if square.
  - constraints:
      -  The transformation preserves the overall grid dimensions.
      -  The number of pixels of each color may change.
      -  The core transformation is a reflection along two different diagonals independently.
