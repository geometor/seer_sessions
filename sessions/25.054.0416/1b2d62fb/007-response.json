There's a prominent vertical line of '1' (blue) pixels. Other colors present are '0' (white) and '9' (maroon).\n*   **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid. It seems to capture a simplified representation of a region from the input.  The color '8'(azure) represents a replaced color and '0'(white) means background.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to focus on a specific feature of the input (the vertical blue line) and its immediate surroundings. The output is much smaller, indicating some form of abstraction or summarization.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
