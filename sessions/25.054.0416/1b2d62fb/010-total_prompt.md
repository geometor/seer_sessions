Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identifies the vertical blue line and attempts to extract a 3-pixel wide region to its right. However, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs across all examples. The primary issue is that the transformation logic is not just about changing the color - but that cells keep the original color or becomes '8' base on the input.

The strategy to resolve the errors involves:

1.  **Re-evaluating the Transformation Rule**: Instead of converting every pixel to Azure, check whether the cell is other than '0'.
2.  **Output:** The output should contains only the 3 columns.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a summary of observations from each example:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Blue Line Column | Key Observations                                                                                                     |

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate**: Find the vertical line of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Define Region:** A region of interest will be the same height as input and start from the immediate right of blue line, with width of 3
3. **Transform**: If the region to extract has cell with value other than '0', change it to '8'.
4.  **Output**: Create a new grid that represents the extracted region.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
