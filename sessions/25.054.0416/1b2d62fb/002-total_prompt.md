# Example

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 9 1 9 9 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 0
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7C67C74CA020>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7C67C74CA380>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a prominent vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the center. The output grid seems to focus on a small section of the input grid and replaces the blue (1) pixels with azure (8) pixels. The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It appears that a specific region is extracted and modified.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 9, 1] # white, maroon, blue
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - features:
        - vertical_line:
            color: 1 # blue
            location: center_column
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 8] # white, azure
      - dimensions: 5x3
      - relationship_to_input: "subset and modified"
  - action: extraction
    description: "A 3x5 subgrid is extracted from around the feature of interest (central blue line)"
  - action: modification
    description: "Within extracted subgrid, replace blue(1) color with azure color(8)"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the central feature:** Find the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. It is in the center column.
2.  **Extract a region:** Extract a 5x3 region (a subgrid) from the input. The region of extraction seem to correspond with two row below and two rows above the first occurance of blue. The extraction is always 3 wide and is centered on the central feature.
3.  **Modify colors:** Within this extracted subgrid, locate blue pixels (value 1).
4.  **Replace Color**: Change value of any pixel with the value of 1 to have a value of 8.
5.  **Output:** The modified 3x5 subgrid is the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
