observations:
  - object: blue_stripe
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      shape: vertical_line
      input_location: variable column
    behavior:
      transformation: color change to azure (8)
      output_location: appears to follow a diagonal, alternating pattern within a 3-column grid.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      width: 3
      height: same as input
      background_color: white (0)
    behavior:
      pixel_placement: azure pixels are placed based on a rule related to the blue stripe's location in the input.

  - overall_transformation: |
      The input grid's blue vertical stripe is extracted.  The blue color is
      mapped to azure. A 3-column wide output grid is created, with height
      equal to the input. The azure pixels are placed in the output grid
      based on a diagonal, alternating pattern, starting at the top-left
      output, stepping down and to the right, wrapping around the 3 width
      output. All other output pixels are white.

inconsistencies:
  - The current code always places the azure stripe in the center column, which is incorrect.
  - The current code only sets the color to azure (8).
