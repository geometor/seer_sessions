Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both 2D grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid is wider than the output grid. It seems like columns are being removed. The height remains the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2D
      elements: integers (representing colors)
  - type: column
    properties:
      elements: integers
      position: index (within the grid)

actions:
  - name: remove_column
    parameters:
      position: index

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: columns are arranged horizontally
  - type: transformation
    relation: input grid transforms to output grid by removing columns
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by removing columns from the input. Specifically, columns at indices 2, 4, and 6 (starting the count at 1) are removed, or, more generally, every other column starting with the second, is removed. The output consists of columns 1,3, and 5. The output grid retains the height of the input grid, and the color/values are preserved in the remaining columns.
