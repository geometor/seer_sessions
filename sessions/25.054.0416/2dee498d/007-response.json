The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a downscaling or extraction process. The colors and their spatial arrangement seem crucial. The specific transformation appears to involve taking a 3x3 section of the input and producing a corresponding 1x1 pixel in the output, effectively summarizing or representing that section.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
