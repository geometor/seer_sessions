# Example

**input:**
```
2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x256 at 0x7C67C764B8E0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7C67C764B9D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a downscaling or extraction process. The colors and their spatial arrangement seem crucial. The specific transformation appears to involve taking a 3x3 section of the input and producing a corresponding 1x1 pixel in the output, effectively summarizing or representing that section.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: input (4x12), output (4x4)
      - elements: pixels
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] # white, blue, red, yellow

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.
  - name: reduce_to_pixel
    description: Transforms a 3x3 subgrid into a single pixel in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The input grid contains multiple non-overlapping 3x3 subgrids that map directly to individual pixels in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into contiguous, non-overlapping 3x3 subgrids.
2.  **Reduce:** For each 3x3 subgrid, extract the color of the top-left pixel in that subgrid.
3.  **Construct:** Place the extracted pixel in the output grid, maintaining the relative spatial arrangement of the subgrids. In other words, if you treat the input as a series of 3x3 blocks the output is the color of the top-left element in each block.

Essentially the operation is taking every 3x3 section of the input, selecting the top left element, and using that to build the ouput


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
