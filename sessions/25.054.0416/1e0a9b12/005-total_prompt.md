Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extract all non-zero elements from the input grid and place them in order on the last row of the output grid, which is the same size as the input. All rows are shifted upward a number of rows equal to the number of rows containing at least on nonzero value.

import numpy as np

    # Create output grid of the same size as input, filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    
    # Extract non-zero elements, preserving order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
    non_zero_elements = input_grid[input_grid != 0]
    
    # Count rows with at least one non-zero element
    rows_with_non_zero = np.any(input_grid != 0, axis=1)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
