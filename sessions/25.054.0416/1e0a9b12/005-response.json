            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the errors and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code were on the right track conceptually: identifying non-zero elements and rearranging them. However, the code has a critical flaw: it doesn't correctly handle the placement of non-zero elements when their count exceeds the width of the grid, resulting in a \"broadcast\" error. The logic of shifting *empty* rows up is not part of all of the examples. The placement of the nonzero elements at the very end is correct.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** The errors in all three examples stem from attempting to assign more non-zero elements to the last row than its width allows.\n2.  **Revised Logic:** The core idea of collecting non-zero elements is good. The placement logic needs fixing. We also need to eliminate or rethink shifting.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program description to accurately capture the transformation *without* shifting rows and with correct collection.\n4. **Metrics:** We need to capture the grid width and non-zero element count in each example.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Results**\nI'll use a simple representation to log relevant info:\n\n*   **Example:** Example number.\n*   **Grid Width:** Width of the input/output grids.\n*   **Non-zero Count:** Number of non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\n| Example | Grid Width | Non-zero Count |\n| ------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| 1       | 4          | 5              |\n| 2       | 6          | 8              |\n| 3       | 5          | 7              |\n\nThese metrics directly explain the errors. In each case, `Non-zero Count` > `Grid Width`.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts and Observations**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_grid_size: [4, 4]\n    output_grid_size: [4, 4]\n    input_non_zero_count: 5\n    output_non_zero_count: 5\n    actions:\n      - collect_non_zero:\n          description: \"All non-zero pixels are identified in the input.\"\n          from: input_grid\n          to: temporary_collection\n      - arrange_last_row:\n         description: \"Non-zero pixels are arranged on the last row.

Effectively, the non-zero elements are placed from the bottom-right, and then filling left and upward as needed.\n4. **All other cells are zero:** Any cells in the output grid not filled with a non-zero pixel should have the value 0. The output and input grids are the same size.\n"
