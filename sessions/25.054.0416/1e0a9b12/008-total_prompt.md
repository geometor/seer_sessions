# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7C67C764B8E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 0
4 0 7 8 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7C67C764B9D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers, where each integer represents a color. The input grid transforms into the output grid. The primary change appears to be related to the position and potentially the presence of specific colored objects within the grid. Some colors seem persistent, while others are added or moved. Specifically, the maroon '9' at the top right corner appears to moves to the bottom right. The azure '8' stays and some elements (like the triple yellow block) do not move.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
    dimensions: 6x6
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
  - type: color_object
    color: yellow
    description: A vertical block of three yellow (4) pixels remains unchanged.
  - type: color_object
    color: orange
    description:  An orange (7) pixel is in both.
  - type: color_object
    color: azure
    description: An azure (8) pixel is in both.
  - type: color_object
    color: maroon
    description: A maroon (9) pixel is in both, but changes position.
  - type: movement
    object: maroon (9)
    from: top_right
    to: bottom_right
  - type: stationary_object
    color: yellow (4)
    description: The position and the shape is the same in input and output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Persistent Objects:** Recognize the vertical block of three yellow (4) pixels on the left side. This object remains unchanged in position and shape between input and output. Also locate single orange (7) and azure (8) pixels to the right of that block.
2.  **Identify Moving Object:** The maroon (9) pixel located in the top-right corner of the input grid moves to the bottom-right corner in the output grid.
3.  **Construct Output:** Reconstruct the grid with the three yellow pixels at the same location as in input. Maintain the (7) and (8) pixels. Move the maroon pixel from top-right to bottom right. All other grid spaces are filled with white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
