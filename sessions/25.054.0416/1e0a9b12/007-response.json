The input grid transforms into the output grid. The primary change appears to be related to the position and potentially the presence of specific colored objects within the grid. Some colors seem persistent, while others are added or moved. Specifically, the maroon '9' at the top right corner appears to moves to the bottom right. The azure '8' stays and some elements (like the triple yellow block) do not move.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
