The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a combination of duplication and rearrangement of certain rows or columns. The overall shape, i.e. the grid, changes. Some of the relative positions of the colors are kept the same, while others are changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Duplicate these rows, taking the whole 3 x 4 grid, doubling all of the rows, to arrive at 6 x 4 grid.\n3. **Rearrange rows**. Take the original 2nd row and move to the final row, so insert a copy of row 2 after row 6. Take the original 3rd row and insert a copy between rows 3 and 4.\n\n"
