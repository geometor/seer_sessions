Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers, where each number represents a color. The primary color observed is '0' (white) and '8' (azure).  The transformation seems to involve a very subtle change related to the azure objects.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_region_1
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular
      initial_position:  [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
      final_position: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
  - object: azure_region_2
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular
      initial_position: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
      final_position: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  - change: single_azure_to_blue
    location:
     - input_grid: [1,2]
       output_grid: [1,2]
       new_value: 1
     - input_grid: [4,4]
       output_grid: [4,4]
       new_value: 1
  - grid_size:
      rows: 7
      columns: 7
  - background_color: white (0)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Check adjacency:** For every azure pixel, find the number of adjacent azure pixels
3. **Change one pixel:** working left to right, top to bottom, for each region of azure pixels, change the color of the first azure pixel that does not have an adjacent azure pixel above or to the left, to blue.
