Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequent code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code provides a useful framework for comparing input, expected output, and transformed output grids. However, it doesn't yet implement any transformation logic.  The provided "transformed" outputs are incorrect, and simply mirroring/duplicating parts of the input grid in different ways. The key is to identify the *rule* that consistently transforms each input to its corresponding expected output. The provided analysis function `analyze_example` is helpful for diagnosing differences, but we need to shift our focus to *inferring* the transformation rule itself. The initial attempt in the code seems to hint at a kind of mirroring or reflection, but it's misapplied and incomplete. A better strategy is needed to account for the doubled size.

The core challenge lies in understanding how the input grid is expanded and filled in the output grid.  Simple mirroring isn't sufficient. We need to carefully examine the placement of original input pixels within the larger output grid, and identify how the empty space is managed.

**Metrics and Reports (via `analyze_example` output interpretation)**

Here's a breakdown of the provided `analyze_example` output, extracting key information:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   **Match:** `False` (Transformed output does not match expected output)
    *   **Pixels Off:** 22
    *   **Size Correct:** `False` (Transformed output is 3x8, expected output is 6x8)
*   **Example 2:**

    *   **Match:** `False`
    *   **Pixels Off:** 32
    *   **Size Correct:** `False` (Transformed output is 6x8, expected output is 6x8, but pixel values are not correctly positioned)
*   **Example 3:**

    *   **Match:** `False`
    *   **Pixels Off:** 28
    *   **Size Correct:**`False`

From analyzing the dimensions and `Pixels off` number, it's clear all are incorrect, in different ways. The transformed examples 1 and 3 swap rows and columns of similar copies. Transformed example 2 keeps input dimension, but doubles values and places in the wrong positions.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_shape: [3, 4]
    output_shape: [6, 8]
    transformation: "Duplicate and interleave input, creating a mirrored pattern."
    objects:
      - name: "Input Block"
        type: "rectangle"
        properties:
          colors: [0, 8] # white, azure
    actions: [duplicate, interleave, mirror]
  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: [3, 4]
    output_shape: [6, 8]
    transformation: "Duplicate and interleave, with color preservation."
    objects:
      - name: "Input Block"
        type: "rectangle"
        properties:
          colors: [0, 3] # white, green
    actions: [duplicate, interleave]
  - example_id: 3
    input_shape: [3, 4]
    output_shape: [6, 8]
    transformation: "Duplicate rows and columns, maintaining color positions."
    objects:
     - name: "Input Block"
       type: "rectangle"
       properties:
         colors: [3, 0] #green, white
    actions: [duplicate, expand]

general_rule: "The input grid's rows and columns are duplicated to double the size of the output grid. The original input appears in the top-left quadrant of the output, mirrored horizontally and vertically and also in diagonal."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Duplication:** The input grid is conceptually duplicated both horizontally and vertically. Imagine making four copies of the input grid.
2.  **Arrangement:** These four copies are arranged to form a larger 2x2 grid of grids.
    *   The original input grid is placed in the top-left quadrant.
    *   A horizontally mirrored copy of the input is placed in the top-right quadrant.
    *   A vertically mirrored copy of the input is placed in the bottom-left quadrant.
    *   A diagonally mirrored copy (equivalent to horizontal + vertical mirroring, or a 180-degree rotation) is placed in the bottom-right quadrant.
3. **Output:** The combined grid constitutes the output.

In simpler terms. Copy the input. Flip it horizontally to the right. Flip original vertically to the bottom. Flip the copy on the right also vertically to the bottom right. Combine all together.
