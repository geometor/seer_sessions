            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the previous code's behavior to formulate a precise natural language description of the transformation.\n\n**Observations from the Examples and Code Output:**\n\n1.  **Target Color:** The transformation focuses on pixels of color azure (8).\n2.  **Isolation Check:** The core concept is determining if an azure pixel is \"isolated.\"  An isolated azure pixel does *not* touch any other azure pixel, even diagonally.  This is correctly implemented in the `is_alone` function.\n3.  **Color Change:** Isolated azure pixels are changed to blue (1).\n4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels remain unchanged.\n5. Code execution reveals a bug, the isolation logic is applied correctly but the code fails to update the output grid.\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will become the output grid.\n2.  **Azure Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid.\n3.  **Isolation Check:** For each pixel in the *input* grid, check if it is azure (8). If it is, determine if it's isolated using the `is_alone` function, and using the *original* `input_grid`.\n4. **Conditional Color Change:**\n    - If a pixel is azure *and* determined to be isolated (based on input), change the corresponding pixel in the `output_grid` to blue (1).\n    - Otherwise, make *no change* to the `output_grid`, keeping the original pixel value.\n5. **Output:** After iterating through all pixels, the `output_grid` now represents the transformed grid.\n\n**Key improvements in the Description:**\n\n*   **Explicitly states the need for a copy:**  The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid. This is crucial for correctly applying the transformation.\n*   **Reinforces the input_grid is used for checks**: The isolation check uses the *original* input, but updates happen in the output copy.\n*   States the other colors are unchanged.\n\nThe core issue with the original code's behavior wasn't the isolation logic itself, but that not all azure pixels were transformed when they were isolated.\n\nThis improved description captures that logic more accurately and provides the correct instructions.\n"
