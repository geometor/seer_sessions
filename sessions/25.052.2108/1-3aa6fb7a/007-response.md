Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and provide a natural language description of the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects of interest are individual pixels colored azure (8).

2.  **Property Check (Adjacency/Isolation):** For each azure pixel, we examine its immediate neighborhood (including diagonals). We determine if an azure pixel is "isolated" or "alone". An azure pixel is considered "alone" if *none* of its eight neighboring pixels are also azure.

3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If an azure pixel is determined to be "alone" (based on the adjacency check), its color is changed to blue (1).
    *   If an azure pixel is *not* "alone" (i.e., it has at least one adjacent azure neighbor), its color remains unchanged (azure, 8).

4.  **Unchanged Pixels:** All pixels that are *not* azure in the input grid remain completely unchanged in the output grid. Their colors and positions are preserved.

**In summary:** The transformation identifies isolated azure pixels and changes their color to blue, while leaving all other pixels (including non-isolated azure pixels) as they were. It's a targeted color change based on a local neighborhood property.

**Addressing the Failed Examples**

The problem in the current code is not correctly identifying isolated pixels because it's not updating. The `is_alone` function is only checking the input grid, we need to be checking for changes in the grid as we go.
