Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation. Here's my plan:

1.  **Examine the Grids:** I'll visually inspect the input and output grids, noting the positions and colors of the pixels. I'll pay close attention to any changes.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Based on the "objectness" prior, I'll consider contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as objects.
3.  **Describe Changes:** I'll describe how the objects in the input grid have changed in the output grid. This might involve changes in color, position, size, or shape.
4. **Formulate NL Program:** I will write a concise natural language program of the transformation.

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:


```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [7, 7]
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
          shape: irregular, two separate blobs
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [7, 7]
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
          shape: irregular, two separate blobs
        - color: blue (1)
          positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
          shape: two single pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  Locate azure pixels that are alone, meaning that they do not touch any other azure pixel, even diagonally.
3.  Change the color of those single azure pixels to blue (1).
4. All other pixels remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
