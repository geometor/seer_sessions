```python
"""
1.  Identify Azure Pixels: Examine each pixel in the input grid. Identify pixels that have the color azure (8).

2.  Check for Isolation: For each azure pixel, determine if it is "isolated". An azure pixel is isolated if it does *not* touch any other azure pixel, including diagonally. This check must be performed against the original `input_grid`.

3.  Change Color of Isolated Pixels: If an azure pixel is determined to be isolated (based on the original input grid), change its color to blue (1) in the `output_grid`.

4.  Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (non-isolated azure pixels, and pixels of any other color) retain their original color in the `output_grid`.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
