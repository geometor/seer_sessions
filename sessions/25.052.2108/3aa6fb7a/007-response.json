            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and provide a natural language description of the transformation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects of interest are individual pixels colored azure (8).\n\n2.  **Property Check (Adjacency/Isolation):** For each azure pixel, we examine its immediate neighborhood (including diagonals). We determine if an azure pixel is \"isolated\" or \"alone\". An azure pixel is considered \"alone\" if *none* of its eight neighboring pixels are also azure.\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   If an azure pixel is determined to be \"alone\" (based on the adjacency check), its color is changed to blue (1).\n    *   If an azure pixel is *not* \"alone\" (i.e., it has at least one adjacent azure neighbor), its color remains unchanged (azure, 8).\n\n4.  **Unchanged Pixels:** All pixels that are *not* azure in the input grid remain completely unchanged in the output grid. Their colors and positions are preserved.\n\n**In summary:** The transformation identifies isolated azure pixels and changes their color to blue, while leaving all other pixels (including non-isolated azure pixels) as they were. It's a targeted color change based on a local neighborhood property.\n\n**Addressing the Failed Examples**\n\nThe problem in the current code is not correctly identifying isolated pixels because it's not updating. The `is_alone` function is only checking the input grid, we need to be checking for changes in the grid as we go.\n"
