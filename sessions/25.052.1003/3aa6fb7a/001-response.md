Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
    grid_size: (7,7)
  output_grid:
     objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (1,2)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (4,5)
    grid_size: (7,7)

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** The two L-shaped azure objects in the input are preserved in the output grid, with no change in their shape, size, or position.

3.  **Insertion Points:** A blue (1) cell is placed immediately to the right of the "tip" of the vertical section of each azure L-shape. The tip is the single cell at one end of the L shape. For instance, with the first object with top left corner at (1,1), the tip is at (1,2). And at (1,2), the inserted blue cell is found. With the second L-shape object with the top left corner at (3,4), the tip is at (4,6), and in output, we can see a new blue cell at (4,5).

**Natural Language Program**
```
1. Copy all L shapes of azure color from the input to the output
2. For each L shape of azure color, find out their corresponding tip coordinates.
3. Insert a blue cell at the found tip coordinate.
```
