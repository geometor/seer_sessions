The tip is the single cell at one end of the L shape. For instance, with the first object with top left corner at (0,4), the tip is at (1,5). At (1,4), the inserted blue cell is found. With the second L-shape object with the top left corner at (2,2), the tip is at (3,2). And at output, we have the inserted blue cell at (2,3), and so on.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n```\n1. Copy all L shapes of azure color from the input to the output\n2. For each L shape of azure color, find out their corresponding tip coordinates.\n3. Insert a blue cell at the found tip coordinate.\n```\n\nThe natural language program, observations, and the python code developed using the first example accurately captures and executes the described transformation also in the second example.\n"
