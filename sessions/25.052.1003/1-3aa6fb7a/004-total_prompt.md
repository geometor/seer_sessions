Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
    grid_size: (7,7)
  output_grid:
     objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the L
        size: 3 cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (1,2)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (4,5)
    grid_size: (7,7)

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find two L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** The two L-shaped azure objects in the input are preserved in the output grid, with no change in their shape, size, or position.

3.  **Insertion Points:** A blue (1) cell is placed immediately to the right of the "tip" of the vertical section of each azure L-shape. The tip is the single cell at one end of the L shape. For instance, with the first object with top left corner at (1,1), the tip is at (1,2). And at (1,2), the inserted blue cell is found. With the second L-shape object with the top left corner at (3,4), the tip is at (4,6), and in output, we can see a new blue cell at (4,5).

**Natural Language Program**
```
1. Copy all L shapes of azure color from the input to the output
2. For each L shape of azure color, find out their corresponding tip coordinates.
3. Insert a blue cell at the found tip coordinate.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml

    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (0,4)  # Top-left corner of the L

        shape: 'L-shape'
        position: (5,3)
        size: 3
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (1,4)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (2,3)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: 'single cell'
        position: (5,3)
    grid_size: (7,7)

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we find three L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** The three L-shaped azure objects in the input are preserved in the output grid, with no change in their shape, size, or position.

3.  **Insertion Points:** A blue (1) cell is placed immediately to the right of the "tip" of the vertical section of each azure L-shape. The tip is the single cell at one end of the L shape. For instance, with the first object with top left corner at (0,4), the tip is at (1,5). At (1,4), the inserted blue cell is found. With the second L-shape object with the top left corner at (2,2), the tip is at (3,2). And at output, we have the inserted blue cell at (2,3), and so on.

**Natural Language Program**

```
1. Copy all L shapes of azure color from the input to the output
2. For each L shape of azure color, find out their corresponding tip coordinates.
3. Insert a blue cell at the found tip coordinate.
```

The natural language program, observations, and the python code developed using the first example accurately captures and executes the described transformation also in the second example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
