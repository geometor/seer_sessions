Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 5 (gray)
        shape: Irregular, but roughly a mirrored 'L' shape
        position: Centered, spanning multiple rows and columns
        size: 16 cells
  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: Similar to input, but with some cells replaced
        position: Same as input
        size: 8
    - object_2:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: Replaces cells of gray object
      size: 8
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (5) object in the input grid.

2.  **Split and Replace:**
    *   The gray object is recolored with azure.
    *   When possible, cells in the gray object are replaced. When a gray pixel has up, down, left and right gray neighbors, it's replaced with a red pixel.

**Natural Language Program**
```
1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.
2. Recolor them to azure.
3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel before recoloring.
4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red.
```

```python
"""
1. Find every gray (color 5) pixel.
2. Recolor them to azure.
3. Check the neighbors of each gray pixel before recoloring.
4. If the neighbors are all gray, replace the center with red.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:
    Gray (5) pixels are recolored to azure (8), and if a gray pixel has
    all gray neighbors (up, down, left, right), it's replaced with red (2).
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:
                # Recolor gray pixels to azure
                output_grid[i, j] = 8

                # Check neighbors (up, down, left, right)
                up = i > 0 and input_grid[i - 1, j] == 5
                down = i < rows - 1 and input_grid[i + 1, j] == 5
                left = j > 0 and input_grid[i, j - 1] == 5
                right = j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i, j + 1] == 5

                # If all neighbors are gray, replace with red
                if up and down and left and right:
                    output_grid[i, j] = 2

    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
