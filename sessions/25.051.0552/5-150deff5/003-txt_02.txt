1. Find all the gray (color 5) pixels.
2. Recolor each gray pixel to azure.
3. During the recoloring, check the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each gray pixel *in the original input grid*.
4. If all four neighbors are gray, replace the pixel in the output with red (color 2) instead of azure.
