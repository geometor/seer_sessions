In this case, we have two such objects:\n    *   A red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2).\n    *   A blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6).\n\n2.  **Replicate and Preserve original cells:** These two cells are preserve in their original position in the output.\n\n3. **Draw a cross around the original color cells**: For each single-cell object a cross pattern of 2 cells wide is drawn, of a specific color for each original cell.\n\n4.  **Prescribed color for each cross**:\n      * The cross around object of color 2 (red) is made of the color 4 (yellow).\n      * The cross around object of color 1 (blue) is made of the color 7 (orange).\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies single-cell objects in the input, retains them and creates a cross pattern from adjacent cells around them in the output using distinct colors for different objects of the input.\n"
