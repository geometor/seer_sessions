In this case, we have several such objects:\n    *   Red cell (color 2) at position (2, 2).\n    *   Blue cell (color 1) at positions (7, 3).\n    *    Magenta cell (color 6) at position (5,6)\n\n2.  **Replicate and Preserve original cells:** All the single cells are preserve in their original position in the output.\n\n3. **Draw a cross around the original color cells**: For each single-cell object, except the magenta one, a cross pattern of 2 cells wide is drawn, of a specific color for each original cell.\n\n4.  **Prescribed color for each cross**:\n      * The cross around objects of color 2 (red) is made of the color 4 (yellow).\n      * The cross around objects of color 1 (blue) is made of the color 7 (orange).\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies single-cell objects in the input, retains them and creates a cross pattern from adjacent cells around them in the output using distinct colors for different objects of the input. The exception is the magenta cell, that is preserved without any surrounding cross.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation identifies single-cell objects in the input, retains them and creates a cross pattern from adjacent cells around them in the output using distinct colors for different objects of the input.\nThe exception is the single-cell object of color 6, that remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_single_cell_objects(grid):\n    # Find single-cell objects and their positions\n    objects = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                # Check if it's a single-cell object\n                is_single = True\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if (dr != 0 or dc != 0) and 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols:\n                            if grid[r + dr, c + dc] == grid[r, c]:\n                                is_single = False\n                                break\n                    if not is_single:\n                        break\n                if is_single:\n                    objects.append((grid[r, c], (r, c)))\n    return objects\n\ndef draw_cross(grid, position, color):\n    # Draw a cross pattern around the given position with specified color.\n    r, c = position\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    # Define cross positions: up, down, left, right\n    cross_positions = [(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)]\n    for cross_pos in cross_positions:\n      cr, cc = cross_pos\n      if 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols:\n          grid[cr, cc] = color\n\n    return grid\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find single-cell objects\n    single_cell_objects = find_single_cell_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Draw cross for each single cell object based on the color of input cell\n    for color, pos in single_cell_objects:\n        if color == 2:  # Red cell\n            output_grid = draw_cross(output_grid, pos, 4)  # Yellow cross\n        elif color == 1:  # Blue cell\n            output_grid = draw_cross(output_grid, pos, 7)  # Orange cross\n        # Color 6 remains unchanged\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
