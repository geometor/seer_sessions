The transformation only affects the color of each cell based on the defined mapping. The actions performed here are color changes and structure maintenance.\n\n**Elaborated reasoning**\n\nThe core concept is a simple one-to-one color substitution. Each number (color) in the input has a corresponding number in the output. There's no spatial reasoning, object manipulation, or complex logic. The input array and output array maintain the exact same shape, and the numbers are directly changed. There is a one-to-one mapping between the input and output color codes.\n"
