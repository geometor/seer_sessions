They are replaced by green cells where the upper object is, and disappear where the other one is.\n    * The blue object (color 1) at position (2,3) moves one row down.\n    *  The magenta object (color 6) moves one row down.\n    *   The red object (color 2) moves two rows down.\n\n3.  **General Rule:** Every object shifts down by a number of rows corresponding to the original row number of its topmost cell, except the blue object (color 1) at position (0,3) that is \"absorbed\" by the green object, adding cells to the green vertical shape.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions and background color\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find objects and their topmost row\n    objects = {}\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            color = input_grid[r, c]\n            if color != 0:\n                if color not in objects:\n                    objects[color] = {'topmost_row': r, 'positions': []}\n                objects[color]['positions'].append((r, c))\n\n   # Apply transformation rules\n    for color, obj in objects.items():\n      for r,c in obj['positions']:\n        if color == 1 and obj['topmost_row'] == 0:\n           if input_grid[r+1,c] == 3:\n            output_grid[r+1,c] = 3\n\n        else:\n            new_row = r + obj['topmost_row']\n            if new_row < rows:\n                output_grid[new_row, c] = color\n            else:\n                output_grid[r,c] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
