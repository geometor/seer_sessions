The rest of the cells are background (color 0).\n\n2.  **Describe Movement/Transformation:**\n    *   The blue object (color 1) at (3, 0) remains in the same position in the output grid (3,0).\n    * The yellow object (color 4) at (0,1) moved two rows down to (2,1).\n    * The yellow object (color 4) at (2,1) moved one row down to (3,1).\n     In the output we have just one object of colour 4, it seems that the two initial objects merged into one object.\n    *   The magenta object (color 6) at (2, 2) moves one row down to (3, 2).\n    *   The maroon object (color 9) at (0, 3) moves three rows down to (3, 3).\n\n3.  **General Rule:** All the objects maintain their row except the objects with color 4, that are merged. Every object moves down a number of rows which matches its own row number. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n\n"
