            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the third example.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 005\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    size: 3x7\n    objects:\n      - color: 1\n        shape: irregular\n        positions: [(0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6)]\n      - color: 5\n        shape: vertical line\n        positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]\n      - color: 0\n        shape: background\n        positions: fills the rest\n  output_grid:\n    size: 3x3\n    objects:\n      - color: 2\n        shape: single cell\n        positions:  [(1, 0), (2,2)]\n      - color: 0\n        shape: background\n        positions: fills the rest\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct types of objects based on color: objects of color 1 (blue), objects of color 5 (gray), and the background color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Bounding Box:** The output grid dimensions (3x3) correspond to the minimal bounding box that encompasses all non-background colors in the input grid.\n\n3.  **Color Mapping:** Within this bounding box, color 5 (gray) is transformed to color 2 (red). All other non-background colors (in this case, color 1 - blue) are removed, being replaced by the background color 0 (white).\n\n4. **Relative Positioning:** The relative positions of the color 5 objects within the bounding box are preserved in the output grid after being mapped to color 2. The transformation translates the objects but keeps their spatial arrangement.\n\n**In Summary**\nThe transformation extracts the smallest bounding box that contains all non-background colors. The color 5 is transformed to color 2.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation extracts the smallest bounding box that contains all non-background colors. The color 5 is transformed to color 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a 3x3 array filled with 0 (white)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find the positions of color 5 in the input grid\n    positions_5 = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)\n\n    # Find min and max row and col to map the positions to the output grid\n    if positions_5.size > 0:\n        min_row = np.min(positions_5[:, 0])\n        min_col = np.min(positions_5[:, 1])\n        \n        # Copy and map color 5 to color 2 in the output grid, adjusting for position\n        for pos in positions_5:\n            row = pos[0] - min_row\n            col = pos[1] - min_col\n            if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3:\n               output_grid[row, col] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
