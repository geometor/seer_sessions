Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x7
    objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: irregular
        positions: [(0,0), (0,5), (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0)]
      - color: 5
        shape: vertical line
        positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: single cell
        positions: [(1,1)]
      - color: 0
        shape: background
        positions: fills the rest
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe three distinct types of objects based on color: objects of color 1 (blue), objects of color 5 (gray), and the background color 0 (white).

2.  **Focus Object:** The output grid is 3x3. The output grid is always the minimal size that includes all non-background colors.

3. **Color Mapping**
    The color 5 is transformed to color 2 (red). Other non-background colors are deleted.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The output is a 3x3 grid. Non-background colors are removed, except color 5 that is mapped to color 2.

**In Summary**

The transformation rule involves creating a new 3x3 grid. In this new grid only color 5, mapped to color 2, is copied. Other colors are transformed to the background color.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 3x3 array filled with 0 (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find the positions of color 5 in the input grid
    positions_5 = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)

    # Find min and max row and col to map the positions to the output grid
    if positions_5.size > 0:
        min_row = np.min(positions_5[:, 0])
        min_col = np.min(positions_5[:, 1])
        
        # Copy and map color 5 to color 2 in the output grid, adjusting for position
        for pos in positions_5:
            row = pos[0] - min_row
            col = pos[1] - min_col
            if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3:
               output_grid[row, col] = 2

    return output_grid
```


**input**
```

0 0 1 5 1 1 1
1 1 0 5 0 1 0

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
