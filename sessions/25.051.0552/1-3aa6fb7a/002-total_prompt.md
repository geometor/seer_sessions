Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001-example_1
input_grid_size: 7x7
output_grid_size: 7x7
objects:
  - color: 8 (azure)
    shape: irregular, two separate components
    position: 
      - component_1: row 2-3, column 2-3
      - component_2: row 4-5, column 5-6
  - color: 1 (blue)
    shape: single cell
    position:
      - appears in output only, seemingly replacing/adjacent to azure components

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One is a 2x2 block in the top-left quadrant, and the other is a mirrored 2x2 block on the bottom-right quadrant.

2.  **Detect changes**: Comparing to the output, the two azure objects are kept intact. However, two new blue pixels appear.

3. **Determine the locations**: One new blue cell (color 1) is inserted in the first azure component, at cell \[1,3] (where indices are zero-based), adjacent to the right of the top-right pixel of the azure object. A mirrored change happens at the second azure object. One blue cell is inserted at \[4,4], adjacent to the left of the bottom-left pixel.

**Step-by-step transformation**
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the right side of the pixel at row 1, column 2.
3. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the left side of the pixel at row 4, column 5.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
