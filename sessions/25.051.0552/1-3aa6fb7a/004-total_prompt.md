Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 001-example_1
input_grid_size: 7x7
output_grid_size: 7x7
objects:
  - color: 8 (azure)
    shape: irregular, two separate components
    position: 
      - component_1: row 2-3, column 2-3
      - component_2: row 4-5, column 5-6
  - color: 1 (blue)
    shape: single cell
    position:
      - appears in output only, seemingly replacing/adjacent to azure components

```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One is a 2x2 block in the top-left quadrant, and the other is a mirrored 2x2 block on the bottom-right quadrant.

2.  **Detect changes**: Comparing to the output, the two azure objects are kept intact. However, two new blue pixels appear.

3. **Determine the locations**: One new blue cell (color 1) is inserted in the first azure component, at cell \[1,3] (where indices are zero-based), adjacent to the right of the top-right pixel of the azure object. A mirrored change happens at the second azure object. One blue cell is inserted at \[4,4], adjacent to the left of the bottom-left pixel.

**Step-by-step transformation**
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the right side of the pixel at row 1, column 2.
3. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the left side of the pixel at row 4, column 5.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the right side of the pixel at row 1, column 2.
3. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the left side of the pixel at row 4, column 5.

Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
task: 003-example_2
input_grid_size: 7x7
output_grid_size: 7x7
objects:
  - color: 8 (azure)
    shape: irregular, three separate components
    position:
      - component_1: row 1, column 5-6
      - component_2: row 3-4, column 3-4
      - component_3: row 6-7, column 4-5
  - color: 1 (blue)
    shape: single cell
    position:
      - appears in output only, seemingly replacing/adjacent to azure components
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid has three azure (color 8) objects.  The first is a horizontal line of length 2, the second is a 2x2 block and the third is a vertical line of length 2.

2.  **Detect Changes:** Comparing input and output, we can see three blue pixels are inserted, each adjacent to one of the azure objects.

3.  **Determine the transformation Rule:**
    - Copy the input grid to the output grid.
    - Insert blue pixels (color code 1) adjacent to the azure objects.
      *   For the first object (horizontal line), the blue pixel is on its left, at (0, 4).
      *   For the second object (2x2 block), the blue pixel is to its upper right corner, at (2,3).
      *   For the third object (vertical line), the blue pixel is on top of it, at (5, 3).

**Step-by-step transformation**

1.  Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2.  Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the left of the pixel at row 0, column 5.
3.  Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the upper-right corner of the 2x2 block starting at row 2, column 2. The insertion coordinate is (2,3).
4.  Insert a blue pixel (color 1) on top of the pixel at row 6, column 3.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the left side of the pixel at row 0, column 5.
3. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) at position (2, 3).
4. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) on top of the pixel at row 6, column 3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
