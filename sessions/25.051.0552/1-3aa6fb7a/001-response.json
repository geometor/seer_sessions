One is a 2x2 block in the top-left quadrant, and the other is a mirrored 2x2 block on the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n2.  **Detect changes**: Comparing to the output, the two azure objects are kept intact. However, two new blue pixels appear.\n\n3. **Determine the locations**: One new blue cell (color 1) is inserted in the first azure component, at cell \\[1,3] (where indices are zero-based), adjacent to the right of the top-right pixel of the azure object. A mirrored change happens at the second azure object. One blue cell is inserted at \\[4,4], adjacent to the left of the bottom-left pixel.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation**\n1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n2. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the right side of the pixel at row 1, column 2.\n3. Insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the left side of the pixel at row 4, column 5.\n"
