Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of digits, where each digit presumably represents a color. The dominant color is '7' (orange), with '5' (gray) appearing sporadically. The transformation seems to involve the introduction of '8' (azure) in relation to the positions of '5's. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - cells: contain digits (0-9) representing colors
  - type: cell
    properties:
      - value: digit (color)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: replace
    description: Change a cell's value based on its neighbors.

relationships:
  - adjacency: Cells are considered adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - containment: The grid contains cells.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an output grid identical to the input grid.

2.  **Identify Targets:** Locate all '5' (gray) pixels in the input grid.

3.  **Conditional Replacement - Phase 1:** For each '5' pixel:

    *   If any of its adjacent cells (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) are '7' (orange), try to change that '7' to '8' (azure) in a specific manner explained below.
4.  **Conditional Replacement - Phase 2:**
    *   Iterate through every '7' cell.
    *   If a '7' cell is adjacent to any '5', change the original '7' cell to '8'.
    *   Prioritize adjacent 7s using this order Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Diagonals.
5. **Preservation:** All cells that are *not* '7' (orange) and adjacent to a '5' remain unchanged.

The core idea is that 5s (gray) are influencing their immediate neighboring 7s(orange) turning them into 8s (azure).
