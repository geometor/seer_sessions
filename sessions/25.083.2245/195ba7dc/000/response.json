            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements of the Task**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of digits (representing colors) into another grid of digits. The input grids contain digits 0, 2, and 7, while the output grids contain only digits 0 and 1. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (fewer columns). It appears that the transformation is reducing sections of columns into single digits. The presence of the '2' (red) digits seems to be a key factor since all columns containing 2 are replaced entirely by 1.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"

Where `n` is equal to the number of contiguous non-zero entries at the bottom of column in the input grid\n    *   If the cell in the input column is not `0`, place a `1` in the corresponding row and column of the output.\n    *   If the cell in the input column is `0`, place a `0` in the corresponding row and column of the output.\n\nIn summary, columns containing '2' are entirely replaced with '1's in the output. Columns not containing '2' have some of their lower non-zero elements truncated, and the others mapped to '1' where the element is not '0' and to '0' when the element is zero.\n"
