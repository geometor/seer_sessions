The primary issue is that the output width calculation is wrong, and how it handles cases when '2' isn't present seems incorrect based on provided examples. It seems like instead of replacing the whole column with `1`, the expected output shows the result as having only two colors (0 and 1), and that the presence of `2` only affects the specific output column's width.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Column Widths:** Carefully examine how the presence or absence of '2' in an input column affects the corresponding output column's width, relative to others.\n2.  **Analyze Row contents:** See how the presence or absence of `2` affects that output column's row contents.\n3.  **Refine the Transformation Rule:** Clearly articulate the relationship between input and output columns and how the digit '2' acts as a key.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples**\nI'll summarize what I observe from the provided examples:\n*   All output values are either 0 or 1.\n*   If an input column contains a '2', its output column has a fixed with of 1 and it contains only `1` values.\n*   If input column does not contain a '2', its corresponding output column width might vary, along with its contents.\n*   The output row count is the same as the input row count.\n\nHere's a YAML block summarizing observations:\n\n"

The number of columns of output will be the calculated later.\n\n2.  **Column Processing:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n\n3.  **'2' Detection:** Check if the current input column contains the digit '2'.\n\n4.  **Transformation - Case 1 (Contains '2'):** If the input column contains a '2', the output has a single column filled with only `1`'s.\n\n5.  **Transformation - Case 2 (No '2'):** All input columns *without* a 2, are grouped and processed together *after* the columns with 2s. The total width occupied by these columns in the output should be equal to the count of non-zero elements that occur in all of these columns *before* any trailing zeros, *if any exist*. These elements are mapped to 1's, while the rest will be zeros.\n\n    *   **Example:** Input columns (no 2s) = `[[7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [7, 0, 0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`. Count the non-zero elements before the trailing zero sequence (if one exists) in each column, i.e., `[2, 1, 2]` and map each column to that portion of the output grid.\n    *   **Expected Output width:** Sum of \\[2, 1, 2] = 5\n\n6.  Output is a grid of 1's and 0's only.\n"
