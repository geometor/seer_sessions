Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captured the basic idea of alternating gray and blue pixels horizontally, stemming from the initial gray pixels. However, it failed to correctly implement the vertical extension and the checkerboard-like pattern emerging from the examples. The vertical extension logic is flawed, placing blue pixels incorrectly and not creating the full intended pattern. The code also has trouble replicating rows with *no* gray pixels, carrying forward the pattern when it shouldn't.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Vertical Extension:** The current vertical extension simply adds a blue pixel to the left and one row down of the gray-blue pattern. The examples show a more complex checkerboard pattern, requiring a more accurate rule that takes the established horizontal pattern and alternates downward.

2.  **Handle Empty Rows:** The code needs to explicitly preserve rows that are empty in the input, preventing the pattern from propagating undesirably.

3.  **Refine Horizontal Pattern:** Ensure the horizontal alternation logic is robust.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's analyze the grids to understand dimensions and pixel counts.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** For each row in the input grid, locate all pixels with a value of 5 (gray).

2.  **Horizontal Alternation:** For each gray pixel found:
    *   Extend to the left, alternating between gray (5) and blue (1) pixels until the edge of the grid is reached.
    *   Extend to the right, alternating between blue (1) and gray (5) pixels until the edge of the grid is reached.

3.  **Vertical Alternation:** For each row *below* a row that contains gray pixels:
    * Starting one column to the left of the start of the horizontal alternation pattern, create a *vertical* alternating pattern with a pixel of value of 1 (blue). This vertical pattern is one cell to the left and one cell down from the cell above. It only fills in positions; it does *not* propagate all the way down, *nor* does it trigger *further* propagations.
    
4.  **Preserve Empty Rows:** If a row in the input grid contains *only* 0 (empty) pixels, the corresponding row in the output grid must also contain only 0 pixels. The patterns do not propagate through an all zero row.

5. Missing from original: The vertical propagation only occurs *one row below* any horizontal alternations, not for every single row.

Revisions relative to previous: Added more detail to vertical alternation (3). Added step 4 about preserving empty rows. Added note at (5) regarding difference.
