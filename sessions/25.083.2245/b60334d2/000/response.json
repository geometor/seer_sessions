Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input grids are 9x9 and primarily filled with black (0) pixels. There are a few gray (5) pixels scattered within the grid, mostly along the second row and in some seemingly random locations.\n*   **Output:** The output grids are also 9x9. They contain black (0), gray (5), and blue (1) pixels. The gray and blue pixels appear in specific patterns.\n* There is a change to existing pixels and new pixels added.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Create a structure in that row by taking every gray pixel and:\n\n    *   Maintain the gray.\n    *   Place a blue pixel immediately to the right.\n\n3. Create secondary structure: For every row that contains a gray pixel,\n    * For the row immediately below:\n       * If the cell is black, place blue at index+1 and index-1 relative to the gray index above\n       * If an index+1 or index-1 doesn't exist, ignore\n\n4. Ignore black rows (rows with only 0): The transformation completely\n    ignores rows that have only zeros.\n\n5. **Everything else:** All other pixels remain black.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies the gray pixels in the input and uses their positions to generate a specific alternating pattern of gray and blue pixels in the output, while also adding new blue pixels, also in relation to the gray pixels in the input grid. The process creates a small amount of mirroring with the gray and blue colors.\n"
