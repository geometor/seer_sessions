Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element is the presence of 2x2 blocks of red (value '2') pixels within a larger grid of black (value '0') pixels. The output seems to be a 3x3 grid. The presence of these 2x2 red blocks in the input appears to be correlated to the placement of white pixels in the output grid. The output grid is always smaller than the input grids, and it always seems to be 3x3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: [0, 2] # Black and Red
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
  - name: red_blocks
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - shape: 2x2 square
      - color: red (2)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: [0, 1] # Black and White
      - height: 3
      - width: 3
  - name: output_blocks
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - shape: 1x1 square
      - color: white(1)

actions:
  - name: identify_red_blocks
    description: Locate all 2x2 red blocks in the input grid.
  - name: map_to_output
    description: Determine output pixel based on presence and distribution.
  - name: generate_output
      description: construct output grid.

relationships:
  - description: Each 2x2 red block in the input contributes to the output grid formation.
  - description: output position is relative to all red_blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Inspect the Input Grid:** Examine the input grid to identify all 2x2 squares of red (2) pixels.

2. **Map to a 3x3 output.**

3.  **First row generation:**
    - Scan across the first few rows for 2x2 red blocks. The scan depth appears related to input dimensions, approximately half the input height.
    - If a 2x2 block exists in the first approximate third of input width, place a '1' (white pixel) in first position.
    -If a 2x2 block exists in the second approximate third of input width, place a '0' in second position.
      - If a 2x2 block exists in the third approximate third of input width, place a '1' (white pixel) in third position.

4.  **Second Row Generation:**
    - Perform scan of input rows, with same depth as step 3, offset down by approximately 1/3 the input height.
     - If a 2x2 block exists in the first approximate third of input width, place a '0' in first position.
    -If a 2x2 block exists in the second approximate third of input width, place a '1' in second position.
      - If a 2x2 block exists in the third approximate third of input width, place a '0' in third position.

5.  **Third Row Generation:**
      - Perform scan of input rows, with same depth as step 3, offset down by approximately 2/3 the input height.
      - If a 2x2 block exists in the first approximate third of input width, place a '1' in first position.
      -If a 2x2 block exists in the second approximate third of input width, place a '0' in second position.
       - If a 2x2 block exists in the third approximate third of input width, place a '0' in third position.

6. **Create a 3x3 output grid.** Fill the output grid with the 0 or 1 values generated from steps 3-5, set any values not determined in steps 3-5 to zero.

Essentially, presence of a 2x2 block within scanning areas of the input grid contribute to a binary value at relative positions in the output grid.
