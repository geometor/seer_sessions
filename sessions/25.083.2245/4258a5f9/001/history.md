Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of numerical values. The most salient feature is the presence of the digit '5' (gray) in the input grids, and its apparent influence on the output grids. The output grids seem to introduce the digit '1' (blue) in proximity to the '5's. There's a sense of expansion or "filling in" around the gray pixels. It's also important to recognize all white space is represented by '0'.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain '0' (white) and '5' (gray) pixels.
  - observation: Output grids contain '0' (white), '1' (blue), and '5' (gray) pixels.
  - observation: '5' pixels in the input seem to correspond to '5' pixels in the output, in the same or similar locations.
  - observation: '1' pixels in the output are located near '5' pixels.
  - observation: The gray pixels in the input appear to "expand" or "fill" the output.
  - object: gray_pixel
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      behavior: expands outwards in output
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      behavior: may be replaced by blue (1) near the grey
  - object: blue_pixel
      properties:
          color: blue (1)
          behavior: appears in output based on gray object locations
  - relationship: gray objects cause the appearance of blue in the output

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** all '5' (gray) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Copy** each '5' pixel to the output grid in the same location.
3.  **Iterate** on input pixels: Create a 3x3 block, using the gray '5' pixel as the center, of blue pixels.
4.  **Expand:** any white pixel in the input adjacent to the 3x3 block is converted to blue in the output.

Essentially, the transformation creates a 3x3 block of '1' (blue) pixels around each '5' (gray) pixel, and expands outward replacing adjacent '0' pixels.
