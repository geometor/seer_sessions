A \"border pixel\" is a pixel that has at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, or right) with a different color. Diagonal neighbors are *not* considered.\n\n2. **Extract Ordered Border Colors:** Create an *ordered* sequence, `border_colors`, of the *unique* colors of the border pixels, preserving the order in which they first appear during the scan.\n\n3. **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n   - The number of columns in the output grid is always 5.\n   - The number of rows in the output grid is determined as follows:\n       1. Let 'n' be the number of unique colors found in the `border_colors` sequence.\n       2.  output_rows =  int(0.85*n + 0.5) if n > 4 else n-1 if n >=2 else n\n\n4. **Construct Output Grid:**\n    1. Create an output grid of the determined dimensions, filled initially with a placeholder value (e.g., -1).\n    2. Fill the output grid with colors from the `border_colors` sequence. The precise placement logic is still under investigation, but it is based on `border_colors`.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_orthogonal_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Get the orthogonally adjacent neighbors of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n        new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc\n        if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:\n            neighbors.append(grid[new_row, new_col])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_border_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Find pixels that have at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor of a different color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    border_pixels = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            neighbors = get_orthogonal_neighbors(grid, i, j)\n            if any(neighbor != grid[i, j] for neighbor in neighbors):\n                border_pixels.append((i, j, grid[i,j]))  # Store row, col, and color\n    return border_pixels\n\ndef get_ordered_border_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"Extract unique border colors in order of first appearance.\"\"\"\n    border_pixels = find_border_pixels(grid)\n    ordered_colors = []\n    for r, c, color in border_pixels:\n        if color not in ordered_colors:\n            ordered_colors.append(color)\n    return ordered_colors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid into a smaller output grid based on ordered border colors.\"\"\"\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    border_colors = get_ordered_border_colors(input_grid)\n\n    # Determine output grid dimensions.\n    num_colors = len(border_colors)\n    output_cols = 5\n    output_rows = int(0.85 * num_colors + 0.5) if num_colors > 4 else num_colors - 1 if num_colors>=2 else num_colors\n\n    # Construct the output grid.\n    output_grid = np.full((output_rows, output_cols), -1)\n\n    # Fill the output grid (placeholder logic - needs refinement).\n    num_to_fill = output_rows * output_cols\n    repeated_colors = (border_colors * (num_to_fill // len(border_colors) + 1))[:num_to_fill]\n    output_grid = np.array(repeated_colors).reshape(output_rows, output_cols)\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
