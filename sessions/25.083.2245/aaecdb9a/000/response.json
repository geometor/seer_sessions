The output grids seem to be composed of digits present in the input grids, but significantly rearranged and reduced in size. There's no obvious direct spatial correspondence; the output isn't a simple sub-region of the input. The transformation doesn't seem to be merely extracting or filtering specific colors since color positions vary considerably. There appears to be a focus around diagonal color areas, with the output being the most changed colors in the grid, and their neighboring colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
