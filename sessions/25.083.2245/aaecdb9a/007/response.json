The order is determined by the first appearance of each border pixel during a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan of the input grid.\n\n3. **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The number of columns in the output grid is always 5.\n    *   The number of rows is determined by the number of unique colors in `border_colors` (denoted as 'n'):\n        *   If n > 4, output rows = int(0.85*n + 0.5)\n        *   If 2 <= n <= 4, output rows = n - 1.\n        *   If n < 2, output rows = n.\n\n4. **Construct Output Grid:**\n\n    1.  Create an output grid with the calculated dimensions, initially filled with a placeholder (e.g., -1).\n    2. The colors and structure of the expected output depends on the order and spatial relationships between border colors in the original image.\n    3. Fill the output grid row by row.  The sequence of unique border colors is used to construct the output grid, repeating the sequence as needed.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_orthogonal_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Get the orthogonally adjacent neighbors of a cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n        new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc\n        if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols:\n            neighbors.append(grid[new_row, new_col])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_border_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Find pixels that have at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor of a different color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    border_pixels = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            neighbors = get_orthogonal_neighbors(grid, i, j)\n            if any(neighbor != grid[i, j] for neighbor in neighbors):\n                border_pixels.append((i, j, grid[i,j]))  # Store row, col, and color\n    return border_pixels\n\ndef get_ordered_border_colors(grid):\n    \"\"\"Extract unique border colors in order of first appearance.\"\"\"\n    border_pixels = find_border_pixels(grid)\n    ordered_colors = []\n    for r, c, color in border_pixels:\n        if color not in ordered_colors:\n            ordered_colors.append(color)\n    return ordered_colors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid into a smaller output grid based on ordered border colors.\"\"\"\n\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    border_colors = get_ordered_border_colors(input_grid)\n\n    # Determine output grid dimensions.\n    num_colors = len(border_colors)\n    output_cols = 5\n    output_rows = int(0.85 * num_colors + 0.5) if num_colors > 4 else num_colors - 1 if 2 <= num_colors <= 4 else num_colors\n\n    # Construct the output grid.\n    output_grid = np.full((output_rows, output_cols), -1)\n\n    # Fill the output grid by cycling through border_colors\n    for r in range(output_rows):\n        for c in range(output_cols):\n            index = (r * output_cols + c) % num_colors\n            output_grid[r,c] = border_colors[index]\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
