objects:
  - type: horizontal_line
    description: Sequence of digits bounded by '5' or grid edges.
    properties:
      - digits: List of integers [0-9].
      - length: Number of digits in the line.
      - start_index: Column index of the first digit.
      - end_index: Column index of the last digit.
  - type: separator
    description: Digit '5' that acts as a boundary.
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - position: (row, column)

transformations:
  - type: digit_substitution
    description: Each digit in a horizontal line is replaced by a specific other digit, according to a consistent mapping within each input/output pair.
    properties:
      - input_digit: Original digit.
      - output_digit: Replaced digit.

relationships:
  - type: bounding
    description: Horizontal lines are bounded by separators (5) or by edges of the grid.
  - type: order_preservation
    description: The relative order of digits within a horizontal line is preserved during transformation.
  - type: constant_separtor
    description: The position and the value of 5 remains constant
