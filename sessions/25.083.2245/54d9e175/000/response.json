            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Objects:** The primary objects appear to be horizontal lines of digits within the grid. The digit '5' seems to act as a separator or boundary. Digits between the '5's are the primary subjects of transformation.\n*   **Relationships:** The digits between the '5's maintain their relative order. The '5's remain unchanged. The height of the output grid is always same as input grid. The width of the ouput grid is same as input grid.\n*   **Transformations:** The digits between the '5' separators are replaced by other digits. The values between '5's are replaced with different number, the number is always same for given set of numbers. The replacement logic/pattern is not immediately obvious, but it IS consistent within each example. It's a one-to-one mapping, a substitution.\n* **Colors**: The color of `5` is grey in input and output. The input values are `0` (white), `1` (blue), `2` (red), `3` (green), `4` (yellow) which get mapped to a new output set of `6` (magenta), `7` (orange), `8` (azure), `9` (maroon).\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

A horizontal line is a sequence of digits that are:\n    *   Bounded by the digit '5' on both sides, *or*\n    *   Bounded by the digit '5' on one side and the edge of the grid on the other, *or*\n    *   Bounded by the edges of the grid on both sides.\n\n2.  **Digit Mapping:** For each horizontal line in input, replace all digits (excluding the bounding '5's) according to these rules:\n    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `1`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `6`.\n    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `2`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `7`.\n    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `3`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `8`.\n    *   If the non-five digits between the 5 separators, in order, are `0`, `4`, `0`, replace all of those digits with `9`.\n\n3.  **Preserve Separators:** The digit '5' and its position remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Output.** The output grid dimensions will match those of the input grid.\n"
