However, the initial implementation makes an error with when to perform the fill. It is applying the transformation to the entire row instead of repeating it for all of the rows. It also doesn't realize that the output grid should have *all* rows transformed in this way.\n\nThe main issue is that the transformation should be applied to *all* rows, replicating the transformed row pattern throughout the output grid. The current code only transforms some of rows and leaves the other as is.\n\nThe core strategy is to rectify how the transformation is applied to the *entire* output grid, ensuring the transformed row pattern is repeated.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code doesn't repeat the transformation for all rows.\n*   **Example 2:** Same issue as Example 1.\n*   **Example 3:** Same issue, and the larger grid highlights the problem with rows not being consistently transformed.\n*    **Example 4:** same issue\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n\n"

The resulting output grid has three times the height of the input grid. The transformation occurs *only* based on segments found in the *first* row of the input grid.\n\n5. **Return output:** Return the modified output grid.\n"
