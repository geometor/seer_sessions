            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code (`code_00.py`) was based on the first training example and implements a mirroring and color-swapping mechanism. It attempts to handle both row-wise and column-wise mirroring. However, the results on the subsequent examples show that the code fails to correctly transform the inputs. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The code attempts to mirror *either* rows *or* columns, and the decision is based on which one has changes first. This is flawed, as the transformation might involve more complex logic, such as mirroring a *specific* section of rows or columns, not necessarily the entire set.\n2.  **Incomplete Color Swap Handling:** The color swapping logic is too simplistic. It identifies *some* swaps, but it doesn't correctly apply them in all cases, and it doesn't capture the full rule governing color changes. It also doesn't account for the context in which swaps are applied (e.g., only within the mirrored region).\n3. The strategy for checking if the change happened in either the left or the right is flawed, as shown by the color palette not being correct for the mirrored parts.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues involves:\n\n1.  **Re-examining Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples (1, 2, and 3) to identify the *precise* mirroring and color-swapping rules.\n2.  **Refine the Mirroring Detection:** Develop a more robust way to detect *which* part of the input is mirrored and *where* it appears in the output. This likely involves identifying specific boundaries or patterns. The current implementation is overly broad and misses the subtleties of partial mirroring and re-location.\n3.  **Precise Color Swap Rules:** Determine the exact conditions under which colors are swapped. This may not be a simple one-to-one mapping; it could depend on position, adjacency, or other factors within the mirrored region.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each significant change to the logic, using all available examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**\n\nI will use `tool_code` to confirm some observations and gather metrics about the input/output grids. I'll focus on identifying regions that change and the specific color changes within those regions. This will inform us more precisely.\n\n"
