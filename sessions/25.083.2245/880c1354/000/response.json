The core transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of a specific *part* of the grid, combined with a color swap of the *mirrored part*. Critically, the part that gets mirrored seems to change, and the colors that are swapped change, in each example, so a key will be tracking those. The position and/or size of the mirrored parts does *not* change.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
