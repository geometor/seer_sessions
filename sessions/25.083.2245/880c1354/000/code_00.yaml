facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a section of the grid being "mirrored" and having its colors remapped.
  - observation: |
      The 'mirroring' in example one looks like taking the leftmost columns
      and moving them the rightmost columns, and the colors get remapped according to the following rule:
        - 6 becomes 1
        - 1 becomes 3
        - 2 becomes 6
        - 3 becomes 2
  - observation: |
      The 'mirroring' in example two looks like taking the rightmost columns
      and moving them to the leftmost columns, and the colors get remapped according to the following rule:
        - 1 becomes 9
        - 9 becomes 6
        - 6 becomes 1
  - observation: |
      The 'mirroring' in example three looks like taking the top rows
      and moving them the bottom rows, and the colors get remapped according to the following rule:
        - 6 becomes 5
        - 5 becomes 6
