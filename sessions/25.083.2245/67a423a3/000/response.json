Here's my breakdown of the task:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs and outputs are grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   There are consistent shapes and patterns within each grid.\n*   The transformation seems to involve some kind of interaction or influence between the different colored objects/pixels.\n*   It appears that a new color (4 - yellow) is introduced in the outputs in relation to specific pattern in the inputs.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The shape of filling appears to depend on extending the fill zone from the crossing point.\n"
