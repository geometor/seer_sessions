"""
The transformation identifies vertical and horizontal lines within the input grid.
It locates where these lines intersect, forming a crossing.
A new color (yellow, represented by 4) appears in the output grid around this intersection.
The yellow color fills the cells immediately above and below the crossing point.
The fill extends horizontally from the intersection, stopping at the original lines or grid edges.
