Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is the appearance of the digit '4' (yellow) in the output grids, seemingly surrounding or framing non-zero digits in the input grids. There's a clear spatial relationship being established. It also appears that zeros remain zeros.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input grid trigger the appearance of '4's in the output.
  - observation: '4's appear in the output grid in positions horizontally and vertically adjacent to the original non-zero value in the input, but only for the top and left.
  - observation: The original non-zero values in the input are maintained in the output, except if they are zero.
  - observation: '0' (white) values in the input grid remain '0' in the output grid, unless changed to 4 because of adjacency rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  If a cell's value is 0, check its top and left neightbors.
    - If the original cell and its top or left neightbor are not the same, the output is 4.
    - Otherwise, the output cell remains 0.
3.  If a cell's value is not 0, maintain that value, copying input cell to output cell.

Essentially, the transformation "highlights" the top and left sides of non-zero values in the input by placing '4's adjacent to them, while preserving the original non-zero values and keeping remaining areas as '0'.
