The most prominent feature is the appearance of the digit '4' (yellow) in the output grids, seemingly surrounding or framing non-zero digits in the input grids. There's a clear spatial relationship being established. It also appears that zeros remain zeros.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If a cell's value is 0, check its top and left neightbors.\n    - If the original cell and its top or left neightbor are not the same, the output is 4.\n    - Otherwise, the output cell remains 0.\n3.  If a cell's value is not 0, maintain that value, copying input cell to output cell.\n\nEssentially, the transformation \"highlights\" the top and left sides of non-zero values in the input by placing '4's adjacent to them, while preserving the original non-zero values and keeping remaining areas as '0'.\n"
