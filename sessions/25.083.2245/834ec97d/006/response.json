            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and as such, it didn't perfectly capture the full transformation rule. The core idea of identifying shapes and adding a border above them is correct, but the implementation of the border is flawed. Specifically, the border is not being extended and repeated correctly as shown in the expected outputs. The results reveal that the code only adds a single '4' above the leftmost pixel of each identified shape, instead of a continuous line of '4's across the entire width of the shape. Also it appears the intention is to stack the lines of '4's, not merely insert 1 line.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Border Width:** The code needs to correctly calculate the width of each shape and use that to place the '4's in the output grid. Currently, it's only placing a single '4'.\n2.  **Border Repetition:** The results also show multiple '4' above each shape. The natural language needs to make this explicit.\n3. **Border Height:** Related, the added border is not just a single row, stacking multiple times. Need to identify how tall.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using assumed grid operations, not tool_code):**\n\nSince I don't have tool execution capabilities in this turn, I'll analyze based on observation and describe what I *would* do with code execution if available.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: One shape (6) of size 1x1.\n    *   Expected Output: Three rows of '4's above the shape, each spanning the shape's width.\n    *   Actual Output: One row with '4' above first column, then 0, then 4, etc.\n    *   Observation: height appears to always expand by three rows.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: One shape (2) of size 1x1.\n    *   Expected Output: One row of '4' above the shape, spanning the shape's width.\n    *   Actual output: Only a '2'.\n    *    Observation: height always appears to expand by at least 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: One shape (9) of size 1x1.\n    *   Expected Output: Five rows of '4's above the shape.\n    *   Actual Output: A row with '4' above the '9'.\n    *   Observation: height appears to expand by 5.\n\nIf I had code execution, I would calculate:\n\n1.  The exact dimensions (width, height) of each shape.\n2.  The number of rows added above each shape.\n3. Confirm the number of 4s added above is three times the shape's width.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The height of the additional section is 3x if the object is in row 2 (counting from 0). The height of the extra section is 1 if object is in row 0. And 5 if object is in row 4.\n4.  **Span Border:** The '4's should span the entire width of the shape, from the leftmost column of the shape to the rightmost column.\n5. **Stack Border:** Repeat the added border of 4s, the number of rows added should equal the border height.\n6.  **Preserve Shape:** The original shape in the input grid should be preserved in the output grid.\n7. Output: return transformed grid.\n\n"
