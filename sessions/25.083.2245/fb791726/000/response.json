The non-zero pixels maintain their relative vertical positions.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids appear to be an expanded version of the input grids. The key transformations are:\n    *   The original non-zero pixels are maintained in their original vertical positions, but shifted to the left.\n    *   The width of the output grid is double the width of the input grid.\n    *   A horizontal line of green (3) pixels is added below each original non-zero pixel. These green lines span the entire width of the *output* grid.\n    *   The original columns of the non-zero input are maintained in their x-position.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
