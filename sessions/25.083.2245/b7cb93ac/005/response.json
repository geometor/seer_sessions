Each object is defined by its color and a bounding box.\n3. **Object Selection**: Select a specific set of objects from input. The selection seems to assemble parts of the input grid and arrange them into the output grid. The objects are arranged as if the output grid is imposed on top of the input grid, truncating as needed. The objects may be placed based on color, the top row of the output seems to match colors of unique pixels, and the bottom two rows are filled with colors from the top two rows of the bounding boxes.\n4.  **Output Construction:** Create a 3x4 output grid.\n5. **Populate Output:** Copy the selected objects from the input to the output grid. Truncate the copied objects to fit within the 3x4 output grid's boundaries.\n6. **Return the output grid**\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Identifies contiguous regions (objects) of the same color.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, object_pixels):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        object_pixels.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, object_pixels)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, object_pixels)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, object_pixels)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, object_pixels)\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if not visited[row, col] and grid[row, col] != 0:\n                color = grid[row, col]\n                object_pixels = []\n                dfs(row, col, color, object_pixels)\n                if object_pixels:\n                    min_row, min_col = np.min(object_pixels, axis=0)\n                    max_row, max_col = np.max(object_pixels, axis=0)\n                    objects.append({\n                        'color': color,\n                        'bounding_box': (min_row, min_col, max_row + 1, max_col + 1),\n                        'pixels': object_pixels\n                    })\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 4), dtype=int)\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    # Object Identification\n    objects = get_objects(input_grid)\n\n\n    # Populate output.\n    for obj in objects:\n        for r, c in obj['pixels']:\n             if r < 3 and c < 4:\n                output_grid[r,c] = obj['color']\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
