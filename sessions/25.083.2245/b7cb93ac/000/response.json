These shapes vary in color and size.\n*   The outputs are smaller grids (3x4) containing a seemingly condensed representation of the non-black pixels from the input.\n*   The output grids maintain the relative horizontal and vertical ordering of the colored objects, from top to bottom and left to right.\n*    The output grid is always three high, and four wide.\n*   The output always includes every non-zero color, once, from left to right in each row.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
