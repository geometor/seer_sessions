Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program description of the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are larger grids (10x12, 13x10, 11x10) filled mostly with black (0) pixels.
*   Within the input grids, there are smaller rectangular shapes or lines formed by non-black pixels. These shapes vary in color and size.
*   The outputs are smaller grids (3x4) containing a seemingly condensed representation of the non-black pixels from the input.
*   The output grids maintain the relative horizontal and vertical ordering of the colored objects, from top to bottom and left to right.
*    The output grid is always three high, and four wide.
*   The output always includes every non-zero color, once, from left to right in each row.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain mostly black (0) pixels.
  - observation: Non-black pixels in the input form distinct rectangular shapes or lines.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the colors from the input.
  - observation: Output grids maintain the relative horizontal and vertical order of colors in input
  - observation: Output grids are 3x4 in dimension
  - observation: the distinct colored shapes in the input map to distinct colors,
    in their original order, as individual pixels in the output.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9)
      size: variable (larger)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9)
      size: fixed (3x4)
  - object: colored_shape
    properties:
       type: rectangular region or line.
       color:  non-zero integer
  - action: extract_colors
    description: Extract the distinct colors from the input grid, maintaining row-by-row left-to-right order.
  - action: arrange
    description: Arrange unique colors in a 3x4 output.
  - relation: color_mapping
    description: Unique colored objects in input are each mapped to a single pixel in the output maintaining relative position.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan the Input:** Traverse the input grid row by row, from top to bottom and left to right.
2.  **Identify Unique Colors:** For each row, maintain a list of colors, only adding colors that haven't yet been added.
3.  **Arrange in Output:** Arrange the unique colors in a 3x4 grid. Starting from top left, insert colors, moving to the right and then the next row.
4.  **Output:** Return 3 x 4 grid
