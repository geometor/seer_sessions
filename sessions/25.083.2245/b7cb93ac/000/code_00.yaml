facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain mostly black (0) pixels.
  - observation: Non-black pixels in the input form distinct rectangular shapes or lines.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the colors from the input.
  - observation: Output grids maintain the relative horizontal and vertical order of colors in input
  - observation: Output grids are 3x4 in dimension
  - observation: the distinct colored shapes in the input map to distinct colors,
    in their original order, as individual pixels in the output.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9)
      size: variable (larger)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9)
      size: fixed (3x4)
  - object: colored_shape
    properties:
       type: rectangular region or line.

  - action: extract_colors
    description: Extract the distinct colors from the input grid, maintaining row-by-row left-to-right order.
  - action: arrange
    description: Arrange unique colors in a 3x4 output.
  - relation: color_mapping
    description: Unique colored objects in input are each mapped to a single pixel in the output maintaining relative position.
