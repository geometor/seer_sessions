facts:
  - task: "Copy parts of input grid to output grid"
  - input_objects:
    - object_1: "Input grid of varying size"
    - object_2: "Colored regions within the input grid (contiguous pixels of the same color)"
  - output_objects:
    - object_1: "Output grid of size 3x4"
    - object_2: "Colored regions within the output grid, copied from the input grid"
  - actions:
    - action_1: "Identify colored regions in the input grid."
    - action_2: "Select specific regions/pixels based on a rule (yet to be fully determined)."
    - action_3: "Copy the selected regions/pixels to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions and shapes within the 3x4 boundaries."
  - relationships:
    - relationship_1: "Output grid dimensions are fixed at 3x4."
    - relationship_2: "Colors in the output grid are a subset of colors in the input grid."
    - relationship_3: "The spatial arrangement of colors in the output grid corresponds to the spatial arrangements of those same color regions in the input, but possibly truncated or cropped to fit."
  - constraints:
      - "output_grid_size is always 3 x 4"
      - "color counts in output are <= to corresponding color counts in input"
