Within these grids, there are distinct regions defined by color. The most prominent colors are gray (5) and azure (8). The background is universally white (0).\n*   **Shapes:** There's a consistent pattern: a central horizontal band of azure (8) pixels surrounded by gray (5) pixels, all within a white (0) background. The azure region seems to be the key element.\n*    **Size Changes**: there is a significant reduction in size and change of aspect ratio\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The azure region is always horizontally centered and surrounded by grey. The height of the azure region varies. The output grid is considerably smaller than the input grid, seemingly focusing on a specific part of the azure region.\n* **Output Structure**: The output is always a 3x3 grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This band is horizontally centered and surrounded by grey pixels.\n2. **Determine top row of Azure pixels**: find the row index of the top most row that contains any Azure pixels\n3.  **Extract a 3x3 Subgrid:** Create a 3x3 grid. Populate the top row of this output grid with the colors of the first three horizontally centered Azure pixels in the Azure Region, starting at `top row of Azure pixels`.\n4. fill the remainder of the output with black (0)\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts a 3x3 \"snapshot\" of the top of the central azure region. The first row comes from the first row with azure pixels. The remainder is always black (0).\n"
