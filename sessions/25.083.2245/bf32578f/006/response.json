            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focused on identifying \"cross-like\" shapes and expanding them into squares. However, the results indicate that the implementation of \"cross-like\" and the expansion/shifting logic is flawed. It seems that the code successfully identifies some objects but fails to either select the correct object and perform the transformation. The consistent failure to match the output and high \"Pixels Off\" counts suggest significant issues in these core areas. It seems a good assumption is made, expanding the cross to a square, but an error occurs during placement. We are missing the relative displacement between the initial center and the resulting square. It's crucial to re-examine the definition of a \"cross,\" the expansion logic, and particularly the *placement* of the expanded square.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate \"Cross-like\":** The current `is_cross_like` function might be too restrictive or too lenient. We need to visually inspect the input grids where it *should* have detected a cross and see what went wrong. We need to understand what patterns it is identifying and what patterns should be idenfied.\n2.  **Refine Expansion Logic:** Ensure the `expand_to_square` function correctly creates a square encompassing the original cross. It's possible edge cases (e.g., crosses near the grid boundary) aren't handled properly. Currently, the expansion seems to simply create a square of the right dimensions, it does not actually check that all the pixels are within bounds.\n3.  **Correct Placement (Shifting):** The most critical error seems to be in the placement of the expanded square. The code currently centers the square at the *original* center of the cross, leading to incorrect offsets. This has to be handled carefully. Instead of just using the original center, we probably need a method to calculate the intended *relative* displacement.\n4. **Develop Metrics:**\n    * Identify cross centers in the inputs and outputs.\n    * Calculate displacement vectors for the center of the objects.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using Code Execution):**\n\nI'll use code execution to calculate the centers of the \"cross-like\" objects in both input and output grids and the displacement vectors.\n\n"

The center is the average of the row and column indices of all pixels constituting the cross.\n\n3.  **Expansion:** For each cross-like object, create a square of the same color.\n    - The length of each side of the new square should be set to make a square.\n    - For example 1, the initial cross size is already a height and width of three, so the output remains a 3x3 square.\n    - For examples 2 and 3, The width of the cross is one, and the height is three, so a new 3x3 square is drawn.\n\n4.  **Displacement:** Shift the center of the expanded square relative to the original cross's center.
