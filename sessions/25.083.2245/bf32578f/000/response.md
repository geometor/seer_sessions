Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.
*   Pixels within the grids have integer values, representing different colors.
*   The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) and potentially manipulating them based on their shape, position, or surrounding pixels.
*   There is an expansion, it seems, of the single color object.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain objects, defined as contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are identified by their color and position within the grid.
  - transformation_type: |
     input objects that are 'cross' shaped expand into squares
  - object_interaction: |
      Objects that neighbor at least one white (0) pixel, will expand by 1 pixel
  - action: |
      The core transformation appears to be related to growing / expanding the input shape to create an enclosing square of that color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Iterate through the input grid and identify all distinct objects. An object is a group of one or more adjacent pixels of the same non-white (non-zero) color.

2.  **"Cross" Detection and Expansion:** For each identified object find shapes that have the cross characteristic. That is, one pixel above, below, left and right. Expand that shape to a solid square.

3. **Output:** Create a copy of the input grid. For the detected input shapes, fill the corresponding output region with the same color in the input, forming the expanded square. All other output grid cells are filled with 0, effectively preserving the background.

Essentially the rule takes the input and if the input shape has the "cross" characteristics, the shape grows into a solid square of the input color.
