1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Scan the input grid and find all pixels that have a value of 8 (azure) or 7 (orange). These are the "key pixels".

2.  **Create Connector:**
    *   Find the topmost key pixel and the bottommost key pixel.
    *   Calculate the center of their top and bottom respectively.
    *   Draw a vertical red (value 2) line connecting these two center points.
    *   Find the horizontal center of the bottom bounding box.
        *   Draw a horizontal line from the leftmost point of the connector line to the rightmost.

3.  **Create Bounding Boxes:**
    *   For each key pixel:
        *   If the pixel is azure (8), draw a 3x3 azure (8) square centered on the key pixel, overwriting the connector where it overlaps.
        *    If the pixel is orange (7), draw a 3x3 orange (7) square centered on the key pixel, overwriting the connector where it overlaps.

4. **Output:** The output grid should now have the connector drawn first and 3x3 squares drawn around each key pixel, overwriting the connector where necessary.
