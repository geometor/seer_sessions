Both grids consist of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The core of the task seems to lie in identifying specific colored pixels (non-zero values) in the input grid and then performing a transformation based on their positions and values to generate the output grid. There's a clear indication of object interaction and manipulation, possibly involving shape creation or modification around the identified pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The rest are background (white(0)).\n  - object_identification: |\n      Pixels with value 8 (azure) and 7 (orange) are treated as key objects.\n  - spatial_relationship: |\n      The output grid highlights and draws boxes around the identified key objects. There are fixed sized boxes in specific shapes and color based on the location of the objects, and a fixed shape and color connecting the boxes\n  - transformation_rule: |\n      A 3x3 box with color is created around each key object.\n      the box colors follow this pattern:\n        azure objects are surrounded by azure\n        orange objects are surrounded by orange\n      A shape is drawn to join the boxes\n      the join color is red and covers any part of the join that touch a box, azure or orange, forming a t-shape with color 2 (red)\n```"

Where the lines connect, form a t-shape. Overwrite with red (2) where the horizontal and vertical parts of the connector touch the boxes\n\n4. **Output:** The resulting grid, with the created shapes and connector, constitutes the output.\n"
