facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain sparse pixels of interest (azure (8) and orange (7)). The rest are background (white(0)).
  - object_identification: |
      Pixels with value 8 (azure) and 7 (orange) are treated as key objects.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output grid highlights and draws boxes around the identified key objects. There are fixed sized boxes in specific shapes and color based on the location of the objects, and a fixed shape and color connecting the boxes
  - transformation_rule: |
      A 3x3 box with color is created around each key object.
      the box colors follow this pattern:
        azure objects are surrounded by azure
        orange objects are surrounded by orange
      A shape is drawn to join the boxes
      the join color is red and covers any part of the join that touch a box, azure or orange, forming a t-shape with color 2 (red)
