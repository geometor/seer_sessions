facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, cols]
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [2*rows, 2*cols]
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - action: copy
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid (top-left quadrant)
    description: The input grid is directly copied to the top-left quadrant of the output grid.

  - action: transform_quadrant
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    quadrants: [top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]
    description:  Each of the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid is derived from the input grid through a specific transformation, but it's NOT a simple reflection.

  - observation: top_left_correct
    description: The top-left quadrant of the output grid always matches the input grid.

  - observation: other_quadrants_incorrect_reflection
    description: The other quadrants (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are NOT simple horizontal, vertical, or combined reflections of the input grid.
