The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with the input grid seemingly \"reflected\" or \"mirrored\" in multiple directions. There's a sense of symmetry, both horizontally and vertically. The core input pattern isn't just copied, but rather, it influences all the quadrants created. It also appears colors of original pixels are maintained.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Reflect it both horizontally and vertically, which the same as 180 degree rotation, or reversing both row and column order.\n\nIn essence, the transformation creates a 2x2 \"tiled\" version of the original grid, where each tile is a reflection (horizontal, vertical, or both) of the original.\n"
