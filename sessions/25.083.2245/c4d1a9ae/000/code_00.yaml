objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x8 (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - location: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: compare_neighbors
    description: Compares a pixel's value with its immediate horizontal neighbors.
  - type: replace_value
    description: Changes a pixel's value based on the comparison result.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered neighbors if they share a horizontal edge.
  - type: conditional_replacement
    description: >
      The replacement of a pixel's value is determined by the values of its
      neighbors and potentially its original value.
