The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of certain digits based on their surrounding neighbors, suggesting a local operation. There's a sense of pattern recognition and conditional replacement, but no obvious global transformations like rotations or reflections.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Don't consider diagonal, top, and bottom pixels. If a pixel is on the edge of the grid and doesn't have neighbors at left and right, stop.\n\n3.  **Conditional Replacement - Example 1:**\n\n    *   If the pixel's left value equals its right value, and both neighbors\n        have value 4, the center pixel value changes to 6 if original value is\n        4, and changes to 2 if original value is 2.\n\n4.  **Conditional Replacement - Example 2:**\n\n    *    If the pixel's left value equals its right value, and both neighbors\n        have value 0, the center pixel value changes to 3 if original value is\n        0, and changes to 9 if original value is 4.\n\n5.  **Output:** The modified grid becomes the output. The transformation occurs in place, each pixel independent of other pixel and its transformation.\n"
