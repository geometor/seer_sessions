Rules are applied simultaneously to all pixels.\n\nSpecific Transformation Rules:\n\nExample 1 Specifics:\n    1. If a pixel is yellow (4) and is immediately to the left of magenta (6), it changes to magenta (6).\n    2. If a pixel is yellow (4) and is between two other yellow (4) pixels, it changes to magenta (6).\n    3. If a pixel is yellow (4) and is next to one or two gray (5) pixels, it becomes gray (5).\n    4. If a yellow (4) pixel has a red (2) neighbor, it does not turn into gray (5).\n    5. If a pixel is magenta (6) and to the right of Yellow (4), change to gray (5).\n    6. Yellow (4) can become red (2) - conditions not clear.\n\nExample 2 Specifics:\n    1. If a pixel is white (0) and *not* adjacent to maroon (9) by any edge, it changes to green (3).\n    2. If white (0) is adjacent to maroon (9) vertically or horizontally, do not change to green.\n    3. White (0) can become Yellow (4) or Maroon (9) - conditions are not clear.\n    4. Maroon(9) remain unchanged.\n\nCombined:\n   1. Consider all eight neighbors.\n   2. Color changes are conditional and prioritized.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets all eight neighbors of a pixel, including diagonals.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (row, col):\n                neighbors.append(grid[i, j])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            current_color = input_grid[row, col]\n            neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col)\n            left_neighbor = input_grid[row, col - 1] if col > 0 else None\n            right_neighbor = input_grid[row, col + 1] if col < cols - 1 else None\n\n            # Example 1 Rules\n            if current_color == 4:\n                if right_neighbor == 6:\n                    output_grid[row, col] = 6  # Rule 1\n                elif left_neighbor == 4 and right_neighbor == 4:\n                    output_grid[row,col] = 6 # Rule 2.\n                elif 5 in neighbors:\n                    if 2 not in neighbors:\n                      output_grid[row,col] = 5 # Rule 3 and 4\n                    else:\n                       # Rule 6:  4 can become 2, we don't have the rule.\n                       pass\n\n            elif current_color == 6:\n                if left_neighbor == 4:\n                    output_grid[row, col] = 5  # Rule 5\n\n            # Example 2 Rules\n            if current_color == 0:\n                if 9 not in neighbors:  # diagonals.\n                    output_grid[row, col] = 3  # Rule 1\n                # Rule 2, 3 are not fully defined.\n                else:\n                    # do not apply rule 1 if adjacent to a 9\n                    pass\n\n            # Rule 4 - maroon remains.\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
