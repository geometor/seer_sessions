            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example and, as expected, doesn't generalize perfectly to the second example. The primary issues stem from the `transform_magenta` and `transform_orange` functions. The logic within `transform_magenta` is overly specific to the layout of the first example (e.g., assuming a specific arrangement and using the grid's midpoint for color determination). Similarly `transform_orange` is too specific.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current `get_object` function is correct and should be preserved. We need to robustly identify magenta and orange objects.\n\n2.  **Improve `transform_magenta`:** Instead of hardcoding row-based transformations and relying on the grid's midpoint, we need to analyze the *relative position* of a magenta pixel *within its object* and its relationship to *neighboring* objects. The current logic of using the midpoint of the *entire grid* is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Improve `transform_orange`:** The existing neighbor check is a good start, but we need more conditions to capture cases where the orange doesn't change and where it changes due to adjacency.\n\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the transformation rules, we'll re-run the code on *both* training examples to ensure we're improving overall performance, not just overfitting to the second example.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's use code execution to gather more precise information about the objects and their transformations in both examples.\n\n"
