            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of moving blocks down within columns. While this works partially, it's clear from the test results that the logic isn't entirely correct. The code incorrectly handles adjacent objects of the same color in both rows and columns. It seems to be merging some blocks that should stay separated and separating blocks that should be together. The core issue stems from how adjacency and grouping of objects are handled. The adjacent object selection algorithm has some errors in logic, missing some cases, including when objects share only a single point of contact. The original hypothesis needs refinement to reflect a more accurate understanding of how objects are defined and moved.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Identify *precisely* where the transformed output deviates from the expected output.\n2.  **Refine Object Definition:** Re-evaluate how \"objects\" are defined. The current code seems to make incorrect assumptions, causing some pixels within a group to be left behind in the output.\n3.  **Revise Movement Logic:** The downward movement logic needs adjusting. The concept of stacking is generally correct, but *which* objects are stacked needs careful consideration.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, aided by provided output):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** The transformed output has merged some blocks that are separate, but single pixels in the input.\n    *   **Mismatch:** The 3's and 4s in the input merge, where there is an adjacency between 3,3 and 4,4 at \\[0,3] and \\[0,4]. Also 6's and 0s are not in correct output locations.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** The transformed output is mostly correct except in merging `8 8` and not putting `0`s in columns correctly.\n    *   **Mismatch:** columns 4 and 5 merge 8,8 and the adjacent 0 is not treated as empty.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:** column based color shifting does not work consistently.\n    *   **Mismatch:** column objects shift incorrectly.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
