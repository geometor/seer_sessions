Here's my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 9x9 grids.\n*   The primary colors involved are black (0), yellow (4), and orange (7).\n*   The transformation seems to involve identifying yellow (4) pixels that are adjacent to other yellow pixels and changing the color to orange (7) conditionally, which appears to be based on the arrangement or pattern of yellow pixels around the one being evaluated.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"
