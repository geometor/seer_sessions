            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempted to identify 2x2 subgrids containing three yellow pixels and change one of the yellow pixels to orange.  However, the results indicate several errors. The transformation isn't correctly identifying the L-shapes and the corner to be changed. It looks like the logic of checking the four possible corner is not working and causes some extra pixels to change. The code needs adjustments in how the L-shapes are handled and where it is located within a larger object.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine L-shape Identification:** Instead of focusing on corners, think about checking for a 2x2 yellow area and make sure exactly one pixel is not yellow.\n2.  **Precise Pixel Modification:** Ensure the correct non-yellow pixel is located and the pixel that needs changing is adjacent.\n3.  **Test and Iterate:** After modifying the code, thoroughly test it against all provided examples.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Examples:**\n\nLet's get more insights on the first two training example failures:\n\n"
