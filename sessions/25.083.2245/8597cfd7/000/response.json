The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.  The input grids are larger and more complex, while the output grids are consistently small (2x2) and contain only one color repeated four times.  The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid. The most obvious repeating elements in the input are vertical lines of colors '2' (red) and '4' (yellow), and a horizontal line of '5'(gray). The output seems to focus on a specific, consistent element within the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
