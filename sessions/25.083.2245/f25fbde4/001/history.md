Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating 2D grids containing the digit '0' (representing white) and '4' (representing yellow). The core operation seems to be a transformation of the yellow objects. The output grids consistently have a smaller, more compact arrangement of yellow pixels compared to their corresponding inputs. The white pixels seem to act as background or empty space.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: yellow_region
    type: contiguous_region
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular in input, rectangular in output
      - size: variable in input, consistent pattern in output

  - id: background
    type: region
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - shape: fills remaining space

actions:
  - type: transformation
    target: yellow_region
    description: Reshapes and expands the yellow region into a rectangle.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: yellow_region and background
    description: Yellow region is surrounded by the background.
  - type: transformation_result
    between: input yellow_region and output yellow_region
    description: The output yellow_region is a transformed, rectangular version of the input yellow_region.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Yellow Region:** Locate the contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that would completely enclose the identified yellow region in the input.

3. **Construct an expanding square:** make a square two pixels wider and taller than the minimal bounding box.

4.  **Create Output:** Generate a new grid where the pixels defined by the new expanding box are filled with yellow (4), centered on the input bounding box center. All other pixels are set to white (0).

Essentially, the transformation takes a yellow object of any shape and converts it into an expanding square centered on original shape's "center".
