Okay, let's analyze the provided information and devise a strategy to improve the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code capture some aspects of the transformation but fail to accurately model the interaction between the green and blue objects, particularly their lengths and positioning relative to the red base line and each other. The code seems to overextend the green and, in the first implementation, does not correctly place the blue. There's a clear need to refine the logic concerning how the lengths of the blue and green lines are determined and constrained. The provided test output data will be extremely helpful.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and actual output. Identify specific pixels that differ and categorize the errors (e.g., incorrect green length, incorrect blue length, incorrect blue position).
2.  **Refine Object Definitions:** Improve the description of how "green" and "blue" objects are defined, specifically their relationship to the "red" object and the canvas boundaries.
3.  **Constrain Growth:** Develop rules to ensure the green and blue lines grow correctly, considering constraints like existing objects and the edge of the input.
4. **Iterate and refine the descriptions**: Update the natural language program and regenerate the python program.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code when appropriate):**

Let's analyze each example in detail:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (8, 9)
    *   Red Object: Row 3, Columns 0-2
    *   Expected Green: Extends upwards from row 2, decreasing in width.
    *   Expected Blue: Starts below red, decreasing length, stops before green.
    *   Actual Output: Green overextends (fills the entire space above red). Blue doesn't appear.
    *  Error types: green overextends, missing blue

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Red Object: Row 3, Columns 0-1
    *   Expected Green: Extends upwards from row 2.
    *   Expected Blue: Single pixel below red.
    *   Actual Output: Green overextends. Blue doesn't appear.
    *  Error types: green overextends, missing blue

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 9)
    *   Red Object: Row 2, Columns 0-3
    *   Expected Green: Extends upwards from row 1.
    *   Expected Blue: Starts below red, decreasing in width.
    *   Actual Output: Green overextends. Blue doesn't appear.
    *  Error types: green overextends, missing blue

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: red_line
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      role: base_line
      shape: horizontal_line
    observations:
      - Appears in every input.
      - Defines the starting point for other objects.

  - object: green_fill
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: fills_area_above_red
    observations:
      - Always present above the red line.
      - Fills from the top of the grid and stops at the line above red_line.
      - width decreases by one on each row, going up.

  - object: blue_lines
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      shape: vertical_lines_decreasing_length
    observations:
      - Appears below the red line.
      - The length of each consecutive blue line is shorter.
      - The first blue line starts one row below the red_line
      - Stops if it encounters green.
      - right-most edge is aligned with red_line
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Red Base:** Identify the horizontal red line (color 2). This line serves as the base for subsequent operations.
2.  **Fill with Green:** Starting from the row immediately above the red line, and extending to the top of the grid, fill the area with green (color 3). The width of green section decreases by one at each row above, starting from full width.
3.  **Create Blue Lines:** Starting from the row immediately below the red line, create a series of blue lines (color 1) that extends downwards.
    *   The rightmost edge should be aligned with red.
    *   The first blue line's left-most edge will be at column zero, and end at the same column as the red line.
    *   The length of each subsequent blue line decreases by one, moving the left-most edge right by one.
4.  **Blue Termination**: Blue lines do not extend into area filled by green.
