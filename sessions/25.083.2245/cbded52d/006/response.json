            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have a fundamental flaw: they don't consistently handle the \"matching\" logic correctly across all examples. While the core idea of preserving 0s and 1s and conditionally changing other values based on odd/even column indices is partially correct, the implementation of the \"matching\" condition is too restrictive and needs to account for the matching value at odd indices and apply it. The current approach is too focused on modifying *even* columns and has trouble changing values at even indices when they are not paired with a matching odd index.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Matching Logic:** The core issue is how \"matches\" are found. The current implementation looks for another pixel in the *same row* with the same value. But, critically it looks at even indexes first and then searches odd indexes to keep the values. We should flip the approach.\n2.  **Prioritize Odd Columns**: Prioritize examining odd columns. If the value is present in an odd column, leave the pixel unchanged. If not in an odd column, *then* check.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nLet's examine each example to pinpoint where the logic fails:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Row 2: `1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3`\n    *   Expected:     `1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3`\n    *   Actual:       `1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3`\n        -  The logic incorrectly keeps the first 3 unchanged, which needs the pairing from index 7. Index 4 is not changed correctly from 1 to 3 because the odd column (index 1) is equal to 3 and should have been propagated to the output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Row 1: `1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4`\n    *   Expected:     `1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4`\n    *   Actual:        `1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4`\n    *   The value at (0,4) is incorrectly not changed. It should have become 4, as there is a 4 in an odd indexed column.\n\n    *   Input Row 5: `2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1`\n    *    Expected:    `2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1`\n    *    Actual:       `1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1`\n\n    *   The values in (4,0), (4,6) are not copied correctly. There is a 2 at (4,6) which should have been used.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Row 5: `3 1 0 1 1 0 3 1`\n    *   Expected:     `3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1`\n    *   Actual:        `1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1`\n\n    *   The value in (4,0) is not copied, (4,3) is not copied, and (4,6) is not copied. (4,6) = 3 which should have been copied.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
