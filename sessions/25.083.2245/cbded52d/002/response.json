The primary issue is that the current code doesn't perfectly replicate the expected outputs. The errors seem to be specifically related to incorrect pixel changes in even columns. We need to analyze why sometimes it should change and sometime not.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\nI don't need to execute code to gather more information, from the previous turn, it provides all the information needed.\n\nLet's summarize the provided information:\n\n*   **Example 1:** 3 pixels are incorrect. The issue is in the second row, where a '1' should have remained, and it hasn't\n*   **Example 2:** 3 pixels are incorrect. The issue is similar, '1' is not changed correctly\n*   **Example 3:** 1 pixels are incorrect. The issue is similar, '1' is not changed correctly.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
