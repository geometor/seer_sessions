            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of connecting diagonally adjacent gray pixels with blue lines and expanding isolated gray pixels into 3x3 blue squares. The results show that this approach is partially correct but has significant flaws. The main issue seems to be the handling of overlapping regions and the priority between connecting and expanding. It also doesn't seem to copy all of the other pixels from the input to the output. The connection logic is flawed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check the assumptions about diagonal adjacency and expansion by carefully examining the examples, particularly how they differ.\n2. **Prioritize Operations:** Determine whether connection should take precedence over expansion, or vice versa. It appears, from the expected output, that the 3x3 expansion is dominant.\n3. **Refine Connection Logic:** The current line-drawing algorithm doesn't correctly handle all cases of diagonal connections, so we need a much more robust approach.\n4. **Overlapping regions:** Overlapping regions must merge - this strongly suggests that creating the 3x3 expansion will be key, followed by drawing of lines between any gray pixels.\n5. **Address all pixels:** Make sure to make a plan for dealing with all input pixels, whether they're changed or not.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI don't need to run the code to check metrics - the results and the grids are printed above.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:** Three gray pixels, two of which are diagonally adjacent. One isolated gray pixel, and another gray pixel that is two spaces diagonally.\n*   **Expected Output:** Shows 3x3 blue squares around all of the input pixels. The two gray pixels are connected with diagonal, single-pixel-wide blue line.\n*   **Actual Output:** The 3x3 regions appear around the diagonally adjacent pixels and the blue line is not continuous where the expansions overlap and there are some pixels that were not expanded.\n* **Pixels Off:** 14\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input:** Three isolated gray pixels, non are diagonally adjacent.\n*   **Expected Output:** Shows 3x3 blue squares around each gray pixel.\n*   **Actual Output:** The expansion is only one pixel instead of a 3x3 block.\n*   **Pixels Off:** 20\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n\n"
