facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: 9
      - width: 9
  - object: pixel
    description: Individual cell within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9) representing a color.
      - color: mapped from value (white, blue, gray).
  - observation: gray_pixels_change
    description: Gray (5) pixels in the input become blue (1) in the output.
  - observation: white_pixels_unchanged
    description: White (0) pixels remain white (0).
  - observation: spatial_transformation
    description: The transformation of gray to blue appears to involve spatial expansion.
  - relationship: relative_position
    description:  The relative positions of original gray pixels dictate the shape and size of the blue regions in the output. Specifically, the output seems to connect diagonal of the input.
