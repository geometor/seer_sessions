The most prominent change is the conversion of gray (5) pixels into blue (1) pixels, and seemingly expanding/replicating those blues based on relative locations of the original gray pixels. There's a clear spatial relationship involved, with the output seemingly \"filling in\" areas defined by the input gray pixels. The background color white (0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If two gray pixels are on a diagonal line, the connecting line is also composed by blue pixels.\n4.  **Preserve** all white (0) pixels from the input grid to the output grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies isolated 'gray' pixels, uses their positions to draw 3x3 squares, overlapping them, and draws blue lines between gray pixels at diagonal, all while keeping 'white' unchanged.\n"
