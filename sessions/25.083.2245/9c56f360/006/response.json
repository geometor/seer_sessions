            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding derived from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal discrepancies, primarily related to the movement and positioning of the green (3) pixels. The code moves green pixels to the *leftmost* available empty space to the left of the leftmost azure pixel, but it doesn't account for all the constraints that can be derived. The updated output indicates we should refine how empty spaces are used, especially with adjacent greens.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on where the code's output differs from the expected output. Pay close attention to the relative positions of azure, green, and white pixels.\n2.  **Refine Movement Rule:** The core issue is the \"leftmost available\" rule. It needs more nuance. We need to prioritize filling the available spaces to be closest to the left most azure. We also need to consider moving only green pixels that aren't *adjacent* to the leftmost azure.\n3.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** Create a structured YAML representation of the observed objects, properties, and actions. This will help formalize the transformation process.\n4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to incorporate the refined movement rule and any other observed constraints.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using print statements):**\n\nI don't need `tool_code` for this part. I'm analyzing given information:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Mismatches occur in rows 2 and 4. In Row 2, Green should move two spaces, not three. In Row 4, the Green should move all the way to the left adjacent to the left most Azure.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *    Mismatches occur in rows 5 and 6. Row 5 needs to move the green to the left. Row 6 has the same issues as Row 5.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Pixels off: 14\n    *    Many mismatches. Similar pattern to before, with green needing to \"fill in\" spaces to the left of leftmost azure, while avoiding positions adjacent to that azure.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
