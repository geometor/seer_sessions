The main issue is that it only considers moving green (3) pixels to the empty spaces *immediately* before the leftmost azure (8) pixel. It doesn't correctly handle cases where green pixels should be moved further to the left, filling any available '0' spaces, even if these zero spaces are not contiguous. Additionally, the adjacency check is too simplistic, and needs some clarification. It appears in some cases we are only looking at horizontal adjacency.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine the insertion logic:** Instead of only looking at contiguous '0's directly before the leftmost '8', we need to consider *all* '0's to the left of the leftmost '8'.\n2.  **Clarify Adjacency:** Specify that we are only checking horizontal adjacency (+/- 1 in columns).\n3. **Prioritize movement:** Move the greens that are furthest away from the leftmost '8' first.\n4. **Handle edge cases**: Ensure the code works correctly even with no green, no azure, multiple azure, and all possible ordering.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using visual inspection and the supplied data, no code execution needed at this stage):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Errors:\n        *   Row 2: Green (3) moved to the wrong position (index 0 instead of 5)\n        *   Row 4: Green (3) should have moved to index 2, but did not move at all.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Errors:\n        *  Row 5: Green (3) pixels did not move to available '0's to the left.\n        *  Row 6: One Green (3) moved correctly to index 3, the other should move to index 4\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 14\n    *   Errors: Numerous errors related to incorrect positioning of moved green (3) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
