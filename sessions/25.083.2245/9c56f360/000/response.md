Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve repositioning of specific digits/colors, specifically '3' (green) appears to be moved. Other digits remain largely in place. The key seems to lie in understanding where green ('3') objects are being moved to. It looks like the green is inserted before a section of white in many of the cases. The background seems to be white, and then azure, and then green.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 8, 3]  # white, azure, green
      - dimensions: variable (different for each example)
  - type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 3 #green
      - role: moving_object
  - type: digit
    properties:
     - value: 8 #azure
     - role: reference_object
  - type: digit
      properties:
        - value: 0  # White
        - role: background

actions:
  - name: move_green
    description: Repositions green (3) pixels based on the location of the azure(8)
    details: insert '3' before '0' in the row if azure(8) is not adjacent to green(3)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  The movement of green pixels is relative to azure pixels and the empty parts of the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all instances of the digit '3' (green pixels) and '8' (azure pixels) within the input grid.
2.  **Check for Adjacency:** for each row, starting from the top:
3.  **Move 3, Case: 3 adjacent to 8** If a '3' is adjacent to an '8', then do not change it.
4. **Move 3, Case: 3 not adjacent to 8** if '3' is in the row but not adjacent to an '8', move the right most '3' to be directly before the last string of 0 before an 8 in that row.
5.  **Repeat** Continue for each line in the grid.

Essentially, the green ('3') pixels are moved to the last available spot before an azure pixel in their respective row, provided they are not already adjacent to an azure.
