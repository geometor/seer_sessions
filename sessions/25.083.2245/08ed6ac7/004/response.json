The code applies the sequence globally across all gray pixels, regardless of the column. The results show discrepancies in both examples, indicating that the color assignment isn't strictly column-local. The strategy is to enforce the column-wise reset of the color sequence. The core issue is that the color_index should reset to 0 at the start of each new column which contains gray.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution where helpful):**\n\nWe are provided inline metrics. Let's focus on summarizing, no further computation required.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 15\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Color Count: False\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 20\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Color Count: False\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

Within each column, it checks each pixel. If a pixel's color is gray (value 5), it is replaced with a color from a predefined sequence: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).  The crucial aspect is that the sequence *restarts* at blue (1) for every new column. Within a single column, the replacement proceeds through the sequence (blue, red, green, yellow), wrapping back to blue if the end of the sequence is reached before the end of the gray pixels in that column. Pixels that are not gray remain unchanged.\n"
