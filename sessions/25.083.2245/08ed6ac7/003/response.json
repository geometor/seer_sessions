Each pixel with the color gray (value 5) is replaced by a color from a predefined sequence: blue, red, green, and yellow. This sequence is applied cyclically. Critically, the sequence restarts at the beginning (blue) for each new *column* that contains gray pixels. The color assignment within a single column proceeds through the sequence (blue, then red, then green, then yellow), wrapping back to blue if necessary. Non-gray pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Create a color sequence to replace gray pixels\n    color_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Blue, Red, Green, Yellow\n\n    # Iterate through each column\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Reset color index for each column\n        color_index = 0\n        # Iterate through each cell in the column\n        for i in range(rows):\n            # Check if the pixel is gray\n            if output_grid[i, j] == 5:\n                # Replace the gray pixel with the current color in the sequence\n                output_grid[i, j] = color_sequence[color_index % len(color_sequence)]\n                # Move to the next color in the sequence\n                color_index += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
