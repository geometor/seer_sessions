Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved outlining non-zero regions and filling enclosed zeros with yellow. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the outlining and filling logic isn't universally correct. The code over-applies the yellow outline, extending it to all sides of non-zero areas, not just adjacent to zeros, and seems to have issues correctly identifying "internal" zeros.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Definition of "Outline":** The current implementation creates an outline on *all* sides of a non-zero region. The examples show the outline should only be placed where a '0' (white) cell is adjacent to the non-zero region.
2.  **Refine "Internal Zero" Detection:** The current `is_internal_zero` function seems too aggressive, possibly classifying zeros as internal when they shouldn't be. We will use a better approach to flood fill and find if internal zero reach the edge.
3. **Consider Example-Specific Differences** The code needs to perform correct on all three examples, not only on the first one.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning, preparing for code execution if needed):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Observation:**  The outline is too extensive. It covers the entire top and left sides of the orange region, whereas it should only be present where the orange region borders a zero.
    *   **Expected Outline:** The outline should only appear where a 0 is adjacent to a non-zero color.
    *   **Internal Zeros:** The two zeros inside the orange region should be filled.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Observation:** Again, the yellow outline is over-applied, appearing on all sides of the magenta shape. The single 0 inside the area is correctly identified as a fully surrounded 0.
    *   **Expected Outline:** Only present where '0' borders the non-zero region.
    *   **Internal Zeros:** The internal zero is correctly identified and colored yellow.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    The outliner is correct.
    *    There is an incorrectly classified enclosed zero in the lower left and one on the lower right.

**YAML Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: non_zero_regions
    description: Contiguous areas of pixels with the same non-zero color.
    properties:
      - color: The color value (1-9) of the region.
      - shape: The 2D arrangement of pixels.
      - location: a set of (row,col) to represent each pixel in the region.
  - name: zero_regions
    description: individual or Contiguous areas of pixels with the value '0'.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - internal: Boolean, True if completely enclosed by a single non-zero region, False otherwise.
      - location: set of (row, col) for each 0 cell.

actions:
  - name: outline
    description: Place a yellow (4) border around non-zero regions.
    parameters:
      - target: A non_zero region.
      - condition: Only on '0' cells directly adjacent to the target region.
  - name: fill_internal_zeros
    description: Change the color of internal zero regions to yellow (4).
    parameters:
      - target: zero region
      - condition: Only if the entire zero_region is internal (surrounded by a single non-zero region)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Regions:** Find all contiguous regions (areas of adjacent pixels) of non-zero color within the grid.
2.  **Identify Zero Regions**: Find areas of color zero.
3.  **Outline Non-Zero Regions:** For each non-zero region:
    *   Iterate through all '0' (white) cells in the grid.
    *   If a '0' cell is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally) to the current non-zero region, change its color to yellow (4).
4. **Fill Internal Zero Regions:** For each non-zero region
    *   Find zero regions completely enclosed by this non-zero region by checking that all the cells surrounding the zero region are either non-zero or yellow from the outliner.
    *   Change all '0' (white) cells of an enclosed region to yellow (4).
