facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The digit '0' (white) appears to be a background color.
  - observation: A new color '4' (yellow) is introduced in the output.
  - observation: Color '4' often appears adjacent to the non-zero color from the input, sometimes within an object of color '0' and sometime replacing '0'.
  - object: target_region
    properties:
      - color: Varies (7 in train_1, 6 in train_2, 3 in train_3)
      - shape: Contiguous block of the same color.  Can be rectangular or irregular.
    actions:
      - identified: The target region is identified within the input grid.
  - object: outline
    properties:
      - color: '4' (yellow)
      - location: Adjacent to the target_region.
    actions:
      - created:  An outline of color '4' is created.
      - placement: The placement rule is not fully clear. Sometimes color 4 *replaces* 0, sometimes it appears *within* a region of '0's.
  - relationship: outline is adjacent to target_region
