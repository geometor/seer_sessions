Okay, let's analyze these input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The digits 2 and 7 are prominent in the input grids.
*   The output grids seem to have a similar structure to the input grids, but with some digits replaced, notably 7s becoming either 3 or 5.
*  The dimensions of input, output grids are the same

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: varies (but input and output dimensions are the same for each pair)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: represented by an integer
          - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Changes the color of certain pixels based on their original color and surrounding context.

relationships:
 - type: adjacency
   description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all pixels with the value 7.
3.  For each pixel with value 7, **examine** its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
4. **Condition 1**: *If* a 7 pixel is adjacent to a 2 pixel, it is replaced with the value 3.
5.  **Condition 2**: *If* a 7 is not adjacent to any 2, and it is at the grid boundary (first/last row/column), the value is replaced with 5
6. **Condition 3:** *If* a 7 is not adjacent to any 2, but also is not at boundary, it is still replaced with 5.
7. all other cells maintain their original value.

In short, the algorithm changes 7s to either 3s or 5s, apparently dependent on adjacency to 2s. 7s near 2s become 3, and the remaining 7's will be replaced with 5.
