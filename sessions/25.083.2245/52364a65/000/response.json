The transformation seems to involve selective removal or shifting of colored blocks within the grid, specifically non-azure colors adjacent to azure, aligned to a specific edge (the edge is not the same for all). The overall grid dimensions remain constant.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The examples suggest it is possible to have multiple edits in one row or column, and to have no edits.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves moving a non-azure pixel next to an azure, but only if the non-azure is also on the edge. Each train example uses a single edge to apply edits (train\\_1 is left, train\\_2 is top), test will likely also only use one edge (or none?).\n"
