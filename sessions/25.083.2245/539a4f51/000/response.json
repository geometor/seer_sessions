Ignoring the 0's the input grid height and width is doubled.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The origin of the output is top left, as is the origin of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Special 0 rule:** In the input grid's rightmost column, every value is 0. The output grid's final two columns will be the same as the rightmost, non-zero column, except for the very last color, which will have 0's added to it.\n\nIn essence, the input grid (excluding the last all-zero column) is doubled in both dimensions to form the output. And the output grid's final two columns reflect the last non-zero column, plus added 0's for the final color.\n"
