            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a limited understanding from the first training example. The subsequent tests on the other examples reveal a significant flaw: the code doesn't correctly replicate and arrange the input grid, and it misinterprets the role of the last column. The strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Re-examine the core transformation:** Discard the initial assumption about doubling and the special treatment of the last column. Focus on what *actually* happens between input and output across *all* examples.\n2.  **Identify repeating patterns:** Observe how blocks of pixels are copied and potentially repositioned.\n3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Develop a new, more accurate description that encompasses all observed behaviors.\n4. **Focus on last rows and last columns**\n5. **Output is double heigh of Input, and Input width + 1**\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning for now):**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, noting key observations:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 5x5, last column is all zeros.\n*   **Output:** 10x10.\n*   **Observation:**\n    The input grid excluding the last zero column appear to be copied twice horizontally, stacked, and added on the right a replica of the input excluding the last column.\n    It appears there are incorrect assumptions on replicating the last non-zero columns.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 5x5, last column is all zeros.\n*   **Output:** 10x10.\n*   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, a horizontal doubling of the input grid (excluding the last zero column), the output grid appear to be stacked and finally added the replica of the input excluding the last column.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** 5x6. Note: sixth column is NOT all zeros\n*   **Output:** 10x10.\n*   **Observation:** The last column is not all zeros. Horizontal copy is incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
