Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 8x8 grids. The majority of the grid is filled with the color orange (7), with a bottom row of azure (8).\n*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as objects. There are seemingly random placements of other colors within the orange background.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve a complex rearrangement of the non-orange, non-azure colored pixels. The positions of these pixels seem to shift, and sometimes their colors are removed, other times, their position is simply changed, within the constraint that they only move within the central colored region of the images.\n* The azure row is always preserved, but the colored pixels that get moved, never are placed over the azure area.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The colored pixels that do not have value `7` in a two-row window can be changed.\n4.  **Process Two Row Windows:** for outlier pixels\n    1.  shift colors in the two-row window down by 1 row and one column.\n    2.  delete colors by setting value of cells to `7` in the two row window if out-of-bounds.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by combining the repositioned outlier pixels, and the preserved base row.
