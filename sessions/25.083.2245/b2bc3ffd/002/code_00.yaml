facts:
  - object: background
    color: orange (7)
    property: static, fills most of the grid except the bottom row
  - object: base_row
    color: azure (8)
    property: static, bottom row, unchanged
  - object: outliers
    color: not orange (7) or azure (8)
    property: dynamic, rearranged within the area above the base row
  - observation: |
      Outlier pixels are rearranged to fill available spaces from top to bottom,
      and within each row from left to right.  The rearrangement occurs within the "central area"
      defined as all rows except for the bottom row. The order of the outliers
      in the output corresponds to their order in the input when read from top
      to bottom, and left to right.
  - action: rearrangement
    description: |
      Outlier pixels fill empty slots in the central area, maintaining their
      original relative order.
