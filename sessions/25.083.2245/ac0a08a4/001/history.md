Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid. The core operation seems to be replicating and expanding colored pixels from the input grid into larger blocks of the same color in the output grid. The placement and size of these expanded blocks appear to be systematic and related to the original pixel's position. It appears that each non-zero pixel in input is expanded to a n x n block of pixels, and 0 (white) in input are maintained as blocks of 0 (white) of same size. The size of the expansion seems to be different between the examples.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are small, output grids are larger.
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid correspond to blocks of the same color in the output grid.
  - observation: Zero pixels in the input grid correspond to possibly white blocks of matching size in the output.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are a multiple of the input grid dimensions.
  - property: Colors in the output grid are the same as their corresponding input pixels.
  - action: Expansion of non-zero pixels into square blocks.
  - action:  Zero (white) pixels are expanded into rectangular area, keeping them white
  - object: input_grid, 2D array of integers
  - object: output_grid, 2D array of integers
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Expansion Factor:** Analyze each example to figure out size of replication for that example. The relation between size of input vs output tells us about the size of expansion.
    *   Example 1: input: 3x3, output 9x9. Expansion = 3x3
    *   Example 2: input 3x2, output 6x6. Expansion = 2x2
    *   Example 3: input: 3x3, output: 15x15. Expansion = 5x5

2.  **Iterate through Input Grid:** For each pixel in the input grid:

    *   **If the pixel is non-zero:** Create a square block of the same color in the output grid. The block's dimensions are determined by the expansion factor. The top-left corner of the block is positioned based on the original pixel's coordinates, scaled by the expansion factor.
    *   **If the pixel is zero:** Create a similar block size in the output filled with value 0.

3.  **Output:** Return the expanded grid.

Essentially non-zero value in the input grid is expanded by the expansion
factor, into a square block of the same color in the output grid, and zero in
input are expanded into matching sized block of 0s.
