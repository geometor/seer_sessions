Specifically, the output grid appears to be 5 times the width and height of the input grid.\n*   The pattern of the input grid seems to be replicated and tiled in the output grid.\n*   There are no rotations or reflections; the orientation of the input is preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
