            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track, focusing on repeating elements within each row. However, the code incorrectly repeated each element five times *consecutively*, rather than interleaving the repetitions as suggested by some of the expected outputs. The core issue is a misunderstanding of how the repetition and concatenation should work across the entire row. The strategy should be revised to correctly interleave the repeated elements.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI'll reproduce relevant parts of results here for easy review.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `5 5 2 5; 2 3 3 2; 5 2 5 3; 3 5 3 2`\n    *   Expected: `5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5; ...` (and so on for other rows)\n    *   Actual:   `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 5; ...`\n    *   Observation: The actual output repeats each element five times *before* moving to the next. The expected output seems to repeat sequences of *pairs* of elements.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `9 5 1 5; 1 5 9 1; 9 1 5 5; 5 5 5 1`\n    *   Expected: `9 5 1 5 5 1 5 9 9 5 1 5 5 1 5 9 9 5 1 5; ...`\n    *   Actual:   `9 9 9 9 9 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5; ...`\n    *   Observation: Same error as Example 1. The expected output pattern isn't as immediately obvious.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: `4 1 1 4; 7 7 4 7; 1 4 1 1; 4 1 1 1`\n    *    Expected: `4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4; ...`\n    *    Actual: `4 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4; ...`\n    *   Observation: Same error, expected repeats the 4 and 1's in a specific paired way.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n\n    *   Input: `2 2 2 2; 8 2 2 2; 2 2 8 2; 8 2 8 8`\n    *   Expected: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2; ...`\n    *   Actual: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2; ...`\n    *   Observation: This one is interesting. In this case, the output *appears* correct at first, but only because all values in the first row of the input are the same. The actual implementation will still repeat the first '2' five times, then the second '2' five times, and so on, even though the *result* looks identical to what's expected.  The second line shows the error.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
