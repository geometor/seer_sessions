    type: 2D array
    properties:
      shape: (4, 4)  # Consistent across all examples
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      shape: (4, 20) # Consistent across all examples

  - action: column_pairing
    description: Input grid columns are conceptually paired (0 with 1, 2 with 3, etc.).
  - action: repetition
    description: Each element of input is repeated five times in output.
  - action: construction
    description: building of rows from sets of repeated elements of input grid
  - relation: output_width
    description: The output grid's width is five times the input grid's width.
  - relation: output_height
    description: The output grid's height is the same as the input grid's height.
