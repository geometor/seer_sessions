The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input grid, retaining only certain colored pixels while discarding others (primarily the background color '0'). The order and relative positions of the non-zero colored pixels are significant. Specifically, connected components of the same color within input are considered. The output arranges these components differently.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Each such group is considered a separate object.\n2. **Order:** Arrange these groups in column major order.\n3. **Arrange in Output:** Create new 2x2 block.\n4. **Layout:**  Place first identified item into top-left 2x2, with the first pixel of item to be at top-left corner.\n    For each identified item, scanning from left to right, and top to bottom:\n        - skip background pixels (0).\n        - put connected color pixels into the output.\n        - fill non-connected component space with zeros\n5.
