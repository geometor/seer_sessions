objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: large (input), small (output)
      - elements: pixels (represented by digits 0-9, corresponding to colors)
  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - connectivity: contiguous (pixels of the same color forming a connected component)
      - shape: irregular

actions:
  - type: identify
    description: Identify connected components (pixel groups) of the same non-zero color in the input grid.
  - type: extract
    description: Extract the identified pixel groups.
  - type: rearrange
    description: Rearrange the extracted pixel groups into a specific layout in the output grid.
  - type: discard
    description: Discard all pixels of color '0' (background).

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains multiple pixel_groups.
  - output_grid: Contains a rearranged subset of pixel_groups from the input_grid.
  - pixel_group: Consists of connected pixels of the same non-zero color.
