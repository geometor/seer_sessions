Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the gray stripe and attempts to extract the portion of the grid to its left. However, there are errors in the copied pixels, specifically in rows where the gray stripe column contains data other than just '5' up to the end of that particular row. The strategy should involve refining which columns of the data to select.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine Misaligned Pixels:** Analyze the specific rows and columns where the output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Refine Column Selection:** Focus on the columns that have colors that are not correct and determine the best way to modify them based on their contents.
3. **Check for edge cases**: Make sure all parts of each grid and the gray bar has been accounted for.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use `tool_code` to calculate the differences between the expected and transformed outputs for each example. This will pinpoint the exact locations of the errors.

    if expected.shape != transformed.shape:

**Gather Metrics Results and Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `diff1=(array([], dtype=int64), array([], dtype=int64))`
    *   `shape1_e=(10, 4)`
    *   `shape1_t=(10, 4)`

    The shapes are the same, and there are *no* differences reported in `diff1`. Previous results showed differences, I believe due to extra spaces in my input strings which I fixed by calling strip().

*   **Example 2:**

    *   `diff2=(array([6]), array([2]))`
    *   `shape2_e=(10, 4)`
    *   `shape2_t=(10, 4)`

    Shapes are identical. There's a single difference at row 6, column 2. Expected is 3, but transformed is 0. The input has, at row 6, `0 0 0 3 5 0 0 0 0`. Our rule took everything to the left of the first '5'. However row 6 continues with 3 3 after the 5. It appears the gray stripe isn't truly a complete vertical line, but rather the first 5 we see in each row.

*   **Example 3:**

    *   `diff3=(array([], dtype=int64), array([], dtype=int64))`
    *   `shape3_e=(10, 4)`
    *   `shape3_t=(10, 4)`

    The shapes are correct, and there are no differences. I had incorrectly copied the expected result previously - which I have now fixed.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - shape: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - shape: derived from input_grid
  - name: gray_marker
    type: marker
    properties:
      - color: 5 (gray)
      - shape: single pixel in each row
      - function: delimiter

actions:
  - name: find_marker
    description: Locate the first gray (5) pixel in each row of the input grid.
  - name: extract_left_region
    description: Extract all pixels to the left of the gray marker in each row.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid with the extracted pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through each row** of the input grid.
2.  **Locate the first Gray (5) pixel** in the current row. This pixel acts as the dividing point for that row.
3.  **Extract Pixels:** Copy all pixels to the left of the located Gray pixel in the current row.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** The output grid will have the same number of rows as the input grid. For each row, the number of columns in the output will match the column index of the first Gray pixel found in the corresponding row of the input grid. Copy the extracted pixels into the corresponding row of the output grid.
5.  **Output:** Return the final output grid.
