Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 10x9 grid with a consistent vertical stripe of '5' (gray) near the center. Other colored objects (non-white and non-gray) are present around this central stripe. The rest of the grid consists of '0' (white) pixels.
*   **Output Grid:** A 10x4 grid. It appears to be a cropped version of the input, but focused on the colored (non-white and non-gray) pixels to the *left* of the gray stripe, and retaining their vertical order and stacking. The gray stripe itself and anything to its right has been removed. The shape and structure of the colored area is conserved, but its location in output is different than input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve isolating a specific region of the input grid based on the location of the gray stripe. It extracts pixels to the left of the gray stripe and removes any trailing white rows

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 9
      colors: [0, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8] #all colors used
      gray_stripe:
        color: 5
        location: vertical, near center

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 4
      colors: [0, 2, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8]

  - name: colored_region
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      colors: [2, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8] #all non-white, non-gray
      location: left of gray stripe
      relation_to_output: same pixels and stacking

actions:
  - name: crop
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    parameters:
      - region: left of gray stripe

  - name: stack
    input: colored_region
    output: output section with colored pixels in same row index

relationships:
  - input_grid contains gray_stripe
  - colored_region is_left_of gray_stripe
  - output_grid is_derived_from colored_region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Gray Stripe:** Locate the vertical stripe of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Define Region of Interest:** Consider the region to the *left* of this gray stripe as the region of interest.
3.  **Extract Colored Pixels**: Copy all the pixels to the left of the gray stripe.
4. **Construct Output Grid**: Create output grid from the copied pixels and arrange in same order and stacking, removing the gray stripe and anything to its right.
5.  **Remove trailing white rows:** Remove any trailing white space.
6. Output: Return the final cropped grid.
