            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 10x9 grid with a consistent vertical stripe of '5' (gray) near the center. Other colored objects (non-white and non-gray) are present around this central stripe. The rest of the grid consists of '0' (white) pixels.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 10x4 grid. It appears to be a cropped version of the input, but focused on the colored (non-white and non-gray) pixels to the *left* of the gray stripe, and retaining their vertical order and stacking. The gray stripe itself and anything to its right has been removed. The shape and structure of the colored area is conserved, but its location in output is different than input.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve isolating a specific region of the input grid based on the location of the gray stripe. It extracts pixels to the left of the gray stripe and removes any trailing white rows\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
