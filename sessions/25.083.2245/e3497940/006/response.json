            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of extracting pixels to the left of the first gray pixel in each row is partially correct. However, the provided examples reveal a subtle, yet crucial detail: the extracted pixels to the left of the gray pixel might need an object mirrored (horizontally flipped). The current implementation *almost* works, but needs to account for this detail. The program needs to recognize the object to the left and flip it.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Verify Misalignment:** Analyze each example, looking for the specific pixel mismatches, to see if they follow a mirrored pattern.\n2.  **Refine Logic:** Update the natural language program and the code to first locate the left-side object and then take the mirror image of it.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's re-examine the provided training examples. I am using the provided transformed output as a guide and calculating what the pixel differences actually are between the transformed output and the expected output.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n"
