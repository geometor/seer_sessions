facts:
  - observation: "The leftmost pixel's color in each row acts as a 'seed' color."
  - observation: "The seed color propagates to the right."
  - observation: "Propagation stops when encountering a run of pixels different than the seed of length greater than 1"
  - observation: "The final pixel of a row is not changed by seed color"
  - example: 1
    seed_color: 4
    blocking_color: 6 #this is not a general rule
    propagation_rule: "Propagate seed color right until a run of different colors is length >= 2 or the end of the line"
  - example: 2
    seed_color: 9
    blocking_color: 8 #this is not a general rule
    propagation_rule: "Propagate seed color right until a run of different colors is length >= 2 or the end of the line"
