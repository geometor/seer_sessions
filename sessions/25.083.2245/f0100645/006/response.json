            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly simplistic. The core idea of propagating the leftmost color is partially correct, but the logic for *when* and *how* to propagate is flawed. The \"blocking color\" concept, as implemented, is not generalizable and doesn't correctly capture the observed behavior in the examples. The results show a consistent pattern of over-propagation, turning almost the entire grid into the seed color.  We need a more nuanced rule that considers the context of *multiple* neighboring pixels, not just the immediately preceding one. The blocking logic is not based on a fixed color map but seems related to runs of colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on *why* certain pixels changed color and others didn't. I will use python to help me count and locate these pixels.\n2.  **Refine Blocking Rule:** The current blocking rule is incorrect. I need to identify the *true* conditions under which color propagation is stopped or altered. This might involve looking at patterns of 2 or more pixels.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** I will revise the natural language program and generate new code based on my improved understanding.\n4. I am in the \"dreamer\" role. So I will focus on developing and articulating the natural language program required. I will record facts discovered as well to help generate better code later.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed):**\n\nLet's analyze the examples provided, specifically to find where the transformations differ.\n\n"
