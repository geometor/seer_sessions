facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The transformation is not a simple global replacement of one color with another.
  - observation: |
      Changes seem to occur near the boundaries of color regions.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, 4s replace 7s, and 6s. The replacements are beside original 4s,
       and 7s and 6s are in the input.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, 9 replaces 7s and one 8, 8s and 7 are replaced when beside a 9.
  - object: |
      color regions: Groups of adjacent pixels with the same value.
  - relationship: |
      adjacency:  Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally, based on the ARC priors.
  - action: |
      propagation: A color's value spreads to neighboring pixels under specific conditions.
  - condition: |
      propagation_trigger: It looks like a specific color "seeds" the propagation.
  - condition: |
     replacement_color: The seeder value.
