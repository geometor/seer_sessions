facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    transformations:
      - type: conditional_replacement
        conditions:
          - description: "Pixels on anti-diagonal"
            details: "If a pixel is on the main anti-diagonal, it may change color."
          - description: central_pixel_odd_dimension
            details: center pixel is changed to yellow if row + col = rows - 1 and rows % 2 == 1
          - description: symmetrical_replacement
            details: "Pixels symmetrically opposite across the center may be changed to yellow (4) based on anti-diagonal position, not dependent on the central pixel."
        actions:
          - change_color:
              to: 4 (yellow)
