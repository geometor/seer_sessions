objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - anti_diagonal: Pixels where the sum of row and column indices equals rows - 1.
      - center_pixel: The pixel at the center of the grid, only present in odd-dimension grids.
      - pixel_value: the color of the pixel

actions:
    - name: change_color_anti_diagonal
      description: change the color of pixels on anti-diagonal
      precondition:
        pixels are on anti-diagonal
      postcondition:
        if odd-dimension grid and center pixel, pixel value = 4
        else if pixel_value is 9, pixel_value is unchanged
        otherwise pixel_value = 4
