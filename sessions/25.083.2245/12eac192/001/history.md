Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids to output grids. The most prominent visual feature is the presence of the digit '1' (blue) which seems to be replaced or mirrored by the digit '3'(green). Other digits largely remain, in place, and untouched. There doesn't seem to be other simple actions with the exception of the substitution of `1` with `3`. It feels like there must be some sort of substitution.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples.
  - object_types:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
          - elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
  - transformation_summary: |
      Digits '1' (blue) are consistently replaced, or mirrored, by digits '3' (green) while most of the other digits maintain their position and colors.
  - specific_replacements:
      - original: 1 (blue)
        replacement: 3 (green)
  - unchanged_elements: |
      Most digits other than '1' remain unchanged in their position and color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the value of the cell, copy unchanged to the output grid.
3.  If any value is equal to 1, change it to a 3 and write it in the output.
