The most prominent visual feature is the presence of the digit '1' (blue) which seems to be replaced or mirrored by the digit '3'(green). Other digits largely remain, in place, and untouched. There doesn't seem to be other simple actions with the exception of the substitution of `1` with `3`. It feels like there must be some sort of substitution.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
