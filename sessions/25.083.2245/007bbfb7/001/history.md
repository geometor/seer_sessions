Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** Small grids (3x3) with varying color arrangements.
*   **Output:** Larger grids (9x9) that seem to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.
*   **Transformation:** The input grid appears to be replicated and tiled in a specific way to create the output grid. The pattern isn't a simple mirroring or rotation, but a structured repetition. The input grid seems to act as a "kernel" that's used to generate a larger pattern. The central element of output 9x9 grid appears to represent the original 3x3 input grid. The other elements appear as copies of certain parts of this core element, forming a repeating pattern.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0-9] # Represents the color palette

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      colors: [0-9]

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: The input grid is copied multiple times.
  - name: tile
    description: The replicated grids are arranged in a specific pattern.

relationships:
  - input_grid is_tiled_to_form output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros (white).
2.  **Central Placement:** Copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the center of the 9x9 output grid. The top-left corner of the input grid will be at position (4,4) of the output grid (0-indexed).
3.  **Top-Left Corner Replication:** Copy the top-left corner cell (0,0) of the *input* grid into the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the *output* grid.

4.  **Top-Right Corner Replication:** Copy the top three cells of the input grid (all of row 0), into output cells that are 3 cells to the right. So copy row 0 of input into output cells (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) and (0,6),(0,7),(0,8).

5. **Bottom-Left Corner Replication:** Copy the 3 rows, and one column, of the input grid into output grid columns 0,1,2.

6.  **Bottom-Right Corner Replication:** Copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid of the output grid.

7. Copy all 9 input elements into the 9 subgrids in the output.

8. More generally, copy Input(r,c) to Output(i,j) where r and c are 0,1, or 2, and i%3 = r and j%3 =c.
