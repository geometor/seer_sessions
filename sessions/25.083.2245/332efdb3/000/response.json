The dimensions of the grid remain the same. The key element seems to be the creation of an alternating pattern of black pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For every other pixel, both horizontally and vertically, change the pixel color back to black (0). Specifically, change a blue pixel (1) to black (0) if the sum of its row and column indices is an even number, and otherwise keep the blue.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule can be described as a conditional fill. Start with every cell as blue and change the color to black for cells in even row and column indices.\n"
