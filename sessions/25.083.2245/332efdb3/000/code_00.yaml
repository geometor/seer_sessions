objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable (but consistent within a pair)
      elements: integers (representing colors)
      initial_state: all elements are 0 (black)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: same as input_grid
      elements: integers (representing colors)
      final_state:  mostly 1 (blue), with alternating 0s (black)

actions:
  - name: fill_with_blue
    description: Changes most pixels to blue (1).
    input: input_grid
    output: partially modified grid

  - name: create_checkerboard
    description: Creates an alternating pattern of black pixels (0).
    input: partially modified grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - output_grid's pattern is derived from the input_grid's dimensions.
