Two L-shapes and one single cell.\n      size: 3,3 and 1\n    - color: 1 (blue)\n      positions: [[1, 4], [2, 3], [5,3]]\n      shape: three single cells.\n      size: 1\n    - color: 0 (white)\n      positions: All other cells\n      shape: Background\n      size: 39\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Three distinct objects of color 8 (azure) are present in the input grid: two L-shapes and a single cell. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Cells within Objects:**\n    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in the top-left object.\n    *    Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the left of the others in the middle object.\n    *   Find the azure (color 8) cell that is at the right of the others in the bottom-left object.\n\n3.  **Change Cell Colors:**\n    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the right of the others in the first object.\n    *   Turn to blue the azure cell that is at the left of the others in the second object.\n    *   Turn to blue the single azure cell that represents the other object.\n\n4. **Leave other cells unchanged.**\n**Transformation Rule Summary:**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  Identify the three distinct objects of azure color.\n2. For the top-left object, turn to blue the rightmost cell.\n2. For the middle object, turn to blue the leftmost cell.\n2. For the bottom-left object, turn to blue the rightmost cell.\n4. All other cells remain unchanged.\n"
