## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x701C02D7FF10>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x701C02D7F460>
Okay, I will analyze the provided example and deliver my observations in the requested format.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The output is a single-digit integer.  The specific colors present in the input grid seem important, as well as their spatial arrangement. The core task seems to involve analyzing the colors and their arrangement in the input grid and mapping that somehow to a single output color/number.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:  mapped from integer value
      position: (row, column) within grid
  - type: output
    properties:
     value: single digit integer

actions:
- type: count
  target: specific color pixels
- type: determine_output

relationships:
  -  grid contains pixels
  -  pixels have color and position
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe the input grid:** Examine the 3x3 input grid and identify all the colors present and their locations.
2.  **Count the number of 'gray' (5) pixels.**
3.  **If the Count of 'gray' pixels is greater than or equal to 4 output 1 (blue), otherwise the output will be 0.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
