## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x701C02E69B10>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x701C02E68280>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains only 0s and 5s, while the output grid contains 3s, 4s, and 2s. The spatial arrangement is preserved (3x3 to 3x3), suggesting a per-pixel transformation based on the input pixel's value and/or its position. The input contains the colors white and gray and the output contains the colors green, yellow, and red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - property: input_values
    values: [0, 5]
  - property: output_values
    values: [2, 3, 4]
  - transformation: per-pixel
    type: mapping
  - relationship: spatial_consistency
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation:
      input_0: corresponds_to_output_3
  - observation:
      input_5: corresponds_to_output_not_3
  - observation:
      input_5_center: corresponds_to_output_4
  - observation:
      input_5_corner: corresponds_to_output_2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid. The output grid will also be 3x3.

2.  **Pixel-wise Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid:

    *   If the pixel value is 0, change that pixel in the output grid to 3.
    *   If the pixel value is 5, and at the center position (row 1, column 1) then the corresponding output pixel is assigned the value 4.
    *   If the pixel value is 5, and at the corner positions (row 0 column 0, row 0 column 2, row 2, column 0, and row 2, column2), then the corresponding output pixel is assigned the value of 2.

3.  **Output:** The transformed 3x3 grid is the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
