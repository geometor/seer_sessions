## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x701C02E685E0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x701C02E69B10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid retains the red (2) pixels in the same positions, but the blue and azure pixels are replaced with gray (5) pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color

actions:
  - type: replace
    target:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: azure
        value: 8
    replacement:
      - color: gray
        value: 5

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grid maintains the same spatial arrangement of pixels. Only the colors of specific pixels change.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels that are blue (1) or azure (8).
2.  **Replace** the identified blue (1) or azure (8) pixel with a gray (5) pixel.
3.  **Preserve:** the original red (2) pixels locations.
4. Output the resulting grid.

In simpler terms the red stays, azure and blue become gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
