Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (2x2) of colored squares into a larger grid (4x4) of colored squares. The original colors and their positions seem to be preserved and replicated in the output. The background appears to be white (color code 0).

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input is a 2x2 grid.
  - observation: The output is a 4x4 grid.
  - observation: Each cell in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - observation: The colors in the input grid are replicated in the corresponding 2x2 blocks in the output grid.
  - observation: The output grid has a white (0) border around the replicated input cells.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x2
      cells:
        - position: [0,0]
          color: 1 (blue)
        - position: [0,1]
          color: 2 (red)
        - position: [1,0]
          color: 3 (green)
        - position: [1,1]
          color: 8 (azure)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      cells:
        - position: [0,0]
          color: 0 (white)
        - position: [0,1]
          color: 1 (blue)
    relations:
        - type: replication
          from: input_grid[0,0]
          to: output_grid[1,1], output_grid[1,2],output_grid[2,1],output_grid[2,2]
        - type: replication
          from: input_grid[0,1]
          to:   output_grid[1,2], output_grid[1,3],output_grid[2,2],output_grid[2,3]
        - type: replication
          from: input_grid[1,0]
          to:  output_grid[2,1], output_grid[2,2],output_grid[3,1],output_grid[3,2]
        - type: replication
          from: input_grid[1,1]
          to: output_grid[2,2], output_grid[2,3],output_grid[3,2],output_grid[3,3]

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create a 4x4 output grid.** Initialize all cells to white (0).
2.  **Iterate through each cell of the 2x2 input grid.**
3.  **For each input cell:**
    *   Replicate its color value to a 2x2 block of cells in the output grid, starting at position (input\_row + 1, input\_col + 1). In other words create a copy in position (input\_row +1, input\_col +1), (input\_row +1, input\_col +2), and so on.

Example of iterating process from input to output, using the example above:

*   Input (0, 0), value 1 (blue), becomes output (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2) all value 1.
*   Input (0, 1), value 2 (red), becomes output (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3) all value 2.
*   Input (1, 0), value 3 (green), becomes output (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2) all value 3.
*   Input (1, 1), value 8 (azure), becomes output (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3) all value 8.
