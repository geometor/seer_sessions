Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x7
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 5
      positions: [(0,0), (0,5), (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0)]
    grey_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]
    white_objects:
      count: 13
      positions: Remaining cells
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    red_object:
      count: 1
      position: [(1,1)]
    white_objects:
      count: 8
      positions: Remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**
Here the central grey object is an agent. It leaves a red mark at its position, contracts, and then disappears.

1.  **Identify the Agent:** Find the gray (color code 5) object that forms a vertical line in the center of the input grid.

2.  **Locate Agent's Position:** Determine the row and column indices covered by that object.

3.  **Record center position:**. Note the cell in the center of the object.

4.  **Change color:** Change the value of the center position to red (color code 2).

5. **Contract and disappear:** Eliminate all input cells except the ones forming the center of the central object. Fill the rest with white (color code 0).

6.  **Output:** A 3x3 output grid whose cells are white, except the center cell which becomes red.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input_grid = [
        [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
        [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output_grid = [
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 2, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if output_grid == expected_output_grid:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output_grid)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)_grid

    print()
    assert output_grid == expected_output_grid, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
