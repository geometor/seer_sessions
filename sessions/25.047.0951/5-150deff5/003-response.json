            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 5\n      shape: Irregular, resembling a distorted \"P\"\n      position: Centered in the grid, shifted slightly to the left.\n      size:  A combination of different sized rectangles.\n  background:\n    - color: 0\n      shape: Covers the entire grid\n      size: 8x10\n\noutput_grid:\n  objects:\n    - color: 8\n      shape: Two separate parts.\n      position:  Where parts of the top large horizontal rectangle and the smaller rectangle attached to the middle section.\n      size: variable\n    - color: 2\n      shape: Like a distorted 'P' letter\n      position: Located at the vertical lines of the input, and connecting the two azure (8) regions.\n      size: Variable.\n  background:\n    - color: 0\n      shape: Covers the entire grid\n      size: 8x10\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the single object in the input grid that is not color 0 (the background). In this case, it's the \"P\"-shaped object made of color 5.\n\n2.  **Decompose:** We can consider the P composed by 3 main parts: Top large horizontal rectangle, vertical bar and the smaller rectangle at the middle.\n\n3. **Change Color:**\n     *   The pixels that coincide with the top rectangle become partially color 8 and partially color 2. More precisely, the two leftmost top pixels change to color 8, and two rightmost pixels change to color 2.\n     *   Pixels of the vertical rectangle adjacent to the top rectangle change to color 2.\n     *   The remaining sections of the vertical rectangle do not change color.\n     *   The pixels on the right section of the middle rectangle change to color 8.\n     *   The vertical connecting lines of the object become 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation Applied to the Example:**\n\n1.  The input grid has a \"P\"-shaped object of color 5.\n2.  The leftmost two cells on the upper section changes to color 8.\n3.  The rightmost two cells on the upper section change to color 2.\n4. The vertical connection lines connecting 8 become 2.\n5. The rightmost two cells of the horizontal section in the middle bar change to 8.\n\nThis description captures the transformation by recognizing the P object, identifying its constituent parts, and specifying how the color changes based on the position within the structure. It emphasizes spatial relationships and a decomposition approach to explain the color changes, making the rule relatively generalizable.\n"
