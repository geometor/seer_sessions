The azure objects exist as two separate components: one is composed by the positions (1, 1), and (2, 1), (2, 2), and the other composed of (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4).\n\n2. **Detect singleton objects** The color 8 objects have different shapes.\n\n3. **Observe Changes**: Compare each azure object in the input and output and keep all the pixels of color 8 unchanged.\n\n4.  **Action - Add Blue Pixel:**\n    *   The rightmost pixel of color 8 of the first object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).\n    *   The leftmost pixel of color 8 of the second object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary:**\n\nThe rule preserves every pixel of color 8. The input contains two distinct objects composed by pixels of color 8. The program turns to color 1 the rightmost and leftmost pixels of the objects found on the input, iterating the search from top to down.\n"
