Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 shapes, not connected.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background
  
output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: single unconnected pixels.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells.
      shape: Background

```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on a natural language program-like structure:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of two primary objects of color 8 (azure) and a background of color 0 (white). The azure objects exist as two separate components: one is composed by the positions (1, 1), and (2, 1), (2, 2), and the other composed of (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4).

2. **Detect singleton objects** The color 8 objects have different shapes.

3. **Observe Changes**: Compare each azure object in the input and output and keep all the pixels of color 8 unchanged.

4.  **Action - Add Blue Pixel:**
    *   The rightmost pixel of color 8 of the first object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).
    *   The leftmost pixel of color 8 of the second object (reading top to down, and left to right) changes to 1 (blue).

**Transformation Rule Summary:**

The rule preserves every pixel of color 8. The input contains two distinct objects composed by pixels of color 8. The program turns to color 1 the rightmost and leftmost pixels of the objects found on the input, iterating the search from top to down.
