Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each filling a single column and composed of a unique, solid color (3, 1, and 2 respectively).

2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Every instance of color '3' (green) in the input grid is replaced by color '4' (yellow) in the output grid.
    *   Every instance of color '1' (blue) in the input grid is replaced by color '5' (gray) in the output grid.
    *   Every instance of color '2' (red) in the input grid is replaced by color '6' (magenta) in the output grid.

3.  **Structure Preservation:** The shape and position of the lines are preserved. The transformation is a direct color substitution, maintaining the overall structure.

In essence, the transformation is a simple color substitution rule, where the input colors 3, 1, and 2 are mapped to the output colors 4, 5, and 6, respectively, while the grid structure remains the same.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
