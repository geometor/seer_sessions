Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
  dimensions: 9x9

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: 1x1
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: 1x1, forms a square around object 2
    - color: 7
      positions: [(5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: 1x1, forms a square around object 1
  dimensions: 9x9
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Locate all objects in the input grid that consist of a single cell. In this case, we have two such objects: a red cell (color 2) at position (3, 2) and a blue cell (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Create a Colored Frame Around Each Identified Object:**
    *    Around the red cell (color 2), create a 3x3 square frame using yellow (color 4) cells. The original red cell remains at the center of this new frame. The frame cells are those at coordinate positions that make up this 3x3 square centered on (3,2) excluding (3,2) itself - this leaves us with the coordinates: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2) and (4,3). Note that the specification says to "create a *frame*". This seems to imply that only the border of a square will be colored and not the inner cells.
    *    Around the blue cell (color 1), create a 3x3 square frame using orange (color 7) cells.  The original blue cell remains at the center. Similarly to the above, the coordinates will be: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6) and (7,7). Again, only the border will be colored.

3.  **Preserve Original Single-Cell Objects:** The original red (2) and blue (1) cells remain in their original positions within their respective frames.

4. **Other cells:** All other cells that were not part of the identified single-cell objects or new frames remain unchanged (color 0).

In summary, the transformation rule involves identifying single-cell objects and drawing a colored frame, a specific shape and of a specific color, around each of them, while preserving the original single-cell objects and leaving everything else at color 0. The colors of the frames are determined depending on the central color.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying single-cell objects and drawing a 3x3 colored frame around each of them. The color of the frame depends on the color of the single-cell object.
- If the single-cell object is red (color 2), the frame is yellow (color 4).
- If the single-cell object is blue (color 1), the frame is orange (color 7).
The original single-cell objects are preserved, and all other cells remain unchanged (color 0).

     - color: 7

       shape: 1x1, forms a square around object 1 at (6,6)
  dimensions: 9x9
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid consisting of a single cell, as in the previous example.

2.  **Create Frames Conditionally:**
    *   If a single-cell object has color 2, create a 3x3 yellow (color 4) frame *around* the object, but *only* fill positions if empty. Do not modify other existing colors. Preserve existing single cell object.
    *   If a single-cell object has color 1, create a 3x3 orange (color 7) frame *around* the object, but *only* fill positions if empty. Do not modify other existing colors. Preserve existing single cell object.
    * If an object has a color other than 1 or 2, it is preserved, but no action will take place (no surrounding frame).

3.  **Preservation and Non-Interference:** The framing operation must *not* overwrite any existing colored cells. If a frame position overlaps with an existing cell (including the single cell object around which the frame is created), the existing cell's color is maintained.

4. **Other cells:** All other cells that were not part of the identified single-cell objects or new frames remain unchanged (color 0).

In summary, the key difference from the previous example is the conditional framing and the non-interference rule: frames are created based on the color of the single-cell object (1 or 2), and the frame creation process does not overwrite any existing colored cells. The color of the frame depends on the color of the single cell object around which it will be drawn.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**
