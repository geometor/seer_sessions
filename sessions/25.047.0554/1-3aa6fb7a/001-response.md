Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shapes, one in top left, one in the bottom right.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single pixels.

  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid. These form two distinct "L" shaped objects.

2.  **Blue Pixel Insertion (Top-Left Object):** In the top-left azure object, identify the corner, which are cells that are only connected to one other cell in its group. Change the rightmost such azure pixel to blue (color 1).

3. **Blue Pixel Insertion (Bottom-Right Object):** In the bottom-right azure object, identify the corner, which are cells that are only connected to one other cell in its group. Change the downmost such azure pixel to blue (color 1).

4. **Other Pixels:** All other pixels, that are not azure or that are not affected by the above-mentioned rule, remain unchanged (color 0).

In essence, the transformation identifies the corner of each isolated group of azure pixels, and paints one of them blue, in the direction of the shape, which means the right-most for a vertical L shape, and the bottom one for a horizontal shape.
