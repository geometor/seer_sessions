## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E1D3490>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E1D3460>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input grid transforms into a new grid, also 3x3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of propagation or filling based on existing non-zero values. Specifically, the magenta (6) color in the input at position (0,2) appears to "fill" downwards in the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 3x3 matrix of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - data_type: integer
      - values: [0-9] representing colors
  - object: cell
    description: individual element within the grid
    properties:
      - row_index: integer, range [0-2]
      - col_index: integer, range [0-2]
      - value: integer, range [0-9]
  - observation:
    description: Magenta (6) expands
    details: The value 6 at (0,2) in the input becomes the value of all cells in the column below it
  - observation:
    description: Yellow (4) expands
    details: The value of 4 at (1,1) becomes the value of all cells in the column below it

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.
2.  Within each column, **find** the highest row index that has non-zero values.
3.  Propagate these values downwards replacing all zero values to fill the column.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
