## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x70DF5E1D3460>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x70DF5E1D3490>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2x6 grid of colored pixels. The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in both rows, in a checkerboard pattern. The overall dimensions of the grid remain the same.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x6
      elements: pixels
      top_row_initial: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
      bottom_row_initial: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
      top_row_final: [3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9]
      bottom_row_final: [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3]
    transformations:
      - type: alteration
        description: Colors alternate between green and maroon in each row.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        green: 3
        maroon: 9
    transformations: {}
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Maintain Grid Structure:** The input grid's dimensions (2x6) are preserved in the output grid.
2.  **Alternate Colors:** In each row of the output, the colors of the pixels alternate between green (3) and maroon (9).
3.  **Row 1 starts with original color:** first row starts with green(3).
4. **Row 2 starts with other color:** second row starts with maroon(9).

Essentially input becomes a checkerboard pattern of alternating green and maroon.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
