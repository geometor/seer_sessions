facts:
  - observation: "The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output."
  - object_property: "Each row contains a single color in the input."
  - transformation_rule: "Each row transforms into an alternating pattern of two colors."
  - transformation_color_1: "The first color in each row of output matches first color in each row of input."
  - transformation_color_2: "The second color in each row depends on its relationship with the first color"
  - row_alternation: "Colors alternate within each row in output."
  - color_relationship: "If initial color is NOT 9 the alternating color is 9. If the intial color IS 9 the alternating color is the second pixel in the input row"
