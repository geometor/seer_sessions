Both grids have the same dimensions (2 rows, 6 columns in this example). The input grid consists of two horizontal lines, each of a single color. The output grid appears to be a checkerboard pattern created by alternating the colors from the input grid, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Use the first color of the first input row to begin.\n4.  **Start Second output Row:** Construct the second row of the output grid using the same alternating color pattern as the first, but starting from the color *not* used to begin the first output row.\n5. **Repeat for additional rows:** If more rows exist, continue constructing output row by swapping the starting color each time\n6. **Repeat for additional columns:** if more columns exist, continue constructing output columns by extending alternating color pattern of the row.\n7.  **Complete Output:** The output grid is formed by these alternating rows.\n\nIn simpler terms: Create a checkerboard pattern in the output grid, using the colors of the two input rows. The top-left cell of the output grid should have the same color as the top-left cell of the input grid. Each adjacent cell (horizontally and vertically) should have the alternating color.\n"
