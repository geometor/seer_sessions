facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - cells: contain color values (0-9)
  - object: row
    properties:
      - color_sequence: alternating colors
      - color_1: determined by the first pixel of the input row
      - color_2:
        condition_1: if color_1 != 9, color_2 = 9
        condition_2: if color_1 == 9, color_2 = second pixel of the row in the *input* grid
  - action: transform
    description: modify the input grid to produce the output grid based on row-wise color alternation
  - observation_1: "Output grid dimensions equal input grid dimensions"
  - observation_2: "color_1 for a row is defined as the color of the first pixel of the corresponding row in the input"
  - observation_3: "color_2 for a row is defined as color 9 if color_1 is not 9"
  - observation_4: "color_2 for a row is defined as the color of the second pixel in the input when color_1 is 9"
  - observation_5: "Each row transforms independently"
  - observation_6: "Each row output has alternating color sequence"
  - observation_7: "odd numbered columns (starting at 1) have color_1"
  - observation_8: "even numbered columns (starting at 1) have color_2"
