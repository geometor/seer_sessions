## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 8 6
5 8 6
5 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E066200>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E0656F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the numbers 5, 8, and 6, while the output grid contains the numbers 1, 9, and 2. The spatial arrangement of the grid is preserved during the transformation. It appears to be a one-to-one mapping between input and output colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [5, 8, 6]
    output_values: [1, 9, 2]
    transformation: element-wise
    mapping:
      5: 1
      8: 9
      6: 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color substitution. Each number in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding number in the output grid according to this direct mapping:

1.  Replace all occurrences of the number 5 with the number 1.
2.  Replace all occurrences of the number 8 with the number 9.
3.  Replace all occurrences of the number 6 with the number 2.

The shape and size of the grid do not change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
