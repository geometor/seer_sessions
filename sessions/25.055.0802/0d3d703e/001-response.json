Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to be a consistent mapping of input colors/digits to output colors/digits. There are no obvious spatial transformations or manipulations of the grid structure itself.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Input digit 3 (green) is replaced with digit 4 (yellow).\n2.  Input digit 1 (blue) is replaced with digit 5 (gray).\n3.
