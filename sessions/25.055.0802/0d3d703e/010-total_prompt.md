Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a direct color substitution: red (2) becomes magenta (6), green (3) becomes yellow (4), and azure (8) becomes maroon (9). This mapping is applied to each pixel in the input grid to generate the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a simple color substitution. The provided code correctly transforms the first training example. Running it against all training examples will confirm whether this simple rule is sufficient for all cases or if it needs refinement. Based on the results, we'll need to adjust the natural language program and potentially the code to reflect any additional complexities or nuances discovered in the other examples. The strategy is to verify the initial hypothesis (color substitution) and then iteratively refine it based on the empirical evidence from all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

Since I don't have direct code execution capabilities, I'll describe the expected results and the types of metrics we would gather. I will assume that you will use this descriptions to use your code execution to gather data.
I will describe how to construct YAML reports.

For each example, we'd ideally want to compute:

1.  **Input Dimensions:** Height and width of the input grid.
2.  **Output Dimensions:** Height and width of the output grid.
3.  **Color Mapping Accuracy:** For each color present in the input, check if it's correctly mapped to the corresponding output color according to the current rule. Count correct and incorrect mappings.
4.  **Pixel-wise Comparison:** Compare each pixel in the generated output with the expected output. Report the percentage of matching pixels.
5. Identify objects, count the number, properties, and actions performed.

Let's assume the provided color mapping (red to magenta, green to yellow, azure to maroon) is consistent across all examples (based on the initial code comment). We expect the dimensions to remain the same. We'll need to focus on whether this color mapping holds true for *all* pixels in *all* training examples.

**Code Execution Instructions**

1.  **Execute the `transform` function:** Run the `transform` function on each input grid from the training set.
2.  **Compare with Expected Output:** Compare the generated output grid, element-by-element, with the corresponding expected output grid provided in the task.
3.  **Gather Metrics:** Calculate the metrics described above (input/output dimensions, color mapping accuracy, pixel-wise comparison, object counts).

**YAML Report Structure (Example)**
I will show how the data you collect should be captured in a yaml block.

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 0  # Index of the training example
    input_dimensions: [10, 10]
    output_dimensions: [10, 10]
    color_mapping_accuracy:
      red_to_magenta: 100% #percentage of correctly mapped
      green_to_yellow: 100%
      azure_to_maroon: 100%
    pixelwise_comparison: 100%  # Percentage of matching pixels
    objects:
        - object_id: 1
          color: red
          shape: rectangle
          size: [2, 3] #height, width
          position: [0,0] #row, col
          actions: color_change #describe action performed on this object
  - example_id: 1  # Index of the training example
    input_dimensions: [12, 12]
    output_dimensions: [12, 12]
    color_mapping_accuracy:
      red_to_magenta: 95%
      green_to_yellow: 100%
      azure_to_maroon: 100%
    pixelwise_comparison: 98%  # Percentage of matching pixels
    objects:
        - object_id: 1
          color: red
          shape: irregular
          size: 5 #number of pixels
          position: [3,3] #row, col of starting pixel
          actions: color_change

```

**Natural Language Program (Initial - Potentially to be Revised)**

```
The transformation rule performs a direct color substitution on each pixel of the input grid.  Red pixels are changed to magenta, green pixels to yellow, and azure pixels to maroon. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
```

**Next Steps:**

After you execute the code and provide the results, particularly any discrepancies or errors, I will:

1.  **Analyze the Errors:** Determine the nature of the errors. Are they due to incorrect color mappings, additional transformations not yet accounted for, or other factors?
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to incorporate the new findings.
3.  **Suggest Code Modifications:** If necessary, provide guidance on how to modify the Python code to align with the refined natural language program.
4. **Repeat** Repeat with more examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
