## Example 4

**input:**
```
9 4 2
9 4 2
9 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E0656F0>

**output:**
```
8 3 6
8 3 6
8 3 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E066200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers in both the input and output. Each number corresponds to a specific color. The transformation appears to be a consistent mapping of input colors/numbers to output colors/numbers. There are no obvious spatial manipulations (rotations, reflections, etc.). The core concept is a simple color substitution.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    element_type: color_coded_pixels
  - observation: input_output_color_mapping
    mapping:
      9: 8  # maroon -> azure
      4: 3  # yellow -> green
      2: 6  # red -> magenta
  - transformation_type: direct_color_substitution
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a one-to-one mapping of input pixel values (colors) to output pixel values (colors). Specifically:

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If the pixel's value is 9 (maroon), change it to 8 (azure).
3.  If the pixel's value is 4 (yellow), change it to 3 (green).
4.  If the pixel's value is 2 (red), change it to 6 (magenta).
5.  Maintain the grid's original 3x3 structure.

This program describes a simple, direct substitution of colors based on their corresponding numerical values without altering the spatial arrangement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
