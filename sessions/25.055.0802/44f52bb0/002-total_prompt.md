## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E065A80>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x70DF5E066200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: red (2) and white (0).  The output is a 1x1 grid containing the color blue (1). The core task appears to involve simplification or summarizing the input grid into a single value output. The specific rule likely involves counting or otherwise assessing the colors in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_type: grid
  - input_dimensions: 3x3
  - input_colors: [red, white]
  - input_color_values: [2, 0]
  - output_type: grid
  - output_dimensions: 1x1
  - output_color: blue
  - output_color_value: 1
  - operation_type: counting # Hypothesis
  - counted_object: red_pixels #Hypothesis

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Output:** If there is at least one red cell, produce the color blue value of one in the output grid, regardless of how many red cells are present.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
