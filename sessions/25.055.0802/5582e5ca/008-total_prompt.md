## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E065930>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E065A80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of pixels. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color (maroon, represented by the digit 9). The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x3).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells:
        - value: integer (0-9)
          color: mapped from value
    actions:
      - transform: change all cell values

relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: output grid has same dimensions as input grid
  - type: color-value
    description: each digit corresponds to a specific color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to replace all the pixels in the input grid with the color maroon (digit 9).  Essentially, every cell value in the input grid, regardless of its initial value, is changed to 9 in the output grid. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
