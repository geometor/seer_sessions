## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E065A80>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E064400>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (magenta, represented by the digit 6). The key is to determine how the input grid's colors relate to the output grid's uniform color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [4, 6, 9, 1, 8]  # yellow, magenta, maroon, blue, azure
    output_color: 6  # magenta
    input_color_counts:
        4: 2
        6: 2
        8: 2
        9: 1
        1: 1
    most_frequent_colors: [4,6,8]
    color_6_positions:
        - [0,1]
        - [1,0]
        - [2,2]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target color:** Find the color represented by the digit '6' (magenta) in the input grid.
2.  **Flood fill:** Replace all pixels in the output grid with the target color (6). The rule is to fill the entire output grid with magenta. The input can be seen as giving the size of the output (same dimensions) and showing which color will fill the output (color 6).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
