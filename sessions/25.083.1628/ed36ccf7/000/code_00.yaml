facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions (3x3).
  - observation: |
      Each grid contains single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - observation: |
      The number of pixels of each color is conserved between input and output.
  - observation: |
      The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of pixels.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: single-digit integers (colors)
  - action: spatial_rearrangement
    description: |
      Pixels are rearranged within the grid, maintaining color counts.
      The rearrangement changes based on the input configuration, indicating
      it is not simply a rotation or reflection
    details: |
        The transformation is either a 90-degree clockwise rotation *or*
        a reflection along the main diagonal + 90-degree rotation, as
        evidenced by consistent results.
