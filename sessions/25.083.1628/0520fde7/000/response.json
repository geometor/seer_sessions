The most prominent change is the replacement of a specific set of pixels. The color 'gray' (value 5) appears in the input grid in the same postion of every input. All other non-black and non-white colors get removed, while 'gray' (5) is key to the transformation. Wherever 'gray'(5) appears in the input, a 'red' (2) appears in the output at that location.  Black (0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
