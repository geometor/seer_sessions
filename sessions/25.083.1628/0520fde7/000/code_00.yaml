facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object: "Pixels with values representing colors."
    properties:
      - color: "Represents a value between 0-9, with specific RGB mappings."
      - position: "Defined by row and column index in the grid."
  - action: "Replacement of pixel values."
    details:
      - condition: "Pixels that are not 0 and are not 5 in the input grid are changed."
      - transformation: "All gray (5) pixels in the input become red (2) in the output. other colors (not 0 or 5) are changed to black (0)."
  - relationship: "Spatial correspondence between input and output pixels."
    details: "Transformation is position-dependent; the output pixel at (row, col) depends on the input pixel at (row, col)."
