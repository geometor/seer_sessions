facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    type: element within grid
    property: color (represented by an integer)

  - object: marker
    type: pixel
    property: specific_color (5, gray)

  - observation: "The output grid's colors depend on the arrangement of 'marker' pixels."
  - observation: "When 'marker' pixels form or almost form a diagonal line, output is bands of color."

  - relationship: diagonal_top_right_to_bottom_left
    marker_positions: [(0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0)]
    output_rows: [Green, Yellow, Red]

  - relationship: right_column
    marker_positions: Any where x=2
    output_rows: [Green, Green, Green]
