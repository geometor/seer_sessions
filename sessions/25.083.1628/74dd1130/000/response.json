The transformation appears to re-arrange the elements within the grid, suggesting a permutation or sorting-based operation, rather than arithmetic or color-based changes. The core operation is a reordering of existing elements. The transformation isn't a simple rotation or reflection, but rather a more complex rearrangement.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
