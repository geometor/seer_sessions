  description: "Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. The resulting expanded grid is then surrounded by a single-pixel border of black (color 0)."
  input:
    object: "grid"
    properties:
      - "2D array of pixels"
      - "each pixel has a color value (0-9)"
  output:
    object: "grid"
    properties:
      - "2D array of pixels"
      - "dimensions are double the input dimensions"
      - "each input pixel is represented as a 2x2 block in the output"
      - "a one-pixel black border surrounds the expanded pixels"
  actions:
    - "duplicate each pixel to create a 2x2 block"
    - "add a border of black pixels (color 0) around the expanded grid"
