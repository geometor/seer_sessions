The transformation seems to focus on replacing certain colors based on their horizontal and/or vertical neighbors, in a way that also seems influenced by the values in the input data. Specifically, color 8 (azure) seems particularly important, and is often, but not always, replaced by color 5 (gray). It appears, the replacement by 5 is conditioned by the location of other '8's in the input.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
