            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were incorrect. The core misunderstanding lies in the reflection logic. The original code seems to be attempting a reflection across *both* the main diagonal *and* the center, which isn't what the examples demonstrate. The examples show a simple reflection over the *anti-diagonal*, not any combination of diagonals or center-reflections. The provided code swaps pixel values, which also is not indicated by the examples. The provided examples have pixels that appear to be in certain locations because of rotation, specifically 180-degree rotation, not reflection as suggested.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Reflection:** The reflection rule needs to be precisely defined. It is anti-diagonal, not what the code did. It's effectively a 180 degree rotation\n2.  **No Swapping:** The description must specify that the color values are moved, not swapped.\n3.  **Metrics Gathering (using code execution where needed):** We don't need the code here since the provided examples show this. We are interested in:\n    *   Grid size for each example\n    *   Identifying the colors involved\n    *   Confirming that non-zero pixels in the original change location.\n\n**Metrics & Observations (from visual inspection, code execution not needed for this simple case):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Size: 4x4\n    *   Colors: 0 (white), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure), 3 (green)\n    *   Non-zero pixels are moved and placed into a grid equivalent to rotating the input grid by 180 degrees.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Size: 4x4\n    *   Colors: 0 (white), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange), 6 (magenta)\n    *   Non-zero pixels are moved and placed into a grid equivalent to rotating the input grid by 180 degrees.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
