The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The background color is consistently black (0).  The most notable change is the rearrangement of non-black pixels. There's a sense of diagonal movement or reflection involved, and empty space is created. The colors of the non-zero pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Or reflect each cell location over the grid diagonal.\n3. **Move** each pixel to it's new location in the output grid.\n4. **Clear** the original locations of the moved pixels in the output grid, replacing the non-black value with black (0).\n\nIn essence, the transformation performs a reflection across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the grid. It's similar to a matrix transpose operation but with the constraint of a square input.\n"
