facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (4x4 in the examples).
  - observation: The background color is consistently black (0) in both input and output.
  - observation: Non-black pixel colors are preserved during the transformation.
  - observation: Non-black pixels seem to be repositioned.
  - relationship: The positions of non-black pixels in the output grid appear to be related to their positions in the input grid through some form of reflection or diagonal mirroring.
  - action: Non-zero pixels are moved from their input grid position to output grid position,
    leaving the previous position as a zero
