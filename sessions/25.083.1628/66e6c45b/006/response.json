            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program described a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid. While this conceptually aligns with a kind of \"flipping\" operation, the provided examples reveal a more nuanced transformation. The code correctly implements a 180-degree rotation, but the expected outputs show that individual 2x2 subgrids *within* the larger grid are being rotated, not the entire grid itself. The strategy must shift from rotating the whole grid to identifying and rotating these 2x2 blocks.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify 2x2 Subgrids:** The core of the revised logic will be to systematically identify all 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.\n2.  **Rotate Each Subgrid:** Each identified 2x2 subgrid will be rotated 180 degrees.\n3.  **Reconstruct Output:** The rotated subgrids will be placed back into their original positions within the overall grid structure to form the final output.\n4.  Iterate and check color correctness, before and after.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (with potential `tool_code`):**\n\nLet's analyze the examples to confirm our understanding. I need to programmatically check a few things, thus tool usage is essential.\n\n"

This division is based on the grid's dimensions, and it's crucial that both dimensions are even numbers.\n\n2.  **Local Rotation:** Each 2x2 subgrid is independently rotated by 180 degrees. This means the top-left pixel becomes the bottom-right, the top-right becomes the bottom-left, the bottom-left becomes the top-right, and the bottom-right becomes the top-left *within that subgrid*.\n\n3.  **Implicit Reconstruction:** The rotated subgrids remain in their original positions within the larger grid structure.  The output grid is formed by the arrangement of these rotated 2x2 blocks. There is no explicit \"reassembly\" step; the rotation of individual blocks inherently defines the final output.\n"
