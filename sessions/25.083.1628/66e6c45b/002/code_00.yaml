task: diagonal_reflection_and_swap
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 4
      columns: 4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      non_zero_pixels:
        example_1: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)]
        example_2: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)]
transformations:
  - type: reflection_and_swap
    description: Reflects non-zero pixel positions across the main diagonal and across the center.
    details:
      - Non-zero pixels are identified.
      - Each non-zero pixel at (r, c) swaps its value with the pixel at (cols-1-c, rows-1-r).
      - Zero pixels remain unchanged.
