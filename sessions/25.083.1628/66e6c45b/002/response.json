            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a simple reflection across the main diagonal is incorrect. The expected outputs show a more complex transformation. It seems that non-zero values on opposite sides of the diagonal and are swapped in position *and* exchanged with each other. It's clear the previous code only transposes and does not correctly map the input to the desired output. The errors are consistent across both examples, indicating a systematic flaw in the transformation logic. The strategy will involve re-examining the relationship between input and output grids to identify the correct swapping rule, and then updating the natural language program and code accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**\n\nFor detailed pixel-by-pixel comparisons, it's not efficient to use `tool_code` here directly. We already have the transformed outputs and expected outputs. We'll derive metrics directly from those.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n*   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n*   Non-zero Input Pixels: (1,1): 5, (1,2): 6, (2,1): 8, (2,2): 3\n*   Non-zero Output Pixels: (0,0): 5, (0,3): 6, (3,0): 8, (3,3): 3\n*   Observations: The input grid is a square. Non zero pixels are reflected along the main diagonal AND also reflected accross the center, swapping positions with cell at the opposite position.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n*   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n*   Non-zero Input Pixels: (1,1): 3, (1,2): 4, (2,1): 7, (2,2): 6\n*   Non-zero Output Pixels: (0,0): 3, (0,3): 4, (3,0): 7, (3,3): 6\n*   Observations: Same observation as example 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
