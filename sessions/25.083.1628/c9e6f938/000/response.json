The output grid's height is the same as the input grid's height.\n\n3. **Expand the grid:** create an output grid that is double in width.\n\n4.  **Replicate and Position:**\n    *   For each orange (7) pixel in the input grid, place an orange pixel in the corresponding position in the output grid. The row number should be the same. The new column number is calculated with: `output_col= input_col * 2`. Place additional orange pixels to \"connect\" the shapes, ensuring the new shape contains all pixels from the original, plus newly added pixels, all contiguous.\n\n5.  **Fill Background:** Fill all remaining cells in the output grid with the background color (white, 0).\n\nKey improvements and observations in this refined response:\n\n*   **Contiguous shapes**: I am making assumptions about the need for the resulting shape to be contiguous, filling between the stretched objects.\n*   **More Specific Replication:** The replication rule isn't a simple mirroring or exact copy. It's a positional translation and extension of the orange shape, where x coordinates are double.\n\nThe natural language program focuses on *what* to do, and it is complete, covering all transformations.\n"
