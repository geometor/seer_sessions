1.  **Identify the Background and Object:** The background color is 0 (white), and the object color is 7 (orange).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same height as the input. The output width is double the input width.
3.  **Create Output:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color (0, white) with the determined dimensions.
4.  **Mirror Objects:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel in the input.
    *   If a pixel is the object color (7), copy it to the same position in the output.
    *   Calculate the mirrored position: `(row, 2 * input_width - 1 - col)`.
    *   Copy the object pixel to this mirrored position in the output.
5.  **Conditional Horizontal Fill:**
    *    For each row and for each contiguous segment of orange color in input grid.
        * Locate its position on the output grid.
        * Locate its mirrored position on the output grid.
        * Fill the space, inclusively, between the copied segment and it's mirrored segment with orange color.
