Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the background color (0, white) and the object color (7, orange) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same height as the input grid. The output grid's width is double the input grid's width.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color (0, white) with the determined dimensions.
4.  **Replicate and Mirror Object:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    *   If the pixel is the object color (7, orange), place a pixel of the same color in the output grid at the corresponding position.
    *   Calculate the mirrored position: `(row, 2 * input_width - 1 - col)`. Place an orange pixel at this mirrored position in the output grid.
5.  **Horizontal Fill:** For each row in the output grid:
    *   Check for presence of the color orange
    *    Fill all pixels between the leftmost and rightmost orange pixels (inclusive) in that row with the object color (7, orange).

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs a mirroring and horizontal fill operation. It correctly handles the first example. However, it fails in the second and third examples because of how the horizontal fill is implemented. The fill logic connects mirrored parts of the object that shouldn't be connected. We need to refine the fill operation to be more context-aware and only fill between mirrored pixels that are part of an original contiguous object.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output of each example to pinpoint the exact discrepancies. Pay close attention to the second and third examples.
2.  **Refine Horizontal Fill:** Modify the horizontal fill logic. Instead of filling between the absolute leftmost and rightmost orange pixels in a row, we should fill *only* between mirrored pairs that originate from the same continuous object in the input.
3.  **Object Identification:** Ensure we can differentiate between separate object segments in a single row. This is crucial for the fill logic.

**Gather Metrics (using manual inspection for now, can automate with code later if needed):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Object Color: 7 (orange)
    *   Object identified and mirrored correctly.
    *   Horizontal Fill: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Object Color: 7
    *   Object identified and mirrored correctly.
    *   Horizontal Fill: Incorrect. Filled between two separate mirrored segments. Two pixels are incorrect (0,2) and (0,3).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Object Color: 7
    *   Object identified and mirrored correctly.
    *   Horizontal Fill: Incorrect. Filled the entire row when it should not have. Four pixels are incorrect (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Background and Object:** The background color is 0 (white), and the object color is 7 (orange).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same height as the input. The output width is double the input width.
3.  **Create Output:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color (0, white) with the determined dimensions.
4.  **Mirror Objects:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel in the input.
    *   If a pixel is the object color (7), copy it to the same position in the output.
    *   Calculate the mirrored position: `(row, 2 * input_width - 1 - col)`.
    *   Copy the object pixel to this mirrored position in the output.
5.  **Conditional Horizontal Fill:**
    *    For each row and for each contiguous segment of orange color in input grid.
        * Locate its position on the output grid.
        * Locate its mirrored position on the output grid.
        * Fill the space, inclusively, between the copied segment and it's mirrored segment with orange color.
