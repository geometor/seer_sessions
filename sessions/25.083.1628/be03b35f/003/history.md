Here's a breakdown of the results, focusing on why the current code fails and how to improve the natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code aims to extract a rectangular subgrid from the top-left, *but it incorrectly determines the dimensions of this subgrid*. It stops either at the first row or column that does *not* contain *only* white or blue, rather than finding the bounding box of the object composed by contiguous white or blue colors. The expected outputs are 2x2 subgrids in all the provided examples. The current logic, if it worked at all, would be finding variable-sized subgrids. The core issue is that the algorithm doesn't properly define or identify the "top-left object." It needs to find contiguous region of blue and white, regardless of shape, not full rows and columns.

**Strategy for Improvement**

1.  **Redefine "Object":** The object isn't defined by full rows/columns of blue/white. It is any contiguous region of just these.
2.  **Bounding Box, not full row/column:** Instead of stopping the search when a non-blue/white cell is encountered, check if the color is either blue or white.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis - code execution not strictly needed for this level of analysis)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5
    *   Expected Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Actual Output Shape: 5x5. The entire input grid is returne.
    *   Observation: The code extends beyond the actual object. The top-left object's true dimensions are 2x2 (the connected blue and white at the top left).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5
    *   Expected Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Actual Output Shape: 5x5. The entire input grid is returned.
    *   Observation: Same as Example 1.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5
    *   Expected Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Actual Output Shape: 5x5. The entire input grid is returned.
    *   Observation: Same as Example 1.

**YAML Fact Block**

  - object_definition: |
      A contiguous region of pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid,

      pixels from the top-left.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Top-Left Object:** Find the largest connected region of pixels, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid, where all pixels within this region are either blue (1) or white (0).  "Connected" means adjacent horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column of the top-left object identified in step 1.
3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract the sub-grid defined by the bounding box. The output grid's dimensions will be (max\_row - min\_row + 1) x (max\_col - min\_col + 1).
4.  **Copy Pixels:** Copy the pixel values within the bounding box from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new output grid.
5.  The expected output dimensions should be 2x2.
