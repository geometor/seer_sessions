Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves extracting a specific sub-grid from the input grid. The sub-grid appears to be defined by the top-left "object" composed of blue and white pixels. The width of the output is equal to number of columns occupied by the top-left object, and height is equal to the number of rows occupied by the top-left object. The output is copied from top-left corner of the object. It seems that the rest of the grid content (specifically the presence of red pixels towards the bottom-right) is irrelevant to the transformation.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain multiple colored pixels, primarily blue (1), white (0), and red (2).
  - object_identification: |
      A distinct object can be identified in the top-left corner of each input grid.
      This object always contains blue and/or white.
  - object_property: |
      The top-left object varies in width and height across the examples.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output grid's dimensions correspond exactly to the dimensions of the top-left object in the input grid.
  - transformation_rule: |
      The output grid is a direct copy of the top-left object from the input grid.
  - irrelevant_elements: |
      Pixels not part of the top-left object (e.g. the red pixels) do not appear in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Top-Left Object:** Locate the contiguous block of pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid that consists of blue (1) and/or white (0) pixels.
2.  **Determine Dimensions:** Calculate the width (number of columns) and height (number of rows) of this top-left object.
3. **Extract Sub-grid:** Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 2.
4.  **Copy Pixels:** Copy the pixel values from the input grid, starting at the top-left corner (0,0) and extending to the calculated width and height, to the corresponding positions in the new output grid.

Essentially, the program isolates and extracts the top-left "blue/white" object from the input to create output.
