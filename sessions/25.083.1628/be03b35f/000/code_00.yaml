facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain multiple colored pixels, primarily blue (1), white (0), and red (2).
  - object_identification: |
      A distinct object can be identified in the top-left corner of each input grid.
      This object always contains blue and/or white.
  - object_property: |
      The top-left object varies in width and height across the examples.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output grid's dimensions correspond exactly to the dimensions of the top-left object in the input grid.
  - transformation_rule: |
      The output grid is a direct copy of the top-left object from the input grid.
  - irrelevant_elements: |
      Pixels not part of the top-left object (e.g. the red pixels) do not appear in the output.
