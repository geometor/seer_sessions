1.  **Input:** A grid of colored pixels (integers 0-9).
2.  **Output:** A 2x2 grid.
3.  **Rule:** The output grid does not exist as a sub-grid in the input grid in any of the training examples.
   *  The output grid always consists of colors blue (1) and white (0)
   *  The top row of the output grid is a copy of the first two pixels of the second row of the input grid.
   *  The second row of the output grid has the first pixel equal to the pixel in position [0,0] and the second pixel as the pixel in position [0,1] of the original grid
