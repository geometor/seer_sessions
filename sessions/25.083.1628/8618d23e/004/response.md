Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the assumption that the input grid is always embedded at the top-left corner of a larger grid, with one extra row and column added, and the new cells filled with maroon (9). The results show this is incorrect. The embedding position and the added rows/columns seem to vary. The provided code fails on all three examples, but the size of output grid and number of added row and column are inconsistent across samples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Misalignment:** For each example, determine the exact difference in placement of the input grid within the output grid. Calculate the row and column offsets.
2.  **Identify Pattern:** Look for a pattern in the offsets. Are they consistent, or do they depend on some property of the input grid (e.g., dimensions, content)?
3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately describe the embedding rule, including how the offsets are determined.

**Gather Metrics and Analyze:**

Let's calculate the offsets for each example. I'll use python to help determine the offset by finding the first differing element between the top-left corner and the rest of the output grid.


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_offset(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    in_rows, in_cols = input_grid.shape
    out_rows, out_cols = output_grid.shape
    
    for row_offset in range(out_rows - in_rows + 1):
      for col_offset in range(out_cols - in_cols + 1):
        if np.array_equal(input_grid, output_grid[row_offset:row_offset + in_rows, col_offset:col_offset+in_cols]):
          return row_offset, col_offset

    return None  # Should not reach here if output contains the input
  

examples = [
    {
        "input": [[7, 1], [1, 7], [6, 5], [5, 6]],
        "output": [[7, 1, 9], [1, 7, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 6, 5], [9, 5, 6]],
    },
    {
        "input": [[4], [0]],
        "output": [[4, 9], [9, 9], [9, 0]],
    },
    {
        "input": [[2, 2, 2], [2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 2], [8, 7, 7], [8, 8, 7], [8, 7, 7]],
        "output": [[2, 2, 2, 9], [2, 8, 8, 9], [2, 2, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 8, 7, 7], [9, 8, 8, 7], [9, 8, 7, 7]],
    },
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    row_offset, col_offset = find_offset(example["input"], example["output"])
    print(f"Example {i+1}: row_offset={row_offset}, col_offset={col_offset}")

I made an error in the implementation of `find_offset`, it seems the input is *not* embedded in the output by simple offsets. It seems my assumption that the input grid can be found by slicing the output grid at some offset was incorrect.

Let's re-examine the examples, and determine what is actually happening.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input: `[[7, 1], [1, 7], [6, 5], [5, 6]]`
    *   Output: `[[7, 1, 9], [1, 7, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 6, 5], [9, 5, 6]]`
    *   Observation: The input grid's rows are interleaved with rows of 9s.
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input: `[[4], [0]]`
    *   Output: `[[4, 9], [9, 9], [9, 0]]`
    *   Observation: The input grid's rows are interleaved with rows of 9s.
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input: `[[2, 2, 2], [2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 2], [8, 7, 7], [8, 8, 7], [8, 7, 7]]`
    *   Output: `[[2, 2, 2, 9], [2, 8, 8, 9], [2, 2, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 8, 7, 7], [9, 8, 8, 7], [9, 8, 7, 7]]`
    *   Observation: The top part of input is placed, then a row of 9. Then bottom part of input starts with 9, and each row appended by 9.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task: interleave_and_prepend
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - cols: variable
      - values: integers 0-9
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - rows: derived from input_grid
      - cols: derived from input_grid
      - values: integers 0-9, predominantly 9 for padding
actions:
  - name: interleave_rows
    description: Insert rows of 9s between the rows of the input grid, the start and number are dependent of where to split the original grid.
  - name: append_columns
    description: Appends a 9 to each row. The first half has a 9 appended, then a line of 9s and for the bottom half a 9 is prepended and appended.
  - name: prepend_9s_row: Add a row of 9s

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Split and Interleave:** The input grid's is split in a top and bottom part. The rows are interleaved with rows of 9s, and for the bottom half, the row starts with a 9.
2.  **Append Column:** A column of 9s is appended to each row of the top half.
3.  **Prepend/Append to bottom half:** A 9 is prepended and appended to each row of the bottom half.

The program needs to determine:
1. Where to split the grid.
2. Determine how to interleave the input rows and newly created rows of 9s
