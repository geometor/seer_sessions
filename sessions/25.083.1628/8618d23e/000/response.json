It seems to incorporate the original input grid and introduces a new color (9, maroon) in a specific pattern.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves expanding the input grid and filling the new space with the maroon color (9), creating a border or frame-like structure. The original input seems to be embedded within this new, larger grid. The maroon color is present even in areas not directly adjacent to the embedded section.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The exact expansion logic needs more data to define but a rule is clearly in place and can be exactly defined.\n2.  **Embed:** Place the original `input_grid` into the `output_grid` at a certain offset.\n3.  **Fill with Maroon:** Fill the remaining cells of the `output_grid`, not occupied by the embedded `input_grid`, with the color maroon (9). Specifically, add a border of maroon (9) of a single row and/or column surrounding the embedded input. The added border is not consistent across all train pairs but a relationship/rule exists to clearly define it.\n\nEssentially, the input grid is being embedded within a larger grid, and the extra space is filled with a consistent maroon color to form a kind of frame. The positioning of the input within the larger output is consistent but needs to be pinpointed, as does the rule for border thickness.\n"
