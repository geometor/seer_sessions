Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another, usually smaller, 2D grid. The output grids seem to be a compressed or summarized version of the input grids.  A key observation is that the input grids often have repeating rows, and the output grid appears to be constructed by extracting unique or non-consecutive, repeating rows. The colors themselves don't seem to change; rather, it's the arrangement of rows that matters.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of integers.
      - columns: (derived from row length)
      - cells: individual integers within the grid, representing colors.

actions:
  - type: row_extraction
    description: Selects specific rows from the input grid.
    criteria:
      - uniqueness: Seems to select only one instance of rows that repeat consecutively.
  - type: compression/deduplication
    description: Removes repeating groups.

relationships:
  - input_grid: The original 2D grid of integers.
  - output_grid: The transformed 2D grid, typically smaller than the input.
  - row_to_row:  A relationship within input where we check for equality of rows in terms of consecutive sequence

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through the rows of the input grid.
2.  **Check for consecutive repeats:** If a row has same values as the immediate next row, ignore. Otherwise, extract the row, to construct the output list of rows.
3.  **Construct Output:** Construct the output grid from the extracted rows.

In essence, the transformation extracts non-consecutively repeating rows from the input grid to create the output grid.
