objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of integers.
      - columns: (derived from row length)
      - cells: individual integers within the grid, representing colors.

actions:
  - type: row_extraction
    description: Selects specific rows from the input grid.
    criteria:
      - uniqueness: Seems to select only one instance of rows that repeat consecutively.
  - type: compression/deduplication
    description: Removes repeating groups.

relationships:
  - input_grid: The original 2D grid of integers.
  - output_grid: The transformed 2D grid, typically smaller than the input.
  - row_to_row:  A relationship within input where we check for equality of rows in terms of consecutive sequence
