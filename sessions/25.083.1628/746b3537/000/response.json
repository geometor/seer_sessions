Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another, usually smaller, 2D grid. The output grids seem to be a compressed or summarized version of the input grids.  A key observation is that the input grids often have repeating rows, and the output grid appears to be constructed by extracting unique or non-consecutive, repeating rows. The colors themselves don't seem to change; rather, it's the arrangement of rows that matters.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
