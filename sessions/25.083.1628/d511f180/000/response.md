Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a specific type of replacement or swapping of values within the grid, maintaining the grid's dimensions. The positions and values of certain digits appear to be key to the transformation. Specifically, it looks like occurrences of a particular color (digit) in the input grid are replaced by another color (digit) in the output grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - height: variable
        - width: variable
      relations:
        - elements_represent: colors

transformations:
  - type: replacement
    description: Certain digits are replaced by other specific digits.
    details:
      - input_digit_1: 5
        output_digit_1: 8
      - input_digit_2: 8
        output_digit_2: 5
    constraints:
        - spatial_context: "Applies to all occurrences of the specified digits within the entire grid."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Digits:** Within the input grid, locate all occurrences of the digit '5'.
2.  **Replacement 1:** Replace all instances of the digit '5' with the digit '8'.
3. **Identify Target Digits:** Within the input grid, locate all occurrences of the digit '8'.
4. **Replacement 2:** Replace all instance of the digit '8' with the digit '5'.
5. **Output:** Maintain all other digits in their original positions, with the dimension of the grid unchanged. output the final grid

In essence, the transformation is a global swap of the digits '5' and '8' throughout the grid.
