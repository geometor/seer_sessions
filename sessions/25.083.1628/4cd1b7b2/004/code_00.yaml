observations:
  - object: column
    property: contains_zero
    transformation: conditional
    details: |
      If a column contains the value '0', it undergoes a transformation.
      If a column does not contain the value '0', it is not transformed.

  - object: zero_elements
    property: value
    transformation: replacement
    details: |
        Zero elements within a transformed column are replaced with values that
        are not present within original values in the same column.

  - object: non_zero_elements
    property: value
    transformation: cyclic_shift
    details: |
       Non-zero elements within the column are cyclically shifted. The exact amount of shift will need to be computed during the coding phase.
