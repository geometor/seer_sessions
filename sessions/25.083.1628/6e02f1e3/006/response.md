Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment**

The initial code correctly handles cases where the input grid is uniformly filled with either color 3 (green) or color 4 (yellow). However, it fails when the input grid contains a mix of colors, specifically in drawing the diagonal cross. The issue lies in how the cross is drawn, including cases that the result did not draw a cross, and also drew it on the wrong line. The cross should extend from corner to corner.

**Strategy**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the examples where the transformed output doesn't match the expected output (Examples 2, 4, and 5). Identify the *precise* differences. It looks like the diagonal application is not always working as expected.
2.  **Refine Logic:** Update the natural language program to accurately describe the conditions for drawing the diagonal cross and to correct the cross drawing to be more robust.
3. **Metrics Gathering**: Develop tool_code to compute metrics

**Metrics Gathering**

I will run some checks to see that the sizes, and shapes, etc are correct.


``` python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_array = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_array = np.array(transformed_output)

    metrics = {
        "input_shape": input_array.shape,
        "expected_shape": expected_array.shape,
        "transformed_shape": transformed_array.shape,
        "shapes_match": input_array.shape == expected_array.shape == transformed_array.shape,
        "pixels_off": np.sum(expected_array != transformed_array),
        "uniform_input": len(np.unique(input_array)) == 1,
        "uniform_input_value" : np.unique(input_array)[0] if len(np.unique(input_array)) == 1 else None
    }
    return metrics

# Example data (replace with your actual data)
examples = [
    {
        "input": [[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]],
        "expected": [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[3, 3, 3], [4, 2, 2], [4, 4, 2]],
        "expected": [[5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]],
        "expected": [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [3, 3, 3]],

    },
    {
        "input": [[2, 2, 2], [3, 2, 3], [3, 3, 3]],
        "expected": [[5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]],
        "transformed": [[5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    }
]

all_metrics = [calculate_metrics(ex["input"], ex["expected"], ex["transformed"]) for ex in examples]

for i, metrics in enumerate(all_metrics):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    for key, value in metrics.items():
        print(f"  {key}: {value}")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Check:** Examine the input grid.  If *all* pixels in the grid are the same color (either 3/green or 4/yellow), then create an output grid of the same size. Fill the first three pixels of the first row of the output grid with color 5 (gray).  All other pixels in the output grid should be color 0 (white).

2.  **Non-Uniform Input:** If the input grid contains pixels of different colors (not uniform), create an output grid of the same dimensions. Draw a diagonal cross using color 5 (gray) and fill the remaining pixels with color 0(white). The diagonal cross should start at the top-left corner (0,0) connecting with color 5(gray) to the bottom right, and top-right to bottom-left corner.
