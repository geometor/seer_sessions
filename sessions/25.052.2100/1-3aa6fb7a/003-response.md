Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and results to refine the natural language program and identify the errors in the previous code's logic.

Here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on a more precise description:

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. These are the objects of interest.

2.  **Object Classification:** Classify each azure object based on its shape:
    *   **2x1 Vertical Bar:** A rectangle with a height of 2 and a width of 1.
    *   **2x2 Square:** A square with a height and width of 2.

3.  **Transformation (Conditional Color Change):**  Apply the following rules based on object type:
    *   **2x1 Vertical Bar:** Change the color of the *bottom* pixel of the bar from azure (8) to blue (1).
    *    **2x2 Square:** Change the color of the *bottom-left* pixel of the square from azure (8) to blue (1).

**Analysis of Errors in Previous Code and Results:**

The previous code had a couple of critical flaws that led to incorrect transformations:

*   **Incorrect Row Check for 2x1 Bars:** The original code checked for `row == 5`. This is incorrect.  It should change the bottom pixel of the 2x1 bar, regardless of the bar's absolute position in the grid.  The condition should identify the bottom pixel *relative to the bar itself*, not to the entire grid.
*    **Incorrect application of pixel selection in the 2x1 case:** The second training case shows clearly that both azure pixels in the first vertical bar object should not be changed - this is the nature of the bug in the previous example. Only the *bottom* azure pixel in the 2x1 vertical bar should be changed.
* **Correct square transformation:** the square transformation worked fine.

The revised natural language program directly addresses these issues by focusing on relative positioning within the identified object, which is crucial for a generalizable solution.
