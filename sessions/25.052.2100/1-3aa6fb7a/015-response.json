Determine if the object lies to the left or the right of this middle column.\n\n4.  **Transform based on Object Type and Position:**\n    *   **2x1 Bar:**\n        *   If the bar is on the *left* side of the middle column, change the color of the *top* pixel of the bar to blue (color 1) in the output grid.\n        *   If the bar is on the *right* side of the middle column, change the color of the *bottom* pixel of the bar to blue (color 1) in the output grid.\n\n    *   **2x2 Square:** Change the color of the *top-left* pixel of the square to blue (color 1) in the output grid.\n\n5. **All other pixels are unchanged**\n\n**Observations about the Previous Code and its Errors:**\n\n*   The code generally implements object classification correctly, and correctly determines which side of the middle an object is on.\n*   The logic for selecting the top-left, top, or bottom pixel for modification *within* the `transform` is correct.\n* The code uses the correct color.\n* The provided code transforms the image, rather than replacing it, which is the behavior indicated in the task.\n\n"
