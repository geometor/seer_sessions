            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, their properties, and actions:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous azure (color 8) objects within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Classify Azure Objects:** Classify each azure object based on its shape:\n    *   \"2x1\\_bar\": A vertical bar two pixels high and one pixel wide.\n    *   \"2x2\\_square\": A square two pixels high and two pixels wide.\n    *    Ignore any other shapes\n\n3.  **Determine Grid Midpoint**: Calculate the horizontal midpoint of the grid (number of columns divided by 2).\n\n4.  **Conditional Coloring Based on Position and Shape:** For each identified azure object, perform the following actions:\n    *   **2x1\\_bar:**\n        *   If the bar is on the *left* side of the grid's midpoint, change the top pixel of the bar to blue (color 1).\n        *   If the bar is on the *right* side of the grid's midpoint, change the bottom pixel of the bar to blue (color 1).\n    *   **2x2\\_square:** Change the top-left pixel of the square to blue(color 1).\n\n5.  The final output grid contains only these new blue pixels, with the original azure objects and other grid elements remaining unchanged, except those altered in the previous step.\n\n**Summary of issues with the last code**\nThe previous code incorrectly applied the blue color:\n*  it replaced the top pixel of ALL 2x1 bars with blue if on left side\n* it replaced the top pixel of ALL 2x1 bars with blue if on right side\n* it replaced top-left pixel of ALL 2x2 squares.\n\nThe corrected logic should alter only a single pixel in each azure shape according the shape and position.\n"
