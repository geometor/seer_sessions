Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and initial thoughts:



```yaml
facts:
  - grid_size: 7x7 # Both input and output grids are 7x7.
  - colors: [0, 8] # Input grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 8 (azure).
  - color_change: # Output grid introduces color 1 (blue).
    - from: 8 # An 8 (azure) pixel changes to 1 (blue).
    - location: "center of object" # needs refinement
  - object_shapes:
      - shape_1: "Two separate 2x1 azure (8) vertical bars"
      - shape_2: "A single 2x2 azure (8) square"
```



**Natural Language Program (Draft 1):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. These form distinct objects.
2.  **Object Properties:** For each object, determine if it's a 2x1 vertical bar or 2x2 square.
3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   For the 2x1 vertical bars: If the pixel in a vertical azure bar is in row 2, leave it unchanged. If it's in row 5 change color from azure (8) to blue (1).
    *   For the 2x2 square: If the pixel in a 2x2 square is in the lower left corner of the square, change to blue (1). If it's the upper right corner leave unchanged.

**Elaboration and Refinement of observations:**

The key seems to be identifying the separate azure objects and then performing a color change based on the object type, specifically looking at row 2 of first azure bar, row 5 of second azure bar, and lower-left corner of azure square.

**Next Steps:**
I think this description is reasonable, I will stop here and wait for you before attempting to turn this into python code.
