Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the errors in the previous code's output to refine our understanding of the transformation.

**Analysis of Errors and Refinement of Transformation Rule:**

The previous code had a couple of key issues based on the provided expected outputs:

1.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection in 2x1 Bars:** The original code intended to change the *bottom* pixel of the 2x1 azure bars to blue. However, the code implemented had the vertical transformation wrong and had inconsistent results.. Looking at the expected outputs, it's clear the **top** pixel of the vertical bar needs to change.

2.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection in 2x2 Squares:** The intention was to change the *bottom-left* pixel of the 2x2 squares. The code had the coordinate logic wrong and should have been the `max_row`.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, incorporating the corrections:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.  These form distinct objects.

2.  **Classify Objects:** For each identified object, determine its shape:
    *   If the object is a 2x1 vertical bar (2 pixels high, 1 pixel wide), it's classified as a "2x1\_bar".
    *   If the object is a 2x2 square (2 pixels high, 2 pixels wide), it's classified as a "2x2\_square".
    *   Other shapes are ignored.

3.  **Apply Transformations:**
    *   **2x1\_bar:** Change the color of the *top* pixel of the bar from azure (8) to blue (1).
    *   **2x2\_square:** Change the color of the *bottom-left* pixel of the square from azure (8) to blue (1).

**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**

*   **Top vs. Bottom:**  The most critical correction is changing the "bottom" pixel to the "top" pixel for the 2x1 bars.
*    **Object Classification:** The code now explicitly checks for both 2x1 bars and 2x2 squares composed by contiguous azure pixels.
*   **Ignoring Other Shapes:** The natural language description now clarifies that objects that are not 2x1 bars or 2x2 squares are not transformed.
