Okay, let's re-examine the transformation, paying very close attention to *exactly* which pixel changes in each azure object.

Here's a revised natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. These form distinct objects.

2.  **Object Properties:** For each object, determine if it's a 2x1 vertical bar or a 2x2 square.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   **2x1 Vertical Bar:**
        *   If the bar is in the **left half** of the grid (columns 0 to floor(width/2) -1 ): Change the color of the *top* pixel of the bar from azure (8) to blue (1).
        *   If the bar is in the **right half** of the grid (columns floor(width/2) to width-1): Change the color of the *bottom* pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).

    *   **2x2 Square:** Change the color of the *top-left* pixel of the square from azure (8) to blue (1).

Key Changes and Reasoning:

*   **Left/Right Division for 2x1 Bars:** The previous description was incorrect about *always* changing the bottom pixel of 2x1 bars. Careful observation of Example 2 shows that the 2x1 bar on the *left* side has its *top* pixel changed. The 2x1 bar on the right hand side has the *bottom* changed. Example 1 had a bug where a right hand bar was not correctly transformed, that will now be resolved with the new division logic. This introduces a concept of spatial relationship (left/right) relative to the entire grid.
*   **2x2 Square Consistency:**  The top-left pixel rule for 2x2 squares remains correct.

The core issue was an incomplete understanding of the 2x1 bar transformation rule, failing to account for the grid's spatial context. The revised description addresses this by splitting the rule based on horizontal position.
