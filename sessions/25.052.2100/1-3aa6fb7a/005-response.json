            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the errors in the previous code's output to refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**Analysis of Errors and Refinement of Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe previous code had a couple of key issues based on the provided expected outputs:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection in 2x1 Bars:** The original code intended to change the *bottom* pixel of the 2x1 azure bars to blue. However, the code implemented had the vertical transformation wrong and had inconsistent results.. Looking at the expected outputs, it's clear the **top** pixel of the vertical bar needs to change.\n\n2.  **Incorrect Pixel Selection in 2x2 Squares:** The intention was to change the *bottom-left* pixel of the 2x2 squares. The code had the coordinate logic wrong and should have been the `max_row`.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation, incorporating the corrections:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.  These form distinct objects.\n\n2.  **Classify Objects:** For each identified object, determine its shape:\n    *   If the object is a 2x1 vertical bar (2 pixels high, 1 pixel wide), it's classified as a \"2x1\\_bar\".\n    *   If the object is a 2x2 square (2 pixels high, 2 pixels wide), it's classified as a \"2x2\\_square\".\n    *   Other shapes are ignored.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations:**\n    *   **2x1\\_bar:** Change the color of the *top* pixel of the bar from azure (8) to blue (1).\n    *   **2x2\\_square:** Change the color of the *bottom-left* pixel of the square from azure (8) to blue (1).\n\n**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**\n\n*   **Top vs. Bottom:**  The most critical correction is changing the \"bottom\" pixel to the \"top\" pixel for the 2x1 bars.\n*    **Object Classification:** The code now explicitly checks for both 2x1 bars and 2x2 squares composed by contiguous azure pixels.\n*   **Ignoring Other Shapes:** The natural language description now clarifies that objects that are not 2x1 bars or 2x2 squares are not transformed.\n"
