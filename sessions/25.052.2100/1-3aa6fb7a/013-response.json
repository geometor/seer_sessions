            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, their properties, and the actions:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains azure (color value 8) objects.  These objects can be one of two shapes:\n    *   A 2x1 vertical bar (2 pixels high, 1 pixel wide).\n    *   A 2x2 square (2 pixels high, 2 pixels wide).\n\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** The grid is conceptually divided into two halves, left and right, based on the horizontal center.  The middle column is considered part of the left half.\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation (2x1 Vertical Bars):** For each 2x1 vertical bar:\n    *   Determine if the bar is in the left half (including the middle column) or the right half of the grid.\n    *   If the bar is in the left half, change the *top* pixel of the bar to blue (color value 1).\n    *   If the bar is in the right half, change the *bottom* pixel of the bar to blue (color value 1).\n\n4.  **Conditional Transformation (2x2 Squares):** For each 2x2 square:\n    *   Change the *top-left* pixel of the square to blue (color value 1).\n\n5. **All other pixels are unchanged**\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies specific azure shapes and modifies them based on their shape and, in the case of vertical bars, their horizontal position relative to the grid's center. The modification always involves changing a specific pixel within the identified shape to blue.\n"
