These form distinct objects.\n2.  **Object Properties:** For each object, determine if it's a 2x1 vertical bar or 2x2 square.\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   For the 2x1 vertical bars: If the pixel in a vertical azure bar is in row 2, leave it unchanged. If it's in row 5 change color from azure (8) to blue (1).\n    *   For the 2x2 square: If the pixel in a 2x2 square is in the lower left corner of the square, change to blue (1). If it's the upper right corner leave unchanged.\n\n**Elaboration and Refinement of observations:**\n\nThe key seems to be identifying the separate azure objects and then performing a color change based on the object type, specifically looking at row 2 of first azure bar, row 5 of second azure bar, and lower-left corner of azure square.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nI think this description is reasonable, I will stop here and wait for you before attempting to turn this into python code.\n"
