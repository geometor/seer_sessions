Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Contains a single red (2) pixel near the center-top.
    *   Contains a single blue (1) pixel near the center-bottom.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The red (2) pixel remains in the same position.
    *   The blue (1) pixel remains in the same position.
    *    Two yellow (4) pixels appear, one to the left and to the right of the red one, like one row above and one row below.
    *   Three orange(7) pixels appear around the blue pixel, specifically to the left, right and above of it.
    *    The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single red (2) pixel and the single blue (1) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Positions:** Keep the red (2) and blue (1) pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  **Add Yellow Pixels:** For the red (2) pixel:
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one row *above* and one column to the *left*.
    *   Place another yellow (4) pixel one row *above* and one column to the *right*.
    *    Place a yellow (4) pixel one row *below* and one column to the *left*.
    *   Place another yellow (4) pixel one row *below* and one column to the *right*.
4.  **Add Orange Pixels:** For the blue (1) pixel:
    *    Place an orange (7) pixel one column to the *left*.
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one column to the *right*.
    *    Place an orange (7) pixel one row *above*.
5. **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (0).

**Summary of actions**

The transformation preserves the positions of the existing red and blue pixels and introduces new yellow pixels around the red one and orange pixels around the blue pixel based on their positions. The remaining pixels keep being white.

Okay, let's analyze the second example transformation.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Contains two red (2) pixels, one near the center-top-right and another on the bottom-left.
    *   Contains two blue (1) pixels, one near the top-left and another one near the center-bottom-right.
    *    Contains one azure (8) pixel, in the top-center.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The red (2) and blue (1) and azure (8) pixels remain in the same positions.
    *   Yellow (4) pixels appear to the left and right of *both* red pixels, one row above, and one row below.
    *   Orange (7) pixels appear to the left, right, and above *both* blue pixels.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all red (2), blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Positions:** Keep the red (2), blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  **Add Yellow Pixels:** For *each* red (2) pixel:
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one row *above* and one column to the *left*.
    *   Place another yellow (4) pixel one row *above* and one column to the *right*.
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one row *below* and one column to the *left*.
    *   Place another yellow (4) pixel one row *below* and one column to the *right*.
4.  **Add Orange Pixels:** For *each* blue (1) pixel:
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one column to the *left*.
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one column to the *right*.
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one row *above*.
5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (0).

**Summary of actions**

The transformation preserves the positions of the existing red, blue and azure pixels and introduces new yellow pixels around each of the red pixels and orange pixels around each of the blue pixels based on their relative positions. It generalizes the rule from the first example to multiple instances of red and blue pixels. The rest of the pixels stay white.

The provided python program is able to solve this.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
