Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (0,4), (0,5) & (1,5)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (180 degrees)
        position: (2,2), (3,2) & (3,3)
    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (straight)
        position: (6,3), (6,4) & (5,4)
  output_grid:
     - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (0,4), (0,5) & (1,5)
     - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (180 degrees)
        position: (2,2), (3,2) & (3,3)
     - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (straight)
        position: (6,3), (6,4) & (5,4)
     - object_4:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1, 4)
     - object_5:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (2, 3)
     - object_6:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (5, 3)
```

**Natural Language Description:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** All three azure L-shaped objects from input grid are present in the output grid, in exactly in the same absolute positions.

3.  **New object detection**: Three new single-cell blue pixels were added, one between the two cells of each of the azure L-shapes.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to keep the position and shape of L-shapes azure objects, and to add one blue cell to fill their inner empty corner.

The natural language program, and therefore the python code, is exactly the same as the first example.
