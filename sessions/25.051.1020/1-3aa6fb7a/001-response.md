Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (3,4), (3,5) & (4,5)
  output_grid:
      - object_1:
          color: 8 (azure)
          shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
          position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
      - object_2:
           color: 8 (azure)
           shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
           position: (3,4), (3,5) & (4,5)
      - object_3:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1, 2)
      - object_4:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (4, 4)
```

**Natural Language Description:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** Both azure L-shaped objects from input grid are present in the output grid, in exactly in the same absolute positions.

3. **New object detection**: Two new single-cell blue pixels were added, one between the two cells of the vertical part of the first azure L-shape, and other between the horizontal part of the second azure L-shape

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to keep the position and shape of L-shapes azure objects, and to add one blue cell to fill their inner empty corner.
