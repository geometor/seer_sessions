The non-blue objects move/are reordered in some way. It is not a simple rotation or reflection.\n\n3. **Find The Rule:** Let's analyze coordinates changes:\n    *   Yellow (4) at (0, 1) moves to (2, 1).\n    *   Maroon (9) at (0, 3) moves to (3, 3).\n    *   Magenta (6) at (2, 2) moves to (3, 2).\n    *   Blue (1) at (3, 0) stays at (3, 0).\n\n4.  **Describe the rule:** The objects are moved to the bottom row of the grid, maintaining the column, unless the bottom row already has a colored cell.\n\n5. **Refine rule description**: The object are moved as follows: If the bottom row, same column, is empty, move the object there. If not, try the row above, and so on.\n\n**Final refined natural language program description:**\n\n1. Consider the objects that are not color 0 (the background).\n2. Maintain the position of all objects in the bottom row.\n3. For any object not in the bottom row:\n  - Consider its current column.\n  - Move object the lowest available cell in its same column.\n"
