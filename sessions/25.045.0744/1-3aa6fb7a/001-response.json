The topmost cell is defined as the cell with the smallest row index, and in case of a tie, the smallest column index. Order the blocks based on the row index of their topmost cells, and then by the column index in case of a row index tie.\n3. **Transform First Block:** For the first block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this topmost cell to color 1.\n4. **Transform Second Block:** For the second block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately below this topmost cell to color 1.\n5. **No Further Transformation:**  If there are more than two blocks, no further transformations are applied to them.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: \"ARC grid puzzle transformation\"\ntransformation_rule: \"For the first connected component of color 8 (ordered by topmost cell position), change the cell to the right of its topmost cell to color 1.
