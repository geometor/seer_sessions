**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected regions of color 8 in the input grid. We will call these regions "blocks".
2. **Order Blocks:** Determine the topmost cell for each block. The topmost cell is defined as the cell with the smallest row index, and in case of a tie, the smallest column index. Order the blocks based on the row index of their topmost cells, and then by the column index in case of a row index tie.
3. **Transform First Block:** For the first block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately below this topmost cell to color 1.
4. **Transform Second Block:** For the second block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this topmost cell to color 1.
5. **Transform Third Block:** For the third block in the ordered list, locate its topmost cell. Change the color of the cell immediately to the left of this topmost cell to color 1.
6. **No Further Transformation:** If there are more than three blocks, no further transformations are applied to them.

**YAML Block:**
