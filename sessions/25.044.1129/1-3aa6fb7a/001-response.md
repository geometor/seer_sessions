Okay, here's a natural language description of the transformation observed between the input and output grids:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all occurrences of the digit '8' in the input grid.

2.  **Check for Diagonal Neighbors:** For each '8', examine its diagonally adjacent cells (up-right, down-right).

3.  **Transformation Rule, place a '1':** If an '8' has the up-right and down-right diagonal neighbor, replace up-right cell to digit '1'.
**In more concise terms:**

The transformation identifies '8's in the input. Then, in the output change the up-right digits '1', if that '8' have up-right and down-right diagonal neighbor.
