## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D4E25D0>

**output:**
```
4 0 0
4 2 0
4 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D6B5E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 3x3.  The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grid has three distinct colors (represented by 0, 2, and 4), while the output has the same colors. The primary change seems to be a replication or extension of certain colored pixels downwards.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: yellow_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: yellow  # Value 4
    initial_position: (0, 0) # (row, col)
    properties:
      - replicated: true

  - id: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: red  # Value 2
    initial_position: (1, 1)
    properties:
      - replicated: true

  - id: white_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: white # Value 0
    initial_position: various
    properties:
      - replicated: false

actions:
  - type: replication
    subject: yellow_pixel
    direction: down
    amount: 2

  - type: replication
    subject: red_pixel
    direction: down
    amount: 1

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Yellow and Red pixels are not initially adjacent.
    
  - type: fills_column
    description: yellow fills first column, red is in second and partially fills.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the yellow pixel (value 4) in the top-left corner (0,0) and the red pixel (value 2) in the center (1,1).

2.  **Replicate Yellow Downward:** Replicate the yellow pixel downwards, filling the entire first column with yellow pixels.

3.  **Replicate Red Downward:** Replicate the red pixel downwards, so the second column will contain the original red pixel and below that a new one.

4. **Leave White Pixels:** The white (value 0) pixels are all unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
