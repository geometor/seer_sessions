## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D4E25D0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A6295F5D450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input grid transforms into the output grid, with some changes in the pixel colors and their positions, potentially guided by copy operations. It will be important to describe those copy operations with reference to source and destination, and their original values.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
  - type: object
    description: Pixels with values 0-9, representing colors.
  - observation:
    description: The central pixel in the input (value 0) is replaced in the output.
  - observation:
    description: The non-zero pixels in the input appear to influence their neighbors or get copied in the output.
    details: specifically, the central white pixel in the input is overwritten in the output by copying the red pixel above it.
  - observation:
    description: "the second row in the input becomes replicated as the third row in the output"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.

2.  **Copy to Center and replicate:**
    - the red 2 in position [0,1] (row, col) is copied to [1,1]
    - the second row is copied to the third row

Here's the breakdown, and as you can see, I'm focused on making observations of the *context* of this example input-output pair that will be valuable to use later to create the code.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
