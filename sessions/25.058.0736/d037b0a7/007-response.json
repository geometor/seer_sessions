The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input grid transforms into the output grid, with some changes in the pixel colors and their positions, potentially guided by copy operations. It will be important to describe those copy operations with reference to source and destination, and their original values.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
