Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** the color of the pixel at the center-right position `[height // 2, width - 1]` of the input grid.
2.  **Compare** the input grid's center-right pixel's color with its bottom-right pixel's `[height-1, width-1]` color.
3.  **Conditional Change:** If the input colors are the same, then the output grid equals the input grid.
4. **Update**: If different, set the color of the output grid's bottom-right pixel to the color of the input's center-right.
5.  **Iterate**: If the colors were different, set the color of the output grid pixel immediately above the bottom-right to the input's center-right color, and so on, until the center-right output grid pixel is set.
6. **All Other Pixels:** Keep the color values of all other pixels the same as the input grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
