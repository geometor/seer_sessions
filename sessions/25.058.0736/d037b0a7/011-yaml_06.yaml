facts:
  - example: 1
    input_object: "Single red pixel at row 1, column 1 (0-indexed)."
    action: "Replicate the red pixel once directly below its original position."
    output_object: "Two red pixels, one at (1,1) and one at (2,1)."
    notes: "The input grid boundaries are maintained"
  - example: 2
    input_object: "A horizontal line of two green pixels at row 1, columns 1 and 2."
    action: "Replicate the green line once directly below its original position."
    output_object: "Two green lines, one at row 1, and other at row 2"
    notes: "The input grid boundaries are maintained"
  - example: 3
    input_object: "A 2x2 yellow square starting at row 1, column 1."
    action: "Replicate the 2x2 yellow square once directly below its original position."
    output_object: "Two 2x2 yellow squares, one stacked on top of other."
    notes: "The replication causes vertical extension of the grid by the height of the square"
