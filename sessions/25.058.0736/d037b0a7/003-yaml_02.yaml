observations:
  - example_1:
      input: "No change between input and output."
      output: "No change."
      predicted: "Correct."
  - example_2:
      input: "A '1' in the bottom right is changed to an '8'; the top right is an 8"
      output: "Bottom right corner and adjacent pixels become '8'."
      predicted: "Correct."
  - example_3:
      input: "A '0' in the bottom right is changed to a '7'; the middle right is 7"
      output: "Bottom right corner becomes '7'."
      predicted: "Incorrect. Changed too many pixels, and used the wrong color."
  - example_4:
      input: "No change between input and output."
      output: "No change."
      predicted: "Incorrect. Changed pixels when it shouldn't have."
  - example_5:
      input:  "A '7' and '9' in bottom right becomes '4'; middle right is a 4"
      output: "Pixels on the right edge, from the center down, take the color of what used to be the center-right pixel"
      predicted: "Partially correct. Propagated to an extra pixel."
overall_rule: "The bottom-right pixel's color in the output grid is determined by the input's center-right pixel color. If the center-right and bottom-right pixel colors are the same, there is no change"
