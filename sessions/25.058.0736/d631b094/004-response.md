```python
"""
The transformation rule appears to be based on counting the number of pixels of a specific color in the input grid and creating an output grid of 1xN size, where N is the count, filled with that same color. The specific color to count and use is determined by the color present in the output grid of the training examples.

1. **Determine the target color:**  From the training examples, extract the color present in the *output* grid.  Since all training outputs have only one color, we can take any non-zero pixel.
2. **Count target color pixels in input:** Count the number of pixels in the *input* grid that match the target color.
3. **Create output grid:** Create a 1xN output grid, where N is the count from step 2.
4. **Fill output grid:** Fill the output grid with the target color.
