Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all pixels with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of identified blue pixels.
3. **Create** the output based on the count. Create a 1xN grid, where N is the number of the blue pixels.
4.  **Fill** all cells of the output grid with the value '1' (blue).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Find all pixels with value '1' (blue)
    blue_pixels = np.where(input_grid == 1)

    # Count the number of blue pixels
    num_blue_pixels = len(blue_pixels[0])

    # Create an output grid of size 1xN, where N is the number of blue pixels
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, num_blue_pixels), dtype=int)

    # Fill all cells of the output grid with '1' (blue)
    output_grid[:] = 1

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved counting blue pixels and creating a 1xN blue grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. Some examples involve different colors and output grid shapes. Therefore, the strategy needs to shift from a fixed color and shape rule to a more adaptive one, likely based on identifying a pattern or relationship between the input and output grids that is consistent across *all* examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a clearer picture, let's use code to analyze each example pair. I'll focus on:

*   Input and Output grid shapes
*   Pixel counts for each color in both input and output
*   Any immediately obvious relationships (e.g., mirroring, rotation) that are consistent.

```tool_code
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape

    input_color_counts = Counter(input_grid.flatten())
    output_color_counts = Counter(output_grid.flatten())
    
    print(f"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"Input color counts: {input_color_counts}")
    print(f"Output color counts: {output_color_counts}")
    print("---")
    
examples = task_data["train"]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
  print(f"Example {i+1}:")
  analyze_example(np.array(example["input"]), np.array(example["output"]))
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
