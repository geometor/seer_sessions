## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627DB27930>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7A627DB27B10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The output grid contains only '1' (blue) pixels. The transformation seems to involve extracting the '1' pixels from the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: [0, 1]
    name: input_grid
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 2]
    elements: [1]
    name: output_grid
  - type: pixel
    value: 0
    color: white
  - type: pixel
    value: 1
    color: blue

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extracting blue pixels from the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: contains
    description: input_grid contains white and blue pixels.
  - type: contains
    description: output_grid contains only blue pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: The input_grid is transformed into the output_grid by extracting the blue pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of identified blue pixels.
3. **Create** the output based on the count. Create a 1xN grid, where N is the number of the blue pixels.
4.  **Fill** all cells of the output grid with the value '1' (blue).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
