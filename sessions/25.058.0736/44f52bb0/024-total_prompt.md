## Example 6

**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D5572F0>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7A627D557F70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values (0 and 2). The output is a single numerical value (7). The image representation shows the grid with colors corresponding to the numbers (0 is white, 2 is red). The output image is a single orange square with the number 7. The transformation seems to involve converting all non-zero pixels to a single number with a new color (orange, which represents value 7).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: 3x3 grid
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - type: output
    description: single value
    elements:
      - value: 7
        color: orange
  - observation: |
    The input grid contains multiple pixels. Non-zero pixels in the
    input grid have a color of red (value = 2). All pixels in the grid are set to 7
    in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The program takes a grid as input.
2.  Change all pixels of input to orange(7).
3. Output is a single orange cell of value 7.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
