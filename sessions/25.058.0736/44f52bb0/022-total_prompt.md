## Example 5

**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D5572F0>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7A627D557F70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, where each number corresponds to a color. The output is a single number, also corresponding to a color (based on the image rendering of it). The colors in the input grid are red (2) and white (0). The output color is orange (7).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
        positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2]]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]
  - type: scalar
    description: output value
    value: 7
    color: orange
  - observation: count of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid
    value: 4

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Count the number of non-white (value not equal to 0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Multiply that amount by a factor and/or adjust the value with addition or subtraction to obtain value `x`.
3. The output should be x, in this case 4 converts to 7.

Based on the very simple example, the relationship is not exactly clear, only that the input is likely the result of a count, and the transformation is likely addition or multiplication, or a combination.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
