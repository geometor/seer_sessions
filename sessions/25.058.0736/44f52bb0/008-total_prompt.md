## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D6B5B30>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7A627D6B5BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing numerical values (0 and 2). In visual terms, it's a grid with white and red pixels.
*   **Output:** A single numerical value (7). The visual representation shows a solid orange square with the number 7 inside.
*   The input represents a 2D array/grid.
*	The output represents a single number that probably is produced by applying a function over the input 2D array/grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: A 3x3 grid (2D array)
    values: [0, 2]  # white, red
    shape: 3x3
  - type: output
    description: A single numerical value.
    value: 7
    color: orange
  - observation: input_red_count
    description: red appears 3 times
    value: 3
  - relationship: object_count_to_output
    subject: red_pixels in input
    relation: multiplied by something
    result: output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Calculate Output:** Do some calculations to produce the final single number output. In this case, the input seems to have three `2`s, which somehow related to the output `7`.

The relationship between input and output may be like this: output = (number of 2s) \* 2 + 1 = 3 \* 2 + 1 = 7

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
