The output is a 1x1 grid containing a single numerical value (1, representing blue). The transformation seems to involve a significant reduction in dimensionality and a change in color. The core operation appears to be counting or consolidating information from the input grid to produce a single output value and color. It looks like the output represent some property of the objects in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
