## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 0 2
2 0 2
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D6B5BD0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7A627D6B5950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors (2 for red and 0 for white).  The output is a 1x1 grid containing a single numerical value (1, representing blue). The transformation seems to involve a significant reduction in dimensionality and a change in color. The core operation appears to be counting or consolidating information from the input grid to produce a single output value and color. It looks like the output represent some property of the objects in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    values: [0, 2]  # white, red
  - observation: Output is a 1x1 grid.
    type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 1]
    values: [1]  # blue
  - observation: Red objects surround a white object in the input.
    type: spatial_relationship
    objects: [red, white]
  - action: The input grid is reduced to a single value.
    type: dimensionality_reduction
  - action: The input grid colors are counted or otherwise consolidated.
    type: color_consolidation
  - observation: The output color is blue (1).
    type: color change
  - relationship: number_of_red_pixels / 2 = output
    type: formula

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the red pixels:** Iterate through the input grid and count the number of pixels with the value 2 (red).
2.  **Divide by two**: take the integer part of the number of red pixels divided by two.
3. **Create output**: construct a 1x1 grid with a cell with the final computed value.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
