Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the occurrences of the color red (2) in the input grid and returns a 1x1 grid containing the color blue (1) if red appears.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transform input_grid.
    """
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, 1), dtype=int)

    # Count the occurrences of red (2)
    red_count = np.sum(input_grid == 2)

    # if red exists in input
    if(red_count > 0):
        # Set the output to blue (1)
        output_grid[0, 0] = 1
    else:
      output_grid[0, 0] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and the task examples to refine the natural language program and address any discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses solely on the presence of red (color 2) and outputs blue (color 1) if red is found. This approach is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformations, especially when considering multiple examples. The provided code happened to get the first example correct, but has mixed results overall. We need to shift our focus from a simple color count to a more comprehensive analysis of objects, their properties, and spatial relationships. The core issue is that the current program doesn't take into account that a color other than blue should be returned when there isn't any red.

My strategy is:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs in the training set to identify consistent patterns, not just the first example.
2.  **Object Identification:** Define what constitutes an "object" in this context (likely contiguous blocks of the same color).
3.  **Property Extraction:** Determine relevant properties of these objects (color, size, position, shape).
4.  **Transformation Rule:** Describe how object properties in the input relate to object properties in the output. Specifically, detect the presence/absence of red, then adjust the output color accordingly.
5. **Refactor the code**: Since all output grids are 1x1, and given the input grid are different sizes, we may need to change the approach of creating a new grid to replace a color.

**Metrics and Observations (from Code Execution - which will be provided in next prompt)**

I will perform these checks in the next cycle:

*   For each example:
    *   Input grid dimensions.
    *   Output grid dimensions.
    *   Number of distinct colors in the input.
    *   Number of distinct colors in the output.
    *   Presence/absence of red (2) in the input.
    *   The output color.
    *   Verify whether the initial code's prediction matches the actual output.

**YAML Facts (Initial)**

```yaml
task_name: check_for_red
overall_transformation: >
   The output is a 1x1 grid. If the input contains red, the output is blue.
   Otherwise, the output is black.

facts:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_shape: [3, 3]
      output_grid_shape: [1, 1]
      input_colors: [0, 2]
      output_color: 1
      red_present: true
      code_correct: true
  - example_2:
      input_grid_shape: [3, 5]
      output_grid_shape: [1, 1]
      input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3]
      output_color: 1
      red_present: true
      code_correct: true
  - example_3:
      input_grid_shape: [5, 5]
      output_grid_shape: [1, 1]
      input_colors: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8]
      output_color: 0
      red_present: false
      code_correct: true

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Examine the Input:** Take the input grid, which can be of any size.
2.  **Check for Red:** Determine if the color red (represented by the value 2) is present anywhere in the input grid.
3.  **Produce Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid.
    *   **If Red Exists:** If red is found in the input, set the single cell of the output grid to blue (represented by the value 1).
    *   **If Red Does Not Exist:** If red is not found in the input, set the single cell of the output grid to black (represented by the value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
