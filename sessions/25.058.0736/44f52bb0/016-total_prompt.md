## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D5574D0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7A627D5572F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The output is a single numerical value within a 1x1 grid. It appears the task involves reducing the input grid to a single value based on the colors/numbers present. In this specific case, the input grid contains the number '2' (red) twice, and the output is '1' (blue).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        count: 7
      - value: 2
        color: red
        count: 2
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
        count: 1
  - observation: two_red_pixels
    description: "The input grid contains two instances of the value 2 (red)."
  - observation: output_is_one
      description: "The output is value 1."
  - relation:
    description: possible relationship is that the input grid had two color '2' values which could be associated with the output value of 1.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the occurrences:** Count the number of times the value '2' (red) appears in the input grid.
2. **Produce the result**: If there are two elements in the grid with value '2', create a single output cell containing the value '1' (blue)


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
