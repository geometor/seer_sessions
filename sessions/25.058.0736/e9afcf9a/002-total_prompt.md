## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7A627DB27930>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7A627D5576B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both grids of numbers. The numbers represent colors (3 for green and 9 for maroon). The input grid consists of two horizontal rows of solid colors. The output grid has the same dimensions but has an alternating pattern of the two colors in both rows and columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 2
      columns: 6
      colors: [3, 9]  # Green and Maroon
    input_state:
      - row_1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
      - row_2: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
    output_state:
      - row_1: [3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9]
      - row_2: [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3]
actions:
  - type: alternate_colors
    description:  Colors in each row and column are alternated.
relationships:
  - type: size_preserved
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - type: colors_preserved
    description: The set of colors used in input and output is the same.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to create a checkerboard-like pattern. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid (2x6).  The colors, green (3) and maroon (9) from the input, alternate in the output grid. The top-left cell of the output grid has the same color as the top-left cell of the input grid (green/3).  Within each row, adjacent cells have different colors. Within each column, adjacent cells have different colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
