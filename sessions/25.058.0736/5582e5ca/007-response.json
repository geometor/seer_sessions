Each pixel has a numerical value (0-9) corresponding to a specific color. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with the color corresponding to the number 9 (maroon). The overall size and shape of the grid remain constant during the transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The output grid will use all nines in the same shape as the input\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is to replace all pixels in the input grid with the color maroon (value 9), regardless of their original color. The most frequent number could also be a source for the answer\n"
