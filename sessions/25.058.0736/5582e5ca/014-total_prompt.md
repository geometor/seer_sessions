## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D8D2CB0>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D557570>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (magenta, represented by the digit 6). The key seems to be identifying a specific color within the input grid that dictates the color of the entire output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input and output are 3x3 grids
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9

  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    elements: [4, 6, 9, 6, 4, 1, 8, 8, 6]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    elements: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

  - relationship: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: "all pixels in output_grid have the value 6 (magenta), which appeared in multiple locations of input"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the most frequent color:** Examine the input grid and determine the color that appears most often. In case of a tie that includes the color at the top and middle element, it looks like the top/middle value wins.
2.  **Flood Fill:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3). Fill every pixel of the output grid with the color identified. In this case, we used to color magenta, represented by the digit '6'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
