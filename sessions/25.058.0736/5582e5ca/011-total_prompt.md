Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to replace all pixels in the input grid with a specific color, determined by the initial color of the input grid:
- If the input grid consists entirely of blue (1) pixels, the output is all maroon (9).
- If the input grid consists entirely of gray (5) pixels, the output is all black (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):

    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
    - If all input pixels are blue (1), output is all maroon (9).
    - If all input pixels are gray (5), output is all black (0).

    Args:
        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The transformed grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
