Previous Code:
```python
"""
Checks if the input grid contains the color yellow (4). If it does, the output grid is filled entirely with yellow (4).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the presence of yellow (4).

    Args:
        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 2D numpy array of the same dimensions as the input_grid, filled with 4 if yellow is present in the input,
        otherwise potentially unchanged (though the current logic always fills with 4).
    """
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as input_grid.
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, 4)

    # Check for the presence of yellow (4) anywhere in the input grid.
    if np.any(input_grid == 4):
        # If yellow is found, the output grid is already initialized to 4.
        return output_grid
    else:
        # If no yellow, return a grid of 4. The prompt only has cases with Yellow.
        return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
