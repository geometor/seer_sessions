The transformation doesn't seem to involve simply recoloring pixels based on their initial color.  Instead, the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the colors seem crucial.  The input and output grids are 3x3. The colors in the input grid are re-arranged in the output grid. There appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation and a reflection.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
