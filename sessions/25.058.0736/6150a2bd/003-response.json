            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire input grid. This worked for the initial example, likely because it involved a simple rotation. However, by testing other training examples, we must gather more data on how well this works. It is likely that the solution is simple and the initial description, while not wrong, only explains the first training example.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Execute and Evaluate:** We must analyze the results of the test.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the execution results, update the YAML document listing facts, objects, properties and actions\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to correctly explain the input to output transformation in all training examples.\n\n**Example Metrics and Results:**\n\nSince the actual training sets and results are not available in text form, I must assume there are none to report on.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts, Objects, Properties, Actions):**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - The input and output are grids.\n  - The grids have dimensions 3x3\n  - Grid cells contain integer values representing colors.\n  - The transformation involves a change in the arrangement of grid cells.\n\nobjects:\n  - input_grid:\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: 3x3\n        - type: 2D array\n        - cell_values: integers (0-9)\n\n  - output_grid:\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: 3x3\n        - type: 2D array\n        - cell_values: integers (0-9)\n      \nactions:\n  - name: rotate_90_clockwise\n    description: The entire input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    agent: input_grid\n    result: output_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input is a 3x3 grid of numbers. The output is the same grid, rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The values in each cell of the grid represent colors, but the transformation only affects the position of the cells, not their values.\n"
