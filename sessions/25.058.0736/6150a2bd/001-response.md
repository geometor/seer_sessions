Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation between the input and output appears to be a rotation of the grid. The colors/numbers themselves don't change; their positions within the grid do. It seems like a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_codes
  - operation: rotation
    type: clockwise
    degrees: 90
  - relation: input_grid -> rotated -> output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid of numbers.
2.  Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  The resulting rotated grid is the output.
