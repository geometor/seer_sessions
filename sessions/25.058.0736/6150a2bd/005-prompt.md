Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a 3x3 grid of numbers. The output is the same grid, rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The values in each cell of the grid represent colors, but the transformation only affects the position of the cells, not their values.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.  NumPy's rot90 function rotates
    # counter-clockwise by default, so we use k=-1 to achieve clockwise rotation.
    output_np = np.rot90(input_np, k=-1)

    # Convert the rotated NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_np.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
