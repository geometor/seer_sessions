Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value representing a specific color. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions, with each pixel's value (and thus color) changed according to a consistent rule. The transformation seems to involve adding 1 to the original value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [0-9]  # Representing colors

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: integer
      color: mapped_color # Determined by COLOR_MAP

actions:
  - type: increment
    description: Add a fixed value to each pixel's value.
    parameters:
      increment_value: 1

relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
    transformation: element-wise increment of pixel values

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of pixels, where each pixel has a numerical value corresponding to a color.
2.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, increment its numerical value by 1.
3.  **Output:** Create a new 3x3 grid with the transformed pixel values. The new values correspond to different colors in output.

In summary, the transformation rule is to simply add 1 to the value of each pixel in the input grid to produce the output grid.
