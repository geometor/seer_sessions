Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves a direct color substitution on a 3x3 grid. The input grid's colors are replaced according to the following rule:

1.  Gray (5) is replaced with Blue (1).
2.  Azure (8) is replaced with Maroon (9).
3.  Magenta (6) is replaced with Red (2).

The spatial configuration of the grid, including the position of each pixel, remains unchanged during the transformation. The output grid is a direct color-mapped version of the input grid.

    """
    Transforms an input grid by applying a color substitution.

    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

        8: 9,  # Azure to Maroon

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
