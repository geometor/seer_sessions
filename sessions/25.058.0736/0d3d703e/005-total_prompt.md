Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Grid Preservation:** The output grid has the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  **Pixel Increment:** Each pixel in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
3.  **Modulo 10:** If incrementing a pixel's value results in 10, the value wraps around to 0.  In other words, the output pixel value is the result of (input pixel value + 1) modulo 10.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by incrementing each pixel's value by 1, wrapping around from 9 to 0.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 2D list representing the output grid.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Iterate over each pixel in the input grid and increment its value by 1, taking the modulo by 10.
    output_grid = (output_grid + 1) % 10 # using numpy element-wise addition and modulo

    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
