Each pixel has a single numerical value representing a specific color. The transformation from input to output appears to maintain the grid's structure (3x3) but changes the color (and thus the numerical value) of each pixel. The transformation seems consistent across all rows, suggesting a simple color mapping or rule. The important features appear to be that we increment each color by 4, wrapping to zero after 9.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
