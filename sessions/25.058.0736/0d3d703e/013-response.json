The input grid has a distinct pattern of three colors (gray, azure, magenta) represented by the numbers 5, 8, and 6.  The output grid mirrors the layout but uses different colors (blue, maroon, red) represented by 1, 9, and 2. The transformation appears to be a simple color substitution, with each color in the input consistently mapping to a specific color in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
