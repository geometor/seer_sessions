## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D4E25D0>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D557610>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a single numerical value representing a specific color. The transformation from input to output appears to maintain the grid's structure (3x3) but changes the color (and thus the numerical value) of each pixel. The transformation seems consistent across all rows, suggesting a simple color mapping or rule. The important features appear to be that we increment each color by 4, wrapping to zero after 9.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: color_transformation
    description: Each pixel's color is changed according to a specific rule.

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid via the color_transformation action.
  - type: element_wise
    description: transformation applies individually to each element, with its spatial relationship preserved

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by an integer from 0 to 9.
2.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, add 4 to its color value. If the result is greater than 9, take result modulo 10.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the same structure as the input, but with each pixel's color value updated according to the transformation rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
