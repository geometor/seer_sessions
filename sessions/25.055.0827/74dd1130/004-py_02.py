"""
The transformation rule appears to be more complex than a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation. Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation seems to depend on the specific input grid. 

- Example 1: The output is identical to the input. It could be interpreted as no rotation, or a 360-degree rotation, or even mirroring across both axes.
- Example 2: Similar to Example 1, the input and output are the same.
- Example 3: The output is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input.

The initial hypothesis of a consistent 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. A new hypothesis could be a conditional transformation based on some properties like color or position.
The code attempts to address cases where the input grid remains the same (identity transformation) and cases involving rotation.

The input may remain unchanged if it is all of uniform color.
