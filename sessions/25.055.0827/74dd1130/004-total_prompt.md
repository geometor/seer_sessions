Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a clockwise rotation of the grid by 90 degrees. The cell at (row, col) in the input grid moves to (col, 2 - row) in the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input list of lists to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input
    rows, cols = input_array.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_array)
    
    # Iterate through the cells of input grid to perform rotation
    for i in range(rows):
      for j in range(cols):
        output_grid[j, rows - 1 - i] = input_array[i,j]

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The provided results reveal that this transformation is not consistent with all given examples. There are discrepancies, the task is more complex than a simple rotation, and possibly dependent on features and context in each training example.
We need to look more closely at the relationships between the pixels in the input and the output grids to understand how the rotation is applied, or whether some examples require a different transformation.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the specific positions and colors of pixels before and after the transformation.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns that go beyond simple rotation. Consider possibilities such as:
    *   Partial rotations (only certain parts of the grid are rotated).
    *   Conditional rotations (rotation depends on the color or position of pixels).
    *   Other transformations like mirroring, instead of rotation.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified patterns, create a revised natural language program that accurately describes the observed transformations. This may involve multiple steps or conditions.
4. Use code execution where needed to check assumptions, and prepare good details
   for the coder.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To help us understand the errors, let's use code to determine the size of the
grids and compare the number of pixels that are correctly transformed for each
example,

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, transform_function):
    results = []
    for example in examples:
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output = example['output']
        predicted_output = transform_function(input_grid)

        input_array = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_array = np.array(expected_output)
        predicted_array = np.array(predicted_output)
        
        correct_pixels = np.sum(predicted_array == expected_array)
        total_pixels = input_array.size  # rows * cols

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_array.shape,
            'output_shape': expected_array.shape,
            'correct_pixels': correct_pixels,
            'total_pixels': total_pixels,
            'accuracy': correct_pixels / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0
        })
    return results

#the previous transform function is used here

# the train set should be included in the prompt - but must be manually copied here
train_examples = [
    {'input': [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]},
    {'input': [[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]], 'output': [[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]},
    {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]}
]
results = analyze_results(train_examples, transform)
print(results)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
