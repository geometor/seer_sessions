Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve some kind of rearrangement or permutation of the cell values, as the same set of numbers are present in both input and output but in different positions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Comparing the input and output, it looks like a clockwise rotation by 90 degrees. To describe the program:\n\n1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored cells.\n2.  **Process:** Rotate the entire grid clockwise by 90 degrees.\n3. **Output:** The new 3x3 rotated grid.\n\nAnother way to express this is to describe the mapping of cell positions:\n\n1. Input cell at (row, col) moves to (col, 2 - row) in the output grid.\n\nFor example:\nInput(0,0) which has value 2 goes to Output (0, 2).\nInput(0,1) which has value 2 goes to Output(1,2)\nInput(0,2) which has value 1 goes to Output(2,2)\nInput (1,0) which has value 1 goes to Output(0,1)\nInput(1,1) which has value 5 goes to Output(1,1)\netc.\n"
