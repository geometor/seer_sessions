Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation seems to depend on the specific input grid. \n\n- Example 1: The output is identical to the input. It could be interpreted as no rotation, or a 360-degree rotation, or even mirroring across both axes.\n- Example 2: Similar to Example 1, the input and output are the same.\n- Example 3: The output is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input.\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a consistent 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. A new hypothesis could be a conditional transformation based on some properties like color or position.\nThe code attempts to address cases where the input grid remains the same (identity transformation) and cases involving rotation.\n\nThe input may remain unchanged if it is all of uniform color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on observed patterns.\n    The transformation can be identity or 90-degree clockwise rotation, seemingly dependent on object uniformity.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_array.shape\n\n    # Check if the grid is uniform (all pixels have the same color)\n    unique_colors = np.unique(input_array)\n    if len(unique_colors) == 1:\n        return input_grid.tolist()  # Identity transformation\n\n    # If not uniform, perform 90-degree clockwise rotation\n    output_grid = np.zeros((cols, rows), dtype=int)\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            output_grid[j, rows - 1 - i] = input_array[i, j]\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
