"""
The transformation can be described as a reflection or mirroring of the grid elements across the main diagonal (the diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner).  Each element at position (row, column) in the input grid is moved to position (column, row) in the output grid. In essence, the rows of the input become the columns of the output, and vice versa.
