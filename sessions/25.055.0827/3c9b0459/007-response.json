Each pixel has a numerical value representing a specific color. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of these pixels within the grid, maintaining the same set of colors and their counts, but changing their positions. It appears to be a rotation or reflection of some kind.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
