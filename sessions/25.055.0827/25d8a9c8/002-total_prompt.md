## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 4
2 3 2
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C864580>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x795D0C865AB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains pixels of yellow (4), red (2), and green (3). The output grid contains pixels of gray (5) and white (0). The spatial arrangement of the pixels seems crucial, with the top row transforming into gray, and the remaining two rows transforming into white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels
      input_colors: [yellow, red, green]
      output_colors: [gray, white]
actions:
  - type: color_transformation
    description: Changes pixel colors based on their row.
    details:
      row_1: yellow -> gray, any -> gray
      row_2_3: any -> white
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The row index of a pixel determines its output color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid. It operates as follows:

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **If** the current row is the first row (index 0), change all pixel values in that row to gray (5).
3.  **Otherwise** (if the row is the second or third row), change all pixel values in that row to white (0).
4.  The output is a new 3x3 grid containing gray pixels in top row and white pixels elsewhere.

Essentially: Top row to 5, other to 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
