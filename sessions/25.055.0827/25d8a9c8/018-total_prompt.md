Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping applied to each pixel of the input grid. The grid dimensions remain constant (3x3). The specific color mappings are:

1.  Red pixels are changed to White.
2.  Yellow pixels are changed to Gray.
3.  Maroon pixels are changed to Gray.
4. All other colors are unchanged (although other colors do not exist in the training examples provided).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy to modify
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # change output pixels based on color mapping
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 2:  # Red
                output_grid[i, j] = 0  # White
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Yellow
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 9:  # Maroon
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current `transform` function and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified a color mapping. The code accurately implements the described transformation and passes all test cases. Therefore, no changes are required.

**Strategy:**

Since the code accurately performs the color mapping described in the training examples, the primary focus will be on ensuring a complete natural language program for this transformation, as requested.

**Metrics and Observations:**
Here's an analysis of the given training pairs, using the provided solution to double-check properties.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

# Provided solution
def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 2:
                output_grid[i, j] = 0
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 4:
                output_grid[i, j] = 5
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 9:
                output_grid[i, j] = 5
    return output_grid

# Training examples
train_examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 2, 2], [2, 4, 2], [2, 2, 2]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[4, 4, 4], [4, 9, 4], [4, 4, 4]]),
        "output": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[9, 9, 9], [9, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
        "output": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 4, 9], [4, 9, 2], [9, 2, 4]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5]]),
    },
]

# Check each example against the provided transform function
for i, example in enumerate(train_examples):
    transformed_input = transform(example["input"])
    comparison = np.array_equal(transformed_input, example["output"])
    print(f"Example {i+1}: {'Passed' if comparison else 'Failed'}")
    if not comparison:
        print(f"  Transformed Input:\n{transformed_input}")
        print(f"  Expected Output:\n{example['output']}")

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
