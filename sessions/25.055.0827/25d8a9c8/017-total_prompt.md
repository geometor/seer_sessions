Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping applied to each pixel of the input grid. The grid dimensions remain constant (3x3). The specific color mappings are:

1.  Red pixels are changed to White.
2.  Yellow pixels are changed to Gray.
3.  Maroon pixels are changed to Gray.
4. All other colors are unchanged (although other colors do not exist in the training examples provided).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy to modify
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # change output pixels based on color mapping
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 2:  # Red
                output_grid[i, j] = 0  # White
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Yellow
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 9:  # Maroon
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
