"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping applied to each pixel of the input grid. The grid dimensions remain constant (3x3). The specific color mappings are:

1.  Red pixels are changed to White.
2.  Yellow pixels are changed to Gray.
3.  Maroon pixels are changed to Gray.
4. All other colors are unchanged (although other colors do not exist in the training examples provided).
