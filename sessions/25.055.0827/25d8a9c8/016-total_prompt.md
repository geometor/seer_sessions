Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves a simple color mapping. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
1.  If a pixel is red, change it to white (0).
2.  If a pixel is yellow, change it to gray (5).
3. If a pixel is maroon, change it to gray (5).
4.  Maintain the grid's original 3x3 structure. Other colors are not present in input, thus no explicit rule needed.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy to modify
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # change output pixels based on color mapping
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] == 2:  # Red
                output_grid[i, j] = 0  # White
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Yellow
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 9:  # Maroon
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Gray

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple color mapping observed in the first training example. The testing results reveal that this initial assessment was accurate and successfully generalizes to all training examples. The transformation involves changing specific colors (red, yellow, maroon) to other specific colors (white, gray) while preserving the grid structure. Since the code works perfectly on all training examples, no changes are necessary. However, I will still provide the requested deliverables for completeness and to demonstrate the process.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use a simplified representation since code execution within this environment isn't directly possible to generate a numpy array and check colors at scale. I will describe the observations based on visual inspection of the provided image of the task examples and the code execution report.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with red, yellow, and maroon pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with white and gray pixels corresponding to the color changes.
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with red and yellow pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with white and gray pixels.
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with yellow and maroon pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with gray pixels.
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   Result: Success.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml

  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: red

      - color: yellow
        positions: [[0,1], [1,0], [2,2]]

    transformations:
        - from: red
          to: white
        - from: yellow
          to: gray
  - example: 3
    input_objects:
        - color: yellow
          positions: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2]]
        - color: maroon
          positions: [[1,0],[1,1],[1,2],[2,0],[2,1],[2,2]]
    output_objects:
        - color: gray
          positions: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[1,1],[1,2],[2,0],[2,1],[2,2]]
    transformations:
        - from: yellow
          to: gray
        - from: maroon
          to: gray
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a color mapping applied to each pixel of the input grid. The grid dimensions remain constant (3x3). The specific color mappings are:

1.  Red pixels are changed to White.
2.  Yellow pixels are changed to Gray.
3.  Maroon pixels are changed to Gray.
4. All other colors are unchanged (although other colors do not exist in the training examples provided).

The previous natural language program is still a perfect match for the complete training set.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
