Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L'
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 180
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L'
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 180
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single
      positions: [[1,2],[4,4]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects of color 8 (azure). One 'L' shape object is in the top left corner formed by the cells (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2), and a 180 rotated 'L' is present on the right formed by (3,4), (3,5) and (4,5).

2.  **Detect Changes:** By comparing the input and output grids, we see changes in the color of two of the light blue cells:
	*   The cell at position (1,2) changes from 8 in input to 1 in output.
    *   The cell at position (4,4) changes from 8 in input to 1 in output.

3.  **Determine the Rule**
	* Check every cell color 8 (azure).
    * If it belongs to an 'L' shape, change to 1 (blue) the cell at the vertex of the angle.

**Conclusion**

The transformation rule replaces some, but not all, of the azure (8) cells with blue (1) cells. The rule highlights the change applied to the azure L shapes.

Okay, here's the Python implementation based on the transformation rule we've identified:

Okay, let's analyze the second example of the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 90
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 270
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L'
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
  - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 90
      positions: [[0,4], [0,5], [1,5]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L' rotated 270
      positions: [[2,2], [3,2], [3,3]]
    - color: 8
      shape: 'L'
      positions: [[5,4], [6,4], [6,5]]
    - color: 1
      shape: single
      positions: [[1,4],[2,3], [5,3]]
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct objects of color 8 (azure).
    *   One 'L' shape is rotated 90 degrees, and its elements are at positions (0,4), (0,5), and (1,5).

    *  Another 'L' rotated 270 degrees, and its elements are at positions (2,2), (3,2), and (3,3)
  
    *   A third 'L' shape, positioned at (5,4), (6,4) and (6,5).

2.  **Detect Changes:** Comparing input and output, the azure (8) cells change at the vertex.
    *    (1,4) changes from 8 to 1.
    *    (2,3) changes from 8 to 1.
    *   (5,3) changes from 8 to 1.

3.  **Determine the Rule**
	* Check every cell color 8 (azure).
    * If it belongs to an 'L' shape, change to 1 (blue) the cell at the vertex of the angle.

**Conclusion**
The transformation rule identifies the L shaped of color 8. Then, modifies the color of the vertex of the corner, changing color 8 (azure) for color 1 (blue)

The previous Python code correctly implements this rule.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
