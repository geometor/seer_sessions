            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example of input and output grids.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grid contains three distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle at the top-right. The second is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the center-left. The last one is a 1x2 horizontal rectangle in the bottom-center.\n\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is almost identical to the input grid. The difference is that a blue pixel (color 1) has appeared immediately to the right of the top-most azure pixel in each object.\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_objects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    position: (0,4)  # top-left corner coordinates\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    position: (2,2)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 1x2 rectangle\n    position: (6,3)\n\noutput_objects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    position: (0,4)\n  - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1 pixel\n    position: (0,5)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 rectangle\n    position: (2,2)\n  - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1 pixel\n    position: (2,3)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 1x2 rectangle\n    position: (6,3)\n    - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1 pixel\n    position: (5,3)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is consistent with the previous example and can be described as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects within the input grid.\n2.  **Find Top-Most Pixel:** For each identified azure object, determine its top-most pixel.\n3.  **Place Blue Pixel:** For each azure object, place a blue (color 1) pixel to the immediate right of the top-most pixel of the azure object. If the location to the right is already occupied or outside the boundary, it is skipped.\n\nThe natural language program is the same as that provided in the first example.\n"
