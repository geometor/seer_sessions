            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise while preserving white pixels was partially correct, but it's not the complete picture. The provided code has issues and does not preserve the white pixels in the correct locations. The problem seems in the logic around preserving only *some* of the original positions. It's not simply preserving white pixels; it's more complex than that. We need to re-examine the relationship between the input and output, paying close attention to *all* colors, not just white.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Careful Re-examination:** We will visually inspect each input-output pair again, meticulously noting the movement and transformation of *all* colors, not just the white ones.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Define \"objects\" within the grid more rigorously. Are individual colored pixels objects, or are contiguous blocks of the same color objects?\n3.  **Precise Movement Tracking:** Instead of just general rotation, we'll try to describe the specific movement of each object or pixel.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** Look for any conditional rules. Does the transformation depend on the color, position, or neighbors of a pixel?\n5. **Refine the code.** Improve the provided code.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\nSince I cannot directly execute the code I will have to rely on analyzing the provided input and outputs.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 3x3 grid with a blue 'L' shape and white background.\n*   **Output:** 3x3 grid with a rotated blue 'L' shape and white background.\n* **Provided Code Result**: Incorrect, did not maintain relative locations of all white pixels\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 5x5 grid with a green 'C' shape and white background.\n*   **Output:** 5x5 grid with a rotated green 'C' shape and white background.\n* **Provided Code Result**: Incorrect, did not maintain relative locations of all white pixels\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with various colors and shapes.\n*   **Output:** 7x7 grid appears to be a 90 degree rotation\n* **Provided Code Result**: Incorrect, did not maintain relative locations of all white pixels\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input: |\n        [[0, 1, 0],\n         [0, 1, 0],\n         [0, 1, 1]]\n      output: |\n        [[0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 0, 0]]\n      objects:\n        - color: blue\n          shape: L-shape\n          input_position: top-left\n          output_position: bottom-left (rotated)\n        - color: white\n          shape: background\n          input_position: fills remaining space\n          output_position: fills remaining space\n      transformations:\n        - rotate_90_clockwise: true\n        - preserve_all_white_pixels: true #all 0 are the same in input and output\n  - example_2:\n      input: |\n        [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]\n      output: |\n        [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n      objects:\n       - color: green\n         shape: C-shape\n         input_position: left\n         output_position: top (rotated)\n       - color: white\n         shape: background\n         input_position: fill\n         output_position: fill\n      transformations:\n       - rotate_90_clockwise: true\n       - preserve_all_white_pixels: true\n  - example_3:\n      input: |\n        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n      output: |\n        [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\n      objects:\n       - color: azure\n         shape: line/partial square\n         input_position: right side\n         output_position: bottom (rotated)\n       - color: blue\n         shape: T-shape\n         input_position: bottom-left\n         output_position: top-left (rotated)\n       - color: white\n         shape: background\n         input_position: fills remaining space\n         output_position: fills remaining space\n      transformations:\n        - rotate_90_clockwise: true\n        - preserve_all_white_pixels: true\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire input grid. All of the white pixels (0) in the output are at the same coordinate locations as the input.\n\n"
