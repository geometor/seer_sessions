## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE9CA5F0>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE9CAA10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The primary colors involved are maroon (9) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a change in the position of the white and maroon pixels. There appears to be some kind of rotation or reflection involved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    colors: [maroon, white]

  - type: pixel
    color: maroon
    value: 9

  - type: pixel
    color: white
    value: 0

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Changes the position of colored pixels within the grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
    layout_input:  "9 is in the corners and the top-left to top-center is a diagonal of 9s going down to right"
    layout_output: "0 is on top-left and extends to middle-left, remaining is 9"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation can be described as a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid, *but* before the rotation we must get the full diagonal, moving value at `[0][1]` to `[2][1]` and make `[0][1]` the `0` value. After this translation the grid is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

Another, possibly simpler way, to describe it:
The input grid is transformed by changing the top-middle cell to white if it is originally maroon, copying all the rest of the left most colum, duplicating the white color to the cell underneath and keeping the rest of the input grid, effectively creating a 2x1 vertical domino of white colored cells.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
