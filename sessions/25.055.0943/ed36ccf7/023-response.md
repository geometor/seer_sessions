Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a 90-degree clockwise rotation with preservation of white pixels was incorrect. The provided code's attempt to preserve white pixels at their original input coordinates within the rotated grid is fundamentally flawed. The white pixels should also rotate with the rest of the grid. The core issue is that the initial natural language program and, consequently, the code, didn't correctly capture the actual transformation. It seems that only a rotation needs to happen, so the white-pixel preservation is unnecessary.

**Strategy:**
1.  Remove the incorrect white-pixel preservation logic, it is not performing the intended task.
2.  Re-evaluate the core transformation rule based on the provided results, it will likely be a simple rotation
3. Update the YAML and Natural Language program

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To confirm, I need to describe the details about each of the examples, I will provide the dimensions and a description of the input and the expected output

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Output Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Description:** A small 3x3 grid. A 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    Input:
    [[0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0]]

    Output:
    [[0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0]]

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 5x5
*   **Output Dimensions:** 5x5
*   **Description:** A 5x5 grid. A 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    Input:
     [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]

    Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

**Example 3:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 7x7
*   **Output Dimensions:** 7x7
*   **Description:** A 7x7 grid. A 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    Input:
    [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

    Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - content: pixels with integer values (0-9)
    actions:
      - name: rotate
        description: Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
        parameters:
          - direction: clockwise
          - angle: 90 degrees

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire input grid.
