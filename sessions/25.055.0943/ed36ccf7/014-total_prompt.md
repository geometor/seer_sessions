## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 9
0 0 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE779720>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
0 0 9
0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE77A6E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The colors (represented by digits) in the grid are changing. The primary colors involved are white (0) and maroon (9). The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 9]  # white, maroon

properties:
  - color:
      type: categorical
      values: {0: white, 9: maroon}
  - position:
      type: coordinate
      range: (1-3, 1-3)  # row, column

actions:
    - rotate_grid: # hypothesis name, might be reflection
        type: transformation
        parameter: 90 degrees clockwise # hypothesis description

relationships:
  - spatial:
      type: adjacency
      description: pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid. The positions of the white (0) and maroon (9) pixels are rearranged according to this rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
