facts:
  - observation: "The transformation consistently involves changing blue pixels to white."
  - observation: "The change seems related to the presence of red pixels."
  - observation: "Blue pixels adjacent to red pixels are often, but not always, changed to white."
  - observation: "In the examples, blue pixels enclosed by or directly adjacent to red pixels turn white."
  - observation: "The initial code's rule about the top-center pixel is not universally applicable but is correct in the first example."
  - observation: "The first example is a special case or an outlier, as the top-center rule is not general."
