## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6
0 0 0
6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE9CAA10>

**output:**
```
6 0 0
6 0 6
6 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE9CA5F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value represented by an integer (0 or 6 in this case). The colors correspond to white (0) and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve a change in the arrangement of these colored pixels within the grid. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is maintained.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_type: grid_transformation
  - grid_dimensions: 3x3
  - colors:
    - 0: white
    - 6: magenta
  - objects:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: integer (0 or 6)
        - position: (row, column)
  - transformations:
    - description: "Rearrangement of pixels based on color and position."
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: "Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, with adjacency being a key factor."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Record the x coordinate of magenta (6) pixels
3. **Reconstruct:** Create output grid
    - set values for cells where the x coordinate matches an x coordinate of magenta (6) pixels from the input, as magenta (6).
4.  **Fill:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).

Essentially, the program takes any column in the input grid with a magenta (6) pixel, and sets the output column to be all magenta, otherwise white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
