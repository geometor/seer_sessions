1. Identify Azure Pixels: Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure).
2. Check for Diagonal Connectivity: Determine if the azure pixels are connected diagonally. Diagonally connected azure pixels are considered a single object.
3. Count distinct diagonal azure groups: Each set of diagonally connected pixels represent one object.
4. Create Output: Create a 1x1 output grid. The single cell in this grid will contain the count of the distinct, diagonally contiguous azure objects, represented as a single digit.
