## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE865990>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7297AE866260>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers (0-9), representing colors.  The output is a single digit number. The specific colors involved are gray (5) and white (0). The output seems to relate to a count of something within the input grid, specifically it appears to be the number of grey (5) objects touching the edge.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each with a color value.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 5] # white, grey
        description: Represents the color of the pixel.
      position:
        type: coordinates
        description: Row and column index within the grid.
  - type: object
    properties:
        color:
            type: integer
            values: [5]
            description: grey
        location:
            type: coordinates
            description: edge locations
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains pixels.
  - type: grouping
    description: adjacent pixels of same value form a connected component (object)
actions:
  - type: counting
    description: Count edge objects

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of pixels with the same color within the input grid.
2.  **Filter Objects by color:** Select objects colored gray (5).
3. **Check Object Location**: Check if any part of the object touches the outer edge/border of the grid.
4.  **Count Edge Objects:** Count the number of objects from step 3 (grey object touching the edge).
5.  **Output:** The output is the final count. In this example, there are two grey objects on corners - all corner objects touch the edge.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
