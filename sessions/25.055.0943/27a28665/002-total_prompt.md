## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE166B60>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7297AE166350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers (0-9), representing different colors. The output appears to be a single digit, also likely representing a color in the same scheme, inside a 1x1 grid. The primary colors involved in the input are gray (5) and white (0). The output is blue (1). It seems like a counting or filtering task.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: 3x3 grid
    elements:
      - color: gray (5)
        locations: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
      - color: white (0)
        locations: [(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)]
  - type: output
    description: 1x1 grid
    elements:
      - color: blue (1)
        locations: [(0,0)]
  - observation: output is a single value
  - observation: input has two distinct colors
  - potential_relationship: output relates to some aggregate of input colors
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program counts the number of times that the color gray appears inside the input grid, and the output is `1` if there are any gray.

Another possible interpretation: Count the unique colors in the grid. There are gray and white, for a total of 2. However, since the output shown is just `1`, it seems that the output color, blue (1) means one of the colors are counted, specifically gray (5) in this example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
