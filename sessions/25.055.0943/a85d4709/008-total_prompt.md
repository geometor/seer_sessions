## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE6B9F00>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE9CAA10>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid where all cells have the same color. The example shows grey (5) and white (0).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid where all cells have the same color, which is green (3).
*   **Transformation:** The color of all cells is replaced by a single, uniform color (green/3) regardless of the original color. The grid dimensions remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    property: color
    input_state: uniform_color # all pixels of the grid have the same color
    output_state: uniform_color # all pixels of the grid have the same color
  - type: transformation
    description: color replacement
    input_color: variable
    output_color: 3
    scope: entire_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid as input.
2. **Replace all:** Replace the color value of every cell in the grid with the value 3 (green).
3.  **Output:** Return the modified 3x3 grid.

Essentially this transformation appears to change the values of all colors to `3`.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
