Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation replaces values in the input grid with corresponding values in the output grid based on a clockwise color scheme. 0s are replaced with 3, 4, and 2 in a clockwise fashion around the edge, and 5s are replaced by the next clockwise value.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Define the clockwise replacement mapping
    replacement_map = {
        (0, 0): 3,  # Top-left 0
        (0, 1): 3, # Top-center 0
        (0, 2): 3,  # Top-right
        (1, 2): 4,  # Middle-right
        (2, 2): 2, # Bottom Right
        (2, 1): 2,  # Bottom-center
        (2, 0): 2,  # Bottom-left
        (1, 0): 4,  # Middle-left
        (1, 1): 4,  # Center

    }

    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Get the value from the input grid
            value = input_grid[r, c]
            if value == 0:
              output_grid[r,c] = replacement_map[(r,c)]
            elif value == 5:
              if (r,c) == (0,2):
                output_grid[r,c] = 3
              if (r,c) == (1,1):
                output_grid[r,c] = 4
              if (r,c) == (2,0):
                output_grid[r,c] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a clockwise color replacement scheme, specifically targeting 0s and 5s. However, the test results on the full training set reveal that this approach is too simplistic and only partially correct. The initial hypothesis about a simple clockwise replacement around the edge is not universally applicable. The code also makes assumptions about positions instead of adapting to the shape of the input. We need a more general rule that considers the context, likely involving the relationship between the 0s and 5s, rather than fixed positions.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine all training input/output pairs, not just the first one, to find a more comprehensive pattern.
2.  **Identify Core Objects and Actions**: Clearly define what constitutes an "object" in this context and what actions are applied.
3.  **Contextual Replacement**: Determine if the replacement is based on the relative position of 0s and 5s, or some other spatial relationship.
4.  **Generalize the Rule**: Develop a rule that is not tied to specific coordinates but is general.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

I will not use code execution here. It is not necessary at this point. Instead, I will meticulously review each example by visual inspection. The error reports are clear enough.

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with 0s and 5s.
    *   Output: Clockwise replacement. Original code worked.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with 0s and 5s.
    *    Output: Shows a change of the `0` values to either `2`, `3`, or `4` depending on relative position to a `5`.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with 0s and one 5.
    *   Output: Again, shows a replacement strategy.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: zero_regions
    description: Contiguous regions of 0s (white pixels).
    properties:
      - color: 0

  - name: five_regions
    description: Contiguous regions of 5s (gray pixels)
    properties:
      - color: 5

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Replace the color of zero_regions based on their spatial relationship to five_regions.
    parameters:
      - source_color: 0
      - target_color: Determined by relative position (2, 3, or 4)

observations:
  - example_1: Zero regions are replaced in what appeared to be a clockwise manner around the edge.
  - example_2: Zero regions are replaced with different numbers depending on the relative location of fives.
  - example_3: Zero regions are replaced.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of 0s (white) and 5s (gray).
2.  **Contextual Replacement:** For each region of 0s, determine its spatial relationship to the nearest region of 5s.
3. **Replacement Rule** The `0` values seem to change to either `3`, `4`, or `2`. Starting at the `5` value, going clockwise they change to `3`, `4`, then `2`.

This revised natural language program provides a more accurate and general description of the transformation. The original concept of clockwise was close, but did not describe how the input was transformed into the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
