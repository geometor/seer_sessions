## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE865750>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
5 5 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE864460>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The primary colors involved are red (2) and azure (8) in the input, and red (2) and gray (5) in the output. The transformation seems to be localized to the central horizontal line of the grid. Specifically, the azure pixels in the input are replaced by gray pixels in the output. The red pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [3, 3]
  - object: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      color:
        input: [red, azure]
        output: [red, gray]
      value:
        input:  [2, 8]
        output: [2, 5]
  - action: replace
    target:
      object: pixel
      location: center_row
      condition: color == azure
    replacement:
      color: gray
      value: 5
  - relationship:
    type: spatial
    description: pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Grid:** The input is a 3x3 grid of pixels.
2.  **Locate the Center Row**: Focus on the pixels in the second (middle) row of the grid.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   Iterate through pixels of central row.
    *   If a pixel's color is azure (value 8), change its color to gray (value 5).
    *   If not azure, leave unchanged
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not azure in the central row remain unchanged.
5.  **Output the grid**

In summary: The transformation replaces azure pixels in the center row of the input grid with gray pixels, leaving all other pixels untouched.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
