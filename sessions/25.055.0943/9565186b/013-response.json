The primary colors involved are red (2) and azure (8) in the input, and red (2) and gray (5) in the output. The transformation seems to be localized to the central horizontal line of the grid. Specifically, the azure pixels in the input are replaced by gray pixels in the output. The red pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
