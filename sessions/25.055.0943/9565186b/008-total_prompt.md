## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 1
8 1 3
8 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE865990>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
5 1 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE864460>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers.  The most prominent change is the replacement of certain colors with others, specifically colors other than '1' (blue) seem to be targets for replacement. The color '1' (blue) appears to be preserved. The replacement color seems to be '5' (gray).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: color_preservation
    details: Color '1' (blue) is unchanged in the output.
  - observation: color_replacement
    details: Colors other than '1' are replaced.
    replacement_color: '5' (gray)
  - relationship: input_output
    type: transformation
    description: Input grid transforms to output grid based on color replacement rules.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color value of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the color value is '1' (blue), **keep** the same value in the output grid.
4.  **Else** (if the color is not '1'), **replace** the color value with '5' (gray) in the output grid.
5. output the modified grid.

Essentially, the program is a simple color replacement rule: "Replace all colors except blue with gray."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
