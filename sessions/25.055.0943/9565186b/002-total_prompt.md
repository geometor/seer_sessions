## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE864460>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE865990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5) pixels. The red pixels remain unchanged. The blue and azure pixels are replaced with gray pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: The output is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Input grid colors include red, blue, and azure.
  - observation: Output grid colors include red and gray.
  - object: red_pixels
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      location: unchanged between input and output
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      location: center of input grid
    action:
      name: replace_color
      new_color: gray (5)
  - object: azure_pixels
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      location: bottom right and center right of input grid
    action:
       name: replace_color
       new_color: gray(5)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If the pixel is red (2), keep its color unchanged in the output grid.
3.  If the pixel is blue (1) or azure (8), change its color to gray (5) in the output grid.
4. output the transformed grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
