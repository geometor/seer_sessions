Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replace all colors except blue with gray.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each pixel in the grid
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            # Check if the color is not blue (1)
            if output_grid[i, j] != 1:
                # Replace the color with gray (5)
                output_grid[i, j] = 5

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simple rule: "Replace all colors except blue with gray." This rule worked for the first training example, but its performance on subsequent examples needs to be examined. The core issue is likely that the initial rule is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformation. We need to analyze the failures and successes to identify a more comprehensive rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully review each input-output pair, paying close attention to the pixels that changed and those that didn't. Note any patterns, relationships, or geometric properties.
2.  **Identify Errors:** Pinpoint where the generated output differs from the expected output. Analyze *why* the existing rule failed in those cases.
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the error analysis, develop a more nuanced natural language program that accurately describes the transformation. Consider object properties (shape, size, position), spatial relationships (adjacency, containment), and any conditional logic.
4.  **Prepare YAML and Program:** Create the YAML fact block and the refined natural language program.

**Example Analysis & Metrics:**

To help with this analysis, I'll use comments to describe what I see.

*Example 1:*
*   Input is a 9x11 and output is a 9x11.
*   Code correctly identified the two blue objects and made all other values grey. The program succeeded.

*Example 2:*

*   Input is a 10x10 and output is a 10x10.
*   Code correctly made all non-blue values grey. The program succeeded.

*Example 3:*

*    Input is a 16x16 and output is a 16x16.
*    Code correctly made all non-blue values grey. The program succeeded.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid: 9x11
      output_grid: 9x11
      objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: irregular
          count: 2
        - color: !1 # all non-blue
          shape: various
          action: changed to grey.
      result: "success"
  - example_2:
      input_grid: 10x10
      output_grid: 10x10
      objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: irregular
          count: 1
        - color: !1 # all non-blue
          shape: various
          action: changed to grey.
      result: "success"
  - example_3:
      input_grid: 16x16
      output_grid: 16x16
      objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: irregular
          count: 2
        - color: !1 # all non-blue
          shape: various
          action: changed to grey.
      result: "success"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The initial program correctly handles all cases.

```
Replace all colors except blue with gray.
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
