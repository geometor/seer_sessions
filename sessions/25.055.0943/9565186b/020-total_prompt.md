## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 3 5
4 4 4
5 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE865AE0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
4 4 4
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE77A470>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   Each cell in the grids contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The output grid retains some colors from the input grid but changes others.
*   The color '4' (yellow) is unchanged.
* The color '5'(grey) is unchanged
* Other colors are replaced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9

transformations:
  - input_color: 3  # Green
    output_color: 5 # Grey
  - input_color: 1  # Blue
    output_color: 5 # Grey

invariant:
    - color: 4
    - color: 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Invariant Colors:** Observe the input and output grids. Colors 4 (yellow) and 5(grey) remain the same in both.
2.  **Change other colors:**
    - Change any 3(green) pixel to 5 (grey).
    - Change any 1(blue) pixel to 5 (grey).
3.  **Preserve:** Keep all pixels that are color 4 (yellow) or 5(grey) unchanged.
4. The output grid will maintain same shape and dimensions.

In essence, the program replaces blues and greens with grey, while keeping yellow and grey pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
