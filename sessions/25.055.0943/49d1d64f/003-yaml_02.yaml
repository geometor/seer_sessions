observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 2
      width: 2
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents the initial pixel values.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 6
      width: 6
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents the transformed pixel values.
  - action: replicate_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: intermediate_grid
    properties:
      scale_factor: 2
      description: Each pixel in the input_grid is replicated into a 2x2 block in the intermediate_grid.
  - action: add_border
    input: intermediate_grid
    output: output_grid
    properties:
      border_color: 0 (white)
      border_width: 1
      description: A border of white pixels is added around the intermediate_grid.
  - scale_factor: 3
    description: the ratio of output grid to input grid dimensions
    details: the scale factor is consistent for height and width
