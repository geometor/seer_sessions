facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relation: spatial_expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: Each pixel in the input, except the center, expands to a 2x2 block in the output.
  - relation: center_preservation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The central pixel of the input grid remains a single pixel at the center of the output grid.
  - relation: color_preservation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description:  The color value of each pixel is unchanged during the transformation.
  - observation: edge_mirroring
    description: Pixels at the edges of the input grid are mirrored at the edge of the larger output grid.
