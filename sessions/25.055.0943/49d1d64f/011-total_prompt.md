Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the initial code output to develop a robust natural language program and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code provides basic analysis, printing shapes and unique colors of input/output pairs. This helps to frame the problem, but doesn't describe the transformation itself. The examples clearly show a consistent pattern: the input grid is being expanded by adding a border of black (0) pixels. The output grid is always larger than the input, and the original input grid's content appears to be centered within the new, larger grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Pattern Consistency:** Verify that the "add a black border" rule applies to all training examples. The printed output confirms this.
2.  **Determine Border Size:** Calculate the added border's thickness on each side (top/bottom, left/right). It appears to always be a one-pixel border.
3.  **Formalize the rule:** Express the transformation as a precise natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations (from code execution):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 5)
    *   Input Unique Colors: \[8]
    *   Output Unique Colors: \[0 8]
    * border added to all sides

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 6)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 8)
    *   Input Unique Colors: \[6 8]
    *   Output Unique Colors: \[0 6 8]
    * border added to all sides

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Input Unique Colors: \[7]
    *   Output Unique Colors: \[0 7]
    * border added to all sides

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Shape: (4, 2)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 4)
    *   Input Unique Colors: \[4]
    *   Output Unique Colors: \[0 4]
    * border added to all sides

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always larger than the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains all the colors of the input grid, plus black (0).
  - observation: |
    The input grid contents appear centered in output grid.
  - rule: |
      A border of black (0) pixels is added to all sides of the input grid.
  - border_thickness: |
       The border thickness is one pixel on all sides (top, bottom, left, right).
  - input_object: The entire input grid.
  - output_object: The expanded grid with a black border.
  - action: Enlarge input grid by adding border.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Take** the input grid.
2.  **Create** a new, larger grid filled with black (color 0) pixels. The new grid's dimensions should be calculated by adding 2 to both the height and width of the input grid (adding one pixel border on each side).
3.  **Copy** the contents of the original input grid into the center of the new grid. Specifically, the top-left corner of the input grid should be placed at position (1, 1) in the output grid (where (0, 0) is the top-leftmost position).
4.  **Return** the new grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
