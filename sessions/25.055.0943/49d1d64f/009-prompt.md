Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that's larger than the input grid. Specifically, add one row above and below the input grid dimensions and increase the width by two.
2.  **Padding border:** Add a border of '0' (white) pixels around the expanded region where the input will be placed. The padding should be one pixel.
3.  **Copy and Expand:** Copy each element from the input grid to the output grid. Expand as follows:
    *   Copy the top row of the input into the output, bordered by white pixels
    *   duplicate the top row of the input and add under the top row, mirroring each pixel
    *   Copy the bottom row of the input grid to output grid, under the duplicated input top row.
    *  duplicate the bottom row of the input and add under it, mirroring each pixel, padding left and right with white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
