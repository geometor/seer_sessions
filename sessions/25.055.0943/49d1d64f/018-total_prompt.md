Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation expands the input grid by duplicating each non-central pixel into a 2x2 block while preserving the central pixel. The original grid is effectively "inflated" around its center and mirrored at the edges, with color values maintained throughout.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms a 3x3 input grid to a 5x5 output grid according to the described rules."""

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=int)

    # Place central pixel
    center_value = input_grid[1, 1]
    output_grid[2, 2] = center_value

    # Iterate through input grid and expand
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if (i, j) != (1, 1):  # Skip central pixel
                output_grid[i*2:i*2+2, j*2:j*2+2] = input_grid[i,j]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved expanding a 3x3 grid to a 5x5 grid by duplicating non-central pixels into 2x2 blocks. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. The size of the input and output grids vary, and the "expansion" factor isn't always consistent. The core concept of preserving the central pixel (when present) seems relevant, but the expansion logic needs significant refinement. The provided examples showcase a variety of input and output sizes. So we must adjust from a static expansion to a dynamic, data-driven one.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine all input/output pairs to identify the relationship between input and output grid dimensions.
2.  **Dynamic Expansion**: Determine a rule for calculating output dimensions based on input dimensions, instead of fixed 5x5.
3. **Refine Pixel Placement Logic:** The current code assumes 2x2 expansion, which is incorrect for all the examples. We must determine how cells in the input map to cells in the output, accounting for cases that are not simple 2x2 expansions of original cells.
4.  **Central pixel** Determine a strategy to handle even dimensioned inputs and outputs.
5.  **Iterative Refinement**: Test the refined natural language program, comparing output on training examples, making adjustments if needed.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use `code_execution` to programmatically analyze input/output dimensions and pixel mappings to extract relevant metrics.

```python
def analyze_examples(task_data):
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        input_shape = input_grid.shape
        output_shape = output_grid.shape
        shape_ratio = (output_shape[0] / input_shape[0], output_shape[1] / input_shape[1])

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_shape,
            'output_shape': output_shape,
            'shape_ratio': shape_ratio
        })
    return results

# task is defined in the context, no need to define it again, just use it to access data
analysis_results = analyze_examples(task)
print(analysis_results)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
