Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation expands the input grid by duplicating each non-central pixel into a 2x2 block while preserving the central pixel. The original grid is effectively "inflated" around its center and mirrored at the edges, with color values maintained throughout.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms a 3x3 input grid to a 5x5 output grid according to the described rules."""

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=int)

    # Place central pixel
    center_value = input_grid[1, 1]
    output_grid[2, 2] = center_value

    # Iterate through input grid and expand
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if (i, j) != (1, 1):  # Skip central pixel
                output_grid[i*2:i*2+2, j*2:j*2+2] = input_grid[i,j]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
