## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 2
3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7297AE77BB80>

**output:**
```
0 1 2 0
1 1 2 2
3 3 8 8
0 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7297AE77BB20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 2x2 grid into a larger 4x4 grid. The original grid's elements (pixels with specific colors and numerical values) appear to be replicated and surrounded by a border of a new color (white, represented by 0). Each original pixel seems to become a 2x2 block in the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
      - value: 3
        color: green
      - value: 8
        color: azure
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - value: original pixel value
        color: original pixel color
        count: 4 (2x2 block)
      - value: 0
        color: white
        location: border
  - type: transformation
    description: replication and bordering
    details: Each pixel in the input grid is replicated into a 2x2 block in the output grid. The resulting 4x4 grid is then bordered with white pixels (value 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate:** For each pixel in the 2x2 input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color and value in the output grid. This will create the inner 2x2 blocks of the output.
2. **Border:** Add one layer of white pixel (value 0) border around 2x2 blocks.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
