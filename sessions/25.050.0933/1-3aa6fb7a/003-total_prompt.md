Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) regions"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape:  "Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure (8) regions"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: "Two single blue pixels"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) colored pixels in the input grid. There two separate azure regions.
2.  **Identify Single Azure Pixels:** Observe that there are single azure pixels within each azure regions that don't have neighbors of color 8.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the isolated single azure pixels into blue (color 1) in the output grid.
4. **Preserve the rest:** All the rest of azure object and the background are preserved.

**Explanation of the Transformation Rule**

The transformation identifies azure regions. From each identified regions, find the most isolated azure pixel, which has no neighbors with the same color and change it to blue. The rest of the structure is kept unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
