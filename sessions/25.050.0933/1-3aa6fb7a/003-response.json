This reveals three distinct azure regions.\n2.  **Identify Single Azure Pixels within Regions:** Within each of the azure regions, identify the azure pixels that have the fewest neighbors of the same color (8).\n3.  **Change Color:** Transform the color of these least-connected azure pixels to blue (color 1).\n4. **Preservation.** The azure regions and white background is preserved.\n\n**Explanation of the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe rule operates on azure (color 8) regions.  For each identified region, it finds the azure pixel(s) with the *fewest* neighbors of the same color and changes their color to blue (color 1). Everything else in the input grid remains unchanged. This is consistent with what was learned from the first example.\n\nThe code written previously will correctly perform this transformation. No changes are required.\n"
