            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input grids are 4 rows by 7 columns. They consistently feature a vertical line of blue pixels (color 1) in the 4th column (index 3). This blue line appears to act as a separator, dividing the grid into two main sections: a left section (columns 0-2) and a right section (columns 4-6).\n2.  **Left Section Colors:** The left section primarily contains orange (7) and white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Right Section Colors:** The right section primarily contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids are 4 rows by 3 columns. This size matches the dimensions of both the left and right sections of the input grid (excluding the blue separator).\n5.  **Output Grid Colors:** The output grids contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to involve a comparison between the left and right sections of the input grid. By observing the examples, it appears that a pixel in the output grid becomes green (3) only if the corresponding pixels in *both* the left section and the right section of the input grid are white (0). If either corresponding input pixel (or both) is non-white, the output pixel is white (0). The blue separator column is ignored in forming the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
