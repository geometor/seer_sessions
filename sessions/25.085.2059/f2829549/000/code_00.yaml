task_description: "Transform a 4x7 input grid based on a pixel-wise comparison across a central blue separator."

input_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 4
    width: 7
    colors_present: [white (0), blue (1), gray (5), orange (7)]
  structure:
    - name: separator
      type: Vertical Line
      properties:
        color: blue (1)
        column_index: 3
        height: 4
    - name: left_subgrid
      type: Subgrid
      properties:
        rows: 0-3
        columns: 0-2
        source: input_grid
        colors_predominant: [orange (7), white (0)]
    - name: right_subgrid
      type: Subgrid
      properties:
        rows: 0-3
        columns: 4-6
        source: input_grid
        colors_predominant: [gray (5), white (0)]

output_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 4
    width: 3
    colors_present: [white (0), green (3)]
    source_relationship: "Derived from comparing left_subgrid and right_subgrid pixel-wise."

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: the blue vertical separator line (column index 3).
    - extract: the left_subgrid (columns 0-2).
    - extract: the right_subgrid (columns 4-6).
    - create: a new output_grid with dimensions matching the subgrids (4x3), initialized to white (0).
    - iterate: through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `2`.
    - compare: the pixel value at `(r, c)` in left_subgrid and `(r, c)` in right_subgrid (relative indexing within subgrids).
    - apply_rule:
        condition: "If the pixel in left_subgrid at `(r, c)` is white (0) AND the pixel in right_subgrid at `(r, c)` is white (0)."
        result: "Set the pixel in output_grid at `(r, c)` to green (3)."
        otherwise: "The pixel in output_grid at `(r, c)` remains white (0)."
  input_elements_ignored:
    - separator (blue line at column 3)

relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions (height, width) are identical to the left_subgrid's and right_subgrid's dimensions.
  - The value of each pixel in the output grid depends on the values of the spatially corresponding pixels in the left_subgrid and right_subgrid.
