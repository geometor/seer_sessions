Okay, let's analyze this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input grids are 4 rows by 7 columns. They consistently feature a vertical line of blue pixels (color 1) in the 4th column (index 3). This blue line appears to act as a separator, dividing the grid into two main sections: a left section (columns 0-2) and a right section (columns 4-6).
2.  **Left Section Colors:** The left section primarily contains orange (7) and white (0) pixels.
3.  **Right Section Colors:** The right section primarily contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids are 4 rows by 3 columns. This size matches the dimensions of both the left and right sections of the input grid (excluding the blue separator).
5.  **Output Grid Colors:** The output grids contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels.
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to involve a comparison between the left and right sections of the input grid. By observing the examples, it appears that a pixel in the output grid becomes green (3) only if the corresponding pixels in *both* the left section and the right section of the input grid are white (0). If either corresponding input pixel (or both) is non-white, the output pixel is white (0). The blue separator column is ignored in forming the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a 4x7 input grid based on a pixel-wise comparison across a central blue separator."

input_grid:
  type: Grid

    height: 4

  structure:
    - name: separator
      type: Vertical Line
      properties:
        color: blue (1)
        column_index: 3
        height: 4
    - name: left_subgrid
      type: Subgrid

output_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 4
    width: 3
    colors_present: [white (0), green (3)]
    source_relationship: "Derived from comparing left_subgrid and right_subgrid pixel-wise."

transformation:
  actions:
    - identify: the blue vertical separator line (column index 3).
    - extract: the left_subgrid (columns 0-2).
    - extract: the right_subgrid (columns 4-6).
    - create: a new output_grid with dimensions matching the subgrids (4x3), initialized to white (0).
    - iterate: through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `2`.
    - compare: the pixel value at `(r, c)` in left_subgrid and `(r, c)` in right_subgrid (relative indexing within subgrids).
    - apply_rule:
        condition: "If the pixel in left_subgrid at `(r, c)` is white (0) AND the pixel in right_subgrid at `(r, c)` is white (0)."
        result: "Set the pixel in output_grid at `(r, c)` to green (3)."
        otherwise: "The pixel in output_grid at `(r, c)` remains white (0)."
  input_elements_ignored:
    - separator (blue line at column 3)

relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions (height, width) are identical to the left_subgrid's and right_subgrid's dimensions.
  - The value of each pixel in the output grid depends on the values of the spatially corresponding pixels in the left_subgrid and right_subgrid.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the vertical blue line (color 1) in the input grid, which serves as a separator. Note its column index (which is 3).
2.  Extract the subgrid to the left of the separator (columns 0, 1, 2). Call this `left_grid`.
3.  Extract the subgrid to the right of the separator (columns 4, 5, 6). Call this `right_grid`. Both `left_grid` and `right_grid` will have the same dimensions (4x3 in the examples).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as `left_grid` and `right_grid`. Initialize all its pixels to white (0).
5.  For each row index `r` from 0 to height-1 and each column index `c` from 0 to width-1 (where height and width are dimensions of the subgrids):
    a.  Get the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in `left_grid`.
    b.  Get the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in `right_grid`.
    c.  If both the pixel from `left_grid` and the pixel from `right_grid` are white (0), then set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).
    d.  Otherwise, leave the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid as white (0).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
