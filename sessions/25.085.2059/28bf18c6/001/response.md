```python
"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of non-white pixels (the object) in the 
input grid. Determines the minimal bounding box that encloses this object. 
Extracts the subgrid corresponding to this bounding box. Constructs the output 
grid by horizontally concatenating the extracted subgrid with a copy of itself. 
The resulting output grid will have the same height as the bounding box subgrid 
and twice its width.
