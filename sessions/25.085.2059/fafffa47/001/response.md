"""
Transforms a 6x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on a pixel-wise comparison 
of the top 3x3 subgrid and the bottom 3x3 subgrid.

1. Divide the 6x3 input grid into two 3x3 subgrids: the 'Top' grid (rows 0-2) and 
   the 'Bottom' grid (rows 3-5).
2. Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
3. Iterate through each cell position (row, column) from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
4. For the current position (row, column), examine the color of the pixel in the 
   'Top' grid (top_pixel) and the color of the pixel in the 'Bottom' grid (bottom_pixel).
5. Apply the following logic:
   a. If top_pixel is white (0) AND bottom_pixel is white (0), set the 
      corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).
   b. If top_pixel is maroon (9) AND bottom_pixel is blue (1), set the 
      corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
   c. Otherwise (if one pixel is white and the other is non-white), set the 
      corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).
6. The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output.
