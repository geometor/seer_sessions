            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input grid is consistently 6 rows by 3 columns. Each output grid is 3 rows by 3 columns.\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grids seem to be logically divided into two 3x3 sections:\n    *   The top half (rows 0-2) contains pixels of white (0) and maroon (9).\n    *   The bottom half (rows 3-5) contains pixels of white (0) and blue (1).\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain pixels of white (0) and red (2). The size of the output grid (3x3) matches the size of the top and bottom sections of the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Hint:** The structure suggests that the output grid is generated by comparing or combining the top 3x3 section and the bottom 3x3 section of the input grid on a pixel-by-pixel basis.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation:**\n\nLet's denote the top 3x3 input subgrid as `Top` and the bottom 3x3 input subgrid as `Bottom`. Let the output grid be `Output`. We need to find the rule that determines `Output[i, j]` based on `Top[i, j]` and `Bottom[i, j]` for `i` from 0 to 2 and `j` from 0 to 2.\n\n*   **Rule 1 Check (Overlap):** If `Top[i, j]` is maroon (9) and `Bottom[i, j]` is blue (1), what is `Output[i, j]`?\n    *   train_1: (1,1), (1,2) -> U=9, L=1 -> O=0\n    *   train_2: (0,0), (0,2) -> U=9, L=1 -> O=0\n    *   train_3: (1,2), (2,0) -> U=9, L=1 -> O=0\n    *   train_4: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) -> U=9, L=1 -> O=0\n    *   train_5: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) -> U=9, L=1 -> O=0\n    *   *Consistent Result:* If `Top[i, j] == 9` and `Bottom[i, j] == 1`, then `Output[i, j] = 0` (white).\n\n*   **Rule 2 Check (Absence):** If `Top[i, j]` is white (0) and `Bottom[i, j]` is white (0), what is `Output[i, j]`?\n    *   train_1: (0,1), (2,0) -> U=0, L=0 -> O=2\n    *   train_2: (0,1), (2,1) -> U=0, L=0 -> O=2\n    *   train_3: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) -> U=0, L=0 -> O=2\n    *   train_4: (0,0), (0,2) -> U=0, L=0 -> O=2\n    *   train_5: (0,0), (1,0) -> U=0, L=0 -> O=2\n    *   *Consistent Result:* If `Top[i, j] == 0` and `Bottom[i, j] == 0`, then `Output[i, j] = 2` (red).\n\n*   **Rule 3 Check (Others):** What about the remaining cases (`Top=9, Bottom=0` or `Top=0, Bottom=1`)?\n    *   train_1: (0,0 U=0,L=1), (0,2 U=9,L=0), (1,0 U=9,L=0), (2,1 U=9,L=0), (2,2 U=0,L=1) -> All result in O=0.\n    *   train_2: (1,0 U=0,L=1), (1,1 U=9,L=0), (1,2 U=9,L=0), (2,0 U=0,L=1), (2,2 U=9,L=0) -> All result in O=0.\n    *   train_3: (0,1 U=9,L=0), (1,0 U=9,L=0) -> All result in O=0.\n    *   train_4: (0,1 U=9,L=0), (1,0 U=0,L=1), (2,0 U=0,L=1), (2,1 U=9,L=0) -> All result in O=0.\n    *   train_5: (0,2 U=9,L=0), (1,1 U=9,L=0) -> All result in O=0.\n    *   *Consistent Result:* In all other cases (where one pixel is non-white and the other is white), `Output[i, j] = 0` (white).\n\n**Summary of Rules:**\n\n1.  If `Top[i, j] == 9` (maroon) AND `Bottom[i, j] == 1` (blue), then `Output[i, j] = 0` (white).\n2.  If `Top[i, j] == 0` (white) AND `Bottom[i, j] == 0` (white), then `Output[i, j] = 2` (red).\n3.  Otherwise, `Output[i, j] = 0` (white).\n\n**Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.\n3.  Iterate through each cell position `(row, column)` from `(0, 0)` to `(2, 2)`.\n4.  For the current position `(row, column)`, examine the color of the pixel in the 'Top' grid (`top_pixel`) and the color of the pixel in the 'Bottom' grid (`bottom_pixel`).\n5.  Apply the following logic:\n    a.  If `top_pixel` is white (0) AND `bottom_pixel` is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).\n    b.  If `top_pixel` is maroon (9) AND `bottom_pixel` is blue (1), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n    c.  Otherwise (if one pixel is white and the other is non-white), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).\n6.  The resulting 3x3 grid is the final output."
