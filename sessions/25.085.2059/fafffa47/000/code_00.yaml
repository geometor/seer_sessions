Task: Compare two patterns within the input grid to generate an output grid.

Input Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 6x3
  - Structure: Logically divided into two 3x3 subgrids.
  - Top Subgrid (Rows 0-2): Contains white (0) and maroon (9) pixels. Represents 'Pattern A'.
  - Bottom Subgrid (Rows 3-5): Contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. Represents 'Pattern B'.

Output Grid Properties:
  - Dimensions: 3x3
  - Content: Contains white (0) and red (2) pixels.

Transformation Rules (Pixel-wise comparison):
  - Compare the pixel at `(r, c)` in the Top Subgrid with the pixel at `(r, c)` in the Bottom Subgrid (where `r` and `c` range from 0 to 2).
  - Rule 1: If Top pixel is maroon (9) AND Bottom pixel is blue (1), the output pixel is white (0). (No overlap)
  - Rule 2: If Top pixel is white (0) AND Bottom pixel is white (0), the output pixel is red (2). (Mutual absence)
  - Rule 3: In all other combinations (maroon/white or white/blue), the output pixel is white (0). (Partial presence)
