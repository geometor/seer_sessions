The output grids contain white (0), azure (8), and blue (1) pixels.\n3.  **Azure Pixels:** In the input, the azure (8) pixels form distinct shapes. These shapes appear to be L-shapes made of 3 azure pixels (a 2x2 square missing one corner).\n4.  **Blue Pixels:** The blue (1) pixels appear only in the output grid. They always occupy positions that were white (0) in the input grid.\n5.  **Location of Blue Pixels:** The blue pixels appear consistently in the \"inner corner\" or \"concave\" part of the azure L-shapes present in the input.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying specific white pixels based on their adjacency to azure pixels and changing their color to blue. All azure pixels remain unchanged. All other white pixels also remain unchanged.\n7.  **Adjacency Rule:** A white (0) pixel is changed to blue (1) if and only if it has *both* a vertical neighbor (up or down) that is azure (8) *and* a horizontal neighbor (left or right) that is azure (8).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
