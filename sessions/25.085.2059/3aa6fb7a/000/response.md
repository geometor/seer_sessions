Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids in both examples are 7x7.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), azure (8), and blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Azure Pixels:** In the input, the azure (8) pixels form distinct shapes. These shapes appear to be L-shapes made of 3 azure pixels (a 2x2 square missing one corner).
4.  **Blue Pixels:** The blue (1) pixels appear only in the output grid. They always occupy positions that were white (0) in the input grid.
5.  **Location of Blue Pixels:** The blue pixels appear consistently in the "inner corner" or "concave" part of the azure L-shapes present in the input.
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be identifying specific white pixels based on their adjacency to azure pixels and changing their color to blue. All azure pixels remain unchanged. All other white pixels also remain unchanged.
7.  **Adjacency Rule:** A white (0) pixel is changed to blue (1) if and only if it has *both* a vertical neighbor (up or down) that is azure (8) *and* a horizontal neighbor (left or right) that is azure (8).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Identify white cells that form the inner corner of an L-shape made of azure cells and change their color to blue.
grid_properties:
  - size_in: [7, 7]
  - size_out: [7, 7]
  - colors_in: [0, 8] # white, azure
  - colors_out: [0, 1, 8] # white, blue, azure
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    color: 8 # azure
    description: Forms L-shapes (3 pixels in a 2x2 area).
  - type: pixel
    color: 0 # white
    description: Background color, some instances are candidates for transformation.
  - type: pixel
    color: 1 # blue
    description: Result color for transformed white pixels. Appears only in output.
actions:
  - action: change_color
    input_color: 0 # white
    output_color: 1 # blue
    condition: |
      The white pixel must have at least one azure (8) neighbor
      in the vertical direction (up or down) AND at least one
      azure (8) neighbor in the horizontal direction (left or right).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation rule depends on the horizontal and vertical adjacency of white pixels to azure pixels.
  - type: preservation
    description: Azure (8) pixels from the input are preserved in the output. White (0) pixels not meeting the transformation condition are also preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid by its row and column index.
3.  For each cell, check if its color is white (0).
4.  If the cell is white (0):
    a.  Check its neighbors (up, down, left, right), taking care to handle grid boundaries.
    b.  Determine if there is at least one azure (8) neighbor in the vertical direction (up or down).
    c.  Determine if there is at least one azure (8) neighbor in the horizontal direction (left or right).
    d.  If *both* conditions (4b and 4c) are true, change the color of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to blue (1).
5.  If the cell is not white (0) initially, or if the conditions in step 4 are not met, the corresponding cell in the output grid keeps its original color (copied in step 1).
6.  Return the final output grid.
