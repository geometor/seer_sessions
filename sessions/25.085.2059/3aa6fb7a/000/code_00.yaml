task_description: Identify white cells that form the inner corner of an L-shape made of azure cells and change their color to blue.
grid_properties:
  - size_in: [7, 7]
  - size_out: [7, 7]
  - colors_in: [0, 8] # white, azure
  - colors_out: [0, 1, 8] # white, blue, azure
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    color: 8 # azure
    description: Forms L-shapes (3 pixels in a 2x2 area).
  - type: pixel
    color: 0 # white
    description: Background color, some instances are candidates for transformation.
  - type: pixel
    color: 1 # blue
    description: Result color for transformed white pixels. Appears only in output.
actions:
  - action: change_color
    input_color: 0 # white
    output_color: 1 # blue
    condition: |
      The white pixel must have at least one azure (8) neighbor
      in the vertical direction (up or down) AND at least one
      azure (8) neighbor in the horizontal direction (left or right).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The transformation rule depends on the horizontal and vertical adjacency of white pixels to azure pixels.
  - type: preservation
    description: Azure (8) pixels from the input are preserved in the output. White (0) pixels not meeting the transformation condition are also preserved.
