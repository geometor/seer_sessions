Task: Gravity Simulation on Objects

Priors:
  - Objectness: Pixels of the same color connected adjacently (not diagonally) form distinct objects.
  - Geometry: Objects have shapes that are preserved during transformation.
  - Topology: Adjacency defines objects and determines stopping conditions for movement (contact).

Observations:
  - Grid: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Background: White pixels (0) represent empty space through which objects can move.
  - Static Elements: Azure pixels (8) act as static ground or obstacles; they do not move.
  - Mobile Objects:
    - Definition: Contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color, excluding white (0) and azure (8).
    - Colors Observed: Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3), Yellow(4), Gray(5), Magenta(6). (Maroon(9) and Orange(7) were not in examples but assumed mobile based on initial description).
    - Behavior: These objects "fall" downwards.
    - Property Preservation: Objects maintain their original shape and internal pixel arrangement during the fall.
  - Movement:
    - Direction: Strictly downwards.
    - Mechanism: Objects move as single units.
    - Stopping Condition: An object stops falling when any pixel at its bottom edge is directly above a non-white pixel (either part of another object or an azure pixel) or when it reaches the bottom row of the grid.
  - Simulation Process:
    - Iteration: The falling process seems to happen iteratively until no object can move further down in a complete pass.
    - Order: The order in which objects fall matters (as seen in Example 1 where the final stack order differs from pixel-based gravity). Objects lower down or those that can fall furthest might move first, or a simultaneous step-wise approach might be used. The expected outputs suggest a stable stacking, implying lower objects settle before higher ones fall onto them.

Discrepancy with Previous Code:
  - The previous code moved individual pixels, breaking object integrity.
  - The final resting positions in the previous code's output do not match the expected stable stacking of objects.
