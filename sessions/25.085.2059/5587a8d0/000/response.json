            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid size is different from the input grid size in the first two examples but the same in the third. The output grid size appears to depend on the *number* of distinct non-background colors present in the input.\n2.  **Background Color:** In all examples, the orange color (7) is the most frequent color in the input and seems to act as a background, being completely absent in the output.\n3.  **Non-Background Colors:** The output grid is constructed using the non-background colors found in the input.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The non-background colors form distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same color). The *size* of these objects seems crucial. Specifically, the size of the largest contiguous block for each color matters.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit a layered or nested square structure. The colors are arranged concentrically, radiating outwards from the center.\n6.  **Color Ordering:** The order of colors in the output layers seems determined by the size of the corresponding objects in the input. The color forming the largest object appears on the outermost layer (border), the color forming the second-largest object forms the next layer inside, and so on, until the color forming the smallest object occupies the center pixel(s).\n7.  **Output Grid Sizing Rule:** If 'N' is the number of distinct non-background colors, the output grid dimensions appear to be (2N - 1) x (2N - 1).\n    *   Example 1: N=2 (Yellow, Magenta). Output size = (2*2 - 1) = 3x3.\n    *   Example 2: N=3 (Blue, Azure, Gray). Output size = (2*3 - 1) = 5x5.\n    *   Example 3: N=4 (Azure, White, Green, Maroon). Output size = (2*4 - 1) = 7x7.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
