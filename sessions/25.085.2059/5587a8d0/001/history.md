Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid size is different from the input grid size in the first two examples but the same in the third. The output grid size appears to depend on the *number* of distinct non-background colors present in the input.
2.  **Background Color:** In all examples, the orange color (7) is the most frequent color in the input and seems to act as a background, being completely absent in the output.
3.  **Non-Background Colors:** The output grid is constructed using the non-background colors found in the input.
4.  **Object Identification:** The non-background colors form distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same color). The *size* of these objects seems crucial. Specifically, the size of the largest contiguous block for each color matters.
5.  **Output Structure:** The output grids exhibit a layered or nested square structure. The colors are arranged concentrically, radiating outwards from the center.
6.  **Color Ordering:** The order of colors in the output layers seems determined by the size of the corresponding objects in the input. The color forming the largest object appears on the outermost layer (border), the color forming the second-largest object forms the next layer inside, and so on, until the color forming the smallest object occupies the center pixel(s).
7.  **Output Grid Sizing Rule:** If 'N' is the number of distinct non-background colors, the output grid dimensions appear to be (2N - 1) x (2N - 1).
    *   Example 1: N=2 (Yellow, Magenta). Output size = (2*2 - 1) = 3x3.
    *   Example 2: N=3 (Blue, Azure, Gray). Output size = (2*3 - 1) = 5x5.
    *   Example 3: N=4 (Azure, White, Green, Maroon). Output size = (2*4 - 1) = 7x7.

transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Identify the most frequent color in the input grid.
    result: This is the background color.
  - step: 2
    action: Find all contiguous blocks of pixels that are not the background color.
    details: Use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  - step: 3
    action: Determine the set of unique non-background colors present.
    result: Count the number of unique colors (N).
  - step: 4
    action: For each unique non-background color, find the size (pixel count) of its largest contiguous block in the input grid.
  - step: 5
    action: Sort the unique non-background colors based on their corresponding largest block sizes, in descending order.
    result: A sorted list of colors [C1, C2, ..., CN].
  - step: 6
    action: Calculate the output grid dimensions as (2N - 1) x (2N - 1).
  - step: 7
    action: Create the output grid.
  - step: 8
    action: Fill the output grid layer by layer, starting from the outermost layer (layer 0) and moving inwards.
    details: Layer 'k' (where k=0 is the outermost border, k=1 is the next layer in, etc.) is filled with the color C(k+1) from the sorted list. The innermost layer (k = N-1) corresponds to the center pixel(s) and is filled with color CN.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Background:** Find the color that appears most frequently in the input grid; this is the background color.
2.  **Identify and Size Objects:** Locate all contiguous groups (objects) of pixels that are *not* the background color. For each distinct non-background color found, determine the size (number of pixels) of its largest contiguous object.
3.  **Count and Sort Colors:** Count the number of distinct non-background colors (let this be N). Create a list of these distinct colors and sort them in descending order based on the largest object size found for each color in the previous step. Let the sorted colors be C1 (largest object), C2 (second largest), ..., CN (smallest object).
4.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the size of the output grid, which will be square with dimensions (2N - 1) x (2N - 1).
5.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the calculated dimensions. Fill this grid concentrically, layer by layer, starting from the outside:
    *   Fill the outermost border (layer 0) with color C1.
    *   Fill the next layer immediately inside the border (layer 1) with color C2.
    *   Continue filling subsequent inner layers (layer k) with the corresponding color C(k+1).
    *   Fill the centermost pixel (layer N-1) with the color CN.
