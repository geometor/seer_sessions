task_description: Move all non-white pixels down by one row.
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - background_color: white (0) is the default background.
objects:
  - definition: Contiguous block(s) of non-white pixels.
  - properties:
      - color: Preserved during transformation.
      - shape: Preserved during transformation.
      - location: Changes during transformation.
actions:
  - name: translate
  - direction: down
  - distance: 1 row
  - target: all non-white pixels
  - effect:
      - original positions of non-white pixels become white (0) in the output.
      - new positions (row + 1, col) receive the original color of the non-white pixels.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_mapping
  - rule: Input pixel at (row, col) maps to output pixel at (row + 1, col) if the input pixel is not white. Otherwise, the output pixel defaults to white.
constraints:
  - Assumes movement does not cause pixels to go outside the grid boundaries (implied by the examples, but should be verified with more complex cases if available).
