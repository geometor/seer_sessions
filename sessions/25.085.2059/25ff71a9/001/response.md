Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized with white (0).
Iterate through each cell of the input grid. 
If a cell's color is not white (0), copy its color to the cell directly below it (row + 1, same column) in the output grid, provided the new row is within the grid boundaries.
