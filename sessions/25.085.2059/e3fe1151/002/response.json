            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial Python code successfully implemented the transformation logic derived from the first example. However, testing against the second and third examples revealed that the logic was incomplete. Specifically, the rule for changing orange pixels based on their neighbors needs refinement. The original rule (\"if gray neighbor, change to white, else change to gray\") does not hold true for examples 2 and 3. The presence of other neighbor colors influences the output color in a more complex way than initially observed. The strategy is to analyze the relationship between the orange pixel, its neighbors, and the resulting output color across all three examples to deduce the correct, more general rule.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 5x5.\n*   **Central Cross:** The central row (index 2) and central column (index 2) remain unchanged in all examples.\n*   **Affected Pixels:** Only orange (7) pixels located *outside* the central cross change color.\n*   **Neighbor Influence:** The color change depends on the colors of the 8 neighboring pixels.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Discrepancies:**\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input (1,1) is Orange (7). Neighbors (excluding self): {8, 9, 7, 3, 7, 7, 8, 7}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {8, 9, 3}. No gray (5) neighbor. Expected output: Red (2). Code output: Gray (5).\n    *   Input (1,3) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {9, 8}. No gray (5) neighbor. Expected output: Red (2). Code output: Gray (5).\n    *   Input (3,1) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 9, 2, 9}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {8, 9, 2}. No gray (5) neighbor. Expected output: Green (3). Code output: Gray (5).\n    *   Input (3,3) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 9, 2, 9}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {8, 9, 2}. No gray (5) neighbor. Expected output: Green (3). Code output: Gray (5).\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input (1,3) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {7, 4, 5, 3, 7, 4, 3, 7}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {4, 5, 3}. Gray (5) neighbor exists. Expected output: Yellow (4). Code output: White (0).\n    *   Input (3,1) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {5, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 3, 4}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {5, 4, 3}. Gray (5) neighbor exists. Expected output: Yellow (4). Code output: White (0).\n    *   Input (4,4) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {3, 5, 7, 4, 7}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {3, 5, 4}. Gray (5) neighbor exists. Expected output: Yellow (4). Code output: White (0).\n    *   Note: Input (0,0) is Orange (7). Neighbors: {4, 3, 4}. Unique non-orange neighbors: {4, 3}. No gray (5) neighbor. Expected output: Gray (5). Code output: Gray(5). (This case worked).\n\n**Revised Rule Deduction:**\n\nBased on analyzing all examples:\n\n1.  The transformation applies only to orange (7) pixels outside the central cross (middle row and column).\n2.  Examine the 8 neighbors of such an orange pixel.\n3.  **Check for a gray (5) neighbor:**\n    *   **If a gray (5) neighbor exists:**\n        *   Check if a yellow (4) neighbor also exists.\n        *   If yes (both gray and yellow neighbors exist), the orange pixel becomes yellow (4). (Seen in Ex 3)\n        *   If no (gray neighbor exists, but no yellow neighbor), the orange pixel becomes white (0). (Seen in Ex 1)\n    *   **If no gray (5) neighbor exists:**\n        *   Check if a red (2) neighbor exists.\n        *   If yes, the orange pixel becomes green (3). (Seen in Ex 2)\n        *   If no red (2) neighbor exists, check if a maroon (9) neighbor exists.\n        *   If yes, the orange pixel becomes red (2). (Seen in Ex 2)\n        *   If no red (2) or maroon (9) neighbor exists, check if a blue (1) or azure (8) neighbor exists.\n        *   If yes, the orange pixel becomes gray (5). (Seen in Ex 1)\n        *   If none of the above specific neighbors (gray, red, maroon, blue, azure) exist, check if both yellow (4) and green (3) neighbors exist.\n        *   If yes, the orange pixel becomes gray (5). (Seen in Ex 3 (0,0))\n        *   (Implicitly, if none of these conditions are met, the pixel might remain orange, although this case isn't observed in the examples).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
