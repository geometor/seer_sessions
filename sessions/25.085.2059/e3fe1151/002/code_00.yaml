task_description: Modify orange pixels based on neighbor colors, leaving a central cross unchanged.
grid_properties:
  - size: All examples use 5x5 grids.
  - structure: A central cross (middle row and middle column) acts as a static background/frame.
objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - role: Can be part of the central cross (static) or outside (potentially dynamic).
transformation_focus:
  - target: Orange (7) pixels located outside the central cross.
actions:
  - name: ChangeColor
    target: Orange (7) pixels outside the central cross.
    conditions_and_outcomes:
      - condition: Pixel has at least one gray (5) neighbor.
        sub_conditions:
          - condition: Pixel also has at least one yellow (4) neighbor.
            outcome: Change pixel to yellow (4).
          - condition: Pixel does NOT have a yellow (4) neighbor.
            outcome: Change pixel to white (0).
      - condition: Pixel has NO gray (5) neighbors.
        sub_conditions_priority: # Evaluated in order
          - condition: Pixel has at least one red (2) neighbor.
            outcome: Change pixel to green (3).
          - condition: Pixel has at least one maroon (9) neighbor.
            outcome: Change pixel to red (2).
          - condition: Pixel has at least one blue (1) or azure (8) neighbor.
            outcome: Change pixel to gray (5).
          - condition: Pixel has at least one yellow (4) AND at least one green (3) neighbor.
            outcome: Change pixel to gray (5).
    fallback: If none of the above conditions are met for an orange pixel outside the cross, it remains unchanged (though this specific scenario is not present in the provided examples).
  - name: KeepColor
    target: All pixels in the central cross.
    outcome: Pixel color remains unchanged.
  - name: KeepColor
    target: All non-orange pixels outside the central cross.
    outcome: Pixel color remains unchanged.
