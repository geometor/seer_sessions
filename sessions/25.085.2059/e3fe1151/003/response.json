Identify the central row and central column. Pixels in this cross remain unchanged.\n2.  Iterate through pixels outside the central cross.\n3.  If an outside pixel is orange (7):\n    a.  Examine its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal).\n    b.  Check for a gray (5) neighbor:\n        i.  If a gray (5) neighbor exists AND a yellow (4) neighbor also exists, change the pixel to yellow (4).\n        ii. If a gray (5) neighbor exists BUT NO yellow (4) neighbor exists, change the pixel to white (0).\n    c.  If NO gray (5) neighbor exists:\n        i.  Check for a red (2) neighbor. If present, change the pixel to green (3).\n        ii. Else, check for a maroon (9) neighbor. If present, change the pixel to red (2).\n        iii. Else, check for a blue (1) or azure (8) neighbor. If present, change the pixel to gray (5).\n        iv. Else, check if BOTH a yellow (4) AND a green (3) neighbor exist. If present, change the pixel to gray (5).\n        v.  Otherwise, the orange pixel remains unchanged.\n4.  Pixels outside the central cross that are not orange remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the values of the 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) of a cell at (r, c).\n    Handles boundary conditions by excluding coordinates outside the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the grid.\n        r: The row index of the cell.\n        c: The column index of the cell.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of neighbor cell values.\n    \"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for dr in range(-1, 2):\n        for dc in range(-1, 2):\n            # Skip the cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check if the neighbor coordinates are within the grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbors.append(grid[nr, nc])\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the refined transformation rule to the input grid based on neighbor analysis of orange pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists or numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    \n    # Determine the indices of the central row and column\n    center_row = height // 2\n    center_col = width // 2\n    \n    # Define the color codes for clarity\n    ORANGE = 7\n    GRAY = 5\n    WHITE = 0\n    YELLOW = 4\n    RED = 2\n    GREEN = 3\n    MAROON = 9\n    BLUE = 1\n    AZURE = 8\n    \n    # Iterate through each pixel of the grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Skip pixels that are part of the central cross\n            if r == center_row or c == center_col:\n                continue\n                \n            # Check if the current pixel is orange\n            if input_np[r, c] == ORANGE:\n                # Get the values of the 8 neighbors\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_np, r, c)\n                # Use a set for efficient checking of neighbor presence\n                neighbor_set = set(neighbors)\n                \n                # Check condition 3b: Gray neighbor present?\n                if GRAY in neighbor_set:\n                    # Check condition 3b.i: Yellow neighbor also present?\n                    if YELLOW in neighbor_set:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = YELLOW\n                    # Check condition 3b.ii: Gray present, but no Yellow\n                    else:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = WHITE\n                # Check condition 3c: No Gray neighbor\n                else:\n                    # Check condition 3c.i: Red neighbor present?\n                    if RED in neighbor_set:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = GREEN\n                    # Check condition 3c.ii: No Red, but Maroon neighbor present?\n                    elif MAROON in neighbor_set:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = RED\n                    # Check condition 3c.iii: No Red/Maroon, but Blue or Azure present?\n                    elif BLUE in neighbor_set or AZURE in neighbor_set:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = GRAY\n                    # Check condition 3c.iv: No Red/Maroon/Blue/Azure, but Yellow AND Green present?\n                    elif YELLOW in neighbor_set and GREEN in neighbor_set:\n                         output_grid[r, c] = GRAY\n                    # Condition 3c.v: Otherwise, leave as orange (already copied)\n                    # else: pass \n            # Non-orange pixels outside the cross remain unchanged (already copied)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
