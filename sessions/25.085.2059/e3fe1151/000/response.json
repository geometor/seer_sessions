This cross consists entirely of orange (7) pixels in the input.\n3.  **Stability:** The central orange cross remains unchanged in the output grid. Pixels outside this cross may or may not change.\n4.  **Key Transformation:** The primary transformation involves orange (7) pixels located *outside* the central cross.\n5.  **Conditional Change:** These external orange pixels change based on their neighboring pixels (including diagonals).\n    *   An orange (7) pixel changes to gray (5) if none of its 8 neighbors are gray (5).\n    *   An orange (7) pixel changes to white (0) if at least one of its 8 neighbors is gray (5).\n6.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels (non-orange pixels outside the central cross) remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
