grid:
  size: 5x5
structure:
  - type: cross
    color: orange # 7
    location: central row (index 2) and central column (index 2)
    behavior: static (remains unchanged)
pixels_of_interest:
  - color: orange # 7
    location: outside the central cross
    behavior: conditional transformation based on neighbors
transformation_rule:
  - condition: pixel is orange (7) AND located outside the central cross
    actions:
      - if: any neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) is gray (5)
        change_pixel_to: white (0)
      - else: # no neighbor is gray (5)
        change_pixel_to: gray (5)
  - condition: pixel is NOT orange (7) AND located outside the central cross
    actions:
      - change_pixel_to: original color (no change)
  - condition: pixel is part of the central cross
    actions:
      - change_pixel_to: original color (no change)
neighbor_definition: 8 adjacent cells (orthogonal and diagonal)
