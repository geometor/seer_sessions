Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 9 and a width of 5. They are visually divided into three distinct horizontal sections:
    *   A top section (rows 0-3) containing red (2) and white (0) pixels.
    *   A single middle row (row 4) consisting entirely of yellow (4) pixels, acting as a separator.
    *   A bottom section (rows 5-8) containing blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have a height of 4 and a width of 5. These dimensions exactly match the top section of the input grid. The output grids contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels.
3.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Input uses white (0), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4).
    *   Output uses white (0) and green (3).
4.  **Transformation Relationship:** The transformation appears to combine information from the top and bottom sections of the input grid to produce the output grid. The yellow separator line is discarded. The output grid's structure mirrors the input's top section.
5.  **Pixel-level Logic:** Comparing corresponding positions in the input's top section, input's bottom section, and the output grid suggests a rule: A pixel in the output grid at position `(r, c)` becomes green (3) if *either* the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input's top section is red (2) *or* the pixel at the corresponding position `(r + 5, c)` in the input's bottom section is blue (1). If neither of these conditions is met, the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Combine information from two distinct sections of the input grid, separated by a specific color line, based on the presence of specific colors in corresponding locations.

input_grid:
  properties:
    height: 9
    width: 5
  components:
    - section: top
      rows: 0-3
      columns: 0-4
      colors_present: [red (2), white (0)]
    - section: separator
      rows: [4]
      columns: 0-4
      colors_present: [yellow (4)]
      role: Delimiter between top and bottom sections
    - section: bottom
      rows: 5-8
      columns: 0-4
      colors_present: [blue (1), white (0)]
      relationship_to_top: Same width, located below separator, offset by 5 rows.

output_grid:
  properties:
    height: 4
    width: 5
    colors_present: [green (3), white (0)]
  relationship_to_input: Dimensions match the input's top section.

transformation_rule:
  type: Pixel-wise combination
  source_sections: [top, bottom] # from input_grid
  target_grid: output_grid
  logic: |
    For each coordinate (r, c) within the dimensions of the output grid (0 <= r < 4, 0 <= c < 5):
    - Let top_pixel_value = input_grid[r, c]
    - Let bottom_pixel_value = input_grid[r + 5, c] # +5 accounts for top section height (4) + separator height (1)
    - If top_pixel_value is red (2) OR bottom_pixel_value is blue (1):
        Set output_grid[r, c] = green (3)
    - Else:
        Set output_grid[r, c] = white (0)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Sections:** Locate the single horizontal row composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This is the separator row.
2.  **Define Regions:**
    *   The "top section" consists of all rows above the separator row.
    *   The "bottom section" consists of all rows below the separator row.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same height and width as the top section, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels.
4.  **Iterate and Combine:** For each row index `r` from 0 up to (height of top section - 1) and each column index `c` from 0 up to (width of top section - 1):
    *   Get the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid's top section. Let this be `top_color`.
    *   Determine the corresponding row index in the bottom section: `bottom_r = r + height_of_top_section + height_of_separator`. In this specific task, this simplifies to `bottom_r = r + 4 + 1 = r + 5`.
    *   Get the color of the pixel at `(bottom_r, c)` in the input grid's bottom section. Let this be `bottom_color`.
    *   **Apply Rule:** If `top_color` is red (2) OR `bottom_color` is blue (1), set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).
5.  **Finalize:** The resulting grid after iterating through all positions is the final output.
