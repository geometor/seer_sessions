            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 9 and a width of 5. They are visually divided into three distinct horizontal sections:\n    *   A top section (rows 0-3) containing red (2) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   A single middle row (row 4) consisting entirely of yellow (4) pixels, acting as a separator.\n    *   A bottom section (rows 5-8) containing blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids consistently have a height of 4 and a width of 5. These dimensions exactly match the top section of the input grid. The output grids contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Input uses white (0), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4).\n    *   Output uses white (0) and green (3).\n4.  **Transformation Relationship:** The transformation appears to combine information from the top and bottom sections of the input grid to produce the output grid. The yellow separator line is discarded. The output grid's structure mirrors the input's top section.\n5.  **Pixel-level Logic:** Comparing corresponding positions in the input's top section, input's bottom section, and the output grid suggests a rule: A pixel in the output grid at position `(r, c)` becomes green (3) if *either* the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input's top section is red (2) *or* the pixel at the corresponding position `(r + 5, c)` in the input's bottom section is blue (1). If neither of these conditions is met, the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
