Identify Sections: Locate the single horizontal row composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This is the separator row.\n2.  Define Regions:\n    *   The \"top section\" consists of all rows above the separator row.\n    *   The \"bottom section\" consists of all rows below the separator row.\n3.  Initialize Output: Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same height and width as the top section, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels.\n4.  Iterate and Combine: For each row index `r` from 0 up to (height of top section - 1) and each column index `c` from 0 up to (width of top section - 1):\n    *   Get the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid's top section.\n    *   Determine the corresponding row index in the bottom section: `bottom_r = r + height_of_top_section + height_of_separator` (which simplifies to `r + 5` in this task).\n    *   Get the color of the pixel at `(bottom_r, c)` in the input grid's bottom section.\n    *   Apply Rule: If the top section pixel color is red (2) OR the bottom section pixel color is blue (1), set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to green (3).\n5.
