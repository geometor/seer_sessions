**Perception**

The task involves transforming a 7x7 input grid into a 6x6 output grid. Across all provided examples, the transformation consistently involves removing the first row and the first column of the input grid. The remaining subgrid, starting from the second row and second column of the input (index 1,1), becomes the output grid, with all pixel colors and their relative positions preserved. Colors present only in the first row or first column of the input (like orange, red, magenta in the examples) do not appear in the output.

    rule: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, specifically the subgrid obtained by excluding the first row and the first column.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid by selecting all rows starting from the second row (index 1) to the last row of the input grid.
3.  From this new grid, select all columns starting from the second column (index 1) to the last column.
4.  The resulting grid is the final output.
