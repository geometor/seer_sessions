Across all provided examples, the transformation consistently involves removing the first row and the first column of the input grid. The remaining subgrid, starting from the second row and second column of the input (index 1,1), becomes the output grid, with all pixel colors and their relative positions preserved. Colors present only in the first row or first column of the input (like orange, red, magenta in the examples) do not appear in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
