1. Identify the sequence of colors present in the first row (index 0) of the input grid.
2. Identify the gray separator row at index 1 of the input grid.
3. Create the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. Copy the first row (containing the color sequence) and the second row (the gray separator) from the input grid to the first two rows of the output grid.
5. Determine the number of colors in the sequence, N.
6. Determine the width of the grid, W.
7. For each subsequent row in the output grid, starting from row index 2 up to the last row:
   a. Calculate the index `idx` for the color sequence using the formula: `idx = (current_row_index - 2) % N`.
   b. Select the color at `ColorSequence[idx]`.
   c. Fill the entire current row of the output grid (all W columns) with the selected color.
