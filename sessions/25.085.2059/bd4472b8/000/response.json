A top row (row index 0) containing a sequence of different colors.\n        2.  A second row (row index 1) composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5), acting as a separator.\n        3.  The remaining rows below the separator, initially filled with white pixels (color 0).\n    *   The output grids retain the first two rows from the input unchanged.\n    *   The rows below the gray separator in the output are filled based on the color sequence found in the first row of the input.\n    *   Each output row below the separator is filled entirely with a single color.\n    *   The colors used to fill these rows cycle through the sequence defined in the first input row.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
