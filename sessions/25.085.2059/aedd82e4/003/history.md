The metrics confirm the hypothesis: the number of red pixels with no *adjacent* (cardinal direction) red neighbors exactly matches the number of blue pixels in the expected output for all four examples.

**YAML Facts Generation:**
Based on the confirmed hypothesis.

**Natural Language Program Update:**
Reflect the new rule based on 4-neighbor adjacency.**General Assessment**

The initial code successfully identified the core colors involved (red, white, blue) and the action (changing red to blue). However, the condition for this change ("isolated" red pixel) was based on an incomplete understanding derived only from the first example. The original definition of isolation (all 8 neighbors are white) proved too strict when tested against examples 3 and 4, where red pixels with non-white neighbors (specifically, other red pixels in diagonal positions) were expected to change. The code failed because it correctly kept these pixels red according to its flawed rule.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the definition of "isolation" by comparing the input pixels that change color with those that don't across all examples, paying close attention to their neighboring pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Modify a grid by changing the color of specific red pixels to blue based on their local neighborhood.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Vary between examples (e.g., 5x4, 4x4, 3x3).
  - colors_present_input: Primarily white (0) and red (2).
  - colors_present_output: Primarily white (0), red (2), and blue (1).
objects:
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9), representing white, red, blue, etc.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - neighbors: Adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) and diagonal pixels.
actions:
  - name: Color Change
    input_object: Red pixel (color 2)
    output_object: Blue pixel (color 1)
    condition: The red pixel must not have any red neighbors in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The state of diagonal neighbors or neighbors of other colors does not affect the condition.
    scope: Apply to each pixel individually. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. Pixels that do not meet the condition retain their original color.
observations_from_metrics:
  - All red pixels that change to blue satisfy the condition of having no adjacent (4-direction) red neighbors ('4_neighbor_isolated': true).
  - All red pixels that do *not* change to blue violate the condition, meaning they have at least one adjacent (4-direction) red neighbor ('4_neighbor_isolated': false).
  - The failed examples (3 and 4) show that the previous code failed specifically on red pixels that *should* have changed (i.e., they meet the 4-neighbor isolation condition) but were incorrectly evaluated by the old 8-neighbor rule.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row `r` and column `c`.
3.  If the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` is red (2):
    a.  Check its neighbors in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right): `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`.
    b.  Ensure neighbor coordinates are within the grid boundaries before checking their color.
    c.  Determine if *any* of these valid cardinal neighbors are also red (2).
    d.  If **none** of the valid cardinal neighbors are red, change the color of the corresponding pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output grid* to blue (1).
4.  If the input pixel is not red, or if it is red but has at least one adjacent red neighbor, keep its original color in the output grid (which is already handled by the initial copy).
