The input grid contains three non-black pixels: a green pixel (3) at (0,0), another green pixel (3) at (0,1), an azure pixel (8) at (0,2), an orange pixel (7) at (1,1), and a gray pixel (5) at (2,0). The remaining pixels are black (0).\n\nThe output grid also contains the same non-black pixels, but their positions have changed. The gray pixel (5) is now at (0,2), the orange pixel (7) is at (1,1) (same position), one green pixel (3) is at (1,2), another green pixel (3) is at (2,1), and the azure pixel (8) is at (2,0). The background remains black (0).\n\nComparing the positions:\n*   Green (3) at (0,0) in input -> Azure (8) at (2,0) in output\n*   Green (3) at (0,1) in input -> Green (3) at (2,1) in output\n*   Azure (8) at (0,2) in input -> Gray (5) at (2,2) in output (wait, the output has gray 5 at 0,2, not 2,2.
