task_type: geometric_transformation
grid_properties:
  - size_input: 3x3
  - size_output: 3x3
  - size_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    definition: each cell in the grid can be considered an independent object for this transformation.
    colors_present_input: [black, green, azure, orange, gray] # [0, 3, 8, 7, 5]
    colors_present_output: [black, green, azure, orange, gray] # [0, 3, 8, 7, 5]
    color_relation: colors are preserved during the transformation.
transformation:
  type: rotation
  subtype: 180 degrees
  scope: applies uniformly to every pixel in the input grid.
  center: center of the grid.
  mapping: a pixel at input coordinates (row, column) moves to output coordinates (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - column).
background:
  color: black (0)
  role: treated the same as any other pixel during the transformation.
