Okay, I will analyze the provided example pair and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

The input and output are both 3x3 grids. The input grid contains three non-black pixels: a green pixel (3) at (0,0), another green pixel (3) at (0,1), an azure pixel (8) at (0,2), an orange pixel (7) at (1,1), and a gray pixel (5) at (2,0). The remaining pixels are black (0).

The output grid also contains the same non-black pixels, but their positions have changed. The gray pixel (5) is now at (0,2), the orange pixel (7) is at (1,1) (same position), one green pixel (3) is at (1,2), another green pixel (3) is at (2,1), and the azure pixel (8) is at (2,0). The background remains black (0).

Comparing the positions:
*   Green (3) at (0,0) in input -> Azure (8) at (2,0) in output
*   Green (3) at (0,1) in input -> Green (3) at (2,1) in output
*   Azure (8) at (0,2) in input -> Gray (5) at (2,2) in output (wait, the output has gray 5 at 0,2, not 2,2. Let me recheck the output)

**Output Re-check:**

```
0 0 5  (row 0)
0 7 3  (row 1)
8 3 3  (row 2)
```

Okay, the output pixels are:
*   Gray (5) at (0, 2)
*   Orange (7) at (1, 1)
*   Green (3) at (1, 2)
*   Azure (8) at (2, 0)
*   Green (3) at (2, 1)
*   Green (3) at (2, 2)

**Input Re-check:**

```
3 3 8  (row 0)
3 7 0  (row 1)
5 0 0  (row 2)
```

Input pixels are:
*   Green (3) at (0, 0)
*   Green (3) at (0, 1)
*   Azure (8) at (0, 2)
*   Green (3) at (1, 0)
*   Orange (7) at (1, 1)
*   Gray (5) at (2, 0)

**Comparing Input and Output Again:**
*   Input (0,0) Green (3) -> Output (2,2) Green (3)
*   Input (0,1) Green (3) -> Output (2,1) Green (3)
*   Input (0,2) Azure (8) -> Output (2,0) Azure (8)
*   Input (1,0) Green (3) -> Output (1,2) Green (3)
*   Input (1,1) Orange (7) -> Output (1,1) Orange (7)
*   Input (2,0) Gray (5)   -> Output (0,2) Gray (5)
*   Black pixels remain black where applicable after the transformation.

This pattern strongly suggests a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid around its center. For a grid of height H and width W, a pixel at (r, c) moves to (H-1-r, W-1-c).
Let's test this with the example (H=3, W=3):
*   (0,0) -> (3-1-0, 3-1-0) = (2,2) -> Correct (Green 3)
*   (0,1) -> (3-1-0, 3-1-1) = (2,1) -> Correct (Green 3)
*   (0,2) -> (3-1-0, 3-1-2) = (2,0) -> Correct (Azure 8)
*   (1,0) -> (3-1-1, 3-1-0) = (1,2) -> Correct (Green 3)
*   (1,1) -> (3-1-1, 3-1-1) = (1,1) -> Correct (Orange 7)
*   (2,0) -> (3-1-2, 3-1-0) = (0,2) -> Correct (Gray 5)
*   (1,2) -> (3-1-1, 3-1-2) = (1,0) -> Black in input, Black in output (Correct)
*   (2,1) -> (3-1-2, 3-1-1) = (0,1) -> Black in input, Black in output (Correct)
*   (2,2) -> (3-1-2, 3-1-2) = (0,0) -> Black in input, Black in output (Correct)

The transformation is consistently a 180-degree rotation.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: geometric_transformation
grid_properties:
  - size_input: 3x3
  - size_output: 3x3
  - size_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    definition: each cell in the grid can be considered an independent object for this transformation.
    colors_present_input: [black, green, azure, orange, gray] # [0, 3, 8, 7, 5]
    colors_present_output: [black, green, azure, orange, gray] # [0, 3, 8, 7, 5]
    color_relation: colors are preserved during the transformation.
transformation:
  type: rotation
  subtype: 180 degrees
  scope: applies uniformly to every pixel in the input grid.
  center: center of the grid.
  mapping: a pixel at input coordinates (row, column) moves to output coordinates (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - column).
background:
  color: black (0)
  role: treated the same as any other pixel during the transformation.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  For each pixel in the input grid located at coordinates (row, column):
    a.  Calculate the corresponding target coordinates in the output grid as (H - 1 - row, W - 1 - column).
    b.  Copy the color value of the input pixel at (row, column) to the output grid at the calculated target coordinates (H - 1 - row, W - 1 - column).
4.  The resulting grid is the final output.
