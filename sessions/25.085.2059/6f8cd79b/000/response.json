They vary in size (rows and columns).\n2.  **Output Analysis:** The output grids have the exact same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They feature a border of azure (8) pixels encompassing an inner area. The inner area retains the original color from the input, which is white (0) in these examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be identifying the boundary pixels of the input grid and changing their color to azure (8) in the output grid. Pixels not on the boundary retain their original color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
