*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a small grid (3x3 in the provided examples).
    *   The output is a larger grid (9x9 in the provided examples), exactly 3 times larger in both height and width than the input grid.
    *   The colors present in the input grid are directly mapped onto larger areas in the output grid.
    *   The spatial arrangement of the colors is preserved but magnified. Each individual pixel from the input grid appears to be expanded into a 3x3 square of the same color in the output grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    transformation: scaling
    input_grid:
      properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
        - size: H x W (e.g., 3x3)
    output_grid:
      properties:
        - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
        - size: (3 * H) x (3 * W) (e.g., 9x9)
    relationship:
      - rule: Each pixel at position (r, c) in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid.
      - mapping: The color of the input pixel at (r, c) determines the color of all pixels within the output block.
      - output_block_location: The top-left corner of the 3x3 block in the output grid is at position (3 * r, 3 * c).
    scale_factor: 3 (applied to both height and width)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `3*H` by `3*W`.
    3.  For each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` in the input grid:
        a.  Get the color `C` of the pixel at input grid position (`r`, `c`).
        b.  Fill the 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid, where the rows range from `3*r` to `3*r + 2` and the columns range from `3*c` to `3*c + 2`, with the color `C`.
    4.  The resulting grid is the output.
