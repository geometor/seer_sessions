Standard reading order (row by row, left to right) of the input pixels does not match the output order. However, scanning the input grid column by column (top to bottom within each column, then moving left to right across columns) and collecting the non-white pixels precisely matches the order they appear in the output grid (filled row by row, left to right).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
