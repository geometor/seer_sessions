The white pixels (0) in the input seem to be ignored or act as background/separators. The specific non-white pixels from the input are rearranged to form the output.\n3.  **Positional Mapping:** By comparing the positions of the non-white pixels in the input and output across the examples, a specific pattern emerges. The output grid seems to be constructed by selecting pixels from specific locations within the 5x5 input grid.\n    *   The corners of the output grid correspond to the corners of the input grid.\n    *   The center of the output grid corresponds to the center of the input grid.\n    *   The edge pixels (non-corner) of the output grid correspond to the inner \"cross\" pixels of the input grid (specifically, the pixels at input coordinates (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3)).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
