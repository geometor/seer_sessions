Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input grids are always 5x5, and the output grids are always 3x3.
2.  **Pixel Content:** The output grid consists entirely of pixels that were present in the input grid. The white pixels (0) in the input seem to be ignored or act as background/separators. The specific non-white pixels from the input are rearranged to form the output.
3.  **Positional Mapping:** By comparing the positions of the non-white pixels in the input and output across the examples, a specific pattern emerges. The output grid seems to be constructed by selecting pixels from specific locations within the 5x5 input grid.
    *   The corners of the output grid correspond to the corners of the input grid.
    *   The center of the output grid corresponds to the center of the input grid.
    *   The edge pixels (non-corner) of the output grid correspond to the inner "cross" pixels of the input grid (specifically, the pixels at input coordinates (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3)).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Construct a 3x3 output grid by selecting pixels from specific locations in a 5x5 input grid.
grid_properties:
  - input_size: 5x5
  - output_size: 3x3
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9 (white is 0)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
transformation_rule:
  - name: Pixel Selection and Mapping
    details: Select 9 specific pixels from the input grid and place them into the 3x3 output grid according to the following coordinate mapping (input (r,c) -> output (r',c')):
      - Input(0,0) -> Output(0,0)  # Top-left corner
      - Input(0,4) -> Output(0,2)  # Top-right corner
      - Input(4,0) -> Output(2,0)  # Bottom-left corner
      - Input(4,4) -> Output(2,2)  # Bottom-right corner
      - Input(2,2) -> Output(1,1)  # Center
      - Input(1,1) -> Output(0,1)  # Top edge (from top-left inner cross)
      - Input(1,3) -> Output(1,2)  # Right edge (from top-right inner cross)
      - Input(3,1) -> Output(1,0)  # Left edge (from bottom-left inner cross)
      - Input(3,3) -> Output(2,1)  # Bottom edge (from bottom-right inner cross)
ignored_elements:
  - White pixels (value 0) in the input grid, unless they happen to be at one of the 9 selected locations (which is not the case in the examples).
  - Input pixels not located at the 9 specified source coordinates.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty 3x3 output grid.
2.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (0,0) to the output grid at position (0,0).
3.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (0,4) to the output grid at position (0,2).
4.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (4,0) to the output grid at position (2,0).
5.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (4,4) to the output grid at position (2,2).
6.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (2,2) to the output grid at position (1,1).
7.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (1,1) to the output grid at position (0,1).
8.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (1,3) to the output grid at position (1,2).
9.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (3,1) to the output grid at position (1,0).
10. Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (3,3) to the output grid at position (2,1).
11. Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
