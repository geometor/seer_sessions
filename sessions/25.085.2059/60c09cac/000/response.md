Okay, here are the requested deliverables based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, representing colors.
2.  **Dimensional Change:** The output grid is always larger than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid's height and width are exactly double the input grid's height and width.
3.  **Color Mapping:** Colors present in the input grid are also present in the output grid. The background color (white, 0) remains the same.
4.  **Pattern Transformation:** Each individual pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 square block of the *same color* in the output grid. The position of this 2x2 block in the output directly relates to the position of the original pixel in the input. If an input pixel is at row `r` and column `c`, its corresponding 2x2 block in the output occupies rows `2*r` and `2*r + 1`, and columns `2*c` and `2*c + 1`.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Grid Scaling
Input: 
  Type: 2D Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains pixels with color values (0-9).
    - Variable dimensions (height H, width W).
Output:
  Type: 2D Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains pixels with color values (0-9).
    - Dimensions are 2*H (height) and 2*W (width).
Transformation:
  Name: Pixel Expansion / Scaling
  Factor: 2x (both height and width)
  Rule: Each pixel at input coordinates (r, c) is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  Output Block Coordinates: 
    - Top-left: (2*r, 2*c)
    - Top-right: (2*r, 2*c + 1)
    - Bottom-left: (2*r + 1, 2*c)
    - Bottom-right: (2*r + 1, 2*c + 1)
Relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - The color of a pixel in the input determines the color of a 2x2 block in the output.
  - The position of a pixel in the input determines the position of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid whose height is twice the height of the input grid and whose width is twice the width of the input grid.
2.  For each row `r` and column `c` of the input grid:
    a.  Identify the color of the pixel at `(r, c)`.
    b.  In the output grid, set the color of the four pixels at coordinates `(2*r, 2*c)`, `(2*r + 1, 2*c)`, `(2*r, 2*c + 1)`, and `(2*r + 1, 2*c + 1)` to be the same color identified in step 2a.
3.  The resulting output grid is the solution.
