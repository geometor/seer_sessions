            "text": "The code execution confirms the analysis: 4 differing pixels, all located in the Top-Right quadrant. The expected TR quadrant matches a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input, while the generated TR quadrant from the previous code was a horizontal flip.\n\nNow I can formulate the final report.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully implemented a transformation that worked for the first two examples but failed on the third. The failure occurred because the transformation rule for the top-right quadrant was incorrectly inferred from only the first example (horizontal flip) instead of the rule that generalizes across all examples (rotate 90 degrees clockwise).\n\nThe strategy is to update the description of the transformation, specifically correcting the operation applied to create the top-right quadrant of the output grid, and then implement this revised logic. The other quadrant transformations (identity, anti-diagonal reflection, 180-degree rotation) appear correct based on all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Size: 3x3\n- Output Size: 6x6\n- Previous Code Result: Match (0 pixels off)\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Size: 2x2\n- Output Size: 4x4\n- Previous Code Result: Match (0 pixels off)\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input Size: 3x3\n- Output Size: 6x6\n- Previous Code Result: Mismatch (4 pixels off)\n- Error Location: The 4 incorrect pixels were confined to the Top-Right quadrant (rows 0-2, columns 3-5).\n- Specific Differences (Row, Col):\n    - (0, 3): Expected 6 (magenta), Generated 9 (maroon)\n    - (0, 4): Expected 6 (magenta), Generated 9 (maroon)\n    - (1, 5): Expected 9 (maroon), Generated 6 (magenta)\n    - (2, 5): Expected 9 (maroon), Generated 6 (magenta)\n- Analysis: The previous code applied a horizontal flip to the input to generate the Top-Right quadrant. The correct operation, based on analyzing the expected output for Example 3, is a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The other quadrants (Top-Left: Identity, Bottom-Left: Anti-diagonal Reflection, Bottom-Right: 180-degree Rotation) were generated correctly by the previous code.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
