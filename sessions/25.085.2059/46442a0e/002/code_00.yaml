task_description: Create a larger output grid by arranging four different geometric transformations of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
grid_properties:
  - Input grid size is variable (HxW).
  - Output grid size is consistently double the input dimensions (2Hx2W).
  - The output grid is composed of four subgrids (quadrants), each of size HxW.
transformations:
  - The input grid serves as the primary object.
  - Four distinct geometric transformations are applied to the input grid:
    1. Identity (no change)
    2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
    3. Reflect across the anti-diagonal (equivalent to transpose then flip vertically)
    4. Rotate 180 degrees (equivalent to flip horizontally then vertically, or two 90-degree rotations)
layout:
  - The transformed grids are arranged in a 2x2 super-grid:
    - Top-Left Quadrant: Identity transformation of the input grid.
    - Top-Right Quadrant: 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
    - Bottom-Left Quadrant: Anti-diagonal reflection of the input grid.
    - Bottom-Right Quadrant: 180-degree rotation of the input grid.
