If the input is HxW, the output is 2Hx2W.\n2.  **Quadrant Structure**: The output grid appears to be composed of four sub-grids or quadrants, each having the same dimensions as the original input grid.\n3.  **Quadrant Content**: Each quadrant seems to be a geometrically transformed version of the input grid.\n    *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Appears identical to the input grid.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Appears to be the input grid flipped horizontally.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Appears to be the input grid transformed in a way that's consistent across examples but isn't just a simple horizontal or vertical flip. Comparing input `I` and the BL quadrant across examples, it looks like the BL quadrant is the input grid reflected across its anti-diagonal (or equivalently, transposed and then flipped vertically).\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Appears to be the input grid rotated 180 degrees (or flipped horizontally and then vertically).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
