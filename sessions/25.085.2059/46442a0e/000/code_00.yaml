input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: 2 * H
    width: 2 * W
relationship: The output grid is constructed by arranging four transformed versions of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
transformations:
  - name: identity
    description: No change to the input grid.
    placement: Top-Left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1)
  - name: horizontal_flip
    description: Mirror the input grid across its vertical center line.
    placement: Top-Right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2*W-1)
  - name: anti_diagonal_reflection
    description: Reflect the input grid across its anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). This is equivalent to transposing the grid and then flipping it vertically.
    placement: Bottom-Left quadrant (rows H to 2*H-1, cols 0 to W-1)
  - name: rotate_180
    description: Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees. This is equivalent to flipping horizontally and then vertically.
    placement: Bottom-Right quadrant (rows H to 2*H-1, cols W to 2*W-1)
