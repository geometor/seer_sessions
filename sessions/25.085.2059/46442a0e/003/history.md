The transformation takes an input grid of size HxW and produces an output grid of size 2Hx2W.
The output grid is composed of four quadrants, each of size HxW.
Each quadrant contains a transformed version of the input grid:
1. Top-Left (TL): The original input grid (identity).
2. Top-Right (TR): The input grid flipped horizontally.
3. Bottom-Left (BL): The input grid reflected across its anti-diagonal (transposed and then flipped vertically).
4. Bottom-Right (BR): The input grid rotated 180 degrees (flipped horizontally and vertically).

The code execution confirms the analysis: 4 differing pixels, all located in the Top-Right quadrant. The expected TR quadrant matches a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input, while the generated TR quadrant from the previous code was a horizontal flip.

Now I can formulate the final report.## General Assessment

The previous code successfully implemented a transformation that worked for the first two examples but failed on the third. The failure occurred because the transformation rule for the top-right quadrant was incorrectly inferred from only the first example (horizontal flip) instead of the rule that generalizes across all examples (rotate 90 degrees clockwise).

The strategy is to update the description of the transformation, specifically correcting the operation applied to create the top-right quadrant of the output grid, and then implement this revised logic. The other quadrant transformations (identity, anti-diagonal reflection, 180-degree rotation) appear correct based on all examples.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
- Input Size: 3x3
- Output Size: 6x6
- Previous Code Result: Match (0 pixels off)

**Example 2:**
- Input Size: 2x2
- Output Size: 4x4
- Previous Code Result: Match (0 pixels off)

**Example 3:**
- Input Size: 3x3
- Output Size: 6x6
- Previous Code Result: Mismatch (4 pixels off)
- Error Location: The 4 incorrect pixels were confined to the Top-Right quadrant (rows 0-2, columns 3-5).
- Specific Differences (Row, Col):
    - (0, 3): Expected 6 (magenta), Generated 9 (maroon)
    - (0, 4): Expected 6 (magenta), Generated 9 (maroon)
    - (1, 5): Expected 9 (maroon), Generated 6 (magenta)
    - (2, 5): Expected 9 (maroon), Generated 6 (magenta)
- Analysis: The previous code applied a horizontal flip to the input to generate the Top-Right quadrant. The correct operation, based on analyzing the expected output for Example 3, is a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The other quadrants (Top-Left: Identity, Bottom-Left: Anti-diagonal Reflection, Bottom-Right: 180-degree Rotation) were generated correctly by the previous code.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Create a larger output grid by arranging four different geometric transformations of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
grid_properties:
  - Input grid size is variable (HxW).
  - Output grid size is consistently double the input dimensions (2Hx2W).
  - The output grid is composed of four subgrids (quadrants), each of size HxW.
transformations:
  - The input grid serves as the primary object.
  - Four distinct geometric transformations are applied to the input grid:
    1. Identity (no change)
    2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
    3. Reflect across the anti-diagonal (equivalent to transpose then flip vertically)
    4. Rotate 180 degrees (equivalent to flip horizontally then vertically, or two 90-degree rotations)
layout:
  - The transformed grids are arranged in a 2x2 super-grid:
    - Top-Left Quadrant: Identity transformation of the input grid.
    - Top-Right Quadrant: 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
    - Bottom-Left Quadrant: Anti-diagonal reflection of the input grid.
    - Bottom-Right Quadrant: 180-degree rotation of the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input grid of size HxW.
2.  Create an output grid of size 2Hx2W, initialized with a default color (e.g., white/0, though the background color doesn't seem critical as all cells are overwritten).
3.  Calculate four transformed versions of the input grid:
    a.  `transform_TL`: The original input grid (identity).
    b.  `transform_TR`: The input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    c.  `transform_BL`: The input grid reflected across its anti-diagonal (transpose the input grid, then flip the result vertically).
    d.  `transform_BR`: The input grid rotated 180 degrees.
4.  Place these transformed grids into the output grid:
    a.  Copy `transform_TL` into the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    b.  Copy `transform_TR` into the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
    c.  Copy `transform_BL` into the bottom-left quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    d.  Copy `transform_BR` into the bottom-right quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
