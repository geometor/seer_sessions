Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size Transformation**: In all examples, the output grid's dimensions are exactly double the input grid's dimensions (height and width). If the input is HxW, the output is 2Hx2W.
2.  **Quadrant Structure**: The output grid appears to be composed of four sub-grids or quadrants, each having the same dimensions as the original input grid.
3.  **Quadrant Content**: Each quadrant seems to be a geometrically transformed version of the input grid.
    *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Appears identical to the input grid.
    *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Appears to be the input grid flipped horizontally.
    *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Appears to be the input grid transformed in a way that's consistent across examples but isn't just a simple horizontal or vertical flip. Comparing input `I` and the BL quadrant across examples, it looks like the BL quadrant is the input grid reflected across its anti-diagonal (or equivalently, transposed and then flipped vertically).
    *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Appears to be the input grid rotated 180 degrees (or flipped horizontally and then vertically).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: H
    width: W
output_object:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: 2 * H
    width: 2 * W
relationship: The output grid is constructed by arranging four transformed versions of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
transformations:
  - name: identity
    description: No change to the input grid.
    placement: Top-Left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1)
  - name: horizontal_flip
    description: Mirror the input grid across its vertical center line.
    placement: Top-Right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2*W-1)
  - name: anti_diagonal_reflection
    description: Reflect the input grid across its anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). This is equivalent to transposing the grid and then flipping it vertically.
    placement: Bottom-Left quadrant (rows H to 2*H-1, cols 0 to W-1)
  - name: rotate_180
    description: Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees. This is equivalent to flipping horizontally and then vertically.
    placement: Bottom-Right quadrant (rows H to 2*H-1, cols W to 2*W-1)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid. Let its dimensions be H (height) and W (width).
2.  Prepare an output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W, initially empty.
3.  Define four transformation operations based on the input grid:
    a.  `identity`: The original input grid.
    b.  `flip_horizontal`: The input grid flipped horizontally.
    c.  `reflect_anti_diagonal`: The input grid reflected across its anti-diagonal (transpose then flip vertically).
    d.  `rotate_180`: The input grid rotated 180 degrees (flip horizontally then vertically).
4.  Place the transformed grids into the output grid:
    a.  Copy `identity` into the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    b.  Copy `flip_horizontal` into the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
    c.  Copy `reflect_anti_diagonal` into the bottom-left quadrant (rows H to 2*H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    d.  Copy `rotate_180` into the bottom-right quadrant (rows H to 2*H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
5.  Return the resulting output grid.
