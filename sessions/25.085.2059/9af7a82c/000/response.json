            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** The input is a small grid of colored pixels (values 0-9). The output is also a grid of colored pixels, often with different dimensions than the input.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to analyze the frequency of different colors in the input grid and represent this information graphically in the output grid.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid seems to function like a bar chart or histogram.\n    *   Each column in the output corresponds to a unique non-white color present in the input.\n    *   The columns are ordered based on the frequency (count) of their corresponding color in the input, typically from most frequent (left) to least frequent (right).\n    *   The height of the colored portion in each column represents the count of that color in the input grid.\n    *   The pixels below the colored bar in each column, and any empty space, are filled with the background color (white, 0).\n4.  **Dimension Changes:**\n    *   The output grid's width is determined by the number of unique non-white colors found in the input.\n    *   The output grid's height seems calculated based on the maximum frequency count of any color and the input grid's height relative to the number of unique colors. Specifically, `Output Height = Max Frequency Count + max(0, Input Height - Number of Unique Colors + 1)`.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The specific colors from the input (excluding white) are preserved and used to build the \"bars\" in the output histogram. White (0) acts as the background color in the output.\n\n**Facts YAML**\n\n"
