Transformation: Frequency Analysis and Histogram Generation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Contains pixels with color values (0-9).
    - Dimensions vary (Height H_in, Width W_in).
    - May contain multiple instances of the same color.
    - Color 0 (white) is treated as background.

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Represents a histogram of non-white input colors.
    - Dimensions (Height H_out, Width W_out) depend on input analysis.
    - Width (W_out): Equals the count of unique non-white colors in the input.
    - Height (H_out): Calculated as `MaxCount + max(0, H_in - W_out + 1)`, where MaxCount is the highest frequency of any non-white color in the input.
    - Background color: 0 (white).

Process:
  1. Identify_Colors: Find all unique non-white colors in the input grid.
  2. Count_Frequencies: Count the occurrences of each unique non-white color.
  3. Sort_Colors: Order the unique colors based on their frequencies in descending order. (Tie-breaking rule not explicitly required by examples, could default to color value if needed).
  4. Determine_Dimensions: Calculate W_out and H_out based on the number of unique colors, their maximum frequency (MaxCount), and the input height (H_in).
  5. Construct_Output:
     - Create a grid of H_out x W_out initialized with white (0).
     - Iterate through the sorted unique colors. For the i-th color (0-indexed):
       - Let its frequency be `Count`.
       - Fill the i-th column of the output grid from row 0 down to row `Count - 1` with that color.

Relationships:
  - Output columns map directly to unique input colors.
  - Output column order depends on input color frequency.
  - Output column height depends on input color frequency.
  - Output grid dimensions depend on input color frequencies, number of unique colors, and input height.
