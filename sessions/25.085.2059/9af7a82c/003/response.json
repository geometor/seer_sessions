Scan the input grid and count the occurrences (frequency) of each non-white pixel color (values 1 through 9). Ignore white pixels (value 0).\n2.  Identify the set of unique non-white colors present and their corresponding frequencies.\n3.  Determine the maximum frequency (`MaxCount`) among all counted colors. If no non-white colors are present, `MaxCount` is 0.\n4.  Determine the number of unique non-white colors found (`UniqueColorCount`).\n5.  Calculate the dimensions for the output grid:\n    *   Height (`H_out`) = `MaxCount`.\n    *   Width (`W_out`) = `UniqueColorCount`.\n6.  Create a new grid with dimensions `H_out` x `W_out`, initially filled entirely with the white color (0).\n7.  Sort the unique non-white colors based primarily on their frequencies in descending order. As a secondary sorting criterion (for ties in frequency), sort by the color value itself in ascending order.\n8.  Iterate through the sorted colors. For each color, assign it to a column in the output grid, starting with the leftmost column (index 0) for the first color in the sorted list (the most frequent), the next column (index 1) for the second color, and so on.\n9.  For each assigned column `c` and its corresponding color `val` with frequency `count`, fill the cells from row 0 down to row `count - 1` in that column `c` with the color `val`.\n10. Return the resulting output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms an input grid into an output grid representing a histogram\n    of non-white color frequencies.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the output histogram grid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
