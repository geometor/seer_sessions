task_description: Create a vertical histogram representing the frequency of each non-white color in the input grid.

input_grid:
  - A 2D array of integers (pixels) representing colors.
  - Dimensions vary per example.
  - Contains pixels with values 0 (white) and 1-9 (non-white colors).

output_grid:
  - A 2D array of integers (pixels) representing the histogram.
  - Dimensions are determined by the color frequencies in the input.
  - Width (W_out): Equals the number of unique non-white colors found in the input grid.
  - Height (H_out): Equals the maximum frequency count among all unique non-white colors in the input grid.
  - Background color: white (0).

objects:
  - type: color_pixels
    attributes:
      - value: Integer from 1 to 9.
      - frequency: The total count of pixels of that color in the input grid.

processing_steps:
  - 1. Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-white pixel colors (values 1-9).
  - 2. Count the frequency of each unique non-white color.
  - 3. Determine the output grid dimensions:
      - Width (W_out) = Number of unique non-white colors.
      - Height (H_out) = Maximum frequency count found in step 2.
      - Handle edge case: If no non-white colors exist, output is an empty grid (0 columns) with height 0 (as MaxCount is 0). Note: previous logic suggested H_in+1, but H=MaxCount=0 seems more consistent. Let's stick to MaxCount=0. If MaxCount is 0, H_out = 0.
  - 4. Create an output grid of H_out x W_out, initialized with white (0).
  - 5. Sort the unique non-white colors based on their frequency counts in descending order. If counts are equal, sort by color value in ascending order (as a secondary key).
  - 6. Iterate through the sorted colors. For each color:
      - Assign it to the next available column in the output grid, starting from column 0 for the most frequent color.
      - Fill the assigned column from the top (row 0) downwards with the color, up to a height equal to the color's frequency count.

visualization: The output grid represents a vertical bar chart where each column corresponds to a unique non-white color from the input, the height of the colored portion of the column represents the frequency of that color, and columns are ordered from left-to-right by decreasing frequency.
