*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain a dominant background color (blue, value 1) and one or more distinct, contiguous objects of other colors (green, red, gray, magenta).
    *   The output grids are smaller than the input grids.
    *   The output grids contain the same colored objects found in the input, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement.
    *   The original background color (blue) is absent in the output.
    *   A new background color (white, value 0) appears in the output, seemingly filling the space previously occupied by the original background color (blue) *within the bounds* of the extracted objects.
    *   The transformation involves identifying all non-background objects, determining the minimal bounding box enclosing them, extracting the content within this box, and replacing any original background pixels within that extracted content with white pixels.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Extract non-background objects and place them on a minimal canvas, replacing the original background color within the extracted area with white.
    
    elements:
      - type: background
        color_name: blue
        color_value: 1
        role: The predominant color in the input grid, defining empty space.
      - type: object
        description: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than the background color.
        examples:
          - color_name: green
            color_value: 3
          - color_name: red
            color_value: 2
          - color_name: gray
            color_value: 5
          - color_name: magenta
            color_value: 6
      - type: output_background
        color_name: white
        color_value: 0
        role: The background color used in the output grid within the extracted bounding box.
    
    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The relative positions of the extracted objects are preserved in the output grid.
      - type: containment
        description: The output grid represents the content within the minimal bounding box enclosing all non-background objects from the input grid.
    
    actions:
      - action: identify_background_color
        input: input_grid
        output: background_color (e.g., 1)
        condition: Typically the most frequent color or the color filling the grid borders.
      - action: find_objects
        input: input_grid, background_color
        output: list_of_object_pixels (coordinates and colors)
        condition: Pixels whose color is not the background_color.
      - action: determine_bounding_box
        input: list_of_object_pixels
        output: coordinates of the minimal bounding box (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - action: extract_subgrid
        input: input_grid, bounding_box
        output: subgrid_content
      - action: create_output_grid
        input: subgrid_content, background_color, output_background_color (0)
        output: output_grid
        steps:
          - Initialize output grid with dimensions derived from the bounding box.
          - Iterate through the subgrid_content.
          - If a pixel's color matches the input background_color, replace it with the output_background_color (0).
          - Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the background color in the input grid (which is blue, color 1).
    2.  Locate all pixels that are *not* the background color. These constitute the objects.
    3.  Determine the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column that encompass *all* non-background pixels found in step 2. This defines the bounding box.
    4.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions are determined by the height (max_row - min_row + 1) and width (max_col - min_col + 1) of the bounding box.
    5.  Iterate through each cell within the bounding box coordinates (from min_row to max_row, and min_col to max_col) in the input grid.
    6.  For each cell, copy its color value to the corresponding position in the new output grid.
    7.  After copying, iterate through the new output grid. If any cell contains the original background color (blue, 1), change its color to white (0). Leave all other colors unchanged.
    8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
