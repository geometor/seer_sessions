The output grids are consistently 3 rows by 3 columns.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Input grids contain white (0), green (3), and yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   Output grids contain only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels.\n3.  **Structure & Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve overlaying or combining the left half (columns 0-2) and the right half (columns 3-5) of the input grid to produce the output grid.\n4.  **Pixel Mapping:** For each cell `(r, c)` in the 3x3 output grid, its color seems determined by the colors of the cells `(r, c)` and `(r, c+3)` in the input grid.\n5.  **Color Logic:**\n    *   If both corresponding input cells (`Input[r, c]` and `Input[r, c+3]`) are white (0), the output cell `Output[r, c]` is white (0).\n    *   If at least one of the corresponding input cells is non-white (green (3) or yellow (4)), the output cell `Output[r, c]` becomes magenta (6). The specific non-white color (green or yellow) doesn't seem to matter for the output, only its presence.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
