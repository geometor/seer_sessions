task_description: Combine the left and right halves of the input grid based on pixel color presence.

input_grid:
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 6
    colors_present: [white, green, yellow]
  structure:
    - name: left_half
      description: Columns 0, 1, 2 of the input grid (a 3x3 subgrid).
    - name: right_half
      description: Columns 3, 4, 5 of the input grid (a 3x3 subgrid).

output_grid:
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3
    colors_present: [white, magenta]

transformation:
  type: element-wise_combination
  input_elements:
    - source: left_half
      coordinates: (r, c)
    - source: right_half
      coordinates: (r, c) # Corresponds to input grid coordinate (r, c+3)
  output_element:
    coordinates: (r, c)
  rule:
    description: Determine the color of the output pixel based on the presence of non-white pixels at the corresponding positions in the input grid's left and right halves.
    conditions:
      - if:
          - Pixel at input(r, c) is non-white (green or yellow)
          - OR
          - Pixel at input(r, c+3) is non-white (green or yellow)
        then:
          - Set output(r, c) to magenta (6).
      - else: # Both input(r, c) and input(r, c+3) are white (0)
          - Set output(r, c) to white (0).

relationship:
  - input pixel at (r, c) and input pixel at (r, c+3) determine the output pixel at (r, c).
