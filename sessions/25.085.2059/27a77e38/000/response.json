            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a distinct horizontal line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels. This line effectively divides the grid into two regions: an upper region above the gray line and a lower region below it, which initially consists of only white (0) pixels.\n2.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies only a single pixel in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n3.  **Modification Location:** The modified pixel is always located in the bottom-most row of the grid. Its column index corresponds to the horizontal center of the grid (the middle column). If the grid has an even width, the column to the left of the exact center is used (index `floor(width / 2)`).\n4.  **Color Determination:** The color of the new pixel is determined by analyzing the row *immediately above* the gray horizontal line.\n    *   First, count the occurrences of each non-gray color within that specific row.\n    *   Identify the color(s) that appear most frequently in that row.\n    *   If only one color is most frequent, that color is used for the modified pixel.\n    *   If there is a tie (multiple colors appear with the same highest frequency in that row), a tie-breaking rule is applied: Count the total occurrences of each of the tied colors in the *entire region above* the gray line. The color among the tied candidates that appears most frequently in this upper region is chosen as the final color for the modified pixel.\n5.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the single pixel at the bottom row, middle column, which is updated with the determined color.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
