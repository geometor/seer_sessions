No colors are added, removed, or changed.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves rearranging the order of elements within the list.\n5.  **Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]`\n        *   Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n        *   The pair `(9, 0)` at indices (0, 1) is swapped to `(0, 9)`.\n        *   The element `1` at index 2 remains unchanged.\n        *   The pair `(6, 8)` at indices (3, 4) is swapped to `(8, 6)`.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]`\n        *   Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n        *   The pair `(4, 3)` at indices (0, 1) is swapped to `(3, 4)`.\n        *   The element `6` at index 2 remains unchanged.\n        *   The pair `(2, 8)` at indices (3, 4) is swapped to `(8, 2)`.\n6.  **Inferred Rule:** The transformation appears to iterate through the list, considering elements based on their position (index). Specifically, it swaps elements at indices `i` and `i+1` if the index `i` is a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6, ...). Elements at indices `i` where `i % 3 == 2` seem to act as separators or remain untouched by the swap operation affecting the preceding pair.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
