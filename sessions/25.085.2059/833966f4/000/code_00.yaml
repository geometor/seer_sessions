task_description: Rearrange elements in a 1D list by swapping adjacent pairs based on their starting index.
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 1D (list or single column grid)
  - element_type: integer (representing color)
transformation:
  type: element rearrangement
  mechanism: pairwise swapping
  condition: based on element index
objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: list of integers
  - name: output_list
    type: list of integers
    relationship: contains the same elements as input_list but potentially in a different order.
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value (color)
      - index (position within the list)
actions:
  - name: swap_adjacent_elements
    condition: happens when the index `i` of the first element in a pair `(element[i], element[i+1])` is divisible by 3.
    affected_indices: `i` and `i+1`
    skipped_indices: elements at index `i` where `i % 3 == 2` are not the start of a swapped pair.
