            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid features a prominent \"cross\" shape composed of a single horizontal line and a single vertical line, both spanning the full width and height of the grid, respectively. These lines always intersect near the center of the grid and are made of the same color.\n2.  **Background Color:** The areas separated by the cross are filled with a consistent background color.\n3.  **Unique Pixel:** Within one of the four quadrants defined by the cross, there exists a single pixel of a unique color, different from both the cross color and the background color.\n4.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is always a rectangular subgrid extracted from the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The key observation is that the output grid corresponds exactly to the quadrant of the input grid (as defined by the cross) that contains the unique pixel. The size and content of the output are determined by the boundaries of that specific quadrant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Examine the input grid to find the single horizontal line and the single vertical line that span the grid's width and height, respectively. Record the row index (`r_cross`) of the horizontal line and the column index (`c_cross`) of the vertical line. These lines form a cross.\n2.  Identify the pixel in the input grid whose color is unique (appears only once). Record its row index (`r_unique`) and column index (`c_unique`).\n3.  Compare the unique pixel's coordinates (`r_unique`, `c_unique`) with the cross's intersection coordinates (`r_cross`, `c_cross`) to determine which quadrant it falls into:\n    *   If `r_unique < r_cross` and `c_unique < c_cross`, it's the Top-Left quadrant.\n    *   If `r_unique < r_cross` and `c_unique > c_cross`, it's the Top-Right quadrant.\n    *   If `r_unique > r_cross` and `c_unique < c_cross`, it's the Bottom-Left quadrant.\n    *   If `r_unique > r_cross` and `c_unique > c_cross`, it's the Bottom-Right quadrant.\n4.  Define the boundaries of the selected quadrant based on the input grid's dimensions (Height `H`, Width `W`) and the cross intersection (`r_cross`, `c_cross`):\n    *   Top-Left: Rows 0 to `r_cross - 1`, Columns 0 to `c_cross - 1`.\n    *   Top-Right: Rows 0 to `r_cross - 1`, Columns `c_cross + 1` to `W - 1`.\n    *   Bottom-Left: Rows `r_cross + 1` to `H - 1`, Columns 0 to `c_cross - 1`.\n    *   Bottom-Right: Rows `r_cross + 1` to `H - 1`, Columns `c_cross + 1` to `W - 1`.\n5.  Extract the subgrid from the input grid corresponding to these calculated row and column boundaries. This subgrid is the final output."
