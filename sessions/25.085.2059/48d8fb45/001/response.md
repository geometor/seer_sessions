"""
Identify the single gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid.
Find all distinct contiguous objects of colors other than white (0) or gray (5).
Calculate the minimum Euclidean distance between the gray pixel and each colored object.
Determine the colored object closest to the gray pixel.
Based on the color of the closest object, return a predefined 3x3 grid pattern.
- If blue (1): [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]]
- If red (2): [[0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]
