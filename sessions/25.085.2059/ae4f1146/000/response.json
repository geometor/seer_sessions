White (0) pixels seem to act as background or separators and are not part of the extracted output pattern.\n    *   The input grid contains multiple potential 3x3 subgrids composed solely of azure and blue pixels.\n    *   A selection criterion must exist to choose exactly one of these 3x3 subgrids to become the output.\n    *   Comparing the number of blue (1) pixels within the valid 3x3 candidate subgrids appears to be the key selection criterion. The subgrid with the highest count of blue pixels is chosen.\n    *   In case of a tie in the count of blue pixels, a positional tie-breaking rule (topmost, then leftmost) seems to be applied.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "

Initialize variables to keep track of the best candidate subgrid found so far: maximum blue pixel count (`max_blue_count` = -1), position of the best subgrid (`best_subgrid_pos` = None), and the content of the best subgrid (`best_subgrid` = None).\n    2.  Iterate through all possible top-left starting positions (row `r`, column `c`) for a 3x3 subgrid within the input grid. The valid range for `r` is from 0 to `input_height - 3`, and for `c` is from 0 to `input_width - 3`.\n    3.  For each position (`r`, `c`), extract the corresponding 3x3 subgrid.\n    4.  Check if this 3x3 subgrid contains *only* azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. If it contains any other color (like white, 0), discard it and proceed to the next position.\n    5.  If the subgrid contains only azure and blue pixels, count the number of blue (1) pixels within it (`current_blue_count`).\n    6.  Compare `current_blue_count` with `max_blue_count`:\n        *   If `current_blue_count` > `max_blue_count`, then this subgrid is the new best candidate. Update `max_blue_count` to `current_blue_count`, update `best_subgrid_pos` to (`r`, `c`), and store the content of this subgrid in `best_subgrid`.\n        *   If `current_blue_count` == `max_blue_count`, apply the tie-breaking rule: Compare the current position (`r`, `c`) with `best_subgrid_pos`. If the current subgrid's position is \"smaller\" (first by row `r`, then by column `c`) than `best_subgrid_pos`, update `best_subgrid_pos` to (`r`, `c`) and update `best_subgrid` to the content of the current subgrid.\n    7.  After iterating through all possible positions, the `best_subgrid` variable will hold the content of the 3x3 subgrid that satisfies the criteria.\n    8.  Return `best_subgrid` as the output grid."
