*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The inputs are always 3x3 grids of pixels with various colors.
    *   The outputs are always 6x6 grids, which is double the height and width of the input grids.
    *   The output grid appears to be composed of four copies of the input grid, modified by reflection (flipping).
    *   Specifically, the output grid seems tiled with the original input grid and its reflections.
    *   Comparing the top-left 3x3 corner of the output with the input reveals they are identical.
    *   The top-right 3x3 corner of the output seems to be a horizontal reflection (left-right flip) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-left 3x3 corner of the output seems to be a vertical reflection (top-bottom flip) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-right 3x3 corner of the output seems to be reflected both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input 3x3 grid (InputGrid).
    2.  Create a new output grid (OutputGrid) with dimensions 6x6 (double the height and width of InputGrid).
    3.  Define the four 3x3 quadrants of the OutputGrid:
        *   Top-Left: Rows 0 to 2, Columns 0 to 2.
        *   Top-Right: Rows 0 to 2, Columns 3 to 5.
        *   Bottom-Left: Rows 3 to 5, Columns 0 to 2.
        *   Bottom-Right: Rows 3 to 5, Columns 3 to 5.
    4.  Copy the InputGrid directly into the Top-Left quadrant of the OutputGrid.
    5.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the InputGrid. Copy this flipped version into the Top-Right quadrant of the OutputGrid.
    6.  Create a vertically flipped version of the InputGrid. Copy this flipped version into the Bottom-Left quadrant of the OutputGrid.
    7.  Create a version of the InputGrid flipped both horizontally and vertically. Copy this doubly flipped version into the Bottom-Right quadrant of the OutputGrid.
    8.  Return the completed 6x6 OutputGrid.
