            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The dimensions of the grid remain the same after the transformation.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8). The output introduces red (2) pixels where only white (0) pixels existed before, or retains existing non-white pixels. White (0) pixels are sometimes changed to red (2), but other colors are never changed.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to operate horizontally within each row independently. It identifies pairs (or groups) of pixels of the *same* non-white color within a single row. The white (0) pixels located horizontally *between* the leftmost and rightmost pixel of that specific color in that row are then changed to red (2).\n4.  **Connectivity:** The red pixels act like a horizontal \"bridge\" or \"fill\" connecting the span covered by a specific non-white color within a row.\n5.  **No Overwriting:** The original non-white pixels are never overwritten by the red (2) fill. The fill only affects the white (0) pixels within the horizontal span.\n6.  **Multiple Colors:** If multiple non-white colors exist in a row (none in the examples, but implied), the process would likely apply independently for each color.\n7.  **Requirement:** For a change to occur in a row for a specific color, there must be at least two pixels of that color separated by at least one white pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
