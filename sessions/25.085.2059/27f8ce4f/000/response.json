The remaining locations in the meta-grid are filled with white 3x3 grids.\n    *   Further analysis suggests this \"pattern color\" is determined by frequency: it's the non-white color that appears most often in the input grid. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the one with the highest numerical value is chosen as the pattern color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
