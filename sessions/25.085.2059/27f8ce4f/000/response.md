*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   All input grids are 3x3.
    *   All output grids are 9x9.
    *   The output grid appears to be constructed by tiling 3x3 subgrids in a 3x3 arrangement.
    *   These 3x3 subgrids are either identical copies of the input grid or are entirely filled with the white color (0).
    *   The arrangement (pattern) of where the input grid copies are placed seems to be determined by the content of the input grid itself.
    *   By analyzing the positions where the input grid copy appears in the output's 3x3 meta-structure and comparing it to the input grid, a specific color within the input grid seems to dictate the pattern.
    *   Specifically, the locations of a particular color in the input grid correspond to the locations where copies of the *entire* input grid are placed in the output's 3x3 meta-grid. The remaining locations in the meta-grid are filled with white 3x3 grids.
    *   Further analysis suggests this "pattern color" is determined by frequency: it's the non-white color that appears most often in the input grid. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, the one with the highest numerical value is chosen as the pattern color.

    task_structure:
      grid_resizing: Input grid size (H, W) maps to output grid size (3*H, 3*W).
      output_composition: Output grid is a 3x3 meta-grid composed of subgrids.
      subgrid_size: Each subgrid in the output has the same dimensions as the input grid.
      subgrid_types: Subgrids are either copies of the input grid or uniform white grids.
    
    transformation_logic:
      pattern_derivation:
        source: The input grid determines a placement pattern for its copies in the output meta-grid.
        method: Identify the "pattern color" from the input grid.
          - Step 1: Count the frequency of each non-white color (1-9) in the input grid.
          - Step 2: Find the maximum frequency.
          - Step 3: Identify all colors that have this maximum frequency.
          - Step 4: Select the color with the highest numerical value among these as the "pattern color".
        pattern_grid_creation: Create a binary pattern grid (P) with the same dimensions as the input grid (I).
          - Rule: P[r][c] = 1 if I[r][c] equals the pattern color.
          - Rule: P[r][c] = 0 otherwise.
      output_construction:
        meta_grid_mapping: Use the pattern grid (P) to populate the 3x3 output meta-grid.
        placement_rule:
          - If P[r][c] == 1, the subgrid at meta-position (r, c) in the output is a copy of the input grid (I).
          - If P[r][c] == 0, the subgrid at meta-position (r, c) in the output is a grid of the same dimensions as I, filled with white (0).
    
    examples_analysis:
      example_1: Pattern color is 5 (Gray), determined by max frequency tie-break (max(4, 5)).
      example_2: Pattern color is 7 (Orange), most frequent.
      example_3: Pattern color is 9 (Maroon), most frequent.
      example_4: Pattern color is 8 (Azure), most frequent.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid, Height (H) and Width (W). (In the examples, H=3, W=3).
    2.  Create the output grid with dimensions 3*H and 3*W, initialized to white (0).
    3.  Identify the "pattern color" from the input grid:
        a.  Count the occurrences of each non-white color (values 1 through 9) within the input grid.
        b.  Find the maximum count among these colors.
        c.  Identify all non-white colors that have this maximum count.
        d.  Select the color with the largest numerical value from this set as the "pattern color".
    4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (from row `r=0` to `H-1`, column `c=0` to `W-1`).
    5.  Check if the color of the input grid cell `Input[r][c]` matches the identified "pattern color".
    6.  If `Input[r][c]` matches the pattern color:
        *   Copy the entire input grid into the corresponding subgrid region of the output grid. This region starts at output row `r*H` and output column `c*W` and has dimensions HxW.
    7.  If `Input[r][c]` does not match the pattern color:
        *   Ensure the corresponding subgrid region of the output grid (starting at `r*H`, `c*W`) remains filled with white (0). (This is implicitly handled if the output grid is initialized to white).
    8.  Return the completed output grid.
