1. Determine the dimensions of the input grid, Height (H) and Width (W).
2. Create the output grid with dimensions 3*H and 3*W, initialized to white (0).
3. Identify the "pattern color" from the input grid:
    a. Count the occurrences of each non-white color (values 1 through 9).
    b. Find the maximum count among these colors.
    c. Identify all non-white colors that have this maximum count.
    d. Select the color with the largest numerical value from this set as the "pattern color".
4. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid (from row `r=0` to `H-1`, column `c=0` to `W-1`).
5. If the color of the input grid cell `Input[r][c]` matches the identified "pattern color":
    a. Copy the entire input grid into the corresponding subgrid region of the output grid. This region starts at output row `r*H` and output column `c*W` and has dimensions HxW.
6. If `Input[r][c]` does not match the pattern color, the corresponding subgrid remains white (initialized value).
7. Return the completed output grid.
