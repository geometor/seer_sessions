task_type: pattern_generation
components:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
  - type: object
    identifier: colored_pixel
    properties:
      - color: non-white (1-9)
      - location: row, column
actions:
  - name: generate_L_shape
    input: colored_pixel (color C, row R, column C)
    output: painted_region
    steps:
      - step: paint_horizontal_segment
        details: Fill cells in row R from column C to the right edge (width-1) with color C.
      - step: paint_vertical_segment
        details: Fill cells in the rightmost column (width-1) from row R to the bottom edge (height-1) with color C.
grid_transformations:
  - description: Apply 'generate_L_shape' independently for every non-white pixel found in the input grid onto an initially white output grid of the same dimensions.
relationships:
  - Each non-white input pixel maps directly to one L-shaped pattern in the output.
  - The position and color of the input pixel determine the position and color of the generated L-shape.
  - The grid boundaries (right edge, bottom edge) define the extent of the L-shape segments.
