The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Key Elements:** The input grids contain one or more isolated, non-white pixels scattered across the white background.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grids show that each non-white pixel from the input has generated an 'L' shape of the same color.\n4.  **'L' Shape Formation:**\n    *   The 'L' shape originates at the position of the input pixel.\n    *   A horizontal line extends from the original pixel's position to the rightmost edge of the grid, filling all cells in that row within this range.\n    *   A vertical line extends downwards from the original pixel's row in the rightmost column, filling all cells in the rightmost column from that row down to the bottom edge of the grid.\n5.  **Overlap:** When multiple 'L' shapes are generated, they might overlap. The examples show that the color of the overlap is determined by the pixel generating the shape (the specific rules of which color \"wins\" an overlap aren't explicitly tested with conflicting colors in the same overlap zone in the examples, but the process seems additive or potentially based on processing order, although the final pattern seems independent of order based on the examples provided). A simpler interpretation is that all required cells for all 'L' shapes are painted, overwriting the background and potentially parts of other 'L' shapes.\n6.  **Background:** White pixels in the input remain white in the output unless they are overwritten by part of an 'L' shape.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
