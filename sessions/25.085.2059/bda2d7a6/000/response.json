The outermost layer might be the background color filling the grid, or a distinct border frame.\n2.  **Colors:** Multiple colors are used in each example. The number of distinct colors/layers varies (3 or 4 in the examples).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation preserves the geometric structure (the shapes and relative positions of the nested rectangles) but changes the colors assigned to each layer.\n4.  **Color Mapping:** There appears to be a consistent rule for how the input layer colors map to the output layer colors, based on their depth or position in the nested structure (from outermost to innermost).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
