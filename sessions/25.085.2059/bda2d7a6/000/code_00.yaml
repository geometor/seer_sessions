  - type: grid
    properties:
      - structure: nested_rectangles
      - content: multiple_colors
objects:
  - id: layer_1
    description: Outermost rectangle or background color.
    properties:
      - color: C1 (variable)
      - shape: rectangle (covers whole grid or is a frame)
  - id: layer_2
    description: Rectangle nested inside layer_1.
    properties:
      - color: C2 (variable)
      - shape: rectangle
  - id: layer_3
    description: Rectangle nested inside layer_2.
    properties:
      - color: C3 (variable)
      - shape: rectangle
  - id: layer_4 (optional)
    description: Rectangle nested inside layer_3 (present in example 1).
    properties:
      - color: C4 (variable)
      - shape: rectangle
relationships:
  - type: nesting
    entities: [layer_1, layer_2, layer_3, layer_4]
    description: layer_2 is inside layer_1, layer_3 is inside layer_2, etc.
actions:
  - action: recolor_layers
    inputs: [layer_1(C1), layer_2(C2), layer_3(C3), layer_4(C4)] # Input colors
    outputs: [layer_1(O1), layer_2(O2), layer_3(O3), layer_4(O4)] # Output colors
    rule:
      - O1 = C3
      - O2 = C1
      - O3 = C2
      - O4 = C3 (if layer_4 exists)
    description: The color of each layer in the output is determined by the color of a specific layer in the input based on its depth. The shapes and positions remain unchanged.
