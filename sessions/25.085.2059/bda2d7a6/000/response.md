Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Structure:** Each input and output grid consists of nested, concentric rectangular shapes or layers. The outermost layer might be the background color filling the grid, or a distinct border frame.
2.  **Colors:** Multiple colors are used in each example. The number of distinct colors/layers varies (3 or 4 in the examples).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation preserves the geometric structure (the shapes and relative positions of the nested rectangles) but changes the colors assigned to each layer.
4.  **Color Mapping:** There appears to be a consistent rule for how the input layer colors map to the output layer colors, based on their depth or position in the nested structure (from outermost to innermost).

    outputs: [layer_1(O1), layer_2(O2), layer_3(O3), layer_4(O4)] # Output colors
    rule:

      - O4 = C3 (if layer_4 exists)
    description: The color of each layer in the output is determined by the color of a specific layer in the input based on its depth. The shapes and positions remain unchanged.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the concentric rectangular layers present in the input grid, starting from the outermost layer (Layer 1) and proceeding inwards (Layer 2, Layer 3, etc.). Record the color of each layer (C1, C2, C3, etc.).
2.  Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
3.  Populate the new grid with the same nested rectangular structure as the input.
4.  Assign colors to the layers in the new grid based on the following rules, using the recorded input colors:
    *   The color of the outermost layer (Output Layer 1) becomes the color of Input Layer 3 (C3).
    *   The color of the next layer inwards (Output Layer 2) becomes the color of Input Layer 1 (C1).
    *   The color of the next layer inwards (Output Layer 3) becomes the color of Input Layer 2 (C2).
    *   If a fourth layer exists, its color (Output Layer 4) becomes the color of Input Layer 3 (C3).
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
