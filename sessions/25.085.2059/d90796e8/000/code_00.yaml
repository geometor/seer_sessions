task_elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions remain constant between input and output
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Represents an integer value (0-9)
      - position: Defined by row and column index
  - type: Color Interaction
    description: Specific interaction occurs between green (3) and red (2) pixels.
    conditions:
      - Green (3) pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a red (2) pixel in the input.
      - Red (2) pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a green (3) pixel in the input.
    actions:
      - If a green (3) pixel meets its condition, it becomes azure (8) in the output.
      - If a red (2) pixel meets its condition, it becomes white (0) in the output.
    independence: The decision to change a pixel's color is based solely on its adjacent neighbors in the *input* grid. Changes happen concurrently.
  - type: Unaffected Pixels
    description: Pixels that are not green (3) adjacent to red (2), or red (2) adjacent to green (3), retain their original color in the output. This includes gray (5), white (0), and any green or red pixels not meeting the adjacency criteria.
