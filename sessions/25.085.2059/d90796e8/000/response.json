            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved in the transformation appear to be green (3) and red (2). Azure (8) appears in the output, replacing some green pixels. White (0) replaces some red pixels. Other colors like gray (5) seem unaffected.\n3.  **Spatial Relationship:** The changes seem dependent on the adjacency (sharing an edge, not diagonally) of green and red pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** When a green pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a red pixel in the input grid, the green pixel turns into an azure (8) pixel in the output grid. Simultaneously, when a red pixel is adjacent to a green pixel in the input grid, it turns into a white (0) pixel in the output grid. These changes happen based on the *original* adjacencies in the input. A single red pixel can cause multiple adjacent green pixels to change, and vice-versa. Pixels not involved in this specific adjacency relationship retain their original color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
