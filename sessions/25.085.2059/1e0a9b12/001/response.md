"""
Simulates gravity acting independently within each column of the grid. 
Non-white pixels (values 1-9) fall downwards in their respective columns 
until they hit the bottom of the grid or another non-white pixel. 
The relative vertical order of non-white pixels within a column is preserved. 
White pixels (value 0) act as empty space.
