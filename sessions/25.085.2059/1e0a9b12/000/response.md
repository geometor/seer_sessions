*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The task involves input and output grids of potentially varying sizes.
    *   The grids contain pixels of different colors, with white (0) acting as a background or empty space.
    *   Non-white pixels (1-9) seem to be the primary objects of interest.
    *   The transformation primarily affects the vertical positioning of non-white pixels.

*   **Perception of Transformation:**
    *   Comparing input and output grids reveals that non-white pixels move downwards.
    *   The movement appears constrained within each column independently.
    *   Pixels fall until they encounter the bottom edge of the grid or another non-white pixel within the same column.
    *   The relative vertical order of non-white pixels within a column is preserved after falling.
    *   Essentially, the task simulates gravity acting on the non-white pixels within each column.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Simulate Gravity in Columns

    Entities:
      - Grid: A 2D array of pixels.
      - Pixel: An individual cell in the grid.
        Properties:
          - color: Integer from 0 to 9.
          - position: (row, column).
          - type: white (0) or non-white (1-9).
      - Column: A vertical slice of the grid.

    Relationships:
      - Containment: Columns contain Pixels. Grids contain Columns.
      - Vertical Adjacency: Pixels can be above or below other pixels in the same column.
      - Support: A non-white pixel is supported if it is at the bottom row, or if the pixel directly below it in the same column is non-white.

    Actions:
      - Identify: Find all non-white pixels in each column of the input grid.
      - Collect: Gather the non-white pixels for a specific column, preserving their original relative vertical order.
      - Re-position: Place the collected non-white pixels at the bottom of the corresponding column in the output grid, maintaining their collected order (stacking them upwards).
      - Fill: Fill the remaining cells above the stacked non-white pixels in the output column with white pixels.

    Rule:
      - For each column independently, simulate gravity by moving all non-white pixels downwards until they are settled at the bottom, either resting on the grid floor or on another non-white pixel, while preserving their original relative vertical order.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with white pixels (0).
    2.  Process the input grid column by column, from left to right.
    3.  For each column:
        a.  Create a temporary list to store the colors of the non-white pixels found in that column.
        b.  Iterate through the rows of the current column from top to bottom (or bottom to top, the order of collection matters for reconstruction). Let's choose bottom to top for easier reconstruction. Iterate from the last row up to the first row.
        c.  If a pixel at the current row and column in the input grid is non-white, add its color to the temporary list. (This list now contains the non-white pixel colors from bottom to top).
        d.  Iterate through the rows of the current column in the *output* grid, starting from the bottom row (last row index) and moving upwards.
        e.  For each position in the output column, take the next available color from the temporary list (starting from the beginning of the list, which corresponds to the lowest original pixel) and place it in the current output grid cell.
        f.  Stop placing colors when the temporary list is empty. The remaining cells above in the output column will retain their initial white color.
    4.  The resulting grid after processing all columns is the final output.
