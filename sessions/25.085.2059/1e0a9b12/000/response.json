Create a temporary list to store the colors of the non-white pixels found in that column.\n        b.  Iterate through the rows of the current column from top to bottom (or bottom to top, the order of collection matters for reconstruction). Let's choose bottom to top for easier reconstruction. Iterate from the last row up to the first row.\n        c.  If a pixel at the current row and column in the input grid is non-white, add its color to the temporary list. (This list now contains the non-white pixel colors from bottom to top).\n        d.  Iterate through the rows of the current column in the *output* grid, starting from the bottom row (last row index) and moving upwards.\n        e.  For each position in the output column, take the next available color from the temporary list (starting from the beginning of the list, which corresponds to the lowest original pixel) and place it in the current output grid cell.\n        f.  Stop placing colors when the temporary list is empty. The remaining cells above in the output column will retain their initial white color.\n    4.  The resulting grid after processing all columns is the final output."
