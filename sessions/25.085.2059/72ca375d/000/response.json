An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a smaller grid, representing a cropped portion of the input grid.\n3.  **Objects:** In each example, there are exactly three distinct objects, each made of a single color.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core task is to identify *which* of the input objects should be selected and presented as the output. The output object is cropped to its minimal bounding box.\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** The selection seems based on the *size* (number of pixels) of the objects.\n    *   In Example 1 (sizes 4, 5, 5), the object with the unique smallest size (4) is selected.\n    *   In Example 2 (sizes 4, 4, 6), the object with the unique largest size (6) is selected.\n    *   In Example 3 (sizes 4, 5, 7), all sizes are unique. The average size is (4+5+7)/3 \u2248 5.33. The object with the size closest to the average (size 5) is selected.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The rule appears to be: Identify all objects and their sizes. If there's exactly one object whose size is unique (occurs only once among all object sizes), select that object. If all objects have unique sizes, select the object whose size is closest to the average size of all objects. Finally, output the selected object cropped to its bounding box.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
