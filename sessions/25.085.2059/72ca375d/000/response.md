Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a 10x10 grid containing the white background color (0) and several distinct "objects". An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a smaller grid, representing a cropped portion of the input grid.
3.  **Objects:** In each example, there are exactly three distinct objects, each made of a single color.
4.  **Transformation:** The core task is to identify *which* of the input objects should be selected and presented as the output. The output object is cropped to its minimal bounding box.
5.  **Selection Criteria:** The selection seems based on the *size* (number of pixels) of the objects.
    *   In Example 1 (sizes 4, 5, 5), the object with the unique smallest size (4) is selected.
    *   In Example 2 (sizes 4, 4, 6), the object with the unique largest size (6) is selected.
    *   In Example 3 (sizes 4, 5, 7), all sizes are unique. The average size is (4+5+7)/3 â‰ˆ 5.33. The object with the size closest to the average (size 5) is selected.
6.  **Hypothesis:** The rule appears to be: Identify all objects and their sizes. If there's exactly one object whose size is unique (occurs only once among all object sizes), select that object. If all objects have unique sizes, select the object whose size is closest to the average size of all objects. Finally, output the selected object cropped to its bounding box.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all distinct objects, where an object is a connected group of pixels sharing the same non-white color.
2.  For each identified object, calculate its size (the total number of pixels it contains).
3.  Determine the frequency of each size among all identified objects.
4.  Count how many object sizes appear exactly once (unique sizes).
5.  **Selection:**
    *   If there is exactly one unique size, identify the object that has this unique size. This is the selected object.
    *   If the number of unique sizes is equal to the total number of objects (meaning every object has a size different from all others), calculate the average size of all objects. Identify the object whose size is numerically closest to this calculated average. This is the selected object. (Assume a tie-breaking rule isn't needed based on examples, or default to the first encountered if necessary).
6.  Determine the minimal bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all pixels) of the selected object.
7.  Create the output grid by extracting the portion of the input grid corresponding to the bounding box of the selected object.
