task_type: object_selection_and_cropping
input_features:
  grid_dimensions: 10x10
  background_color: 0 (white)
  elements:
    - type: object
      definition: contiguous group of same non-white pixels
      quantity: 3 per example
      properties:
        - color: single non-white color per object
        - size: number of pixels
        - shape: variable
        - bounding_box: minimal rectangle enclosing the object
output_features:
  grid_dimensions: variable (matches bounding box of selected object)
  content: pixels corresponding to the selected object within its bounding box
selection_rule:
  - step: identify_objects
    description: Find all contiguous non-white pixel groups.
  - step: calculate_properties
    description: For each object, determine its size (pixel count).
  - step: analyze_sizes
    description: Create a frequency count of object sizes. Identify unique sizes (those occurring only once).
  - step: apply_selection_logic
    description: |
      - IF exactly one unique size exists:
          Select the object with that unique size.
      - ELSE IF all object sizes are unique:
          Calculate the average size of all objects.
          Select the object whose size is numerically closest to the average.
      - ELSE (other cases not covered by examples):
          [Rule undefined based on provided examples]
  - step: generate_output
    description: Crop the input grid to the bounding box of the selected object.
