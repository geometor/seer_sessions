            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** In all examples, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. This suggests the output grid is a scaled-up version, specifically 3 times larger in both height and width.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid seems composed of multiple copies of the original input grid, interspersed with blocks of the background color (white, 0). The output can be visualized as a 3x3 \"meta-grid\", where each cell of the meta-grid is the size of the original input grid (3x3 in these examples).\n3.  **Placement Logic:** The placement of the input grid copies within the output meta-grid is not random. It appears to depend on the content of the *original* input grid.\n4.  **Identifying the Key:** Let's compare the input grid pixel locations to the meta-grid locations where copies are placed:\n    *   **Example 1:** Input has azure (8) at (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Output has copies at meta-grid positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Azure (8) is the most frequent color (6 times).\n    *   **Example 2:** Input has green (3) at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Output has copies at meta-grid positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Green (3) is the most frequent color (3 times).\n    *   **Example 3:** Input has maroon (9) at (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1). Output has copies at meta-grid positions (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1). Maroon (9) is the most frequent color (4 times).\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies the most frequent non-background color in the input grid. It then creates an output grid 3 times larger in each dimension. For every pixel in the input grid that matches the most frequent color, a copy of the *entire* input grid is placed in the corresponding location within the 3x3 meta-grid structure of the output. Locations in the meta-grid corresponding to input pixels *not* matching the most frequent color are filled with a block of the background color (white, 0) matching the input grid's size.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

The top-left corner of this copied block in the output grid should be at row `r * H` and column `c * W`.\n8.  If the color at `(r, c)` does not match the `target_color`, leave the corresponding `H x W` block in the output grid filled with the background color (this is already handled by the initialization in step 4).\n9.
