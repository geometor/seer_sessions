Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size Transformation:** All input grids are 3x3, and all output grids are 9x9. This indicates a scaling or tiling operation.
2.  **Pattern Repetition:** The 3x3 input pattern is repeated exactly three times within the 9x9 output grid.
3.  **Tiling Orientation:** The repetition happens either horizontally (side-by-side) creating a 3x9 block, or vertically (stacked) creating a 9x3 block.
4.  **Placement:** The resulting 3x9 or 9x3 block is placed within the 9x9 output grid. The placement seems to be either at the top/left edge, the center, or potentially the bottom/right edge.
5.  **Background Fill:** The remaining area of the 9x9 output grid, not covered by the repeated input pattern, is filled with the background color (white, 0).
6.  **Determining Rule:** The key is to figure out what property of the input grid determines *both* the orientation (horizontal/vertical tiling) and the placement (top/middle/bottom or left/center/right) of the repeated block within the output grid.
7.  **Uniform Lines:** Observing the inputs reveals a pattern:
    *   Example 1: The top row is uniformly blue (1). Output: Horizontal tiling at the top.
    *   Example 2: The left column is uniformly red (2). Output: Vertical tiling on the left.
    *   Example 3: The left column is uniformly green (3). Output: Vertical tiling on the left.
    *   Example 4: The middle row is uniformly green (3). Output: Horizontal tiling in the middle.
8.  **Hypothesis:** The presence and location of a row or column containing only a single color (a "uniform" line) dictates the transformation.
    *   A uniform *row* leads to *horizontal* tiling. The row's position (top, middle, bottom) determines the vertical placement of the 3x9 block (top, middle, bottom).
    *   A uniform *column* leads to *vertical* tiling. The column's position (left, middle, right) determines the horizontal placement of the 9x3 block (left, middle, right).

relationship:
  - rule: The input_grid is tiled 3 times to form a pattern within the output_grid.
  - condition: If a uniform_row exists in the input_grid:
    action:
      - orientation: horizontal_tiling (input | input | input) forming a 3x9 block.
      - placement: The 3x9 block is placed in the output_grid vertically aligned with the position of the uniform_row (top row -> top placement, middle row -> middle placement, bottom row -> bottom placement).
  - condition: Else if a uniform_column exists in the input_grid:
    action:
      - orientation: vertical_tiling (input stacked on input stacked on input) forming a 9x3 block.
      - placement: The 9x3 block is placed in the output_grid horizontally aligned with the position of the uniform_column (left column -> left placement, middle column -> middle placement, right column -> right placement).
  - default_action: Fill the remaining areas of the output_grid with the background_color.
assumptions:
  - Exactly one uniform row or column exists in each input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new 9x9 grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0). Let this be the `output_grid`.
2.  Examine the input 3x3 grid (let's call it `input_grid`).
3.  Check if any row in the `input_grid` consists of only one color (is uniform):
    *   If the top row (row 0) is uniform: Tile the `input_grid` horizontally three times to create a 3x9 pattern. Place this pattern into the top three rows (rows 0-2) of the `output_grid`. Proceed to step 5.
    *   If the middle row (row 1) is uniform: Tile the `input_grid` horizontally three times to create a 3x9 pattern. Place this pattern into the middle three rows (rows 3-5) of the `output_grid`. Proceed to step 5.
    *   If the bottom row (row 2) is uniform: Tile the `input_grid` horizontally three times to create a 3x9 pattern. Place this pattern into the bottom three rows (rows 6-8) of the `output_grid`. Proceed to step 5.
4.  If no uniform row was found, check if any column in the `input_grid` consists of only one color (is uniform):
    *   If the left column (column 0) is uniform: Tile the `input_grid` vertically three times to create a 9x3 pattern. Place this pattern into the left three columns (columns 0-2) of the `output_grid`. Proceed to step 5.
    *   If the middle column (column 1) is uniform: Tile the `input_grid` vertically three times to create a 9x3 pattern. Place this pattern into the middle three columns (columns 3-5) of the `output_grid`. Proceed to step 5.
    *   If the right column (column 2) is uniform: Tile the `input_grid` vertically three times to create a 9x3 pattern. Place this pattern into the right three columns (columns 6-8) of the `output_grid`. Proceed to step 5.
5.  Return the `output_grid`.
