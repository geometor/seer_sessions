Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:
1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid (assumed to be 6x6).
2.  Find the unique 2x2 block composed entirely of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row `r` and column `c` of its top-left pixel.
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within this input block:
    *   `color_TL`: Top-Left pixel at `(r, c)`
    *   `color_TR`: Top-Right pixel at `(r, c+1)`
    *   `color_BL`: Bottom-Left pixel at `(r+1, c)`
    *   `color_BR`: Bottom-Right pixel at `(r+1, c+1)`
4.  Check if the identified block is centrally located within the 6x6 grid. The block is considered centered if its top-left corner is at `r=2` and `c=2`.
5.  **If the block is centered (`r=2`, `c=2`):**
    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) with `color_BR`.
    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) with `color_BL`.
    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) with `color_TR`.
    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) with `color_TL`.
6.  **If the block is not centered (e.g., `r=1`, `c=1`):**
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (0, 0) in the output grid to `color_BR`.
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (0, 3) in the output grid to `color_BL`.
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (3, 0) in the output grid to `color_TR`.
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (3, 3) in the output grid to `color_TL`.
7.  The modified grid is the final output.
