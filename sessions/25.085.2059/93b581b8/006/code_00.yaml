task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - size: All examples use 6x6 grids.
  objects:
    - object_type: block
      description: A single 2x2 block composed entirely of non-white pixels.
      properties:
        - location: Varies between examples. Can be centered (2, 2) or off-center (1, 1).
        - colors: Contains four distinct non-white colors (TL, TR, BL, BR).
actions:
  - action_type: copy
    description: The output grid initially copies the input grid.
  - action_type: find
    description: Locate the unique 2x2 non-white block in the input grid.
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - block_location: (r, c) of the top-left corner
      - block_colors: {TL, TR, BL, BR}
  - action_type: conditional_placement
    description: Place four 2x2 colored blocks onto the output grid based on the input block's location. The colors used are swapped diagonally from the input block.
    conditions:
      - condition: Input block is centered (r=2, c=2) in a 6x6 grid.
        placements:
          - target_area: Top-left corner (0:2, 0:2)
            color: Input block's BR color
          - target_area: Top-right corner (0:2, 4:6)
            color: Input block's BL color
          - target_area: Bottom-left corner (4:6, 0:2)
            color: Input block's TR color
          - target_area: Bottom-right corner (4:6, 4:6)
            color: Input block's TL color
      - condition: Input block is at (r=1, c=1) in a 6x6 grid.
        placements:
          - target_area: Top-left area (0:2, 0:2)
            color: Input block's BR color
          - target_area: Top-mid-right area (0:2, 3:5)
            color: Input block's BL color
          - target_area: Mid-left area (3:5, 0:2)
            color: Input block's TR color
          - target_area: Mid-mid-right area (3:5, 3:5)
            color: Input block's TL color
