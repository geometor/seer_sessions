Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input is a 6x6 grid, predominantly composed of white pixels (color 0). Centered within the grid (though not necessarily exactly in the middle) is a single 2x2 block of non-white pixels.
2.  **Output Structure:** Each output is also a 6x6 grid. It retains the original 2x2 block from the input in the exact same position. Additionally, four new 2x2 blocks appear in the four corners of the grid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
3.  **Central Object:** The core element in the input is the 2x2 block of colored pixels. Let's denote its top-left position as `(r, c)`. The block consists of pixels: `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+1, c+1)`.
4.  **Corner Blocks:** The newly added blocks in the output are located at fixed positions:
    *   Top-Left Corner: Occupies cells `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`.
    *   Top-Right Corner: Occupies cells `(0,4)` to `(1,5)`.
    *   Bottom-Left Corner: Occupies cells `(3,0)` to `(4,1)`.
    *   Bottom-Right Corner: Occupies cells `(3,4)` to `(4,5)`.
5.  **Color Mapping:** There's a distinct relationship between the colors of the pixels in the input's central 2x2 block and the colors filling the output's corner 2x2 blocks. The mapping appears to be diagonally opposite:
    *   The color of the top-left pixel `(r, c)` of the central block is used to fill the *bottom-right* corner block in the output.
    *   The color of the top-right pixel `(r, c+1)` of the central block is used to fill the *bottom-left* corner block in the output.
    *   The color of the bottom-left pixel `(r+1, c)` of the central block is used to fill the *top-right* corner block in the output.
    *   The color of the bottom-right pixel `(r+1, c+1)` of the central block is used to fill the *top-left* corner block in the output.
6.  **Filling Corner Blocks:** Examples `train_2` and `train_3` show the corner 2x2 areas being *completely filled* with the mapped color. The provided output for `train_1` seems inconsistent with this, showing partial filling or single pixels in some corners. Given the consistency in `train_2` and `train_3`, I will assume the rule is to fill the entire 2x2 corner area, and `train_1` might be an outlier or have a transcription error in the example display.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Start with the input 6x6 grid. Create a new 6x6 grid for the output, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Locate the 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row and column `(r, c)` of its top-left pixel.
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels of this input block:
    *   `color_TL` = color at `(r, c)`
    *   `color_TR` = color at `(r, c+1)`
    *   `color_BL` = color at `(r+1, c)`
    *   `color_BR` = color at `(r+1, c+1)`
4.  Modify the output grid by filling the four 2x2 corner areas according to the following rules:
    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_BR`.
    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_BL`.
    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 3-4, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_TR`.
    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area (rows 3-4, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_TL`.
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
