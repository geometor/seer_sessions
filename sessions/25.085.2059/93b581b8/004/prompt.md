Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:
1.  Start with the input 6x6 grid. Create a new 6x6 grid for the output, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Locate the unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row and column `(r, c)` of its top-left pixel.
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels of this input block:
    *   `color_TL` = color at `(r, c)`
    *   `color_TR` = color at `(r, c+1)`
    *   `color_BL` = color at `(r+1, c)`
    *   `color_BR` = color at `(r+1, c+1)`
4.  Modify the output grid by filling four specific 2x2 corner areas according to the following rules:
    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_BR`.
    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_BL`.
    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_TR`.
    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_TL`.
5.  The resulting grid is the final output. This logic is derived primarily from examples 2 and 3, assuming a consistent 2x2 fill pattern in specific corner locations (0:2,0:2), (0:2,4:6), (4:6,0:2), (4:6,4:6). Example 1 appears inconsistent with this full 2x2 fill pattern.
