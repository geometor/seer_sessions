Create a new 6x6 grid for the output, initially identical to the input grid.\n2.  Locate the unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row and column `(r, c)` of its top-left pixel.\n3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels of this input block:\n    *   `color_TL` = color at `(r, c)`\n    *   `color_TR` = color at `(r, c+1)`\n    *   `color_BL` = color at `(r+1, c)`\n    *   `color_BR` = color at `(r+1, c+1)`\n4.  Modify the output grid by filling the four 2x2 corner areas according to the following rules:\n    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_BR`.\n    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_BL`.\n    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 3-4, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_TR`.\n    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area (rows 3-4, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_TL`.\n5.  The resulting grid is the final output.\nNote: This assumes a 6x6 grid and specific corner locations based on observations from training examples 2 and 3. Training example 1's output seems inconsistent with the pattern of filling the entire 2x2 corner block, but the consistent pattern is implemented here.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_central_block_origin(grid: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-left coordinate (r, c) of the first occurrence \n    of a 2x2 block where all pixels are non-white (non-zero).\n    Assumes there is exactly one such block in a predominantly white grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (row, column) of the top-left corner of the block, \n        or None if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    # Iterate through possible top-left corners of a 2x2 block\n    for r in range(H - 1):\n        for c in range(W - 1):\n            # Check if all four pixels in the 2x2 block starting at (r, c) are non-white\n            if (grid[r, c] != 0 and\n                grid[r, c + 1] != 0 and\n                grid[r + 1, c] != 0 and\n                grid[r + 1, c + 1] != 0):\n                # Found the block\n                return r, c\n    # Return None if no non-white 2x2 block is found (shouldn't happen based on task constraints)\n    return None \n\ndef transform(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by copying a central 2x2 block and creating \n    four new 2x2 blocks in the corners, colored based on the diagonally \n    opposite pixels of the central block.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid (assumed 6x6).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Check if grid is 6x6 as expected by the corner logic derived from examples\n    H, W = input_np.shape\n    if H != 6 or W != 6:\n        # This implementation currently assumes a 6x6 grid for corner placement.\n        # If grids of other sizes are possible, the corner logic would need generalization.\n        print(f\"Warning: Grid dimensions ({H}x{W}) are not 6x6.
