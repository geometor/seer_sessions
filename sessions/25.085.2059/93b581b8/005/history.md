Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:
1.  Start with the input 6x6 grid. Create a new 6x6 grid for the output, initially identical to the input grid.
2.  Locate the unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row and column `(r, c)` of its top-left pixel.
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels of this input block:
    *   `color_TL` = color at `(r, c)`
    *   `color_TR` = color at `(r, c+1)`
    *   `color_BL` = color at `(r+1, c)`
    *   `color_BR` = color at `(r+1, c+1)`
4.  Modify the output grid by filling four specific 2x2 corner areas according to the following rules:
    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_BR`.
    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_BL`.
    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) entirely with `color_TR`.
    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) entirely with `color_TL`.
5.  The resulting grid is the final output. This logic is derived primarily from examples 2 and 3, assuming a consistent 2x2 fill pattern in specific corner locations (0:2,0:2), (0:2,4:6), (4:6,0:2), (4:6,4:6). Example 1 appears inconsistent with this full 2x2 fill pattern.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the core mechanism: locating a 2x2 non-white block in the input and using its pixel colors to modify the corners of the output grid. The color mapping (swapping diagonally opposite colors from the input block to specific corners) was correctly identified.

However, the code failed on Example 1 because it assumed the modification always involved filling 2x2 areas in the extreme corners (0:2,0:2), (0:2,4:6), (4:6,0:2), (4:6,4:6). Example 1 demonstrates a different pattern where only single pixels are placed at specific coordinates (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3).

The key difference appears to be the location of the initial 2x2 block. In Examples 2 and 3, the block is perfectly centered (top-left at row 2, col 2 in a 6x6 grid), leading to the 2x2 corner fill. In Example 1, the block is offset (top-left at row 1, col 1), leading to the single-pixel corner placement.

The strategy for resolving the error is to:
1.  Find the 2x2 non-white block and its top-left coordinates `(r, c)`.
2.  Check if the block is centered (`r == 2` and `c == 2` for a 6x6 grid).
3.  Apply the 2x2 corner filling logic if centered.
4.  Apply the 1x1 corner pixel placement logic (at specific coordinates) if not centered.
5.  Ensure the output grid starts as a copy of the input grid, and only the specified corner locations are modified.

- common_rule:
    - Identify the unique 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    - Determine its top-left coordinate `(r, c)`.
    - Store the colors of its pixels: `color_TL`, `color_TR`, `color_BL`, `color_BR`.
    - Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    - Check if the block is centered (assuming 6x6 grid, this means `r=2` and `c=2`).
    - Conditional action based on centeredness:
        - If centered: Fill four 2x2 areas in the output grid corners.
            - `output[0:2, 0:2] = color_BR`
            - `output[0:2, 4:6] = color_BL`
            - `output[4:6, 0:2] = color_TR`
            - `output[4:6, 4:6] = color_TL`
        - If not centered: Modify four single pixels in the output grid.
            - `output[0, 0] = color_BR`
            - `output[0, 3] = color_BL`
            - `output[3, 0] = color_TR`
            - `output[3, 3] = color_TL`

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid (assumed to be 6x6).
2.  Find the unique 2x2 block composed entirely of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row `r` and column `c` of its top-left pixel.
3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within this input block:
    *   `color_TL`: Top-Left pixel at `(r, c)`
    *   `color_TR`: Top-Right pixel at `(r, c+1)`
    *   `color_BL`: Bottom-Left pixel at `(r+1, c)`
    *   `color_BR`: Bottom-Right pixel at `(r+1, c+1)`
4.  Check if the identified block is centrally located within the 6x6 grid. The block is considered centered if its top-left corner is at `r=2` and `c=2`.
5.  **If the block is centered (`r=2`, `c=2`):**
    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) with `color_BR`.
    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) with `color_BL`.
    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) with `color_TR`.
    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) with `color_TL`.
6.  **If the block is not centered (e.g., `r=1`, `c=1`):**
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (0, 0) in the output grid to `color_BR`.
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (0, 3) in the output grid to `color_BL`.
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (3, 0) in the output grid to `color_TR`.
    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (3, 3) in the output grid to `color_TL`.
7.  The modified grid is the final output.
