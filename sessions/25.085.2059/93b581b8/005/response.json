Create the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid (assumed to be 6x6).\n2.  Find the unique 2x2 block composed entirely of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the row `r` and column `c` of its top-left pixel.\n3.  Identify the colors of the four pixels within this input block:\n    *   `color_TL`: Top-Left pixel at `(r, c)`\n    *   `color_TR`: Top-Right pixel at `(r, c+1)`\n    *   `color_BL`: Bottom-Left pixel at `(r+1, c)`\n    *   `color_BR`: Bottom-Right pixel at `(r+1, c+1)`\n4.  Check if the identified block is centrally located within the 6x6 grid. The block is considered centered if its top-left corner is at `r=2` and `c=2`.\n5.  **If the block is centered (`r=2`, `c=2`):**\n    *   Fill the top-left 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) with `color_BR`.\n    *   Fill the top-right 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 0-1, columns 4-5) with `color_BL`.\n    *   Fill the bottom-left 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 0-1) with `color_TR`.\n    *   Fill the bottom-right 2x2 area of the output grid (rows 4-5, columns 4-5) with `color_TL`.\n6.  **If the block is not centered (e.g., `r=1`, `c=1`):**\n    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (0, 0) in the output grid to `color_BR`.\n    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (0, 3) in the output grid to `color_BL`.\n    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (3, 0) in the output grid to `color_TR`.\n    *   Set the pixel at coordinate (3, 3) in the output grid to `color_TL`.\n7.  The modified grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_non_white_2x2_block(grid: np.ndarray) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-left coordinate (r, c) of the first occurrence \n    of a 2x2 block where all pixels are non-white (non-zero).\n    Assumes there is at most one such block.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (row, column) of the top-left corner of the block, \n        or None if no such block is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    # Iterate through possible top-left corners of a 2x2 block\n    for r in range(H - 1):\n        for c in range(W - 1):\n            # Check if all four pixels in the 2x2 block starting at (r, c) are non-white\n            if (grid[r, c] != 0 and\n                grid[r, c + 1] != 0 and\n                grid[r + 1, c] != 0 and\n                grid[r + 1, c + 1] != 0):\n                # Found the block\n                return r, c\n    # Return None if no non-white 2x2 block is found\n    return None \n\ndef transform(input_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the location of a 2x2 non-white block.\n    If the block is centered in a 6x6 grid, it fills 2x2 corners.\n    If the block is off-center (like in Example 1), it fills specific single pixels.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a numpy array for efficient processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Get grid dimensions\n    H, W = input_np.shape\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n\n    # Find the top-left corner (r, c) of the 2x2 non-white block\n    block_origin = find_non_white_2x2_block(input_np)\n\n    # If no block is found, return the original grid (as list of lists)\n    if block_origin is None:\n        # print(\"Warning: No 2x2 non-white block found.\") # Optional warning\n        return output_grid.tolist() \n\n    r, c = block_origin\n\n    # Get the colors from the four pixels of the central block in the input\n    # Add checks to prevent IndexError if block is at the very edge (though unlikely based on examples)\n    if r+1 >= H or c+1 >= W:\n        # print(\"Error: Found block origin, but block extends beyond grid boundaries.\")\n        return output_grid.tolist() # Return unchanged grid if block is invalidly placed\n        \n    color_TL = input_np[r, c]         # Top-Left pixel color\n    color_TR = input_np[r, c + 1]     # Top-Right pixel color\n    color_BL = input_np[r + 1, c]     # Bottom-Left pixel color\n    color_BR = input_np[r + 1, c + 1] # Bottom-Right pixel color\n\n    # Check grid size and block centeredness\n    is_centered_6x6 = (H == 6 and W == 6 and r == 2 and c == 2)\n\n    # --- Apply transformation based on centeredness ---\n    if is_centered_6x6:\n        # Apply 2x2 corner fill logic (for centered 6x6 grids like Ex2, Ex3)\n        # Safety checks for grid size (already implicitly checked by H==6, W==6)\n        \n        # Top-left corner (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) gets color_BR\n        output_grid[0:2, 0:2] = color_BR\n\n        # Top-right corner (rows 0-1, cols 4-5) gets color_BL\n        output_grid[0:2, 4:6] = color_BL\n\n        # Bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, cols 0-1) gets color_TR\n        output_grid[4:6, 0:2] = color_TR\n\n        # Bottom-right corner (rows 4-5, cols 4-5) gets color_TL\n        output_grid[4:6, 4:6] = color_TL\n        \n    # Handle the specific non-centered case observed in Example 1 (r=1, c=1 in 6x6)\n    # Assuming this 1x1 pixel placement applies ONLY to this specific non-centered case\n    # or perhaps any non-centered 6x6 case.
