task_structure:
  - description: Input grid is partitioned into multiple smaller subgrids.
    details: The 9x10 input grid is divided by white lines (color 0) into a 2x3 arrangement of 6 subgrids.
  - description: Subgrid dimensions vary slightly due to partitioning lines.
    details:
      - Top-left: 3x2 (rows 1-3, cols 1-2)
      - Top-middle: 3x3 (rows 1-3, cols 4-6)
      - Top-right: 3x2 (rows 1-3, cols 8-9)
      - Bottom-left: 3x2 (rows 5-7, cols 1-2)
      - Bottom-middle: 3x3 (rows 5-7, cols 4-6)
      - Bottom-right: 3x2 (rows 5-7, cols 8-9)
      (Note: Indices are 0-based, ranges are inclusive start, exclusive end)
transformation:
  - description: Output grid is generated based on subgrid analysis.
    details: A 4x5 output grid is created, initialized to white (0).
  - description: Mapping subgrids to output cells.
    details: Each of the 6 input subgrids corresponds to a unique cell within the central 2x3 area of the output grid (output rows 1-2, cols 1-3).
      - Top-left subgrid -> Output[1, 1]
      - Top-middle subgrid -> Output[1, 2]
      - Top-right subgrid -> Output[1, 3]
      - Bottom-left subgrid -> Output[2, 1]
      - Bottom-middle subgrid -> Output[2, 2]
      - Bottom-right subgrid -> Output[2, 3]
  - description: Color determination rule for output cells.
    action: For each input subgrid, identify all non-white pixels.
    action: Count the occurrences of each distinct non-white color.
    action: Determine the color(s) that appear most frequently.
    action: If there is a single most frequent color, select that color.
    action: If there's a tie for the most frequent color, select the color with the smallest numerical value among the tied colors (standard ARC tie-breaker, though not explicitly needed for these examples).
    action: If a subgrid contains only white pixels, the corresponding output cell remains white (0).
    result: Place the selected color into the corresponding cell in the output grid.
output_structure:
  - description: Final output grid has a specific size and border.
    details: The output grid is 4x5, with a 1-pixel white border surrounding the central 2x3 area derived from the input subgrids.
