## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9x10. They feature a distinct structure created by horizontal white lines (color 0) at rows 0, 4, and 8, and vertical white lines at columns 0, 3, and 7.
2.  **Partitioning:** These white lines partition the input grid into 6 significant rectangular subgrids arranged in a 2-row, 3-column layout.
    *   Row 1 blocks: Input[1:4, 1:3], Input[1:4, 4:7], Input[1:4, 8:10]
    *   Row 2 blocks: Input[5:8, 1:3], Input[5:8, 4:7], Input[5:8, 8:10]
    *   Note the varying widths of the subgrids (2, 3, 2 columns).
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 4x5. They have a white border (rows 0 and 3, columns 0 and 4). The central 2x3 area (rows 1-2, columns 1-3) contains the transformed colors.
4.  **Mapping:** There is a direct spatial mapping between the 2x3 arrangement of input subgrids and the 2x3 central area of the output grid.
    *   Input subgrid at Row `i`, Column `j` (0-indexed relative to the subgrid layout) maps to Output cell at `(i+1, j+1)`.
5.  **Transformation Rule:** The color of each cell in the central 2x3 area of the output grid is determined by finding the **most frequent non-white (non-zero) color** within the corresponding input subgrid.
6.  **Consistency:** This partitioning and frequency analysis rule holds true across all three training examples. No ties for the most frequent color were observed.

      relation: one-to-one between 6 input subgrids and 6 output cells in the central area.
  rule:
    - description: Determine the color for each output cell in the central area.
    - steps:
        - For the corresponding input subgrid:
          - Identify all non-white pixels.
          - Count the frequency of each unique non-white color.
          - Select the color with the highest frequency.
        - Assign the selected color to the output cell.
    - assumption: No ties occur for the most frequent non-white color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid of size 4x5 filled with white (0).
2.  Define the coordinates of the 6 input subgrids based on the partitioning white lines (rows 0, 4, 8 and columns 0, 3, 7):
    *   Subgrid (0,0): Input rows 1-3, columns 1-2.
    *   Subgrid (0,1): Input rows 1-3, columns 4-6.
    *   Subgrid (0,2): Input rows 1-3, columns 8-9.
    *   Subgrid (1,0): Input rows 5-7, columns 1-2.
    *   Subgrid (1,1): Input rows 5-7, columns 4-6.
    *   Subgrid (1,2): Input rows 5-7, columns 8-9.
3.  Define the corresponding output cell coordinates:
    *   Output cell for Subgrid (0,0) is (1, 1).
    *   Output cell for Subgrid (0,1) is (1, 2).
    *   Output cell for Subgrid (0,2) is (1, 3).
    *   Output cell for Subgrid (1,0) is (2, 1).
    *   Output cell for Subgrid (1,1) is (2, 2).
    *   Output cell for Subgrid (1,2) is (2, 3).
4.  For each input subgrid:
    a.  Extract all pixel values within the subgrid's coordinates.
    b.  Filter out any white (0) pixel values.
    c.  If no non-white pixels exist, the most frequent color is undefined (though this case doesn't appear in examples; assume output remains white/0 or handle as needed).
    d.  Count the occurrences of each remaining (non-white) color.
    e.  Identify the color that occurs most frequently.
    f.  Place this most frequent color into the corresponding output cell defined in step 3.
5.  Return the completed 4x5 output grid.
