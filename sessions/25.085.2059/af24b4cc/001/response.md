```python
"""
Transforms a 9x10 input grid into a 4x5 output grid.
The input grid is partitioned into 6 subgrids (2 rows, 3 columns) by white lines.
The output grid has a white border, and its central 2x3 area is filled based on the input subgrids.
Each cell in the output's central 2x3 area corresponds to one input subgrid.
The color of an output cell is determined by finding the most frequent non-white (non-zero) color within its corresponding input subgrid.
