task_description: Analyze 9x10 input grids partitioned by white lines into six rectangular subgrids and generate a 4x5 output grid summarizing the subgrids.

input_grid:
  properties:
    height: 9
    width: 10
    structure: Contains 6 distinct subgrids separated by white (0) pixels.
    partitioning_rows: [0, 4, 8] # Rows containing primarily white separators
    partitioning_cols: [0, 3, 7, 10] # Columns containing primarily white separators
  subgrids:
    - location: rows 1-3, cols 1-2 (indices 1:4, 1:3)
    - location: rows 1-3, cols 4-6 (indices 1:4, 4:7)
    - location: rows 1-3, cols 8-9 (indices 1:4, 8:10)
    - location: rows 5-7, cols 1-2 (indices 5:8, 1:3)
    - location: rows 5-7, cols 4-6 (indices 5:8, 4:7)
    - location: rows 5-7, cols 8-9 (indices 5:8, 8:10)

output_grid:
  properties:
    height: 4
    width: 5
    structure: Contains a white (0) border surrounding a central 2x3 area.
  central_area:
    location: rows 1-2, cols 1-3 (indices 1:3, 1:4)
    content: Each cell corresponds to one input subgrid, ordered row-by-row, left-to-right.

transformation:
  action: Map each input subgrid to a corresponding cell in the output grid's central area.
  rule: Determine the color for each output cell by analyzing its corresponding input subgrid.
  color_determination:
    1. Identify all non-white (non-zero) pixel colors within the subgrid.
    2. Count the frequency of each non-white color.
    3. Find the maximum frequency among these colors.
    4. Identify all colors that occur with this maximum frequency.
    5. If only one color has the maximum frequency, that color is the result.
    6. If multiple colors share the maximum frequency (a tie), select the color with the smallest numerical value among them.
    7. If the subgrid contains only white pixels (or is empty), the resulting color is white (0).
  mapping:
    - input[1:4, 1:3]  -> output[1, 1]
    - input[1:4, 4:7]  -> output[1, 2]
    - input[1:4, 8:10] -> output[1, 3]
    - input[5:8, 1:3]  -> output[2, 1]
    - input[5:8, 4:7]  -> output[2, 2]
    - input[5:8, 8:10] -> output[2, 3]
