elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors (0-9). Constant dimensions between input and output.
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value 0-9. 0 is background (white). 1-9 are distinct colors.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - element: row
    description: A horizontal line of pixels in the grid.
    properties:
      - non_white_pixels: A list of pixels in the row with color > 0.
      - count_non_white: The number of non-white pixels in the row.

transformation:
  - scope: row-by-row
    description: The grid transformation is applied independently to each row.
  - condition:
      description: A transformation applies to a row only if it meets specific criteria.
      criteria:
        - count_non_white == 2
        - Let the two non-white pixels be P1 (left, color C1, col1) and P2 (right, color C2, col2).
        - The pair of colors (C1, C2) must be one of {(1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 7), (7, 4)}.
          (blue, azure), (azure, blue), (yellow, orange), (orange, yellow).
  - action:
      description: If the condition is met, the right pixel (P2) moves left.
      steps:
        - Identify the positions (row, col1) and (row, col2) and colors C1, C2.
        - Change the pixel at (row, col2) in the output grid to white (0).
        - Change the pixel at (row, col1 + 1) in the output grid to color C2.
  - default:
      description: If the condition is not met for a row, the row remains unchanged in the output grid.
