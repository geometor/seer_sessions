            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same dimensions. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The primary objects are individual pixels with colors other than white (values 1-9). They appear sparsely distributed.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids reveals that most pixels remain unchanged. The changes involve the horizontal movement of *some* colored pixels within their rows.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:**\n    *   The movement is always horizontal, from right to left within a single row.\n    *   A pixel that moves leaves its original position, which becomes white (0).\n    *   The moving pixel stops immediately to the right of another non-white pixel in the same row.\n5.  **Condition for Movement:** By examining all examples, the movement seems conditional:\n    *   It only occurs in rows containing *exactly two* non-white pixels.\n    *   Furthermore, it only occurs for specific *pairs* of colors. Let the left pixel have color `C1` and the right pixel have color `C2`. Movement happens only if the pair (`C1`, `C2`) is one of:\n        *   (blue(1), azure(8))\n        *   (azure(8), blue(1))\n        *   (yellow(4), orange(7))\n        *   (orange(7), yellow(4))\n    *   If a row has exactly two non-white pixels, but the color pair (left, right) is *not* one of the above, no movement occurs (e.g., train_2 row 1: (maroon(9), red(2)); train_4 row 2: (magenta(6), orange(7))).\n    *   Rows with 0, 1, or more than 2 non-white pixels are never modified.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"

Iterate through each row of the input grid, identified by its `row_index`.\n3.  For the current row, find all non-white pixels, storing their color and column index. Let this list be `pixels`.\n4.  Check if the number of pixels in the `pixels` list is exactly two.\n5.
