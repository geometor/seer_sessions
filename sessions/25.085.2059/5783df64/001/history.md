*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain a white background (color 0) with exactly nine scattered, non-white pixels (colors 1-9).
    *   The output grids are always 3x3.
    *   Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to one of the non-white pixels from the input grid.
    *   The position of a non-white pixel within a specific region of the input grid determines its position in the 3x3 output grid.
    *   The input grid can be conceptually divided into a 3x3 grid of equally sized rectangular blocks. The dimensions of these blocks depend on the input grid size (e.g., 3x3 blocks for a 9x9 input, 2x2 blocks for a 6x6 input).
    *   Each of these 3x3 input blocks contains exactly one non-white pixel.
    *   The color of the non-white pixel found in the input block at block-coordinates (i, j) is placed at coordinates (i, j) in the output grid.

    task_type: Grid Transformation
    input_features:
      - grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 9x9, 6x6)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - objects:
          - type: Pixel
          - count: 9 non-white pixels per input grid
          - properties:
              - color: Varies (1-9)
              - position: Scattered
      - structure: Can be divided into a 3x3 grid of equal-sized blocks.
    output_features:
      - grid_dimensions: Fixed (3x3)
      - content: Contains exactly the 9 non-white colors from the input.
      - structure: Represents a mapping of the input blocks.
    transformation:
      - name: Block Mapping
      - description: Maps the content of input grid blocks to output grid cells.
      - steps:
          - Determine block dimensions by dividing input dimensions by output dimensions (3x3).
          - Iterate through the 3x3 block structure of the input grid.
          - For each block, locate the single non-white pixel within it.
          - Place the color of that pixel into the corresponding cell of the 3x3 output grid.
    relationship:
      - The position (block_row, block_col) of the block containing a non-white pixel in the input grid maps directly to the position (row, col) of that pixel's color in the output grid.
      - Each input block contains exactly one non-white pixel.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (InputHeight, InputWidth) and the output grid (OutputHeight=3, OutputWidth=3).
    2.  Calculate the dimensions of the blocks within the input grid: BlockHeight = InputHeight / OutputHeight, BlockWidth = InputWidth / OutputWidth.
    3.  Create a new 3x3 output grid initialized with a default color (e.g., white).
    4.  Iterate through the block rows (`block_r`) from 0 to 2 and block columns (`block_c`) from 0 to 2.
    5.  For each block (`block_r`, `block_c`):
        a.  Define the region of the input grid corresponding to this block:
            *   Start row: `block_r * BlockHeight`
            *   End row: `(block_r + 1) * BlockHeight - 1`
            *   Start column: `block_c * BlockWidth`
            *   End column: `(block_c + 1) * BlockWidth - 1`
        b.  Search within this defined region of the input grid to find the coordinates (`pixel_r`, `pixel_c`) of the pixel whose color is not white (0).
        c.  Retrieve the color value of the pixel at (`pixel_r`, `pixel_c`) in the input grid.
        d.  Place this color value into the output grid at position (`block_r`, `block_c`).
    6.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
