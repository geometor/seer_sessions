The dimensions of these blocks depend on the input grid size (e.g., 3x3 blocks for a 9x9 input, 2x2 blocks for a 6x6 input).\n    *   Each of these 3x3 input blocks contains exactly one non-white pixel.\n    *   The color of the non-white pixel found in the input block at block-coordinates (i, j) is placed at coordinates (i, j) in the output grid.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
