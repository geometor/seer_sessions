Both grids have the same dimensions in each example.\n2.  **Background:** The background color is white (0).\n3.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain isolated pixels of various colors (red=2, green=3, azure=8, magenta=6) scattered on the white background.\n4.  **Output Changes:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, except for the addition of blue (1) pixels.\n5.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels in the output consistently appear adjacent (including diagonals) to the red (2) pixels found in the input. They form a 3x3 square centered on each red pixel, but the center remains red, and only cells that were originally white (0) are changed to blue (1).\n6.  **Selective Application:** Other colored pixels (green, azure, magenta) in the input do not cause any blue pixels to be added around them and remain unchanged in the output.\n7.  **Overwrites:** The rule only changes white pixels to blue. If a neighbor of a red pixel is already a non-white color, it remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
