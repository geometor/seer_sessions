Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task involves transforming input grids into output grids. Both grids have the same dimensions in each example.
2.  **Background:** The background color is white (0).
3.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain isolated pixels of various colors (red=2, green=3, azure=8, magenta=6) scattered on the white background.
4.  **Output Changes:** The output grids are identical to the input grids, except for the addition of blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Pattern:** The blue pixels in the output consistently appear adjacent (including diagonals) to the red (2) pixels found in the input. They form a 3x3 square centered on each red pixel, but the center remains red, and only cells that were originally white (0) are changed to blue (1).
6.  **Selective Application:** Other colored pixels (green, azure, magenta) in the input do not cause any blue pixels to be added around them and remain unchanged in the output.
7.  **Overwrites:** The rule only changes white pixels to blue. If a neighbor of a red pixel is already a non-white color, it remains unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  grid_dimensions: preserved in output
  background_color: white (0)
  elements:
    - type: isolated_pixels
    - colors: [red(2), green(3), azure(8), magenta(6)] # Colors observed in inputs
target_elements:
  - type: pixel
  - color: red (2)
transformation_rule:
  action: color_change
  source_color: white (0)
  target_color: blue (1)
  condition:
    - description: The pixel must be one of the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of a red (2) pixel.
    - description: The pixel must currently be white (0).
  preservation:
    - description: All original non-white pixels (including the red pixels) retain their original color and position.
    - description: White pixels that are not neighbors of red pixels remain white.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid.
3.  If a cell contains a red (2) pixel:
    a.  Identify the 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals) surrounding this red pixel.
    b.  For each neighbor cell:
        i.  Check if the neighbor cell is within the grid boundaries.
        ii. If the neighbor cell is within bounds AND its color in the *original* input grid is white (0), change the color of that corresponding cell in the *output* grid to blue (1).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
