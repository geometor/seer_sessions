Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input grids are 3x3.
2.  **Colors:** Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (orange 7, red 2, azure 8, blue 1).
3.  **Object Identification:** The non-white pixels can be considered the primary objects or elements of interest. They are scattered within the input grid.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids have a height of 1. The width varies.
5.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain only the non-white color found in the corresponding input grid.
6.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to extract all the non-white pixels from the input grid and arrange them horizontally in a single row in the output grid.
7.  **Pixel Count:** The number of pixels in the output grid equals the number of non-white pixels in the input grid.
8.  **Order:** The order of the pixels in the output row seems to correspond to the order they are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task: "extract and linearize non-background pixels"
elements:
  - type: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - contains_background: true
        background_color: 0 (white)
      - contains_objects: true
        object_color: varies (e.g., 7, 2, 8, 1)
        object_count: varies (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 2)
        unique_object_color_count: 1
  - type: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - height: 1
      - width: matches input object_count
      - contains_only_object_color: true
      - pixel_order: follows input scan order (row-major)
transformation:
  - action: identify_pixels
    target: input grid
    condition: pixel color is not 0 (white)
  - action: count_pixels
    source: identified pixels
    result: N (width of output grid)
  - action: create_grid
    properties:
      height: 1
      width: N
      initial_color: determined by object color
  - action: populate_grid
    target: output grid
    source: identified pixels from input grid
    order: row-major scan order of input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
2.  Count the total number (N) of these non-white pixels.
3.  Create a new output grid with 1 row and N columns.
4.  Iterate through the input grid, scanning row by row from top to bottom, and within each row, scanning column by column from left to right.
5.  For each non-white pixel encountered during the scan, place its color into the next available column in the output grid, starting from the leftmost column (index 0).
6.  The final output grid contains all the non-white pixels from the input, arranged horizontally in the order they were found.
