They are scattered within the input grid.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids have a height of 1. The width varies.\n5.  **Output Content:** The output grids contain only the non-white color found in the corresponding input grid.\n6.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to extract all the non-white pixels from the input grid and arrange them horizontally in a single row in the output grid.\n7.  **Pixel Count:** The number of pixels in the output grid equals the number of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n8.  **Order:** The order of the pixels in the output row seems to correspond to the order they are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
