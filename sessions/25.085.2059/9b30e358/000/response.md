Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels (colors). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in each example.
2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid seems to have a dominant "background" color (gray in train_1, green in train_2).
3.  **Pattern Identification:** In both inputs, there's a distinct, contiguous block of rows located towards the bottom that contains pixels differing from the background color. The rows above this block consist solely of the background color. Let's call this the "source pattern block".
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be constructed by taking the source pattern block from the input and repeating it vertically to fill the entire output grid height.
5.  **Conditional Logic:** Comparing train_1 and train_2 reveals a nuance.
    *   In train_1, the source pattern block (rows 5-9, height 5) is tiled directly (rows 5-9 appear in output rows 0-4, then again in output rows 5-9).
    *   In train_2, the source pattern block (rows 6-9, height 4) seems to be internally rearranged *before* tiling. Specifically, the bottom half of the pattern block (rows 8-9) is moved to the top, followed by the original top half (rows 6-7). This rearranged block {row 8, row 9, row 6, row 7} is then tiled vertically to fill the output.
6.  **Hypothesis:** The difference in behavior seems linked to the height of the source pattern block. If the height is odd (like 5 in train_1), the block is tiled as is. If the height is even (like 4 in train_2), the block is split into top and bottom halves, the order is swapped (bottom half then top half), and this rearranged block is tiled.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_tiling

components:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - height: H_in
        - width: W_in
        - background_color: most frequent color
        - pattern_block:
            type: subgrid (contiguous rows)
            location: exists as a single block, typically preceded by background-only rows
            properties:
              - contains_non_background_pixels: true
              - start_row: index of the first row with non-background pixels
              - end_row: index of the last row with non-background pixels
              - height: H_pattern = end_row - start_row + 1
              - rows: list of rows constituting the pattern
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - height: H_out = H_in
        - width: W_out = W_in
        - content: derived exclusively from the input pattern_block rows

transformation:
  - name: identify_background_and_pattern
    description: Find the most frequent color as background. Identify the contiguous block of rows containing non-background colors (pattern_block). Determine its height (H_pattern).
  - name: determine_tiling_unit
    description: Check the parity of H_pattern.
    conditions:
      - if H_pattern is odd:
          action: The tiling_unit is the pattern_block itself.
      - if H_pattern is even:
          action: Calculate mid = H_pattern / 2. Split pattern_block into top_half (first mid rows) and bottom_half (last mid rows). The tiling_unit is the vertical concatenation of bottom_half followed by top_half.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input. Fill the output grid rows by vertically tiling the tiling_unit. For output row index `i`, the content is taken from row `i % H_pattern` of the tiling_unit.

relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions match the input grid dimensions.
  - The content of the output grid is solely determined by the rows within the identified pattern_block of the input grid.
  - The method of constructing the tiling unit depends on the height (specifically, the parity) of the pattern_block.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid to determine its height and width. Identify the most frequent pixel color and designate it as the `background_color`.
2.  **Locate Pattern Block:** Scan the input grid row by row from top to bottom. Find the first row (`start_row`) that contains any pixel color different from the `background_color`. Continue scanning to find the last row (`end_row`) that contains any pixel color different from the `background_color`. Extract all rows from `start_row` to `end_row` inclusive; this is the `source_pattern_block`. Calculate its height, `H_pattern`.
3.  **Prepare Tiling Unit:**
    *   If `H_pattern` is an odd number, the `tiling_unit` is identical to the `source_pattern_block`.
    *   If `H_pattern` is an even number, calculate `mid = H_pattern / 2`. Split the `source_pattern_block` into the `top_half` (the first `mid` rows) and the `bottom_half` (the last `mid` rows). Construct the `tiling_unit` by vertically stacking the `bottom_half` followed by the `top_half`.
4.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid. Iterate through each row index `i` from 0 to `output_height - 1`. For each row `i`, determine the corresponding row index `j` within the `tiling_unit` using the formula `j = i % H_pattern`. Copy the row `j` from the `tiling_unit` to row `i` of the output grid.
5.  **Return Output:** The newly generated grid is the final output.
