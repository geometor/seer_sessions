            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels (colors). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in each example.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid seems to have a dominant \"background\" color (gray in train_1, green in train_2).\n3.  **Pattern Identification:** In both inputs, there's a distinct, contiguous block of rows located towards the bottom that contains pixels differing from the background color. The rows above this block consist solely of the background color. Let's call this the \"source pattern block\".\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be constructed by taking the source pattern block from the input and repeating it vertically to fill the entire output grid height.\n5.  **Conditional Logic:** Comparing train_1 and train_2 reveals a nuance.\n    *   In train_1, the source pattern block (rows 5-9, height 5) is tiled directly (rows 5-9 appear in output rows 0-4, then again in output rows 5-9).\n    *   In train_2, the source pattern block (rows 6-9, height 4) seems to be internally rearranged *before* tiling. Specifically, the bottom half of the pattern block (rows 8-9) is moved to the top, followed by the original top half (rows 6-7). This rearranged block {row 8, row 9, row 6, row 7} is then tiled vertically to fill the output.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** The difference in behavior seems linked to the height of the source pattern block. If the height is odd (like 5 in train_1), the block is tiled as is. If the height is even (like 4 in train_2), the block is split into top and bottom halves, the order is swapped (bottom half then top half), and this rearranged block is tiled.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the most frequent pixel color and designate it as the `background_color`.\n2.  **Locate Pattern Block:** Scan the input grid row by row from top to bottom. Find the first row (`start_row`) that contains any pixel color different from the `background_color`. Continue scanning to find the last row (`end_row`) that contains any pixel color different from the `background_color`. Extract all rows from `start_row` to `end_row` inclusive; this is the `source_pattern_block`. Calculate its height, `H_pattern`.\n3.  **Prepare Tiling Unit:**\n    *   If `H_pattern` is an odd number, the `tiling_unit` is identical to the `source_pattern_block`.\n    *   If `H_pattern` is an even number, calculate `mid = H_pattern / 2`. Split the `source_pattern_block` into the `top_half` (the first `mid` rows) and the `bottom_half` (the last `mid` rows). Construct the `tiling_unit` by vertically stacking the `bottom_half` followed by the `top_half`.\n4.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid. Iterate through each row index `i` from 0 to `output_height - 1`. For each row `i`, determine the corresponding row index `j` within the `tiling_unit` using the formula `j = i % H_pattern`. Copy the row `j` from the `tiling_unit` to row `i` of the output grid.\n5.  **Return Output:** The newly generated grid is the final output."
