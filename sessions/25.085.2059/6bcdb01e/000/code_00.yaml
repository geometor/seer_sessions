task_description: Fill an area defined by boundaries starting from a seed color.

elements:
  - object: boundary
    color: 8 (azure)
    property: static_position
    role: Acts as a barrier to the fill operation.
  - object: seed
    color: 3 (green)
    property: static_position
    role: Defines the starting point(s) for the fill operation.
  - object: fillable_area
    color: 7 (orange)
    property: dynamic_color
    role: Represents the pixels eligible to be changed during the fill operation.
  - object: filled_area
    color: 3 (green)
    property: derived_from_fillable
    role: Represents the pixels that were originally orange but changed to green.

actions:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    input: grid
    output: set of coordinates for azure pixels
  - action: identify_seeds
    input: grid
    output: set of coordinates for initial green pixels
  - action: flood_fill
    parameters:
      - grid: input grid
      - start_points: coordinates from identify_seeds
      - target_color: 7 (orange)
      - fill_color: 3 (green)
      - boundary_color: 8 (azure)
    process: Change the color of target_color pixels to fill_color if they are connected (up, down, left, right) to the start_points or other newly filled pixels, without crossing boundary_color pixels or grid edges.
    output: modified grid

relationships:
  - connectivity: Pixels are connected if they share a side (4-connectivity).
  - bounding: Azure pixels bound the area where the flood fill can occur. Orange pixels outside the area reachable from the seed without crossing a boundary remain orange.
