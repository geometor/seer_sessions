The initial positions of the Green (3) pixels also remain unchanged.\n4.  **Dynamic Elements:** Some Orange (7) pixels in the input grid are changed to Green (3) in the output grid.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to be a \"fill\" operation. It seems like the area containing Orange pixels, which is connected (sharing a side, not just a corner) to the initial Green pixels, gets filled with Green. This filling process is bounded by the Azure pixels. The Azure pixels act as barriers that the Green color cannot cross.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Perform a flood fill operation starting from the seed pixels:\n    *   Maintain a list or queue of pixels to visit, initially containing all seed pixel coordinates.\n    *   Maintain a set of visited pixels to avoid redundant checks.\n    *   While the list/queue is not empty:\n        *   Take a pixel coordinate from the list/queue.\n        *   Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n        *   For each neighbor:\n            *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries, has the fillable color (Orange, 7), and has not been visited:\n                *   Change the neighbor's color in the output grid to the fill color (Green, 3).\n                *   Mark the neighbor as visited.\n                *   Add the neighbor's coordinate to the list/queue.\n5.
