Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids maintain the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors Present:** The grids use three colors: Azure (8), Orange (7), and Green (3).
3.  **Static Elements:** The positions of the Azure (8) pixels remain unchanged between the input and output grids. The initial positions of the Green (3) pixels also remain unchanged.
4.  **Dynamic Elements:** Some Orange (7) pixels in the input grid are changed to Green (3) in the output grid.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to be a "fill" operation. It seems like the area containing Orange pixels, which is connected (sharing a side, not just a corner) to the initial Green pixels, gets filled with Green. This filling process is bounded by the Azure pixels. The Azure pixels act as barriers that the Green color cannot cross.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Fill an area defined by boundaries starting from a seed color.

elements:
  - object: boundary
    color: 8 (azure)
    property: static_position
    role: Acts as a barrier to the fill operation.
  - object: seed
    color: 3 (green)
    property: static_position
    role: Defines the starting point(s) for the fill operation.
  - object: fillable_area
    color: 7 (orange)
    property: dynamic_color
    role: Represents the pixels eligible to be changed during the fill operation.
  - object: filled_area
    color: 3 (green)
    property: derived_from_fillable
    role: Represents the pixels that were originally orange but changed to green.

actions:
  - action: identify_boundaries
    input: grid
    output: set of coordinates for azure pixels
  - action: identify_seeds
    input: grid
    output: set of coordinates for initial green pixels
  - action: flood_fill
    parameters:
      - grid: input grid
      - start_points: coordinates from identify_seeds
      - target_color: 7 (orange)
      - fill_color: 3 (green)
      - boundary_color: 8 (azure)
    process: Change the color of target_color pixels to fill_color if they are connected (up, down, left, right) to the start_points or other newly filled pixels, without crossing boundary_color pixels or grid edges.
    output: modified grid

relationships:
  - connectivity: Pixels are connected if they share a side (4-connectivity).
  - bounding: Azure pixels bound the area where the flood fill can occur. Orange pixels outside the area reachable from the seed without crossing a boundary remain orange.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels with the seed color (Green, 3) in the input grid. These are the starting points for the fill.
3.  Identify all pixels with the boundary color (Azure, 8). These act as barriers.
4.  Perform a flood fill operation starting from the seed pixels:
    *   Maintain a list or queue of pixels to visit, initially containing all seed pixel coordinates.
    *   Maintain a set of visited pixels to avoid redundant checks.
    *   While the list/queue is not empty:
        *   Take a pixel coordinate from the list/queue.
        *   Examine its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        *   For each neighbor:
            *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries, has the fillable color (Orange, 7), and has not been visited:
                *   Change the neighbor's color in the output grid to the fill color (Green, 3).
                *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
                *   Add the neighbor's coordinate to the list/queue.
5.  The resulting modified grid is the final output.
