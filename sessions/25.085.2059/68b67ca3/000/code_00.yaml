task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid:
  properties:
    height: 6
    width: 6
    pixels: integers 0-9
    structure: Contains non-white pixels primarily at even row and even column indices. Rows and columns with odd indices are typically white.
output_grid:
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3
    pixels: integers 0-9
transformation:
  type: subsampling
  description: >
    Selects pixels from the input grid to create the output grid.
  mapping:
    input_coords: (r_in, c_in)
    output_coords: (r_out, c_out)
    rule: output[r_out, c_out] = input[r_out * 2, c_out * 2]
    details: Takes every second pixel starting from the top-left corner (0,0) along both rows and columns.
