This suggests a downscaling or subsampling operation where the output grid is half the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\n\nObserving the placement of non-white pixels in the input grids, they appear only in rows 0, 2, and 4, and columns 0, 2, and 4. All other rows (1, 3, 5) and columns (1, 3, 5) consist entirely of white pixels (0).\n\nComparing the input and output grids pixel by pixel reveals a direct mapping:\n- The pixel at output coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` corresponds to the pixel at input coordinate `(r_in, c_in)`.\n- The relationship seems to be `r_in = r_out * 2` and `c_in = c_out * 2`.\n\nThis pattern holds across all provided examples. The transformation effectively extracts pixels from the input grid at even row and even column indices to form the smaller output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
