  - description: Analysis of input grid structure.
    observations:
      - property: Input grids can have varying dimensions.
      - property: Input grids exhibit repetitive patterns.
      - pattern_type: Row-wise uniformity - Each row contains only one distinct value repeated across columns (Examples 1, 4, 5).
      - pattern_type: Grid-wise uniformity - All rows in the grid are identical copies of each other (Examples 2, 3).
      - feature: Consecutive identical rows can exist (Example 4).
      - feature: Consecutive identical values can exist within a row (Example 3).

  - description: Analysis of output grid structure.
    observations:
      - property: Output grids are simpler than input grids, typically 1D (single row or single column).
      - correlation: Output is a single column when input has row-wise uniformity.
      - correlation: Output is a single row when input has grid-wise uniformity.

  - description: Core transformation logic involves identifying and processing repetitive patterns.
    actions:
      - action: Identify the primary repetition type (row-wise or grid-wise uniformity).
      - action: If grid-wise uniformity, extract the unique row pattern.
      - action: If row-wise uniformity, extract the unique value from each row, forming a sequence.
      - action: Apply deduplication to the extracted sequence or row pattern.
      - sub_action: Deduplication removes consecutive identical elements.
      - rule: Deduplication applies horizontally within the row pattern for grid-wise uniformity (Example 3).
      - rule: Deduplication applies vertically to the sequence of row values for row-wise uniformity (Example 4).

  - description: Construction of the output grid.
    actions:
      - action: If grid-wise uniformity was detected, arrange the deduplicated row pattern as a single output row.
      - action: If row-wise uniformity was detected, arrange the deduplicated sequence of row values as a single output column.
