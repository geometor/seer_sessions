            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids vary in size. A key observation across all examples is the repetition of values, either within rows or across rows.\n    *   In examples 1, 4, and 5, each row consists of a single value repeated across the columns (e.g., `[2, 2]`, `[4, 4, 4, 4]`). Example 4 also shows consecutive rows having the same repeated value (e.g., two rows of `4`, two rows of `2`).\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, all rows within the input grid are identical copies of each other (e.g., `[3, 4, 6]` repeated, `[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]` repeated). Example 3 contains consecutive duplicate values *within* the row pattern (`3, 3`).\n\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are significantly simpler than the inputs.\n    *   In examples 1, 4, and 5, the output is a single column (Nx1 grid).\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, the output is a single row (1xM grid).\n\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the nature of repetition in the input.\n    *   **Row-wise Repetition (Examples 1, 4, 5):** When each input row contains only one repeating value, the output appears to be a column formed by taking that unique value from each row. In example 4, consecutive identical rows in the input (like the two `4` rows) seem to be collapsed into a single entry in the output column.\n    *   **Grid-wise Repetition (Examples 2, 3):** When all input rows are identical, the output appears to be derived from that single, unique row pattern. In example 3, consecutive duplicates *within* that row pattern (`3, 3`) are reduced to a single instance (`3`) in the output row.\n\n4.  **Deduplication Logic:** There appears to be a process of removing *consecutive* duplicates. This happens either:\n    *   Vertically, across the representative values of rows (Example 4: `4, 4, 2, 2, 8, 3` -> `4, 2, 8, 3`).\n    *   Horizontally, within a repeated row pattern (Example 3: `2, 3, 3, 8, 1` -> `2, 3, 8, 1`).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
