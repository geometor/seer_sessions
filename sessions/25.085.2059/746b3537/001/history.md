Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids vary in size. A key observation across all examples is the repetition of values, either within rows or across rows.
    *   In examples 1, 4, and 5, each row consists of a single value repeated across the columns (e.g., `[2, 2]`, `[4, 4, 4, 4]`). Example 4 also shows consecutive rows having the same repeated value (e.g., two rows of `4`, two rows of `2`).
    *   In examples 2 and 3, all rows within the input grid are identical copies of each other (e.g., `[3, 4, 6]` repeated, `[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]` repeated). Example 3 contains consecutive duplicate values *within* the row pattern (`3, 3`).

2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are significantly simpler than the inputs.
    *   In examples 1, 4, and 5, the output is a single column (Nx1 grid).
    *   In examples 2 and 3, the output is a single row (1xM grid).

3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation seems to depend on the nature of repetition in the input.
    *   **Row-wise Repetition (Examples 1, 4, 5):** When each input row contains only one repeating value, the output appears to be a column formed by taking that unique value from each row. In example 4, consecutive identical rows in the input (like the two `4` rows) seem to be collapsed into a single entry in the output column.
    *   **Grid-wise Repetition (Examples 2, 3):** When all input rows are identical, the output appears to be derived from that single, unique row pattern. In example 3, consecutive duplicates *within* that row pattern (`3, 3`) are reduced to a single instance (`3`) in the output row.

4.  **Deduplication Logic:** There appears to be a process of removing *consecutive* duplicates. This happens either:
    *   Vertically, across the representative values of rows (Example 4: `4, 4, 2, 2, 8, 3` -> `4, 2, 8, 3`).
    *   Horizontally, within a repeated row pattern (Example 3: `2, 3, 3, 8, 1` -> `2, 3, 8, 1`).

    observations:
      - property: Input grids can have varying dimensions.
      - property: Input grids exhibit repetitive patterns.
      - pattern_type: Row-wise uniformity - Each row contains only one distinct value repeated across columns (Examples 1, 4, 5).
      - pattern_type: Grid-wise uniformity - All rows in the grid are identical copies of each other (Examples 2, 3).
      - feature: Consecutive identical rows can exist (Example 4).
      - feature: Consecutive identical values can exist within a row (Example 3).

    observations:
      - property: Output grids are simpler than input grids, typically 1D (single row or single column).
      - correlation: Output is a single column when input has row-wise uniformity.
      - correlation: Output is a single row when input has grid-wise uniformity.

  - description: Core transformation logic involves identifying and processing repetitive patterns.
    actions:
      - action: Identify the primary repetition type (row-wise or grid-wise uniformity).
      - action: If grid-wise uniformity, extract the unique row pattern.
      - action: If row-wise uniformity, extract the unique value from each row, forming a sequence.
      - action: Apply deduplication to the extracted sequence or row pattern.
      - sub_action: Deduplication removes consecutive identical elements.
      - rule: Deduplication applies horizontally within the row pattern for grid-wise uniformity (Example 3).
      - rule: Deduplication applies vertically to the sequence of row values for row-wise uniformity (Example 4).

  - description: Construction of the output grid.
    actions:
      - action: If grid-wise uniformity was detected, arrange the deduplicated row pattern as a single output row.
      - action: If row-wise uniformity was detected, arrange the deduplicated sequence of row values as a single output column.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input grid to determine the type of uniformity:
    a.  Check if all rows in the input grid are identical. If yes, proceed to Step 2 (Grid-wise Uniformity).
    b.  If not all rows are identical, check if *each* row consists of only a single value repeated across its columns. If yes, proceed to Step 3 (Row-wise Uniformity).
    c.  (Implicitly) If neither condition is met, the logic might be different (though not represented in these examples).

2.  **Grid-wise Uniformity:**
    a.  Take one instance of the identical row pattern from the input.
    b.  Process this row pattern by removing any *consecutive* duplicate values within it.
    c.  The output is a single row grid containing this processed pattern.

3.  **Row-wise Uniformity:**
    a.  Create a vertical sequence (list) where each element is the unique value found in the corresponding row of the input grid.
    b.  Process this sequence by removing any *consecutive* duplicate values within it.
    c.  The output is a single column grid containing this processed sequence.
