It's possible the task only applies to square grids, or the transformation naturally works for non-square grids too (although matrix transpose is typically defined for any dimension). Assuming square grids based on examples.\n    *   There is a prominent diagonal line of `grey (5)` pixels running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in the input grids. These `grey (5)` pixels remain in the exact same positions in the output grids.\n    *   Other colored pixels exist in the input grids, generally located off this main diagonal.\n    *   In the output grids, these off-diagonal pixels have moved. Their positions appear to be mirrored across the main `grey (5)` diagonal.\n    *   Specifically, a pixel at input position (row `r`, column `c`) moves to output position (column `c`, row `r`), *unless* `r` equals `c` (i.e., the pixel is on the main diagonal).\n    *   This operation is equivalent to a matrix transpose, but with the constraint that the elements on the main diagonal remain fixed. An alternative way to achieve this is to swap the values of cell `(r, c)` and `(c, r)` for all pairs where `r < c`.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
