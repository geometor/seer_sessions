import copy

"""
Transforms the input grid by swapping the values of pixels at symmetric positions (r, c) and (c, r) across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), for all pairs where r != c. Pixels on the main diagonal (where r == c) remain unchanged. This is equivalent to a matrix transpose operation where the main diagonal elements are fixed.
