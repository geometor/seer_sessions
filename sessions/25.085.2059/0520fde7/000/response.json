Create a new output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and a width equal to the number of columns to the left of the central gray line (which is also equal to the number of columns to the right of the gray line in these examples, specifically 3 columns). Initialize this output grid with white pixels (0).\n    2.  Identify the column index of the vertical gray line (color 5) in the input grid. Let this be `gray_col_index`.\n    3.  Iterate through each row `i` of the input grid (from top to bottom).\n    4.  For each row `i`, iterate through the columns `j` from 0 up to (but not including) `gray_col_index`. This corresponds to iterating through the columns of the left side of the input grid and simultaneously the columns of the output grid.\n    5.  Inside this loop, check if the pixel at `(i, j)` in the input grid is blue (1) AND the pixel at `(i, gray_col_index + 1 + j)` in the input grid (the corresponding mirrored position on the right side) is also blue (1).\n    6.  If both pixels are blue, set the pixel at `(i, j)` in the output grid to red (2).\n    7.  If the condition in step 5 is not met, the pixel at `(i, j)` in the output grid remains white (0).\n    8.  After iterating through all rows and relevant columns, the resulting output grid is complete."
