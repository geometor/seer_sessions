## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it incorrectly assumed all input grids consist of a single row. The error message "Input grid should be a list containing a single list (row)" across all examples confirms that the input grids in this task are multi-row. The core logic of identifying a horizontal block of color followed by white space and then extending that color might still be relevant, but it needs to be adapted to operate within a potentially larger, multi-row grid context. The transformation likely modifies the input grid structure rather than generating a completely new one based solely on the first row. The output grid probably has the same dimensions as the input grid. The transformation seems to involve locating a specific pattern (a horizontal bar ending before the grid edge) and adding pixels diagonally downwards and to the right from the end of this bar.

## Metrics Gathering

Based on the previous code's logic and the error encountered, we infer the following likely characteristics of the examples (assuming access to the data would confirm these):

| Example | Input Shape (H x W) | Output Shape (H x W) | Identified Pattern Row (r) | Pattern Color (C) | Pattern Length (N) | Diagonal Pixels Added (Coords relative to top-left 0,0) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | (e.g., 5x8) | (e.g., 5x8) | (e.g., 2) | (e.g., 1 - blue) | (e.g., 3) | `(r+1, N)`, `(r+2, N+1)`, ... | Growth stops if out of bounds or target pixel is not white. |
| 2 | (e.g., 6x10) | (e.g., 6x10) | (e.g., 0) | (e.g., 2 - red) | (e.g., 2) | `(r+1, N)`, `(r+2, N+1)`, ... | Assumes pattern search starts from row 0. |
| 3 | (e.g., 4x6) | (e.g., 4x6) | (e.g., 1) | (e.g., 3 - green) | (e.g., 4) | `(r+1, N)`, `(r+2, N+1)`, ... |  |
| 4 | (e.g., 7x7) | (e.g., 7x7) | (e.g., 3) | (e.g., 8 - azure) | (e.g., 5) | `(r+1, N)`, `(r+2, N+1)`, ... |  |
| 5 | (e.g., 3x5) | (e.g., 3x5) | (e.g., 0) | (e.g., 5 - gray) | (e.g., 1) | `(r+1, N)`, `(r+2, N+1)`, ... |  |

*Note: The specific shapes, row indices, colors, and lengths are hypothetical examples consistent with the inferred transformation logic. Actual data is needed for confirmation.*

    Process:
      1. Iterate with step `k` starting from 1.
      2. Calculate target coordinates: `(target_r, target_c) = (r + k, (N-1) + k + 1) = (r + k, N + k -1)`. NO, wait, the index *after* the block is N. So it should be `(target_r, target_c) = (r + k, N + k)`. Let's recheck. Previous code: `change_index = initial_non_white_count + (i - 1)`. If `initial_non_white_count` is N, and `i` is the step (starting from 1), then the column index is `N + k - 1`. The row index is `r + k`. So, `(target_r, target_c) = (r + k, N + k - 1)`.
      3. Check if `target_r` < H and `target_c` < W.
      4. Check if `InputGrid[target_r][target_c]` is white (0).
      5. If both checks pass, set `OutputGrid[target_r][target_c] = C`.
      6. Stop iterating when checks fail.
    Output: Modified OutputGrid
```

*Correction:* Recalculated the target coordinates based on the previous code logic. The `i`-th pixel added (where `i` starts from 1) was at column index `N + (i-1)`. This corresponds to `N + k - 1` where `k` is the step number (also starting from 1). The row increases by `k` relative to the block's row `r`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row, from top (row 0) to bottom.
3.  In each row, scan from left (column 0) to right.
4.  Identify the *first* occurrence of a horizontal, contiguous block of a single non-white color (let's call this color C) that is immediately followed by a white pixel (color 0).
5.  Once this first block is found, record its color C, its length N (number of pixels of color C), and the row index `r` where it was found. Stop searching for other blocks.
6.  If no such block is found in the entire grid, return the unmodified copy of the input grid.
7.  If a block (C, N, r) is found, proceed to modify the output grid:
    a.  Start an iteration counter `k` at 1.
    b.  Calculate the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c)` where `target_r = r + k` and `target_c = N + k - 1`.
    c.  Check if the `target_r` is less than the grid height and `target_c` is less than the grid width (i.e., the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries).
    d.  If the target coordinates are within bounds, check if the pixel at `(target_r, target_c)` in the *original input grid* was white (0).
    e.  If both conditions (within bounds AND original pixel was white) are true, change the pixel at `(target_r, target_c)` in the *output grid* to color C.
    f.  Increment `k` by 1 and repeat steps 7b-7e.
    g.  Stop this iterative process (adding diagonal pixels) as soon as either the target coordinates go out of bounds OR the pixel at the target coordinates in the original input grid was not white.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
