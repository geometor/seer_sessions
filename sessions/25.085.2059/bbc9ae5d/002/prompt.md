"""
The transformation rule operates on a single input row containing an initial contiguous block of identical non-white pixels followed by zero or more white pixels.

1.  Determine the width (W) of the input row.
2.  Determine the height (H) of the output grid, which is calculated as W // 2 (integer division).
3.  Identify the non-white color (C) present in the initial block of the input row.
4.  Count the number of pixels (N) in this initial non-white block.
5.  Initialize the output grid with dimensions H x W.
6.  Set the first row (row 0) of the output grid to be identical to the input row.
7.  Generate the subsequent rows (from row 1 to H-1):
    a.  Start with a copy of the previous row (row i-1).
    b.  Locate the index of the first white pixel in that row. This index corresponds to the position immediately after the current block of non-white pixels, which is at index N + (i-1).
    c.  Change the pixel at this index from white (0) to the non-white color C.
    d.  Place this modified row into the output grid at row index i.
8.  Return the completed H x W output grid.
