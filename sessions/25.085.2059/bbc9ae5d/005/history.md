"""
1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid row by row, from top (row 0) to bottom.
3.  In each row, scan from left (column 0) to right.
4.  Identify the *first* occurrence of a horizontal, contiguous block of a single non-white color (let's call this color C) that is immediately followed by a white pixel (color 0).
5.  Once this first block is found, record its color C, its length N (number of pixels of color C), and the row index `r` where it was found. Stop searching for other blocks.
6.  If no such block is found in the entire grid, return the unmodified copy of the input grid.
7.  If a block (C, N, r) is found, proceed to modify the output grid:
    a.  Start an iteration counter `k` at 1.
    b.  Calculate the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c)` where `target_r = r + k` and `target_c = N + k - 1`. (Note: N here is the length, so the column index after the block is N if starting from col 0. Let's re-verify. If block starts at col `s`, it ends at `s+N-1`. The next col is `s+N`. The NL program uses `N` as length. The calculation `N + k - 1` seems based on the assumption the block starts at column 0. It should rather be `(start_col + N) + k - 1`. Let's recalculate based on position: first pixel added is at `(r+1, start_col + N)`. Second is at `(r+2, start_col + N + 1)`, etc. So `target_r = r + k`, `target_c = start_col + N + k - 1`.) Let's adjust the helper to return start_col too.
    c.  Check if the `target_r` is less than the grid height and `target_c` is less than the grid width (i.e., the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries).
    d.  If the target coordinates are within bounds, check if the pixel at `(target_r, target_c)` in the *original input grid* was white (0).
    e.  If both conditions (within bounds AND original pixel was white) are true, change the pixel at `(target_r, target_c)` in the *output grid* to color C.
    f.  Increment `k` by 1 and repeat steps 7b-7e.
    g.  Stop this iterative process (adding diagonal pixels) as soon as either the target coordinates go out of bounds OR the pixel at the target coordinates in the original input grid was not white.
8.  Return the modified output grid.

*Correction*: Adjusted the target column calculation in the natural language program and will adjust the code accordingly. The helper function will return the starting column `s` of the block. The target column will be `target_c = s + N + k - 1`.

## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it was based on an incomplete hypothesis derived from a single example (or a misinterpretation). The key failures were:
1.  **Incorrect Output Dimensions:** The code did not account for the fact that the output grid's height increases relative to the input grid. It attempted to modify pixels within the original grid boundaries only.
2.  **Flawed Transformation Logic:** The logic for adding pixels diagonally was either implemented incorrectly or based on a wrong pattern. The actual transformation involves adding new rows and extending a colored block diagonally downwards and to the right in each new row.

The strategy to resolve these errors is to:
1.  Re-analyze all provided examples to identify the consistent pattern of transformation, paying close attention to how the output grid dimensions change and how new pixels are added.
2.  Formulate a new hypothesis that correctly captures the relationship between the input block, the grid width, the output grid height, and the placement of new colored pixels.
3.  Update the natural language program to accurately reflect this revised understanding.

## Metrics and Observations

All input examples consist of a single row (Height=1). The output height varies.
