## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it was based on an incomplete hypothesis derived from a single example (or a misinterpretation). The key failures were:
1.  **Incorrect Output Dimensions:** The code did not account for the fact that the output grid's height increases relative to the input grid. It attempted to modify pixels within the original grid boundaries only.
2.  **Flawed Transformation Logic:** The logic for adding pixels diagonally was either implemented incorrectly or based on a wrong pattern. The actual transformation involves adding new rows and extending a colored block diagonally downwards and to the right in each new row.

The strategy to resolve these errors is to:
1.  Re-analyze all provided examples to identify the consistent pattern of transformation, paying close attention to how the output grid dimensions change and how new pixels are added.
2.  Formulate a new hypothesis that correctly captures the relationship between the input block, the grid width, the output grid height, and the placement of new colored pixels.
3.  Update the natural language program to accurately reflect this revised understanding.

## Metrics and Observations

All input examples consist of a single row (Height=1). The output height varies.
