Determine the width (W) of the input row.\n2.  Determine the height (H) of the output grid, which is calculated as W // 2 (integer division).\n3.  Identify the non-white color (C) present in the initial block of the input row.\n4.  Count the number of pixels (N) in this initial non-white block.\n5.  Initialize the output grid with dimensions H x W.\n6.  Set the first row (row 0) of the output grid to be identical to the input row.\n7.  Generate the subsequent rows (from row 1 to H-1):\n    a.  Start with a copy of the previous row (row i-1).\n    b.  Locate the index of the first white pixel in that row. This index corresponds to the position immediately after the current block of non-white pixels, which is at index N + (i-1).\n    c.  Change the pixel at this index from white (0) to the non-white color C.\n    d.  Place this modified row into the output grid at row index i.\n8.
