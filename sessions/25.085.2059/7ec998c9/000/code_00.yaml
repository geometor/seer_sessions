task_description: "Draw blue lines connecting grid edges based on the position of a single unique pixel, with line direction varying based on the pixel's row parity."

elements:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - height: H (variable)
      - width: W (variable)
      - background_color: bg (variable, dominant color in input)
  - object: unique_pixel
    properties:
      - color: px_color (different from bg)
      - location: (r, c) (single instance in input)
  - object: blue_lines
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: Composed of one vertical segment and two horizontal segments.
      - location:
          - vertical_segment: Column c, extending from row 0 to H-1, excluding row r.
          - top_horizontal_segment: Row 0. Extends either from column 0 to c OR from column c to W-1.
          - bottom_horizontal_segment: Row H-1. Extends either from column 0 to c OR from column c to W-1.

relationships:
  - type: defines
    source: unique_pixel.location(r, c)
    target: blue_lines.location
    details: "The column c defines the vertical line's position. The row r defines the gap in the vertical line."
  - type: controls
    source: unique_pixel.location.r (parity)
    target: blue_lines.location (horizontal segments' direction)
    details: |
      If r is odd:
        - Top line runs from column 0 to c.
        - Bottom line runs from column c to W-1.
      If r is even:
        - Top line runs from column c to W-1.
        - Bottom line runs from column 0 to c.

actions:
  - action: identify
    parameters: [input_grid]
    output: [background_color, unique_pixel(px_color, r, c), grid_dimensions(H, W)]
  - action: draw_vertical_line
    parameters: [output_grid, column(c), height(H), skip_row(r), color(blue)]
    condition: "Target pixel must have background_color."
  - action: draw_horizontal_lines
    parameters: [output_grid, column(c), width(W), height(H), row_parity(r), color(blue)]
    condition: "Target pixel must have background_color."
    details: "Draws lines on row 0 and row H-1 based on the parity rule."
  - action: preserve
    parameters: [output_grid, unique_pixel(px_color, r, c)]
    details: "Ensure the pixel at (r, c) retains its original color px_color."
