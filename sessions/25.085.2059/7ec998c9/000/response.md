Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid consists of a uniform background color with a single pixel of a different, unique color. The grid sizes and colors (background and unique pixel) vary across examples.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid retains the original dimensions and the unique pixel from the input grid at its original location. The background color also largely persists, but some background pixels are changed to blue (1).
3.  **Pattern of Change:** The pixels changed to blue (1) form a specific pattern related to the position of the unique pixel. This pattern consists of:
    *   A vertical line segment along the column of the unique pixel. This line extends from the top edge to the bottom edge but *skips* the row containing the unique pixel itself.
    *   Two horizontal line segments, one along the top edge (row 0) and one along the bottom edge (last row).
4.  **Horizontal Line Variation:** The exact extent and direction of the horizontal blue lines on the top and bottom edges depend on the row index of the unique pixel in the input grid.
    *   In Example 1 (pixel at row 3, which is odd), the top line goes from the left edge *to* the unique pixel's column, and the bottom line goes *from* the unique pixel's column to the right edge.
    *   In Example 2 (pixel at row 2, which is even), the top line goes *from* the unique pixel's column to the right edge, and the bottom line goes from the left edge *to* the unique pixel's column.
    *   In Example 3 (pixel at row 3, which is odd), the pattern matches Example 1: top line from left to pixel column, bottom line from pixel column to right.
5.  **Rule Dependency:** The rule determining which way the horizontal lines are drawn (left-to-column/column-to-right vs. column-to-right/left-to-column) seems to depend on the parity (odd or even) of the row index of the unique input pixel.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color (`bg`), the color (`px_color`) and location (`r`, `c`) of the single unique pixel in the input grid. Determine the grid's height (`H`) and width (`W`).
2.  Create an output grid of the same dimensions (`H`x`W`), initially filled with the background color (`bg`).
3.  Place the unique pixel color (`px_color`) at location (`r`, `c`) in the output grid.
4.  Draw the vertical blue line: For each row `i` from 0 to `H-1`, if `i` is not equal to `r`, set the pixel at `(i, c)` in the output grid to blue (1).
5.  Check if the row index `r` is odd or even.
6.  If `r` is odd:
    *   Draw the top horizontal blue line: For each column `j` from 0 to `c` (inclusive), set the pixel at `(0, j)` to blue (1).
    *   Draw the bottom horizontal blue line: For each column `j` from `c` to `W-1` (inclusive), set the pixel at `(H-1, j)` to blue (1).
7.  If `r` is even:
    *   Draw the top horizontal blue line: For each column `j` from `c` to `W-1` (inclusive), set the pixel at `(0, j)` to blue (1).
    *   Draw the bottom horizontal blue line: For each column `j` from 0 to `c` (inclusive), set the pixel at `(H-1, j)` to blue (1).
8.  Return the completed output grid. (Note: Steps 4, 6, and 7 should only change pixels that were originally the background color; the unique pixel at (r,c) must remain unchanged from step 3).
