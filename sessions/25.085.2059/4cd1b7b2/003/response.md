"""
Processes the input grid row by row.
For each row, identifies the colors from the set {1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow)} that are present.
Calculates the sum of these present colors (sum_present).
Determines which colors from this set are missing in the row.
Calculates the sum of these missing colors (sum_missing).
Finds the positions (columns) of the white (0) pixels in that row.
Sorts the white pixel positions by column index (ascending).
Sorts the missing colors based on a condition:
- If sum_missing < sum_present, sort missing colors in descending order.
- Otherwise, sort missing colors in ascending order.
Fills the white pixels in the row with the sorted missing colors, assigning them according to the sorted white pixel positions.
Non-white pixels remain unchanged.
