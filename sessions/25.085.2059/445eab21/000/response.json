The two rectangles always have different colors and sizes. The output grid is consistently a 2x2 square filled with a single color. This output color matches the color of one of the rectangles present in the input grid. By comparing the sizes of the two rectangles in each example, it appears the output color is determined by the color of the rectangle that occupies the larger area (calculated by its bounding box).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
