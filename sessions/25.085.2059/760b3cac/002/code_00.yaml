Input_Grid:
  - Contains pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).
  - Contains at least one azure object (contiguous pixels of color 8).
  - Contains at least one yellow object (contiguous pixels of color 4).

Objects:
  - Azure_Object:
    - Composed of all azure pixels (color 8).
    - Properties:
      - Set of pixel coordinates `{(r, c)}`.
      - Leftmost column index `min_col`.
      - Rightmost column index `max_col`.
      - Average column index `avg_col_azure`.
  - Yellow_Object:
    - Composed of all yellow pixels (color 4).
    - Properties:
      - Set of pixel coordinates `{(r, c)}`.
      - Average column index `avg_col_yellow`.

Relationships:
  - Relative_Horizontal_Position: Determined by comparing `avg_col_yellow` and `avg_col_azure`.

Actions:
  - Identify_Objects: Locate all azure and yellow pixels and calculate their properties (`min_col`, `max_col`, `avg_col`).
  - Determine_Reflection_Axis:
    - If `avg_col_yellow >= avg_col_azure`: The reflection axis is vertical, positioned at `x = max_col + 0.5`. Reflection occurs to the right.
    - If `avg_col_yellow < avg_col_azure`: The reflection axis is vertical, positioned at `x = min_col - 0.5`. Reflection occurs to the left.
  - Reflect_Azure_Pixels:
    - For each azure pixel `(r, c)` in the Azure_Object:
      - Calculate its reflected column coordinate `reflected_c` based on the determined reflection axis.
        - Right reflection: `reflected_c = 2 * max_col + 1 - c`
        - Left reflection: `reflected_c = 2 * min_col - 1 - c`
      - If the reflected coordinate `(r, reflected_c)` is within the grid bounds, mark it for addition.
  - Update_Grid:
    - Create a copy of the Input_Grid.
    - Add all calculated, valid reflected azure pixels (color 8) to the copied grid. Original pixels (azure, yellow, white, etc.) are preserved.

Output_Grid:
  - The modified grid containing the original pixels plus the reflected azure pixels.
  - If no azure pixels were present in the input, the Output_Grid is identical to the Input_Grid.
