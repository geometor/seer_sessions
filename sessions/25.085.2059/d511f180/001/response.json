For each pixel, examine its 8 neighbors (including diagonals) in the input grid.\n3.  If the current pixel is gray (5) and has at least one azure (8) neighbor, change its color to azure (8) in the output grid.\n4.  If the current pixel is azure (8) and has at least one gray (5) neighbor, change its color to gray (5) in the output grid.\n5.  If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., the pixel is not gray or azure, or it is gray/azure but lacks the triggering neighbor color), keep its original color in the output grid.\n6.
