Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. The grid sizes vary between examples (3x3, 5x5).
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used include green(3), gray(5), blue(1), yellow(4), azure(8), red(2), maroon(9), orange(7), magenta(6). However, the transformation seems to primarily involve gray(5) and azure(8) pixels.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between the input and output grids exclusively affect pixels that are either gray(5) or azure(8) in the input. All other colored pixels remain in their original positions and retain their colors.
4.  **Interaction Rule:** The change appears to depend on the neighboring pixels. Specifically:
    *   A gray(5) pixel in the input becomes azure(8) in the output *if* it is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one azure(8) pixel in the input.
    *   An azure(8) pixel in the input becomes gray(5) in the output *if* it is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one gray(5) pixel in the input.
5.  **Simultaneity:** The changes seem to be determined based solely on the input grid state. All pixels are evaluated based on their input neighbors, and the output grid is constructed based on these evaluations. The transformation is applied simultaneously across the grid, not sequentially.
6.  **No Change Condition:** If a gray(5) pixel has no azure(8) neighbors, it remains gray(5). If an azure(8) pixel has no gray(5) neighbors, it remains azure(8).

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      - colors: 0-9 mapped to specific colors
      - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9
      - position: (row, column) coordinate
      - neighbors: 8 adjacent pixels (including diagonals)

transformation:
  - type: conditional color change
  - focus: pixels with color gray (5) or azure (8)
  - rules:
      - rule: 1
        condition: Input pixel color is gray (5) AND at least one neighbor (8 directions) in the input grid has color azure (8).
        action: Change pixel color to azure (8) in the output grid.
      - rule: 2
        condition: Input pixel color is azure (8) AND at least one neighbor (8 directions) in the input grid has color gray (5).
        action: Change pixel color to gray (5) in the output grid.
      - rule: 3
        condition: Input pixel color is neither gray (5) nor azure (8).
        action: Keep the input pixel color in the output grid.
      - rule: 4
        condition: Input pixel color is gray (5) AND NO neighbor has color azure (8).
        action: Keep the input pixel color (gray, 5) in the output grid.
      - rule: 5
        condition: Input pixel color is azure (8) AND NO neighbor has color gray (5).
        action: Keep the input pixel color (azure, 8) in the output grid.
  - characteristic: All pixels are evaluated based on the input grid state simultaneously to produce the output grid.

invariance:
  - Pixels with colors other than gray (5) or azure (8) always remain unchanged.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell `(row, col)` of the input grid.
3.  For each cell, determine its `input_color` from the input grid.
4.  Identify the colors of the 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid, being careful to handle boundary conditions (cells outside the grid are not considered neighbors).
5.  Apply the following logic to determine the color for the corresponding cell `(row, col)` in the output grid:
    a.  If the `input_color` is gray (5):
        i.  Check if any of its input neighbors have the color azure (8).
        ii. If yes, set the output cell color to azure (8).
        iii. If no, set the output cell color to gray (5).
    b.  If the `input_color` is azure (8):
        i.  Check if any of its input neighbors have the color gray (5).
        ii. If yes, set the output cell color to gray (5).
        iii. If no, set the output cell color to azure (8).
    c.  If the `input_color` is neither gray (5) nor azure (8), set the output cell color to the `input_color`.
6.  After iterating through all cells, return the completed output grid.
