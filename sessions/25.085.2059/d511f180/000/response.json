            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. The grid sizes vary between examples (3x3, 5x5).\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used include green(3), gray(5), blue(1), yellow(4), azure(8), red(2), maroon(9), orange(7), magenta(6). However, the transformation seems to primarily involve gray(5) and azure(8) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between the input and output grids exclusively affect pixels that are either gray(5) or azure(8) in the input. All other colored pixels remain in their original positions and retain their colors.\n4.  **Interaction Rule:** The change appears to depend on the neighboring pixels. Specifically:\n    *   A gray(5) pixel in the input becomes azure(8) in the output *if* it is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one azure(8) pixel in the input.\n    *   An azure(8) pixel in the input becomes gray(5) in the output *if* it is adjacent (including diagonals) to at least one gray(5) pixel in the input.\n5.  **Simultaneity:** The changes seem to be determined based solely on the input grid state. All pixels are evaluated based on their input neighbors, and the output grid is constructed based on these evaluations. The transformation is applied simultaneously across the grid, not sequentially.\n6.  **No Change Condition:** If a gray(5) pixel has no azure(8) neighbors, it remains gray(5). If an azure(8) pixel has no gray(5) neighbors, it remains azure(8).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the colors of the 8 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the *input* grid, being careful to handle boundary conditions (cells outside the grid are not considered neighbors).\n5.  Apply the following logic to determine the color for the corresponding cell `(row, col)` in the output grid:\n    a.  If the `input_color` is gray (5):\n        i.  Check if any of its input neighbors have the color azure (8).\n        ii. If yes, set the output cell color to azure (8).\n        iii. If no, set the output cell color to gray (5).\n    b.
