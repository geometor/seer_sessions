elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
      - colors: 0-9 mapped to specific colors
      - dimensions: variable height and width (up to 30x30)
  - element: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer 0-9
      - position: (row, column) coordinate
      - neighbors: 8 adjacent pixels (including diagonals)

transformation:
  - type: conditional color change
  - focus: pixels with color gray (5) or azure (8)
  - rules:
      - rule: 1
        condition: Input pixel color is gray (5) AND at least one neighbor (8 directions) in the input grid has color azure (8).
        action: Change pixel color to azure (8) in the output grid.
      - rule: 2
        condition: Input pixel color is azure (8) AND at least one neighbor (8 directions) in the input grid has color gray (5).
        action: Change pixel color to gray (5) in the output grid.
      - rule: 3
        condition: Input pixel color is neither gray (5) nor azure (8).
        action: Keep the input pixel color in the output grid.
      - rule: 4
        condition: Input pixel color is gray (5) AND NO neighbor has color azure (8).
        action: Keep the input pixel color (gray, 5) in the output grid.
      - rule: 5
        condition: Input pixel color is azure (8) AND NO neighbor has color gray (5).
        action: Keep the input pixel color (azure, 8) in the output grid.
  - characteristic: All pixels are evaluated based on the input grid state simultaneously to produce the output grid.

invariance:
  - Pixels with colors other than gray (5) or azure (8) always remain unchanged.
  - The grid dimensions remain unchanged.
