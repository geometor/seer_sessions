"""
Transforms an input grid based on the interaction between gray (5) and azure (8) pixels according to revised rules.

1.  Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying the input grid's contents.
2.  Iterate through each pixel `P` at position `(r, c)` in the **input grid**.
3.  Examine the colors of the 8 neighboring pixels of `P` in the **input grid**.
4.  Apply the following rules based on the color of pixel `P` and its neighbors in the **input grid**:
    *   **If `P` is gray (5):**
        *   Check if any neighbor is azure (8). If yes, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to azure (8).
        *   Otherwise (no azure neighbors), check if any neighbor is gray (5). If yes, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to azure (8).
        *   Otherwise (no azure and no gray neighbors), the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** remains gray (5).
    *   **If `P` is azure (8):**
        *   Check if any neighbor is gray (5). If yes, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to gray (5).
        *   Otherwise (no gray neighbors), the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** remains azure (8).
    *   **If `P` is neither gray (5) nor azure (8):**
        *   The pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** retains its original color.
5.  Return the completed **output grid**. The transformation is applied simultaneously, meaning all decisions are based on the original input grid state.
