Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying the input grid's contents.\n2.  Iterate through each pixel `P` at position `(r, c)` in the **input grid**.\n3.  Examine the colors of the 8 neighboring pixels of `P` in the **input grid**.\n4.  Apply the following rules based on the color of pixel `P` and its neighbors in the **input grid**:\n    *   **If `P` is gray (5):**\n        *   Check if any neighbor is azure (8). If yes, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to azure (8).\n        *   Otherwise (no azure neighbors), check if any neighbor is gray (5). If yes, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to azure (8).\n        *   Otherwise (no azure and no gray neighbors), the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** remains gray (5).\n    *   **If `P` is azure (8):**\n        *   Check if any neighbor is gray (5). If yes, set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** to gray (5).\n        *   Otherwise (no gray neighbors), the pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** remains azure (8).\n    *   **If `P` is neither gray (5) nor azure (8):**\n        *   The pixel at `(r, c)` in the **output grid** retains its original color.\n5.  Return the completed **output grid**. The transformation is applied simultaneously, meaning all decisions are based on the original input grid state.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _get_neighbor_colors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the colors of the 8 neighbors for a given cell (r, c).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        r (int): The row index of the cell.\n        c (int): The column index of the cell.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of colors of the valid neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    neighbor_colors = []\n    # Iterate through the 8 possible neighbor offsets (dr, dc)\n    for dr in range(-1, 2):\n        for dc in range(-1, 2):\n            # Skip the cell itself\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n            # Check if the neighbor coordinates are within the grid bounds\n            if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width:\n                neighbor_colors.append(grid[nr, nc])\n                \n    return neighbor_colors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the revised transformation rules to the input grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (np.array): A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array: A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    # This handles cases where pixels don't change or retain original color\n    # if no rule condition is met.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    gray_color = 5\n    azure_color = 8\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            current_color = input_grid[r, c]\n            \n            # Get the colors of the neighbors from the *input* grid\n            neighbor_colors = _get_neighbor_colors(input_grid, r, c)\n\n            # Apply revised transformation rules based on the input grid state\n            if current_color == gray_color:\n                # Check if any neighbor is azure\n                if azure_color in neighbor_colors:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = azure_color\n                # Else (no azure neighbor), check if any neighbor is gray\n                elif gray_color in neighbor_colors:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = azure_color\n                # Else (no azure or gray neighbors), the color remains gray (already copied)\n                    \n            elif current_color == azure_color:\n                # Check if any neighbor is gray\n                if gray_color in neighbor_colors:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = gray_color\n                # Else (no gray neighbors), the color remains azure (already copied)\n\n            # No else needed for other colors: if the color is not gray or azure, \n            # the output_grid already holds the original color from the initial copy.\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
