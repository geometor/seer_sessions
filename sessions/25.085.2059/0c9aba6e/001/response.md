"""
Compares corresponding pixels in two 6x4 subgrids extracted from the input grid. 
The input grid has a 13x4 structure, divided by a separator line (row 6, orange pixels).
The top subgrid is rows 0-5, and the bottom subgrid is rows 7-12.
The output grid is 6x4. A pixel in the output grid at (r, c) is set to azure (8) 
if and only if the corresponding pixels at (r, c) in BOTH the top and bottom 
input subgrids are white (0). Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).
