            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grids consistently have a height of 13 and a width of 4. They are visually divided into three parts:\n    *   A top section (rows 0-5, 6x4 grid) containing patterns of red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.\n    *   A single row of orange (7) pixels (row 6) acting as a horizontal separator.\n    *   A bottom section (rows 7-12, 6x4 grid) containing patterns of magenta (6) pixels on a white (0) background.\n\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output grids are always 6x4, matching the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input. They contain only azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background.\n\n3.  **Transformation Hint**: The fixed structure with the separator line and the output dimensions matching the input sections strongly suggests a comparison or combination operation between the top (red pattern) section and the bottom (magenta pattern) section. The specific colors (red, magenta, orange) in the input seem less important than their *presence* or *absence* (compared to the white background) when determining the output. The output color (azure) appears where a specific condition between the corresponding top and bottom pixels is met.\n\n4.  **Core Logic**: By comparing the input sections pixel by pixel with the output grid, a pattern emerges: An azure pixel appears in the output grid at a specific location `(r, c)` *if and only if* the pixel at the corresponding location `(r, c)` in the *top* section is white (0) AND the pixel at the corresponding location `(r, c)` in the *bottom* section (relative to its start, i.e., input row `r+7`) is also white (0). If either corresponding input pixel is colored (red or magenta), the output pixel at `(r, c)` is white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
