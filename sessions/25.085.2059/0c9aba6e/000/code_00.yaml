task_description: Compare corresponding pixels in two subgrids defined by a separator line to generate an output grid.

input_grid:
  properties:
    height: 13
    width: 4
  components:
    - object: top_subgrid
      roi: rows 0-5
      properties:
        height: 6
        width: 4
        pixels: contains white (0) and red (2)
    - object: separator
      roi: row 6
      properties:
        height: 1
        width: 4
        pixels: consists entirely of orange (7)
    - object: bottom_subgrid
      roi: rows 7-12
      properties:
        height: 6
        width: 4
        pixels: contains white (0) and magenta (6)

output_grid:
  properties:
    height: 6
    width: 4
    pixels: contains white (0) and azure (8)

relationship:
  type: pixel_wise_comparison
  input_sections: [top_subgrid, bottom_subgrid]
  output_grid: output_grid
  rule: For each coordinate (r, c) within the 6x4 dimensions:
    condition: pixel at (r, c) in top_subgrid is white (0) AND pixel at (r, c) in bottom_subgrid is white (0)
    result_if_true: Set output pixel at (r, c) to azure (8)
    result_if_false: Set output pixel at (r, c) to white (0)
  ignored_elements:
    - separator line (orange pixels)
    - specific colors (red, magenta) in input subgrids, only their presence (non-white) vs. absence (white) matters.
