task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W
output_features:
  - grid: 2D array of integers (pixels)
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W + H - 1
transformation:
  - name: diagonal_embedding
    parameters:
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - shift_rule: row `r` (0-indexed) is shifted `(H - 1) - r` columns right
    steps:
      - Calculate output dimensions: height H, width W + H - 1.
      - Initialize output grid with background_color (0).
      - For each row `r` from 0 to H-1:
        - Calculate horizontal shift `s = (H - 1) - r`.
        - Copy pixels from input grid row `r` (columns 0 to W-1) to output grid row `r` starting at column `s` (columns `s` to `s + W - 1`).
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: The entire input grid treated as a single object to be transformed.
  - type: row
    description: Individual rows of the input grid, each undergoing a specific horizontal shift.
  - type: pixel
    description: Individual cells with color values.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: The position of a row determines its horizontal shift amount in the output.
  - type: containment
    description: The input grid content is contained within the output grid, shifted diagonally.
