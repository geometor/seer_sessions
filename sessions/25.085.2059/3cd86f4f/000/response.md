**Perception**

1.  **Input and Output Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of pixels (represented by integers 0-9).
2.  **Dimensionality Change:** The output grid always has the same height as the input grid but is wider.
3.  **Content Preservation:** The content (pixel values and relative positions within rows) of the input grid appears preserved within the output grid.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves embedding the input grid into a larger output grid. This embedding follows a specific pattern: each row of the input grid is shifted horizontally to the right within the output grid.
5.  **Shift Pattern:** The amount of horizontal shift depends on the row index. The top row (index 0) is shifted the most, and the shift amount decreases by one for each subsequent row. The bottom row (index `height - 1`) has a shift of zero. Specifically, row `r` is shifted `(input_height - 1) - r` columns to the right.
6.  **Padding:** The new areas created in the output grid due to the shifting (primarily to the left of the shifted content in the upper rows and to the right in the lower rows) are filled with the white pixel (value 0).
7.  **Output Width Calculation:** The width of the output grid is equal to the input grid's width plus the maximum shift amount, which is `input_height - 1`. So, `output_width = input_width + input_height - 1`.

    parameters:
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - shift_rule: row `r` (0-indexed) is shifted `(H - 1) - r` columns right
    steps:
      - Calculate output dimensions: height H, width W + H - 1.
      - Initialize output grid with background_color (0).
      - For each row `r` from 0 to H-1:
        - Calculate horizontal shift `s = (H - 1) - r`.
        - Copy pixels from input grid row `r` (columns 0 to W-1) to output grid row `r` starting at column `s` (columns `s` to `s + W - 1`).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the width of the output grid: `Output_Width = W + H - 1`. The height remains H.
3.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions H by `Output_Width`, and fill it entirely with the white color (0).
4.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, using a row index `r` starting from 0 up to H-1.
5.  For each row `r`, calculate the horizontal shift amount: `shift = (H - 1) - r`.
6.  Copy the pixels from the input grid's row `r` into the output grid's row `r`, starting at the column index specified by `shift`. The pixels will occupy columns `shift` through `shift + W - 1` in the output row `r`.
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
