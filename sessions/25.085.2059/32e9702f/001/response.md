```python
"""
Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized entirely with gray (5) pixels. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is not white (0), calculate its target position by shifting it one column to the left. If this target position is within the grid boundaries (column index >= 0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the color of the original input pixel. Finally, return the completed output grid.
