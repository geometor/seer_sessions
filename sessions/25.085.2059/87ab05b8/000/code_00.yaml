task_name: unknown_task # To be filled later if name is known
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_input: 4x4 # Based on examples
  - dimensions_output: 4x4 # Based on examples
  - dimension_preservation: True # Output dimensions match input dimensions

input_features:
  - background_color_dominant: magenta (6) # Appears frequently but not uniformly
  - unique_pixel_color: red (2) # Present exactly once in each example input
  - other_pixel_colors: [maroon (9), blue (1), yellow (4), gray (5), white (0), azure (8)] # Appear scattered

output_features:
  - background_color_uniform: magenta (6)
  - foreground_object:
      shape: square
      size: 2x2
      color: red (2)
      position: bottom-right corner # Specifically rows H-2 to H-1, cols W-2 to W-1
      
transformation_rule:
  - identify: Locate the pixel with color red (2) in the input grid.
  - determine_output_color: The color red (2) itself is the target fill color.
  - construct_output:
      action: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input.
      action: Fill the entire output grid with magenta (6).
      action: Fill the 2x2 area in the bottom-right corner of the output grid with red (2).

assumptions:
  - There is always exactly one red (2) pixel in the input grid.
  - The output grid dimensions always match the input grid dimensions.
