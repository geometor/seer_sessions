            "text": "Okay, here are my observations and the natural language program for the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids in the examples are 4x4. It's likely the transformation preserves the grid dimensions.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in both input and output is magenta (6). In the output, magenta serves as a uniform background, except for a specific region.\n3.  **Key Color Identification:** The input grids contain various colors scattered around, but the color red (2) appears exactly once in each input example.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid consistently features a 2x2 square of a single color placed in the bottom-right corner. The rest of the grid is filled with magenta (6).\n5.  **Color Transformation:** The color of the 2x2 square in the output is always red (2). This color corresponds to the unique red (2) pixel found in the input grid.\n6.  **Positional Transformation:** The *location* of the red (2) pixel in the input grid does not influence the *location* of the 2x2 red square in the output grid; the square is always placed in the bottom-right corner (rows 2-3, columns 2-3 for a 4x4 grid).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
