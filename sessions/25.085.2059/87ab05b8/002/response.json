Correct.\n\nThe rule holds.\n\nNow, construct the report.\n- General Assessment: The previous code correctly identified the output structure (magenta background, 2x2 red square) but incorrectly assumed a fixed position (bottom-right) for the red square. The failure on Example 2 highlighted this incorrect assumption. Analysis of all examples suggests the position of the 2x2 red square is determined by the position of the single red pixel in the input grid, with adjustments to keep the square within bounds.\n- Gather Metrics: Done using `tool_code`. Confirmed input red pixel locations and output 2x2 square top-left coordinates. All grids are 4x4.\n- YAML Facts: Document objects (grids, pixels, 2x2 square), properties (size, color, position), and actions (find pixel, create grid, fill background, calculate position, draw square).\n- Natural Language Program: Refine the program based on the derived rule.**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified that the output grid should have the same dimensions as the input, be filled primarily with magenta (6), and contain a 2x2 square of red (2). However, it incorrectly assumed the 2x2 red square was always placed in the bottom-right corner. The failure on Example 2, where the expected output had the red square in the bottom-left, revealed this fixed positioning was wrong.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to re-examine the relationship between the input and output grids across all examples, specifically looking for how the position of elements in the input determines the position of the 2x2 red square in the output. The key seems to be the location of the single red (2) pixel present in each input grid.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the execution results and analysis:\n"
