InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Has Height H and Width W.
    - Contains Pixels with Colors (0-9).
  Objects:
    - CornerPixels:
        - TopLeft: InputGrid[0][0]
        - TopRight: InputGrid[0][W-1]
        - BottomLeft: InputGrid[H-1][0]
        - BottomRight: InputGrid[H-1][W-1]
    - BlueFrame:
        - Located at Row 1, Row H-2, Column 1, Column W-1.
        - Consists of Blue (1) pixels.
    - InnerGrid:
        - The rectangular region inside the BlueFrame.
        - Location: Rows 2 to H-3, Columns 2 to W-3.
        - Dimensions: (H-4) x (W-4). Let's call these h x w.
        - Contains only White (0) and Azure (8) pixels.
        - Can be divided into four equal Quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR), each of size (h/2) x (w/2).
OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: h x w (same as InnerGrid).
Transformation:
  Rule: Create OutputGrid based on InnerGrid and CornerPixels.
  Steps:
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the InnerGrid (from 0 to h-1, 0 to w-1).
    - Get the Color `C` of InnerGrid[r][c].
    - If `C` is White (0):
        - Set OutputGrid[r][c] = White (0).
    - If `C` is Azure (8):
        - Determine the Quadrant of cell (r, c) within the InnerGrid:
            - If r < h/2 and c < w/2: Quadrant is TopLeft (TL).
            - If r < h/2 and c >= w/2: Quadrant is TopRight (TR).
            - If r >= h/2 and c < w/2: Quadrant is BottomLeft (BL).
            - If r >= h/2 and c >= w/2: Quadrant is BottomRight (BR).
        - Set OutputGrid[r][c] based on the Quadrant:
            - TL Quadrant -> TopLeft CornerPixel Color
            - TR Quadrant -> TopRight CornerPixel Color
            - BL Quadrant -> BottomLeft CornerPixel Color
            - BR Quadrant -> BottomRight CornerPixel Color
