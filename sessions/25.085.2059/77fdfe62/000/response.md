Okay, let's break down this task.

### Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The task takes a larger input grid and produces a smaller output grid.
2.  **Input Grid Features:**
    *   The input grids have a distinct structure: Four corner pixels of potentially unique colors, surrounded by a 1-pixel thick frame of blue (1) pixels (except at the very corners), which in turn encloses an inner grid region.
    *   The inner grid region (inside the blue frame) seems to contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
    *   The dimensions of the inner grid region appear to determine the dimensions of the output grid. In the examples, a 4x4 inner region (within a 6x6 input) yields a 2x2 output, and a 6x6 inner region (within an 8x8 input) yields a 4x4 output. However, looking closer, the *actual* relevant inner grid seems to be smaller.
        *   Example 1: Input 6x6. The region *inside* the blue frame is rows 2-3, cols 2-3. This is a 2x2 grid. Output is 2x2.
        *   Example 2: Input 8x8. The region *inside* the blue frame is rows 2-5, cols 2-5. This is a 4x4 grid. Output is 4x4.
        *   Example 3: Input 8x8. The region *inside* the blue frame is rows 2-5, cols 2-5. This is a 4x4 grid. Output is 4x4.
    *   This suggests the output grid dimensions are directly copied from the dimensions of the grid inside the blue frame.
3.  **Transformation Logic:**
    *   The output grid seems to be a transformation of the inner grid (the part inside the blue frame).
    *   Pixels in the output grid depend on the corresponding pixel in the inner grid and the corner pixels of the *original input grid*.
    *   If a pixel in the inner grid is white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid is also white (0).
    *   If a pixel in the inner grid is azure (8), the corresponding pixel in the output grid takes the color of one of the original input grid's corner pixels.
    *   The specific corner color used depends on the *quadrant* the azure (8) pixel resides in within the inner grid.
        *   Azure pixels in the top-left quadrant of the inner grid map to the top-left corner color of the input grid.
        *   Azure pixels in the top-right quadrant map to the top-right corner color.
        *   Azure pixels in the bottom-left quadrant map to the bottom-left corner color.
        *   Azure pixels in the bottom-right quadrant map to the bottom-right corner color.
4.  **Coordinate System:** It's crucial to be precise about indexing. Assuming 0-based indexing for rows and columns.

### Facts


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Has Height H and Width W.
    - Contains Pixels with Colors (0-9).
  Objects:
    - CornerPixels:
        - TopLeft: InputGrid[0][0]
        - TopRight: InputGrid[0][W-1]
        - BottomLeft: InputGrid[H-1][0]
        - BottomRight: InputGrid[H-1][W-1]
    - BlueFrame:
        - Located at Row 1, Row H-2, Column 1, Column W-1.
        - Consists of Blue (1) pixels.
    - InnerGrid:
        - The rectangular region inside the BlueFrame.
        - Location: Rows 2 to H-3, Columns 2 to W-3.
        - Dimensions: (H-4) x (W-4). Let's call these h x w.
        - Contains only White (0) and Azure (8) pixels.
        - Can be divided into four equal Quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR), each of size (h/2) x (w/2).
OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: h x w (same as InnerGrid).
Transformation:
  Rule: Create OutputGrid based on InnerGrid and CornerPixels.
  Steps:
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the InnerGrid (from 0 to h-1, 0 to w-1).
    - Get the Color `C` of InnerGrid[r][c].
    - If `C` is White (0):
        - Set OutputGrid[r][c] = White (0).
    - If `C` is Azure (8):
        - Determine the Quadrant of cell (r, c) within the InnerGrid:
            - If r < h/2 and c < w/2: Quadrant is TopLeft (TL).
            - If r < h/2 and c >= w/2: Quadrant is TopRight (TR).
            - If r >= h/2 and c < w/2: Quadrant is BottomLeft (BL).
            - If r >= h/2 and c >= w/2: Quadrant is BottomRight (BR).
        - Set OutputGrid[r][c] based on the Quadrant:
            - TL Quadrant -> TopLeft CornerPixel Color
            - TR Quadrant -> TopRight CornerPixel Color
            - BL Quadrant -> BottomLeft CornerPixel Color
            - BR Quadrant -> BottomRight CornerPixel Color
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the dimensions of the input grid, Height `H` and Width `W`.
2.  Extract the four corner pixel colors: `TopLeft_Color` = `InputGrid[0][0]`, `TopRight_Color` = `InputGrid[0][W-1]`, `BottomLeft_Color` = `InputGrid[H-1][0]`, `BottomRight_Color` = `InputGrid[H-1][W-1]`.
3.  Extract the inner grid, which is the subgrid located from row 2 to row `H-3` and column 2 to column `W-3`. Let the dimensions of this inner grid be `h` (height = `H-4`) and `w` (width = `W-4`).
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `h` x `w`.
5.  Iterate through each cell of the inner grid using row index `r` (from 0 to `h-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `w-1`).
6.  For each cell `(r, c)` in the inner grid:
    a.  Get the color `InnerColor` = `InnerGrid[r][c]`.
    b.  If `InnerColor` is white (0), set the corresponding cell in the output grid `OutputGrid[r][c]` to white (0).
    c.  If `InnerColor` is azure (8), determine which quadrant the cell `(r, c)` belongs to within the inner grid:
        i.  If `r < h/2` and `c < w/2` (Top-Left Quadrant), set `OutputGrid[r][c]` to `TopLeft_Color`.
        ii. If `r < h/2` and `c >= w/2` (Top-Right Quadrant), set `OutputGrid[r][c]` to `TopRight_Color`.
        iii.If `r >= h/2` and `c < w/2` (Bottom-Left Quadrant), set `OutputGrid[r][c]` to `BottomLeft_Color`.
        iv. If `r >= h/2` and `c >= w/2` (Bottom-Right Quadrant), set `OutputGrid[r][c]` to `BottomRight_Color`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
