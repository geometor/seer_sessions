            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The task takes a larger input grid and produces a smaller output grid.\n2.  **Input Grid Features:**\n    *   The input grids have a distinct structure: Four corner pixels of potentially unique colors, surrounded by a 1-pixel thick frame of blue (1) pixels (except at the very corners), which in turn encloses an inner grid region.\n    *   The inner grid region (inside the blue frame) seems to contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels.\n    *   The dimensions of the inner grid region appear to determine the dimensions of the output grid. In the examples, a 4x4 inner region (within a 6x6 input) yields a 2x2 output, and a 6x6 inner region (within an 8x8 input) yields a 4x4 output. However, looking closer, the *actual* relevant inner grid seems to be smaller.\n        *   Example 1: Input 6x6. The region *inside* the blue frame is rows 2-3, cols 2-3. This is a 2x2 grid. Output is 2x2.\n        *   Example 2: Input 8x8. The region *inside* the blue frame is rows 2-5, cols 2-5. This is a 4x4 grid. Output is 4x4.\n        *   Example 3: Input 8x8. The region *inside* the blue frame is rows 2-5, cols 2-5. This is a 4x4 grid. Output is 4x4.\n    *   This suggests the output grid dimensions are directly copied from the dimensions of the grid inside the blue frame.\n3.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The output grid seems to be a transformation of the inner grid (the part inside the blue frame).\n    *   Pixels in the output grid depend on the corresponding pixel in the inner grid and the corner pixels of the *original input grid*.\n    *   If a pixel in the inner grid is white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid is also white (0).\n    *   If a pixel in the inner grid is azure (8), the corresponding pixel in the output grid takes the color of one of the original input grid's corner pixels.\n    *   The specific corner color used depends on the *quadrant* the azure (8) pixel resides in within the inner grid.\n        *   Azure pixels in the top-left quadrant of the inner grid map to the top-left corner color of the input grid.\n        *   Azure pixels in the top-right quadrant map to the top-right corner color.\n        *   Azure pixels in the bottom-left quadrant map to the bottom-left corner color.\n        *   Azure pixels in the bottom-right quadrant map to the bottom-right corner color.\n4.  **Coordinate System:** It's crucial to be precise about indexing. Assuming 0-based indexing for rows and columns.\n\n### Facts\n\n"
