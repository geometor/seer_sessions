Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids consist primarily of 'white' (0) pixels, forming the background. There is a single, distinct 'blue' (1) pixel located consistently at the bottom-left corner (last row, first column). The dimensions (height and width) vary across examples, but the height is always 10.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The 'white' background is completely replaced by a pattern composed of 'azure' (8) and 'blue' (1) pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve generating a pattern based on the grid's width. The position of the input 'blue' pixel seems less important than the grid dimensions themselves, although it happens to be in a position that aligns with the start of the output pattern.
4.  **Pattern Details:** In the output, each row contains exactly one 'blue' (1) pixel, with all other pixels in that row being 'azure' (8). The column position of the 'blue' pixel changes row by row.
5.  **Column Movement:** Observing the column index of the 'blue' pixel from the bottom row (row index H-1) upwards towards the top row (row index 0), reveals a systematic movement. It starts at column 0 in the bottom row, increments by one for each row upwards until it reaches the rightmost column (W-1), then decrements by one for each row until it reaches column 1, and then repeats this cycle (0 -> W-1 -> 1 -> 0 -> ...).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  - input_dimensions: variable width (W), fixed height (H=10 in examples)
  - output_dimensions: same as input (W x H)
background_color:
  - input: white (0)
  - output: replaced entirely
objects:
  - type: single pixel
    color: blue (1)
    location:
      input: fixed at (H-1, 0)
      output: generated pattern, one per row
  - type: background filler
    color: azure (8)
    location:
      output: all cells in a row except the one with the blue pixel
transformation_rule:
  - name: generate_column_pattern
    based_on: grid_width (W)
    pattern_type: reflection or bounce
    sequence:
      - starts at column 0 for the bottom row (H-1)
      - moves right (column index increases) one step per row upwards
      - reaches column W-1
      - moves left (column index decreases) one step per row upwards
      - reaches column 1
      - repeats from column 0 if necessary
    periodicity: (W - 1) * 2  (for W > 1), or 1 (for W = 1)
output_composition:
  - for each row 'r' from 0 to H-1:
    - calculate the target column 'c' based on the bounce pattern sequence and the row's position relative to the bottom row (H-1-r).
    - set pixel (r, c) to blue (1)
    - set all other pixels (r, c') where c' != c to azure (8)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions (H x W).
3.  If the width W is 1:
    a.  Fill the entire output grid with blue (1).
4.  If the width W is greater than 1:
    a.  Generate the 'bounce' sequence of column indices: start with `0, 1, ..., W-1`, then append `W-2, W-3, ..., 1`. The length of this sequence is `P = (W-1) * 2`.
    b.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to H-1.
    c.  For the current row `r`, calculate the step index `idx = (H - 1 - r)`. This represents the number of steps taken upwards from the bottom row.
    d.  Determine the target column `c` by taking the element at index `(idx % P)` from the generated bounce sequence.
    e.  Fill the entire row `r` of the output grid with azure (8).
    f.  Set the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to blue (1).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
