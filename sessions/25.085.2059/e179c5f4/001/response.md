"""
Generates a pattern in the output grid based on its dimensions. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input. Each row in the output contains exactly one blue (1) pixel, and the rest are azure (8). The column position of the blue pixel follows a "bounce" pattern starting from column 0 at the bottom row, moving right to the last column (W-1), then left to column 1, and repeating this cycle upwards. The input grid's content (a single blue pixel at the bottom-left) is essentially ignored, except for determining the dimensions.
