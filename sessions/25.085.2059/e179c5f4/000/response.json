            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** The input grids consist primarily of 'white' (0) pixels, forming the background. There is a single, distinct 'blue' (1) pixel located consistently at the bottom-left corner (last row, first column). The dimensions (height and width) vary across examples, but the height is always 10.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. The 'white' background is completely replaced by a pattern composed of 'azure' (8) and 'blue' (1) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve generating a pattern based on the grid's width. The position of the input 'blue' pixel seems less important than the grid dimensions themselves, although it happens to be in a position that aligns with the start of the output pattern.\n4.  **Pattern Details:** In the output, each row contains exactly one 'blue' (1) pixel, with all other pixels in that row being 'azure' (8). The column position of the 'blue' pixel changes row by row.\n5.  **Column Movement:** Observing the column index of the 'blue' pixel from the bottom row (row index H-1) upwards towards the top row (row index 0), reveals a systematic movement. It starts at column 0 in the bottom row, increments by one for each row upwards until it reaches the rightmost column (W-1), then decrements by one for each row until it reaches column 1, and then repeats this cycle (0 -> W-1 -> 1 -> 0 -> ...).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
