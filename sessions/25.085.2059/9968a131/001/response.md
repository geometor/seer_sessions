"""
Transforms an input grid based on finding specific adjacent pixel pairs within rows.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Define the set of trigger pairs: {(8, 3), (5, 0)}.
3. Iterate through each row 'r' of the input grid.
4. For the current row 'r', scan horizontally from left to right (column 'c' from 0 up to width - 3).
5. Check if the pair of pixels at (r, c) and (r, c+1) matches any of the trigger pairs.
6. If a trigger pair is found at column 'c':
   a. Perform a right cyclic permutation on the three pixels starting at column 'c': (r, c), (r, c+1), (r, c+2).
   b. Specifically, let v0 = input[r, c], v1 = input[r, c+1], v2 = input[r, c+2]. Update the output grid such that output[r, c] = v2, output[r, c+1] = v0, output[r, c+2] = v1.
   c. Stop searching for triggers in the current row 'r' and proceed to the next row.
7. If no trigger pair is found in a row, that row remains unchanged in the output grid.
8. Return the final output grid.
