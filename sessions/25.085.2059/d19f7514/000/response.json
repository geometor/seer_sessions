The widths are identical. This strongly suggests the input grid is composed of two sub-grids stacked vertically.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   **Input:** Uses white (0), green (3), and gray (5). The green pixels appear predominantly in the top half, and gray pixels appear predominantly in the bottom half, although not exclusively.\n    *   **Output:** Uses only white (0) and yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a result of combining information from the top and bottom halves of the input grid on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The dimensions of the output match the dimensions of each half of the input.\n4.  **Core Logic:** Observing the pixel mapping across examples reveals a pattern:\n    *   If a pixel in the top half is green (3), the corresponding output pixel is yellow (4), regardless of the color in the bottom half at that position.\n    *   If a pixel in the top half is *not* green (3), but the corresponding pixel in the bottom half is gray (5), the output pixel is yellow (4).\n    *   If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., top is not green AND bottom is not gray), the output pixel is white (0).\n    *   This logic can be simplified: the output pixel is yellow (4) if the top pixel is green (3) OR the bottom pixel is gray (5). Otherwise, it's white (0).\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Create a new grid, `output_grid`, with dimensions `H` x `W`.\n4.  For each position `(row, col)` from `(0, 0)` up to `(H-1, W-1)`:\n    a.  Examine the color `top_color` at `(row, col)` in `top_grid`.\n    b.  Examine the color `bottom_color` at `(row, col)` in `bottom_grid`.\n    c.  If `top_color` is green (3) OR `bottom_color` is gray (5), set the color at `(row, col)` in `output_grid` to yellow (4).\n    d.
