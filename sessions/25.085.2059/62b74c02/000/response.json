The pattern is composed of vertical columns of different colors. The transition from the pattern to the white space is abrupt.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as the corresponding input grids. The pattern from the left side of the input is preserved on the left side of the output. The white space from the input is filled in the output.\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary goal is to determine how the white space in the input grid is filled to produce the output grid, using the pattern found on the left side of the input.\n4.  **Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   The pattern on the left (let's call it the `PatternBlock`) seems crucial. Its width varies between examples (3 columns in ex1 and ex2, 4 columns in ex3).\n    *   The filling of the white space appears related to the columns within the `PatternBlock`.\n    *   In the output, the *last* few columns seem to directly replicate the `PatternBlock`. Specifically, if the `PatternBlock` has width `N`, the last `N` columns of the output are identical to the `N` columns of the `PatternBlock`.\n    *   The space *between* the initial `PatternBlock` and the final replicated `PatternBlock` in the output is filled with repetitions of the *first column* (`C0`) of the `PatternBlock`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Examine the input grid to identify the `Pattern Block`: Find all contiguous, non-white columns starting from the leftmost column (column 0). Let the columns be `C0, C1, ..., Cn` and the width of this block be `N = n + 1`.\n2.  Determine the total width `W` of the grid.\n3.  Check if `N` equals `W`. If they are equal, the input grid has no white space to fill, so the output grid is identical to the input grid. Stop and return the input grid.\n4.  Otherwise, create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n5.  Copy the `Pattern Block` (columns `C0` through `Cn`) into the first `N` columns (indices 0 to `N-1`) of the output grid.\n6.  Copy the `Pattern Block` (columns `C0` through `Cn`) into the last `N` columns (indices `W-N` to `W-1`) of the output grid.\n7.  Fill the columns in the output grid starting from index `N` up to, but not including, index `W-N` by repeatedly using the first column (`C0`) of the `Pattern Block`. If `N` is greater than or equal to `W-N`, this step does nothing.\n8.  Return the completed output grid."
