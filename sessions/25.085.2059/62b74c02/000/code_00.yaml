task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    attributes:
      - Contains a 'Pattern Block' on the left.
      - Contains a 'White Space Block' on the right (pixels with value 0).
      - Dimensions: height H, width W.
  - name: Output Grid
    attributes:
      - Same dimensions (H, W) as Input Grid.
      - 'White Space Block' is filled according to a rule.
  - name: Pattern Block
    description: A contiguous block of non-white columns starting from the left edge (column 0) of the Input Grid.
    properties:
      - Columns: C0, C1, ..., Cn
      - Width: N = n + 1
      - Height: H (same as grid height)
  - name: White Space Block
    description: A contiguous block of columns containing only white pixels (value 0), starting immediately to the right of the Pattern Block.
    properties:
      - Start Column Index: FirstWhiteCol = N
  - name: Transformation Rule
    description: Defines how the White Space Block in the Input Grid is filled to create the Output Grid.
    steps:
      - Identify the Pattern Block (columns C0 to Cn, width N).
      - Determine the grid width W.
      - Create the Output Grid.
      - Copy the Pattern Block (C0 to Cn) to the first N columns of the Output Grid.
      - Copy the Pattern Block (C0 to Cn) to the last N columns (indices W-N to W-1) of the Output Grid.
      - Fill the intermediate columns (indices N to W-N-1) of the Output Grid by repeating the first column (C0) of the Pattern Block.
    edge_cases:
      - If the Input Grid contains no White Space Block (FirstWhiteCol >= W), the Output Grid is identical to the Input Grid.
      - If the range for intermediate columns (N to W-N-1) is empty or invalid (i.e., N > W-N-1), no C0 columns are added in the middle.
