Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a pattern on the left side and a block of 'white' pixels (value 0) on the right side. The pattern is composed of vertical columns of different colors. The transition from the pattern to the white space is abrupt.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grids have the same dimensions as the corresponding input grids. The pattern from the left side of the input is preserved on the left side of the output. The white space from the input is filled in the output.
3.  **Transformation Goal:** The primary goal is to determine how the white space in the input grid is filled to produce the output grid, using the pattern found on the left side of the input.
4.  **Pattern Analysis:**
    *   The pattern on the left (let's call it the `PatternBlock`) seems crucial. Its width varies between examples (3 columns in ex1 and ex2, 4 columns in ex3).
    *   The filling of the white space appears related to the columns within the `PatternBlock`.
    *   In the output, the *last* few columns seem to directly replicate the `PatternBlock`. Specifically, if the `PatternBlock` has width `N`, the last `N` columns of the output are identical to the `N` columns of the `PatternBlock`.
    *   The space *between* the initial `PatternBlock` and the final replicated `PatternBlock` in the output is filled with repetitions of the *first column* (`C0`) of the `PatternBlock`.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    attributes:
      - Contains a 'Pattern Block' on the left.
      - Contains a 'White Space Block' on the right (pixels with value 0).
      - Dimensions: height H, width W.
  - name: Output Grid
    attributes:
      - Same dimensions (H, W) as Input Grid.
      - 'White Space Block' is filled according to a rule.
  - name: Pattern Block
    description: A contiguous block of non-white columns starting from the left edge (column 0) of the Input Grid.
    properties:
      - Columns: C0, C1, ..., Cn
      - Width: N = n + 1
      - Height: H (same as grid height)
  - name: White Space Block
    description: A contiguous block of columns containing only white pixels (value 0), starting immediately to the right of the Pattern Block.
    properties:
      - Start Column Index: FirstWhiteCol = N
  - name: Transformation Rule
    description: Defines how the White Space Block in the Input Grid is filled to create the Output Grid.
    steps:
      - Identify the Pattern Block (columns C0 to Cn, width N).
      - Determine the grid width W.
      - Create the Output Grid.
      - Copy the Pattern Block (C0 to Cn) to the first N columns of the Output Grid.
      - Copy the Pattern Block (C0 to Cn) to the last N columns (indices W-N to W-1) of the Output Grid.
      - Fill the intermediate columns (indices N to W-N-1) of the Output Grid by repeating the first column (C0) of the Pattern Block.
    edge_cases:
      - If the Input Grid contains no White Space Block (FirstWhiteCol >= W), the Output Grid is identical to the Input Grid.
      - If the range for intermediate columns (N to W-N-1) is empty or invalid (i.e., N > W-N-1), no C0 columns are added in the middle.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input grid to identify the `Pattern Block`: Find all contiguous, non-white columns starting from the leftmost column (column 0). Let the columns be `C0, C1, ..., Cn` and the width of this block be `N = n + 1`.
2.  Determine the total width `W` of the grid.
3.  Check if `N` equals `W`. If they are equal, the input grid has no white space to fill, so the output grid is identical to the input grid. Stop and return the input grid.
4.  Otherwise, create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  Copy the `Pattern Block` (columns `C0` through `Cn`) into the first `N` columns (indices 0 to `N-1`) of the output grid.
6.  Copy the `Pattern Block` (columns `C0` through `Cn`) into the last `N` columns (indices `W-N` to `W-1`) of the output grid.
7.  Fill the columns in the output grid starting from index `N` up to, but not including, index `W-N` by repeatedly using the first column (`C0`) of the `Pattern Block`. If `N` is greater than or equal to `W-N`, this step does nothing.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
