"""
Identifies a horizontal separator row (color 4). 
Extracts the subgrid above the separator (top_grid) and the subgrid below the separator (bottom_grid).
Creates an output grid of the same dimensions as the subgrids, initialized to white (0).
Iterates through each corresponding pixel position (row, col) in the top and bottom grids. 
If the pixel at (row, col) in BOTH the top_grid AND the bottom_grid is white (0), sets the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3). 
Otherwise, the output grid pixel remains white (0).
