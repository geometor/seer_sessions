task_description: Pixel-wise comparison of two subgrids based on the absence of color.

components:
  - name: input_grid
    description: A larger grid containing two distinct pattern subgrids separated by a specific row.
    properties:
      - structure: Composed of a top subgrid, a separator row, and a bottom subgrid.
      - height: Variable (9 in examples)
      - width: Variable (4 in examples)

  - name: separator_row
    description: A single row that visually and logically divides the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Consistently yellow (4).
      - function: Delimits the top and bottom pattern subgrids.

  - name: top_subgrid
    description: The upper pattern subgrid in the input.
    properties:
      - location: Above the separator row.
      - colors_present: white (0), orange (7).
      - dimensions: Matches the output grid dimensions (e.g., 4x4).

  - name: bottom_subgrid
    description: The lower pattern subgrid in the input.
    properties:
      - location: Below the separator row.
      - colors_present: white (0), red (2).
      - dimensions: Matches the output grid dimensions (e.g., 4x4).

  - name: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after applying the transformation rule.
    properties:
      - colors_present: white (0), green (3).
      - dimensions: Same as the top and bottom subgrids (e.g., 4x4).

relationships:
  - type: extraction
    source: input_grid
    target: [top_subgrid, bottom_subgrid]
    details: Identify the yellow separator row to determine the boundaries of the top and bottom subgrids.

  - type: pixel_wise_comparison
    input1: top_subgrid
    input2: bottom_subgrid
    output: output_grid
    rule: For each coordinate (row, col):
            IF top_subgrid[row, col] is white (0) AND bottom_subgrid[row, col] is white (0)
            THEN output_grid[row, col] is green (3)
            ELSE output_grid[row, col] is white (0).
