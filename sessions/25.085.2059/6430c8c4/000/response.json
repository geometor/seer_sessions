            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid has a consistent structure:\n    *   A top section containing white (0) and orange (7) pixels.\n    *   A single middle row composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This acts as a clear separator.\n    *   A bottom section containing white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n    *   In all examples, the top section and the bottom section have the same dimensions (4x4). The overall input grid dimension is 9x4.\n\n2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid is a 4x4 grid containing white (0) and green (3) pixels. The dimensions match the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Transformation Hint:** The presence of the separator strongly suggests that the transformation involves comparing or combining the information from the top section (orange pattern) and the bottom section (red pattern) to produce the output grid (green pattern). The colors involved (orange, red, green) might be arbitrary identifiers for the patterns being processed, or they might have inherent meaning, but the core logic seems positional.\n\n4.  **Pattern Analysis:** Comparing the pixel values at corresponding positions in the top and bottom sections reveals the transformation rule. A green pixel appears in the output grid specifically at positions where *both* the corresponding pixel in the top section *and* the corresponding pixel in the bottom section are white (0). If either or both corresponding pixels in the input sections are colored (orange 7 or red 2), the output pixel at that position is white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
