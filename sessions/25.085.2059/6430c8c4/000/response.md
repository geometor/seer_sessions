Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid has a consistent structure:
    *   A top section containing white (0) and orange (7) pixels.
    *   A single middle row composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels. This acts as a clear separator.
    *   A bottom section containing white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    *   In all examples, the top section and the bottom section have the same dimensions (4x4). The overall input grid dimension is 9x4.

2.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid is a 4x4 grid containing white (0) and green (3) pixels. The dimensions match the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input grid.

3.  **Transformation Hint:** The presence of the separator strongly suggests that the transformation involves comparing or combining the information from the top section (orange pattern) and the bottom section (red pattern) to produce the output grid (green pattern). The colors involved (orange, red, green) might be arbitrary identifiers for the patterns being processed, or they might have inherent meaning, but the core logic seems positional.

4.  **Pattern Analysis:** Comparing the pixel values at corresponding positions in the top and bottom sections reveals the transformation rule. A green pixel appears in the output grid specifically at positions where *both* the corresponding pixel in the top section *and* the corresponding pixel in the bottom section are white (0). If either or both corresponding pixels in the input sections are colored (orange 7 or red 2), the output pixel at that position is white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Pixel-wise comparison of two subgrids based on the absence of color.

components:
  - name: input_grid
    description: A larger grid containing two distinct pattern subgrids separated by a specific row.
    properties:
      - structure: Composed of a top subgrid, a separator row, and a bottom subgrid.
      - height: Variable (9 in examples)
      - width: Variable (4 in examples)

  - name: separator_row
    description: A single row that visually and logically divides the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Consistently yellow (4).
      - function: Delimits the top and bottom pattern subgrids.

  - name: top_subgrid
    description: The upper pattern subgrid in the input.
    properties:
      - location: Above the separator row.
      - colors_present: white (0), orange (7).
      - dimensions: Matches the output grid dimensions (e.g., 4x4).

  - name: bottom_subgrid
    description: The lower pattern subgrid in the input.
    properties:
      - location: Below the separator row.
      - colors_present: white (0), red (2).
      - dimensions: Matches the output grid dimensions (e.g., 4x4).

  - name: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after applying the transformation rule.
    properties:
      - colors_present: white (0), green (3).
      - dimensions: Same as the top and bottom subgrids (e.g., 4x4).

relationships:
  - type: extraction
    source: input_grid
    target: [top_subgrid, bottom_subgrid]
    details: Identify the yellow separator row to determine the boundaries of the top and bottom subgrids.

  - type: pixel_wise_comparison
    input1: top_subgrid
    input2: bottom_subgrid
    output: output_grid
    rule: For each coordinate (row, col):
            IF top_subgrid[row, col] is white (0) AND bottom_subgrid[row, col] is white (0)
            THEN output_grid[row, col] is green (3)
            ELSE output_grid[row, col] is white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** the yellow (4) separator row within the input grid.
2.  **Extract** the subgrid located above the separator row (this is the 'top grid').
3.  **Extract** the subgrid located below the separator row (this is the 'bottom grid'). Note that the top and bottom grids will have the same dimensions.
4.  **Create** a new output grid with the same dimensions as the top/bottom grids, initialized with white (0) pixels.
5.  **Iterate** through each pixel position (row, column) within the dimensions of the top/bottom grids.
6.  **For each position**:
    *   Check the color of the pixel at this position in the top grid.
    *   Check the color of the pixel at this position in the bottom grid.
    *   **If** the pixel in the top grid is white (0) **AND** the pixel in the bottom grid is white (0), **then** set the pixel at the corresponding position in the output grid to green (3).
    *   **Otherwise** (if either or both pixels are not white), leave the corresponding pixel in the output grid as white (0).
7.  **Return** the completed output grid.
