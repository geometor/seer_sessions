The code successfully implemented this for Example 1 (no sort needed) and Example 3 (sort needed).\n\nHowever, the code failed on Example 2, producing a different row order than expected when sorting was applied. The previous code used standard lexicographical sorting on the rows *after* removing the first column. The discrepancy in Example 2, combined with the success in Example 3 under the same sorting condition (top-left pixel not red), suggests the sorting criterion itself was misspecified. The sorting mechanism needs to be re-evaluated based on all examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify grid properties using `tool_code`.\n2.  Compare the intermediate rows (input minus the first column)"
