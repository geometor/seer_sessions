Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment**

The initial hypothesis correctly identified the removal of the first column and the conditional nature of the transformation based on the top-left pixel's color (red vs. not red). The code successfully implemented this for Example 1 (no sort needed) and Example 3 (sort needed).

However, the code failed on Example 2, producing a different row order than expected when sorting was applied. The previous code used standard lexicographical sorting on the rows *after* removing the first column. The discrepancy in Example 2, combined with the success in Example 3 under the same sorting condition (top-left pixel not red), suggests the sorting criterion itself was misspecified. The sorting mechanism needs to be re-evaluated based on all examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify grid properties using `tool_code`.
2.  Compare the intermediate rows (input minus the first column)
