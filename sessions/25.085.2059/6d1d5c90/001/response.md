Transformation Rule:
1. Examine the pixel at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid.
2. Create an intermediate grid by removing the first column (column 0) from the input grid.
3. If the pixel at the top-left corner of the *original* input grid was red (color 2), the intermediate grid is the final output.
4. Otherwise (if the top-left pixel was not red), sort the rows of the intermediate grid lexicographically. This sorted grid is the final output.
