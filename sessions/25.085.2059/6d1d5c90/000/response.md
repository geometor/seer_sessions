*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The task operates on grids of pixels (colors).
    *   All examples show an input grid with 7 columns and an output grid with 6 columns. The number of rows remains the same.
    *   The transformation consistently involves removing the first column (column index 0) of the input grid.
    *   In examples 2 and 3, the rows of the grid *after* removing the first column are sorted lexicographically.
    *   In example 1, the rows are *not* sorted after removing the first column; their relative order is preserved from the input.
    *   The difference seems related to the content of the removed first column. Specifically, the position of the red pixel (color 2) appears to be the deciding factor.
    *   If the red pixel (color 2) is in the first row (row index 0) of the input's first column, the rows are *not* sorted after removing the column (Example 1).
    *   If the red pixel (color 2) is *not* in the first row of the input's first column, the rows *are* sorted lexicographically after removing the column (Examples 2 and 3).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: grid_transformation
    input_grid:
      properties:
        - shape: variable height H, width W
        - content: pixels with colors 0-9
      examples_shape: [6x7]
    output_grid:
      properties:
        - shape: height H, width W-1
        - content: pixels with colors 0-9
      examples_shape: [6x6]
    transformation:
      steps:
        - name: Identify_Red_Pixel_Position
          description: Find the row index of the red pixel (color 2) in the first column (index 0) of the input grid. Store whether it is in the first row (index 0).
        - name: Remove_First_Column
          description: Create an intermediate grid by taking all columns from the input grid except the first one (index 0).
        - name: Conditional_Row_Sort
          description: Check if the red pixel was found in the first row during the identification step.
          condition_true: (Red pixel was NOT in the first row) Sort the rows of the intermediate grid lexicographically.
          condition_false: (Red pixel WAS in the first row) Keep the rows of the intermediate grid in their original relative order.
        - name: Finalize_Output
          description: The resulting grid from the conditional sort step is the output grid.
    key_elements:
      - grid: The 2D array structure.
      - first_column: The column at index 0, which is removed.
      - red_pixel: The pixel with color value 2. Its position in the first column determines the sorting behavior.
      - rows: Horizontal sequences of pixels within the grid.
      - lexicographical_sort: The method used to order rows when the condition is met.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the first column (column 0) of the input grid to locate the red pixel (color 2). Determine if its row index is 0.
    2.  Construct a new grid by removing the first column from the input grid.
    3.  If the red pixel was found at row index 0 in the first column of the *original* input grid, the new grid (with the first column removed) is the final output.
    4.  Otherwise (if the red pixel was not in row 0 of the first column), sort the rows of the new grid lexicographically. This sorted grid is the final output.
