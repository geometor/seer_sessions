The number of rows remains the same.\n    *   The transformation consistently involves removing the first column (column index 0) of the input grid.\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, the rows of the grid *after* removing the first column are sorted lexicographically.\n    *   In example 1, the rows are *not* sorted after removing the first column; their relative order is preserved from the input.\n    *   The difference seems related to the content of the removed first column. Specifically, the position of the red pixel (color 2) appears to be the deciding factor.\n    *   If the red pixel (color 2) is in the first row (row index 0) of the input's first column, the rows are *not* sorted after removing the column (Example 1).\n    *   If the red pixel (color 2) is *not* in the first row of the input's first column, the rows *are* sorted lexicographically after removing the column (Examples 2 and 3).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
