Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular array of pixels (colors 0-9).
    - Height is the same as input height (H).
    - Width is double the input width (2 * W).

  Action: Horizontal Duplication
  Description: The output grid is constructed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally.
  Relationship:
