The left half of the output grid is identical to the input grid, and the right half is also identical to the input grid.\n4.  **Example 1 Discrepancy:** I note that the provided output for `train_1` seems to have a slight inconsistency in the 3rd row compared to a perfect duplication (`2 3 3 2 3 3 2 | 3 3 2 3 3 2 3` vs `2 3 3 2 3 3 2 | 2 3 3 2 3 3 2`). However, given the perfect consistency in examples 2 and 3, I will proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation rule is horizontal duplication, and the discrepancy in example 1 might be a typo in the example data.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
