Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of pixels with different colors.
2.  **Dimensional Change:** In all examples, the output grid has the same height as the input grid, but exactly double the width.
    *   Example 1: Input 5x7 -> Output 5x14
    *   Example 2: Input 5x6 -> Output 5x12
    *   Example 3: Input 5x8 -> Output 5x16
3.  **Content Relationship:** The content of the output grid appears to be formed by taking the input grid and placing an identical copy of it immediately to its right. The left half of the output grid is identical to the input grid, and the right half is also identical to the input grid.
4.  **Example 1 Discrepancy:** I note that the provided output for `train_1` seems to have a slight inconsistency in the 3rd row compared to a perfect duplication (`2 3 3 2 3 3 2 | 3 3 2 3 3 2 3` vs `2 3 3 2 3 3 2 | 2 3 3 2 3 3 2`). However, given the perfect consistency in examples 2 and 3, I will proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation rule is horizontal duplication, and the discrepancy in example 1 might be a typo in the example data.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation

Input:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular array of pixels (colors 0-9).
    - Variable height (H).
    - Variable width (W).

Output:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Rectangular array of pixels (colors 0-9).
    - Height is the same as input height (H).
    - Width is double the input width (2 * W).

Transformation:
  Action: Horizontal Duplication
  Description: The output grid is constructed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally.
  Relationship:
    - Output grid's left half (columns 0 to W-1) is identical to the input grid.
    - Output grid's right half (columns W to 2*W-1) is identical to the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Determine its height (H) and width (W).
3.  Create a new grid with height H and width (2 * W).
4.  For each row `r` from 0 to H-1 and each column `c` from 0 to W-1 in the input grid:
    a.  Copy the pixel value at `input[r][c]` to `output[r][c]`.
    b.  Copy the pixel value at `input[r][c]` to `output[r][c + W]`.
5.  Return the newly created grid.
