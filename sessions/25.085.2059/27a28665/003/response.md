```python
"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid containing white (0) and one other foreground color into a single integer output. 
The transformation is based on two calculated properties of the foreground pixels:
1. N: The number of connected components formed by the foreground pixels using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
2. M: The maximum number of adjacent foreground neighbors (using 4-way adjacency) for any single foreground pixel.

The output integer is determined by the following rules mapping the pair (N, M):
- If N=2 and M=2, output is 3.
- If N=1 and M=4, output is 6.
- If N=5 and M=0, output is 2.
- If N=3 and M=2, output is 1.
