"""
This program takes a 3x3 input grid containing white (0) and one other foreground color. 
It determines the number of connected components (N) formed by the foreground pixels using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
It also calculates the maximum number of adjacent foreground neighbors (M) for any single foreground pixel, again using 4-way adjacency.
Finally, it returns a specific integer output based on the combination of N and M according to the following rules:
- If N=1 and M=2, output is 1.
- If N=5 and M=0, output is 2.
- If N=2 and M=2, output is 3.
- If N=1 and M=4, output is 6.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code correctly identified the relevant features for the transformation: the number of connected components (N) of the non-white pixels and the maximum number of non-white neighbors (M) for any single non-white pixel, both using 4-way adjacency.

The code successfully mapped the (N, M) pairs for the first five examples to their respective outputs. However, it failed on Examples 6 and 7 because the (N, M) pairs calculated for these inputs were not included in the explicit `if/elif` conditions. The code returned `-1`, indicating an unhandled case.

The strategy is to:
1.  Calculate N and M for the failing examples (6 and 7).
2.  Determine the correct mapping rule for these examples based on their expected output (which is 1 for both).
3.  Update the set of mapping rules to include this new finding.
4.  Verify that the updated rules cover all provided examples correctly.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's use the helper functions from the previous code to calculate N (number of connected components) and M (maximum neighbors) for the failing examples.

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 6: N=3, M=2
Example 7: N=3, M=2

```
**Analysis of Metrics:**

The code execution confirms the manual calculation:
- For Example 6, N=3 and M=2. The expected output is 1.
- For Example 7, N=3 and M=2. The expected output is 1.

This gives us a new rule: `If N=3 and M=2, the output is 1`.

Let's consolidate all rules derived from the examples:

- Examples 1, 2: N=2, M=2 -> Output 3
- Example 3:     N=1, M=4 -> Output 6
- Examples 4, 5: N=5, M=0 -> Output 2
- Examples 6, 7: N=3, M=2 -> Output 1

The rule `(N=1, M=2) -> 1` present in the previous code seems incorrect based on the provided examples and should be replaced by `(N=3, M=2) -> 1`.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive a 3x3 input grid containing white pixels (0) and pixels of a single non-white color (1-9).
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the grid.
3.  Calculate the number of connected components (N) formed by these non-white pixels, considering pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (4-way adjacency).
4.  For each non-white pixel, count how many of its horizontal and vertical neighbors are also non-white.
5.  Determine the maximum count found in step 4 across all non-white pixels. Call this maximum neighbor count M.
6.  Apply the following rules based on the calculated values of N and M to determine the single integer output:
    *   If N is 2 and M is 2, the output is 3.
    *   If N is 1 and M is 4, the output is 6.
    *   If N is 5 and M is 0, the output is 2.
    *   If N is 3 and M is 2, the output is 1.
7.  Return the determined integer output.
