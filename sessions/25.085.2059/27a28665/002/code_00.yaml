task_description: Analyze a 3x3 input grid to determine an integer output based on properties of the non-white pixels.
input_grid:
  description: A 3x3 grid.
  properties:
    size: 3x3
    pixels:
      - color: white (0) - background
      - color: non-white (1-9) - foreground (only one non-white color per grid)
foreground_pixels:
  description: The set of pixels in the input grid that are not white (value > 0).
derived_properties:
  - name: N
    description: Number of connected components formed by foreground pixels.
    calculation: Use 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  - name: M
    description: Maximum number of foreground neighbors for any single foreground pixel.
    calculation: Use 4-way adjacency. Count neighbors for each foreground pixel and find the maximum count.
transformation:
  description: Map the calculated pair (N, M) to a specific integer output.
  rules:
    - condition: N=2 and M=2
      output: 3
    - condition: N=1 and M=4
      output: 6
    - condition: N=5 and M=0
      output: 2
    - condition: N=3 and M=2
      output: 1
output:
  description: A single integer value determined by the transformation rules.
