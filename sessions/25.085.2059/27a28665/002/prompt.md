"""
This program takes a 3x3 input grid containing white (0) and one other foreground color. 
It determines the number of connected components (N) formed by the foreground pixels using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
It also calculates the maximum number of adjacent foreground neighbors (M) for any single foreground pixel, again using 4-way adjacency.
Finally, it returns a specific integer output based on the combination of N and M according to the following rules:
- If N=1 and M=2, output is 1.
- If N=5 and M=0, output is 2.
- If N=2 and M=2, output is 3.
- If N=1 and M=4, output is 6.
