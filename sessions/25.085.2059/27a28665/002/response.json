            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the relevant features for the transformation: the number of connected components (N) of the non-white pixels and the maximum number of non-white neighbors (M) for any single non-white pixel, both using 4-way adjacency.\n\nThe code successfully mapped the (N, M) pairs for the first five examples to their respective outputs. However, it failed on Examples 6 and 7 because the (N, M) pairs calculated for these inputs were not included in the explicit `if/elif` conditions. The code returned `-1`, indicating an unhandled case.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Calculate N and M for the failing examples (6 and 7).\n2.  Determine the correct mapping rule for these examples based on their expected output (which is 1 for both).\n3.  Update the set of mapping rules to include this new finding.\n4.  Verify that the updated rules cover all provided examples correctly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's use the helper functions from the previous code to calculate N (number of connected components) and M (maximum neighbors) for the failing examples.\n\n"
