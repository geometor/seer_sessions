            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is always a 3x3 grid containing pixels of different colors. Each grid has a background color (white, color 0) and one other foreground color (blue, azure, gray, yellow).\n2.  **Output:** The output is always a single integer.\n3.  **Relationship:** The output integer seems to be derived from the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the foreground (non-white) pixels within the 3x3 grid.\n4.  **Objects:** The foreground pixels form distinct shapes or patterns. We can consider contiguous blocks of the same foreground color as objects. Connectivity seems to be based on side-by-side adjacency (not diagonals).\n5.  **Properties:** Key properties appear to be:\n    *   The number of distinct connected objects formed by the foreground color.\n    *   The connectivity *within* these objects, specifically the maximum number of adjacent foreground neighbors any single foreground pixel has.\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n\nBy examining the examples, we can deduce a pattern:\n\n*   Identify the foreground (non-white) color.\n*   Find all connected components (objects) of this color, using 4-way adjacency. Let N be the number of objects.\n*   For each foreground pixel, count its foreground neighbors (up, down, left, right). Find the maximum count among all foreground pixels. Let M be this maximum neighbor count.\n*   The output value is determined by the specific combination of N and M observed in the examples:\n    *   (N=1, M=2) maps to 1 (Examples 6, 7)\n    *   (N=5, M=0) maps to 2 (Examples 4, 5)\n    *   (N=2, M=2) maps to 3 (Examples 1, 2)\n    *   (N=1, M=4) maps to 6 (Example 3)\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
