Input:
  type: grid
  size: 3x3
  colors:
    - white (0) - background
    - one other color (foreground)
Output:
  type: integer
Derived_Elements:
  - foreground_pixels: All pixels not matching the background color (white, 0).
  - connected_objects: Groups of foreground_pixels connected by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
Properties_Used:
  - object_count (N): The total number of distinct connected_objects.
  - max_neighbor_count (M): The maximum number of adjacent (4-way) foreground neighbors for any single foreground_pixel.
Transformation_Rule_Mapping:
  - conditions:
      object_count: 1
      max_neighbor_count: 2
    output: 1
  - conditions:
      object_count: 5
      max_neighbor_count: 0
    output: 2
  - conditions:
      object_count: 2
      max_neighbor_count: 2
    output: 3
  - conditions:
      object_count: 1
      max_neighbor_count: 4
    output: 6
