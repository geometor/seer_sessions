Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is always a 3x3 grid containing pixels of different colors. Each grid has a background color (white, color 0) and one other foreground color (blue, azure, gray, yellow).
2.  **Output:** The output is always a single integer.
3.  **Relationship:** The output integer seems to be derived from the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the foreground (non-white) pixels within the 3x3 grid.
4.  **Objects:** The foreground pixels form distinct shapes or patterns. We can consider contiguous blocks of the same foreground color as objects. Connectivity seems to be based on side-by-side adjacency (not diagonals).
5.  **Properties:** Key properties appear to be:
    *   The number of distinct connected objects formed by the foreground color.
    *   The connectivity *within* these objects, specifically the maximum number of adjacent foreground neighbors any single foreground pixel has.

**Analysis Summary:**

By examining the examples, we can deduce a pattern:

*   Identify the foreground (non-white) color.
*   Find all connected components (objects) of this color, using 4-way adjacency. Let N be the number of objects.
*   For each foreground pixel, count its foreground neighbors (up, down, left, right). Find the maximum count among all foreground pixels. Let M be this maximum neighbor count.
*   The output value is determined by the specific combination of N and M observed in the examples:
    *   (N=1, M=2) maps to 1 (Examples 6, 7)
    *   (N=5, M=0) maps to 2 (Examples 4, 5)
    *   (N=2, M=2) maps to 3 (Examples 1, 2)
    *   (N=1, M=4) maps to 6 (Example 3)

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:

  size: 3x3
  colors:
    - white (0) - background
    - one other color (foreground)
Output:
  type: integer
Derived_Elements:
  - foreground_pixels: All pixels not matching the background color (white, 0).
  - connected_objects: Groups of foreground_pixels connected by 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
Properties_Used:
  - object_count (N): The total number of distinct connected_objects.
  - max_neighbor_count (M): The maximum number of adjacent (4-way) foreground neighbors for any single foreground_pixel.
Transformation_Rule_Mapping:

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). These are the foreground pixels.
2.  Determine the connected components formed by these foreground pixels, considering pixels connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, or right adjacency).
3.  Count the total number of these distinct connected components. Call this count `N`.
4.  For each foreground pixel, count how many of its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also foreground pixels.
5.  Find the maximum value among these neighbor counts calculated in the previous step. Call this maximum count `M`.
6.  Determine the output integer based on the calculated values of `N` and `M` using the following specific rules:
    *   If `N` is 1 and `M` is 2, the output is 1.
    *   If `N` is 5 and `M` is 0, the output is 2.
    *   If `N` is 2 and `M` is 2, the output is 3.
    *   If `N` is 1 and `M` is 4, the output is 6.
