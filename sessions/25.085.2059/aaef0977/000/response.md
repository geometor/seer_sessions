Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids are both 8x8 in both examples. The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist primarily of a single background color (orange, 7). There is exactly one pixel with a different color (the "special" pixel). In `train_1`, the special pixel is green (3) at (0, 6). In `train_2`, it's gray (5) at (5, 2).
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are filled entirely with colors different from the input background color. The output grid contains a complex pattern of colors using 9 out of the 10 available colors (0-9). The specific 9 colors used are all colors *except* the background color from the input.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve using the special pixel's location and color to generate the output pattern. The pattern appears to radiate outwards from the special pixel's location.
5.  **Pattern Analysis:** Calculating the Manhattan distance (`d = |row_diff| + |col_diff|`) from the special pixel to every other pixel reveals a pattern. The color of an output pixel `(r, c)` depends on its Manhattan distance `d` from the input special pixel `(r0, c0)`.
6.  **Color Sequence:** There is a repeating sequence of 9 colors used in the output. The sequence starts with the color of the special pixel (`C0`) at distance `d=0`. The color at distance `d` is given by `Sequence[d % 9]`.
7.  **Sequence Composition:** The sequence consists of all colors (0-9) *except* the background color found in the input grid. The order of colors in the sequence depends on the starting color `C0` (the special pixel's color). It appears there's a fixed underlying permutation of color indices (relative to the available 9 colors), and this permutation is cyclically shifted so that `C0` becomes the first element.
