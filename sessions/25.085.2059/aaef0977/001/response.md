"""
The transformation takes an input grid, which consists predominantly of a single background color and exactly one 'special' pixel of a different color. It generates an output grid of the same dimensions. The output grid's colors form a pattern based on the Manhattan distance from the location of the input's special pixel.

1. Identify the background color (the most frequent color in the input grid).
2. Identify the 'special' pixel (the unique pixel with a color different from the background). Note its location (r0, c0) and color (C0).
3. Determine the set of 9 colors to be used in the output grid. This set includes all colors from 0 to 9 *except* the background color identified in step 1.
4. Create a specific sequence of these 9 colors. This sequence starts with the special pixel's color (C0) and cycles through the remaining 8 colors in a fixed, but relative, order. The exact order is determined by finding the position of C0 in a standard sorted list of the 9 available colors and then cyclically shifting that list so C0 is first.
5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
6. For each pixel (r, c) in the output grid:
    a. Calculate the Manhattan distance 'd' between (r, c) and the special pixel's location (r0, c0): d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0).
    b. Determine the color for the output pixel (r, c) by taking the color from the sequence generated in step 4 at index (d % 9).
7. Return the completed output grid.
