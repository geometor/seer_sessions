The output grid introduces magenta (6) pixels. The transformation appears to be column-based. By observing the examples, it becomes clear that yellow pixels located in specific columns are changed to magenta, while all other pixels retain their original color. These specific columns correspond to indices that are multiples of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, ...).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
