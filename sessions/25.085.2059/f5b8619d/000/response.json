Observing the dimensions, the output grid appears to be exactly twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.\n2.  **Tiling:** The pattern within the output grid repeats. Specifically, the output grid looks like a 2x2 tiling of a transformed version of the input grid. Let's call the transformed version the \"unit pattern\".\n3.  **Unit Pattern Generation:** To understand the transformation, we can compare the input grid with the top-left quadrant of the output grid (which represents the unit pattern).\n    *   **Non-white Pixels:** Any non-white pixel (gray `5` in train_1, red `2` in train_2, yellow `4` in train_3) in the input grid appears in the same position within the unit pattern in the output.\n    *   **White Pixels (Background):** White pixels (`0`) in the input grid are treated differently. If a white pixel in the input grid is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to *any* non-white pixel, it becomes an azure pixel (`8`) in the corresponding position in the unit pattern.\n    *   **Other White Pixels:** White pixels in the input grid that are *not* adjacent to any non-white pixel remain white (`0`) in the unit pattern.\n4.  **Final Output Construction:** The unit pattern, derived as described above, is then tiled 2x2 to create the final output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
