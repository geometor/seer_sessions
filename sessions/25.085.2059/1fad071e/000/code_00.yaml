task_type: transformation
input_domain: grid
output_domain: grid (vector)
input_colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red (primarily observed)
output_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
input_dimensions: variable (9x9 in examples)
output_dimensions: fixed (1x5)
objects:
  - type: pixel_block
    color: blue (1)
    shape: 2x2 square
    relevance: primary focus for transformation
  - type: pixel_block
    color: red (2)
    shape: various
    relevance: appears irrelevant
  - type: pixel_block
    color: blue (1)
    shape: various (other than 2x2 square)
    relevance: appears irrelevant
transformation_logic:
  - action: find_objects
    target: 2x2 squares of blue (1) pixels in the input grid
  - action: count_objects
    target: the found blue 2x2 squares
  - action: generate_output
    details: Create a 1x5 array. Fill the first 'n' positions with blue (1), where 'n' is the count from the previous step. Fill the remaining positions (5 - n) with white (0).
relationship: count_to_sequence
  - description: The number of identified blue 2x2 squares determines the number of blue pixels placed sequentially from the start of the 1x5 output array.
