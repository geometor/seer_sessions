The blue (1) objects seem particularly relevant. Specifically, 2x2 squares composed entirely of blue pixels appear significant. Red (2) objects and other blue shapes seem irrelevant to the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying and counting a specific feature in the input grid \u2013 the blue 2x2 squares \u2013 and representing this count in the fixed-size output array.\n5.  **Relationship:** The number of blue pixels in the output array directly corresponds to the number of blue 2x2 squares found in the input grid. The output array is filled with blue pixels from the left up to the count, and the remaining positions are filled with white pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
