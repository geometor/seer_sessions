Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 9x9 grids containing pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), blue (1), and red (2).
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are consistently 1x5 arrays (horizontal vectors) containing only blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
3.  **Key Objects:** The input grids contain distinct objects formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. The blue (1) objects seem particularly relevant. Specifically, 2x2 squares composed entirely of blue pixels appear significant. Red (2) objects and other blue shapes seem irrelevant to the output.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying and counting a specific feature in the input grid – the blue 2x2 squares – and representing this count in the fixed-size output array.
5.  **Relationship:** The number of blue pixels in the output array directly corresponds to the number of blue 2x2 squares found in the input grid. The output array is filled with blue pixels from the left up to the count, and the remaining positions are filled with white pixels.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
input_domain: grid
output_domain: grid (vector)
input_colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red (primarily observed)
output_colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
input_dimensions: variable (9x9 in examples)
output_dimensions: fixed (1x5)
objects:
  - type: pixel_block
    color: blue (1)
    shape: 2x2 square
    relevance: primary focus for transformation
  - type: pixel_block
    color: red (2)
    shape: various
    relevance: appears irrelevant
  - type: pixel_block
    color: blue (1)
    shape: various (other than 2x2 square)
    relevance: appears irrelevant
transformation_logic:
  - action: find_objects
    target: 2x2 squares of blue (1) pixels in the input grid
  - action: count_objects
    target: the found blue 2x2 squares
  - action: generate_output
    details: Create a 1x5 array. Fill the first 'n' positions with blue (1), where 'n' is the count from the previous step. Fill the remaining positions (5 - n) with white (0).
relationship: count_to_sequence
  - description: The number of identified blue 2x2 squares determines the number of blue pixels placed sequentially from the start of the 1x5 output array.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all instances of 2x2 blocks where all four pixels are blue (color 1).
2.  Count the total number of such blue 2x2 squares found. Let this count be `N`.
3.  Create a new 1x5 grid (output array).
4.  Fill the first `N` cells of the output array with blue pixels (color 1).
5.  Fill the remaining `5 - N` cells of the output array with white pixels (color 0).
6.  Return the generated 1x5 output array.
