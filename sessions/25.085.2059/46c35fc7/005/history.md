"""
Identifies connected components of non-orange (7) pixels using 8-way adjacency.
For each component, determines its bounding box.
If a component's bounding box is exactly 3x3 pixels in size:
1. Extracts the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid corresponding to this bounding box.
2. Applies a specific pixel rearrangement within this 3x3 subgrid:
    - Input(0,0) -> Output(2,0)
    - Input(0,1) -> Output(1,2)
    - Input(0,2) -> Output(0,0)
    - Input(1,0) -> Output(0,1)
    - Input(1,1) -> Output(1,1) (Center pixel remains)
    - Input(1,2) -> Output(2,1)
    - Input(2,0) -> Output(0,2)
    - Input(2,1) -> Output(1,0)
    - Input(2,2) -> Output(2,2)
   (Coordinates are relative to the top-left of the 3x3 subgrid).
3. Places the rearranged 3x3 subgrid into the output grid at the same location as the bounding box.
Pixels outside of these identified 3x3 bounding boxes remain unchanged from the input grid.
The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.

**Correction:** The code execution result for Example 3 is unexpected! It found only *one* component with a 6x6 bounding box. This contradicts my manual trace and the visual inspection. Let's re-run the component finding specifically for Example 3, perhaps printing the components found.

Maybe the issue is that the two "components" in Example 3 are actually connected diagonally through the orange background? No, the `_find_non_bg_components` explicitly checks `grid[nr, nc] != bg_color`.

Let's look at the grid again.
Example 3 Input:

```
7 7 7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 6 5 5 7  <-- (1,3)=6
7 7 7 5 7 6 7  <-- (2,3)=5, (2,5)=6
7 7 7 1 5 1 7  <-- (3,3)=1, (3,4)=5, (3,5)=1
8 8 8 7 7 7 7  <-- (4,0)=8
9 7 9 7 7 7 7  <-- (5,0)=9, (5,2)=9
0 0 0 7 7 7 7  <-- (6,0)=0
```

Are (3,3)=1 and (4,0)=8 connected? No.
Are (3,5)=1 and (4,2)=8 connected? No.
Are (3,3)=1 and (5,2)=9 connected? No.
Are (3,5)=1 and (5,0)=9 connected? No.
Are (3,4)=5 and (4,0..2)? No.
Are (3,4)=5 and (5,0..2)? No.
Are (3,4)=5 and (6,0..2)? No.

Let's rethink the component finding. It uses 8-way adjacency.
Component 1 (top-right guess): (1,3)=6 connects to (2,3)=5. (2,3)=5 connects to (3,3)=1 and (3,4)=5. (3,4)=5 connects to (2,5)=6 and (3,5)=1. (2,5)=6 connects to (1,5)=5. (1,5)=5 connects to (1,4)=5. (1,4)=5 connects to (1,3)=6. Looks like a single component: {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)}. Bbox: (1,3) to (3,5) -> 3x3.

Component 2 (bottom-left guess): (4,0)=8 connects to (5,0)=9. (5,0)=9 connects to (6,0)=0 and (6,1)=0. (6,1)=0 connects to (6,2)=0. (6,2)=0 connects to (5,2)=9. (5,2)=9 connects to (4,2)=8. (4,2)=8 connects to (4,1)=8. Looks like a single component: {(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)}. Bbox: (4,0) to (6,2) -> 3x3.

Why did the tool code merge them? Let's re-run just for Example 3 and print intermediate steps.

```
**Further Correction:** The verbose output confirms the code found only *one* large component (16 pixels) in Example 3. My manual trace was wrong. I must have missed a connection. Let's re-examine the grid visually and trace connections carefully from the first non-bg pixel (1,3)=6.


```
. . . . . . .
. . . @ @ @ .  (1,3),(1,4),(1,5)
. . . @ . @ .  (2,3),    (2,5)
. . . @ @ @ .  (3,3),(3,4),(3,5)
@ @ @ . . . .  (4,0),(4,1),(4,2)
@ . @ . . . .  (5,0),    (5,2)
@ @ @ . . . .  (6,0),(6,1),(6,2)
```

Where is the connection between the top-right group and the bottom-left group?
Let's check the neighbours of (3,3)=1: (2,3)=5, (3,4)=5, **(4,2)=8** (diagonal). Yes! Pixel (3,3) is diagonally adjacent to pixel (4,2).
My previous check was flawed. The BFS correctly identifies them as a single component.

**Revised Understanding:**

The rule *cannot* be simply "find non-bg components and if their bbox is 3x3, apply permutation". Example 3 demonstrates this doesn't work because the component's bbox is 6x6.

However, the *output* for Example 3 clearly shows two distinct 3x3 areas being transformed using the *same* permutation.

What defines these 3x3 areas?
They aren't defined by component bounding boxes.

Let's look at the *input* structure again.
Example 1: Two 3x3 blocks of mostly non-orange pixels, separated by orange.
Example 2: One central 3x3 block of mostly non-orange pixels, surrounded by orange.
Example 3: Two 3x3 blocks of mostly non-orange pixels, separated by orange, but the non-orange pixels within them are *connected* diagonally.

Perhaps the rule is:
1.  Identify all 3x3 subgrids in the input.
2.  Check if a 3x3 subgrid meets a certain criterion.
3.  If it meets the criterion, apply the permutation to it.

What criterion?
*   Must contain non-orange pixels? (All transformed 3x3s do).
*   Must the *bounding box* of the non-orange pixels *within* the 3x3 subgrid be exactly 3x3?
    *   Ex1 (top-left): `[[9,6,5],[8,7,1],[0,8,9]]`. Non-orange pixels: all except (1,1). Bbox is 3x3. -> Yes.
    *   Ex1 (bottom-right): `[[1,8,4],[4,7,6],[6,2,4]]`. Non-orange pixels: all except (1,1). Bbox is 3x3. -> Yes.
    *   Ex2 (center): `[[5,2,8],[1,7,9],[4,3,0]]`. Non-orange pixels: all except (1,1). Bbox is 3x3. -> Yes.
    *   Ex3 (top-right): `[[6,5,5],[5,7,6],[1,5,1]]`. Non-orange pixels: all except (1,1). Bbox is 3x3. -> Yes.
    *   Ex3 (bottom-left): `[[8,8,8],[9,7,9],[0,0,0]]`. Non-orange pixels: all except (1,1). Bbox is 3x3. -> Yes.

This looks promising! The criterion might be: **Scan all possible 3x3 subgrids. If the bounding box of the non-orange pixels *contained entirely within that 3x3 subgrid* has dimensions 3x3, then apply the permutation to that 3x3 subgrid.**

This fits all examples. Example 3 has two such 3x3 subgrids (rows 1-3, cols 3-5 and rows 4-6, cols 0-2) that satisfy this criterion independently, even though the non-orange pixels within them form a single larger connected component across the whole grid.

Let's refine the Natural Language program based on this new hypothesis.

## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified a specific 3x3 pixel permutation as the core transformation but incorrectly determined the conditions under which this permutation is applied. The assumption that the transformation applies only to 3x3 bounding boxes of globally connected non-orange components failed on Example 3, where the relevant non-orange pixels formed a single larger component.

The strategy is to revise the condition for applying the transformation. Instead of looking at global components, we will analyze all possible 3x3 subgrids within the input and apply the transformation if the non-orange pixels *within* that specific 3x3 subgrid span a 3x3 bounding box.

## Metrics

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid: 7x7
*   Background Color: 7 (orange)
*   Identified 3x3 Regions for Transformation (based on revised hypothesis):
    *   Region 1: Rows 0-2, Cols 0-2. Input `[[9,6,5],[8,7,1],[0,8,9]]`. Non-orange pixels within: {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)}. Bbox of these: (0,0) to (2,2) -> 3x3. Apply permutation.
    *   Region 2: Rows 4-6, Cols 3-5. Input `[[1,8,4],[4,7,6],[6,2,4]]`. Non-orange pixels within: {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)} (relative coords). Bbox of these: (0,0) to (2,2) -> 3x3. Apply permutation.
*   Expected Output requires permutation in these two regions.

**Example 2:**
*   Input Grid: 7x7
*   Background Color: 7 (orange)
*   Identified 3x3 Regions for Transformation (based on revised hypothesis):
    *   Region 1: Rows 2-4, Cols 2-4. Input `[[5,2,8],[1,7,9],[4,3,0]]`. Non-orange pixels within: {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)} (relative coords). Bbox of these: (0,0) to (2,2) -> 3x3. Apply permutation.
*   Expected Output requires permutation in this region.

**Example 3:**
*   Input Grid: 7x7
*   Background Color: 7 (orange)
*   Identified 3x3 Regions for Transformation (based on revised hypothesis):
    *   Region 1: Rows 1-3, Cols 3-5. Input `[[6,5,5],[5,7,6],[1,5,1]]`. Non-orange pixels within: {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)} (relative coords). Bbox of these: (0,0) to (2,2) -> 3x3. Apply permutation.
    *   Region 2: Rows 4-6, Cols 0-2. Input `[[8,8,8],[9,7,9],[0,0,0]]`. Non-orange pixels within: {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)} (relative coords). Bbox of these: (0,0) to (2,2) -> 3x3. Apply permutation.
*   Expected Output requires permutation in these two regions.

This revised hypothesis appears consistent across all training examples.

          - height: 3
          - width: 3
          - scope: calculated only from non-background pixels within the 3x3 subgrid itself.

actions:
  - name: apply_permutation_to_target
    description: Rearrange the pixels within a target 3x3 subgrid according to a fixed pattern.
    condition: The 3x3 subgrid meets the target_criterion.
    permutation_map: # (Input Row, Input Col) -> (Output Row, Output Col), relative to top-left of 3x3
      - [(0,0), (2,0)]

      - [(0,2), (0,0)]
      - [(1,0), (0,1)]
      - [(1,1), (1,1)] # Center pixel remains in place
      - [(1,2), (2,1)]
      - [(2,0), (2,2)]
      - [(2,1), (1,0)]
      - [(2,2), (0,2)]
    effect: Modifies the pixels in the output grid corresponding to the target 3x3 subgrid location.

grid_processing:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Iterate through all possible top-left coordinates (r, c) such that a 3x3 subgrid can be extracted starting at (r, c).
  - step: For each 3x3 subgrid:
      - Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.
      - Identify all non-background (non-orange) pixel coordinates within this 3x3 subgrid.
      - If non-background pixels exist:
          - Calculate the min/max row and column indices of these non-background pixels (relative to the 3x3 subgrid's top-left).
          - Determine the height and width of the bounding box defined by these min/max indices.
          - Check if the height is 3 and the width is 3 (i.e., meets target_criterion).
          - If the criterion is met:
              - Apply the fixed permutation (actions.apply_permutation_to_target.permutation_map) to the extracted 3x3 subgrid.
              - Update the corresponding 3x3 region in the output grid with the permuted subgrid.
  - step: Return the final output grid.

notes:
  - Pixels outside the identified target 3x3 subgrids remain unchanged from the input.
  - The transformation is applied independently to each qualifying 3x3 subgrid.
  - The non-orange pixels within a qualifying 3x3 subgrid do not need to form a single connected component within that subgrid, nor do they need to fill the entire subgrid; they only need to span its full 3x3 extent.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through the input grid, considering every possible 3x3 subgrid. Let the top-left corner of a subgrid be at `(r, c)`.
3.  For each 3x3 subgrid extracted from the *input* grid:
    a.  Identify all pixels within this 3x3 subgrid that are *not* orange (color 7).
    b.  If there are any non-orange pixels:
        i.  Calculate the bounding box of these non-orange pixels *relative to the 3x3 subgrid itself*. That is, find the minimum and maximum row index (0-2) and column index (0-2) occupied by non-orange pixels within the subgrid.
        ii. Check if the height of this bounding box (max_row - min_row + 1) is 3 and the width (max_col - min_col + 1) is 3.
    c.  If the bounding box of the internal non-orange pixels is exactly 3x3:
        i.  Apply the following fixed permutation to the pixels of the 3x3 subgrid extracted in step 3:
            - Pixel at (0,0) moves to (2,0)
            - Pixel at (0,1) moves to (1,2)
            - Pixel at (0,2) moves to (0,0)
            - Pixel at (1,0) moves to (0,1)
            - Pixel at (1,1) stays at (1,1)
            - Pixel at (1,2) moves to (2,1)
            - Pixel at (2,0) moves to (2,2)
            - Pixel at (2,1) moves to (1,0)
            - Pixel at (2,2) moves to (0,2)
            (Coordinates are relative to the top-left of the 3x3 subgrid).
        ii. Place the resulting permuted 3x3 subgrid into the *output* grid at the corresponding location `(r, c)` to `(r+2, c+2)`.
4.  After checking all possible 3x3 subgrids, return the final output grid.
