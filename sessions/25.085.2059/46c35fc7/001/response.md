"""
Identify connected components of non-orange (7) pixels using 8-way adjacency. 
For each component, determine its bounding box.
If a component's bounding box is exactly 3x3 pixels in size:
1. Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the input grid corresponding to this bounding box.
2. Transpose this 3x3 subgrid (swap rows and columns).
3. Place the transposed 3x3 subgrid into the output grid at the same location as the bounding box.
Pixels outside of these identified 3x3 bounding boxes remain unchanged from the input grid.
The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.
