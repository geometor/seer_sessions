task_description: "Identify 3x3 subgrids based on a spatial criterion and apply a permutation to their pixels, conditional on the colors in the subgrid's bottom corners."
background_color: 7 # Orange
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Variable (up to 30x30)
  - values: Integers 0-9 representing colors.
objects:
  - object: "Target Subgrid"
    definition: "A 3x3 subgrid within the input grid."
    properties:
      - criterion: "The non-orange pixels within the subgrid must have a bounding box of exactly 3x3 relative to the subgrid itself."
      - center_pixel: "Always orange (7) in the identified subgrids in the examples."
      - bottom_corners: "The pixels at relative coordinates (2,0) and (2,2) within the subgrid."
actions:
  - action: "Permute Pixels"
    condition: "Applied only to Target Subgrids meeting the criterion."
    details:
      - "The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input."
      - "The transformation occurs in place on the output grid."
      - "The center pixel (1,1) remains unchanged."
      - "Two different permutations (P1 and P1) are applied to the 8 outer pixels."
      - "Permutation P1 is used if the colors of the bottom_corners (Input[2,0] and Input[2,2]) are identical."
      - "Permutation P2 is used if the colors of the bottom_corners are different."
      - "Common Mappings (Input -> Output coords for both P1 & P2):"
        - (0,0) -> (2,0)
        - (0,1) -> (1,2)
        - (0,2) -> (0,0)
        - (1,0) -> (0,1)
        - (1,1) -> (1,1)
        - (1,2) -> (2,1)
        - (2,1) -> (1,0)
      - "Specific Mappings for P1 (Input[2,0] == Input[2,2]):"
        - (2,0) -> (0,2)
        - (2,2) -> (2,2)
      - "Specific Mappings for P2 (Input[2,0] != Input[2,2]):"
        - (2,0) -> (2,2)
        - (2,2) -> (0,2)
