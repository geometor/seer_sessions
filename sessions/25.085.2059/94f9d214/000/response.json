            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height that is twice their width (specifically 8x4 in all examples). The output grids are always square, with dimensions equal to half the height (and the full width) of the input grid (4x4).\n2.  **Input Content:** Each input grid appears to be vertically divided into two halves. The top half (rows 0-3) contains patterns primarily using green (3) and white (0). The bottom half (rows 4-7) contains patterns primarily using blue (1) and white (0). The specific shapes or patterns formed by green and blue pixels vary between examples.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are significantly sparser than the input grids. They consist mostly of the white (0) background color, with a few pixels colored red (2).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve comparing the top half of the input grid with the bottom half. The output grid's size (4x4) matches the size of these halves. The red pixels in the output appear at locations where a specific condition is met based on the corresponding pixels in the top and bottom input halves.\n5.  **Pixel Correspondence Rule:** By comparing the input halves and the output grid pixel by pixel, a clear pattern emerges: a pixel in the output grid is colored red (2) if *and only if* the corresponding pixel in the *top* half of the input AND the corresponding pixel in the *bottom* half of the input are *both* white (0). If either corresponding input pixel is non-white (green or blue in these examples), the output pixel is white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
