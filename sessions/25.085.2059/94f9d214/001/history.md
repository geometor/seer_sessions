Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height that is twice their width (specifically 8x4 in all examples). The output grids are always square, with dimensions equal to half the height (and the full width) of the input grid (4x4).
2.  **Input Content:** Each input grid appears to be vertically divided into two halves. The top half (rows 0-3) contains patterns primarily using green (3) and white (0). The bottom half (rows 4-7) contains patterns primarily using blue (1) and white (0). The specific shapes or patterns formed by green and blue pixels vary between examples.
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are significantly sparser than the input grids. They consist mostly of the white (0) background color, with a few pixels colored red (2).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve comparing the top half of the input grid with the bottom half. The output grid's size (4x4) matches the size of these halves. The red pixels in the output appear at locations where a specific condition is met based on the corresponding pixels in the top and bottom input halves.
5.  **Pixel Correspondence Rule:** By comparing the input halves and the output grid pixel by pixel, a clear pattern emerges: a pixel in the output grid is colored red (2) if *and only if* the corresponding pixel in the *top* half of the input AND the corresponding pixel in the *bottom* half of the input are *both* white (0). If either corresponding input pixel is non-white (green or blue in these examples), the output pixel is white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Compare the top and bottom halves of an input grid to generate an output grid highlighting positions where both halves have the background color.

definitions:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
        height: H
        width: W
        comment: In examples, H=8, W=4. H is always even.
      - type: output
        height: H/2
        width: W
        comment: In examples, 4x4.

  - object: subgrid
    properties:
      - type: top_half
        source: input grid
        rows: 0 to (H/2 - 1)
        columns: 0 to (W - 1)
        pixels: Contains various colors, including background (white=0).
      - type: bottom_half
        source: input grid
        rows: H/2 to (H - 1)
        columns: 0 to (W - 1)
        pixels: Contains various colors, including background (white=0).

relationships:
  - type: correspondence
    from: output grid pixel at (r, c)
    to:
      - top_half pixel at (r, c)
      - bottom_half pixel at (r, c) # Note: This corresponds to input grid pixel at (r + H/2, c)
    comment: Each output pixel maps to one pixel in the top half and one in the bottom half at the same (r, c) coordinates relative to their respective subgrids.

actions:
  - action: generate_output
    actor: system
    steps:
      - Create an output grid of size H/2 x W, initialized to white (0).
      - Iterate through each coordinate (r, c) from (0, 0) to (H/2 - 1, W - 1).
      - Get the color `color_top` from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
      - Get the color `color_bottom` from the input grid at `(r + H/2, c)`.
      - Check if `color_top` is white (0) AND `color_bottom` is white (0).
      - If true, set the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` to red (2).
      - If false, ensure the output grid pixel at `(r, c)` remains white (0). # Default state

constants:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - output_marker_color: red (2)

observations:
  - The specific non-background colors (green=3, blue=1) in the input halves do not influence the output color, only whether a pixel is background or not.
  - The transformation rule is a pixel-wise logical AND operation on the "is background" status of corresponding pixels in the two halves.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height `H` and width `W` of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height `H/2` and width `W`. Initialize all pixels in the output grid to white (color 0).
3.  For each row index `r` from 0 to `(H/2 - 1)`:
4.  For each column index `c` from 0 to `(W - 1)`:
5.  Check the color of the pixel in the input grid at position (`r`, `c`). Let this be `top_pixel_color`.
6.  Check the color of the pixel in the input grid at position (`r + H/2`, `c`). Let this be `bottom_pixel_color`.
7.  If `top_pixel_color` is white (0) AND `bottom_pixel_color` is white (0), then set the color of the pixel in the output grid at position (`r`, `c`) to red (2).
8.  (Otherwise, the output pixel at (`r`, `c`) remains white (0) as per the initialization).
9.  Return the completed output grid.
