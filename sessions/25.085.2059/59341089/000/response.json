The output grid appears to be constructed by manipulating and repeating each row of the input grid horizontally. Specifically, each input row seems to generate its corresponding output row independently. Looking at the pattern within each output row, it seems to be composed of four concatenated segments, each the same width as the input grid (3 pixels). Comparing these segments to the original input row reveals a repeating pattern: the input row reversed, then the original input row, then the reversed row again, and finally the original row again.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
