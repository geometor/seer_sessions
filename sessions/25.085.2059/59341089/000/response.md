*   **Perception:**
    The task involves transforming a small input grid (3x3 in all examples) into a wider output grid (3x12). The height remains constant. The output grid appears to be constructed by manipulating and repeating each row of the input grid horizontally. Specifically, each input row seems to generate its corresponding output row independently. Looking at the pattern within each output row, it seems to be composed of four concatenated segments, each the same width as the input grid (3 pixels). Comparing these segments to the original input row reveals a repeating pattern: the input row reversed, then the original input row, then the reversed row again, and finally the original row again.

*   **Facts:**

    task_context:
      description: Transforms each row of the input grid by creating a sequence of the reversed row and the original row, repeated twice, and concatenating them horizontally.
      grid_relationship:
        height: Output height is the same as input height.
        width: Output width is four times the input width.
      transformation_type: row-based_manipulation # Each row is processed independently.

        description: A 1D horizontal sequence of pixels within the grid.

      row_processing:
        input: row `i` from the input grid.
        steps:
          - operation: reverse
            input: input_row `i`
            output: reversed_row `i`
          - operation: concatenate
            inputs: [reversed_row `i`, input_row `i`, reversed_row `i`, input_row `i`]
            output: output_row `i`
        placement: output_row `i` becomes row `i` in the output grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with height `H` and width `4 * W`.
    3.  For each row index `i` from 0 to `H-1`:
        a.  Extract the `i`-th row from the input grid (`input_row`).
        b.  Create a reversed version of the `input_row` (`reversed_row`).
        c.  Construct the `output_row` by concatenating `reversed_row`, `input_row`, `reversed_row`, and `input_row` in that sequence.
        d.  Assign this `output_row` to the `i`-th row of the output grid.
    4.  Return the completed output grid.
