"""
Analyzes a 4x14 input grid by partitioning it into three 4x4 blocks (skipping 
separator columns 4 and 9). Determines a characteristic color for each block 
based on specific pixel patterns within it. Constructs a 3x3 output grid where 
the first row is filled with the color derived from the first block, the second 
row with the color from the second block, and the third row with the color 
from the third block.

Block Color Determination Rules:
1.  All Gray Rule: If the block contains only gray (5) pixels, its 
    characteristic color is red (2).
2.  Gray and White Rules: If the block contains only gray (5) and white (0) 
    pixels:
    a.  If white pixels form a 2x2 square at rows 1,2 and columns 1,2 
        (relative to block's top-left), the color is azure (8).
    b.  If white pixels form a 2x2 square at rows 2,3 and columns 1,2, the 
        color is yellow (4).
    c.  If the only white pixels are at (1,0), (2,0), (1,3), and (2,3), the 
        color is green (3).
3.  (Hypothetical/Untested): If a block contained exactly one unique color C 
    (other than gray/white), the color would likely be C. This is not needed 
    for the provided examples.
