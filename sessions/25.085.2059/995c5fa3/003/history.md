"""
Analyze a 4x14 input grid, interpreting it as three distinct 4x4 blocks 
separated by white columns (at indices 4 and 9). Determine a characteristic

the first row is filled with the color derived from the first block, the second 
row with the color from the second block, and the third row with the color 
from the third block.

Rule for determining block color:
1. If a block contains exactly one unique color other than gray (5) and white (0), 
   that unique color is the characteristic color.
2. If a block contains only gray (5) pixels, the characteristic color is red (2).
3. If a block contains only gray (5) and white (0) pixels:
   - If it's the first block (leftmost), the color is green (3).
   - If it's the second block (middle), the color is azure (8).
   - The rule for the third block in this state is not defined by the examples, 
     but the observed patterns suggest it would follow either the 'unique color' 
     or 'all gray' rules if applicable.

**General Assessment**

The previous code correctly identified the overall structure of the task: partitioning the input into three 4x4 blocks and mapping each block's properties to a single color in the output 3x3 grid (block 1 -> row 1, block 2 -> row 2, block 3 -> row 3).

However, the rules for determining the characteristic color of each block were incomplete or incorrect, particularly for blocks containing only gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The errors occurred in all four examples, indicating that the logic for the gray+white cases needs significant revision. The "all gray" rule producing red (2) appears correct. The rule for a single unique non-background color was not tested as no examples fit that criterion.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the content of each 4x4 block (specifically the patterns formed by gray and white pixels) and the expected output color for that block, using all four examples to derive a comprehensive rule set.

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's analyze the patterns within each block for all examples using the refined understanding. We define three main patterns:
1.  **All Gray:** The block contains only gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Gray+White (Square):** The block contains only gray (5) and white (0) pixels, and the white pixels form a 2x2 square at columns 1 and 2. We further distinguish if this square is in rows 1,2 ('Center') or rows 2,3 ('Bottom').
3.  **Gray+White (Non-Square):** The block contains only gray (5) and white (0) pixels, where the white pixels are specifically at positions (1,0), (2,0), (1,3), and (2,3).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Input Structure:** The input is a 4x14 grid. Mentally (or actually) divide this grid into three 4x4 blocks by ignoring the white separator columns at index 4 and 9. Label these blocks Block 1 (cols 0-3), Block 2 (cols 5-8), and Block 3 (cols 10-13).
2.  **Analyze Each Block:** For each of the three 4x4 blocks, determine its characteristic color based on the following rules, checked in order:
    a.  **All Gray Rule:** If the block contains only gray (5) pixels, its characteristic color is red (2).
    b.  **Gray and White Rule:** If the block contains only gray (5) and white (0) pixels:
        i.  Check if the white pixels form a 2x2 square located at rows 1, 2 and columns 1, 2 (relative to the block's top-left corner). If yes, the characteristic color is azure (8).
        ii. Check if the white pixels form a 2x2 square located at rows 2, 3 and columns 1, 2. If yes, the characteristic color is yellow (4).
        iii. Check if the only white pixels are located at (1,0), (2,0), (1,3), and (2,3). If yes, the characteristic color is green (3).
    c.  **(Fallback/Hypothetical):** If none of the above apply (e.g., if a block contained a unique color like blue, or a mix not covered), this program does not define the output color based on the provided examples. However, if a block contained exactly one unique color C (where C is not gray or white), the characteristic color would likely be C.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
    a.  Fill the first row (row 0) entirely with the characteristic color determined for Block 1.
    b.  Fill the second row (row 1) entirely with the characteristic color determined for Block 2.
    c.  Fill the third row (row 2) entirely with the characteristic color determined for Block 3.
4.  **Return Result:** The final 3x3 grid is the output.
