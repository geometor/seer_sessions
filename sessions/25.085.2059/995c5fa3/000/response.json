They appear to be visually divided into three distinct 4x4 sections by vertical columns of white pixels (color 0) located at columns 4 and 9.\n2.  **Block Content**: Each 4x4 section (let's call them Block 1, Block 2, Block 3 from left to right) contains pixels of gray (color 5), white (color 0), and sometimes a single other unique color.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are always 3x3. Each row in the output grid consists of a single solid color.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**: There seems to be a direct correspondence between the three input blocks and the three output rows. The color of each output row is determined by the content of the corresponding input block.\n5.  **Color Mapping Rules**:\n    *   If an input block contains a unique color other than gray (5) or white (0), the corresponding output row takes that unique color.\n    *   If an input block consists *only* of gray (5) pixels, the corresponding output row is red (2).\n    *   If an input block consists *only* of gray (5) and white (0) pixels (no other unique color), the output color depends on the block's position:\n        *   Block 1 (leftmost) maps to green (3).\n        *   Block 2 (middle) maps to azure (8).\n        *   (The mapping for Block 3 in this state is not demonstrated in the examples).\n6.  **Output Construction**: The color derived from Block 1 fills the first row of the 3x3 output, the color from Block 2 fills the second row, and the color from Block 3 fills the third row.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Ignore the separator columns (4 and 9).\n2.  **Analyze Blocks**: For each block (Block 1, Block 2, Block 3), determine its content category:\n    *   a.  Identify all unique pixel colors within the block, excluding gray (5) and white (0).\n    *   b.  If exactly one such unique color `C` is found, categorize the block as \"Unique Color `C`\".\n    *   c.  If no such unique colors are found, check if all pixels in the block are gray (5). If yes, categorize the block as \"All Gray\".\n    *   d.  If no unique colors are found and not all pixels are gray (meaning it contains only gray and white), categorize the block as \"Gray+White Only\".\n3.  **Determine Output Colors**: Assign an output color to each block based on its category and position:\n    *   If the category is \"Unique Color `C`\", the output color is `C`.\n    *   If the category is \"All Gray\", the output color is red (2).\n    *   If the category is \"Gray+White Only\":\n        *   If it's Block 1, the output color is green (3).\n        *   If it's Block 2, the output color is azure (8).\n        *   (Assume a default or handle potential error if this occurs for Block 3, as it wasn't seen).\n4.  **Construct Output**: Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill the first row entirely with the output color determined for Block 1, the second row with the color for Block 2, and the third row with the color for Block 3."
