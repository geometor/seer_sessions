*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output grids in all examples have the same dimensions (3x3).
    *   The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding row in the output grid.
    *   The output grid only contains two colors: White (0) and Gray (5).
    *   Observing the relationship between input rows and output rows:
        *   If an input row consists entirely of pixels of the same color (e.g., `[4, 4, 4]` in train\_1, `[6, 6, 6]` in train\_2, `[1, 1, 1]` in train\_3, `[4, 4, 4]` in train\_4), the corresponding output row consists entirely of Gray (5) pixels.
        *   If an input row contains pixels of different colors (e.g., `[2, 9, 2]` in train\_1, `[7, 3, 3]` in train\_2, `[2, 2, 4]` in train\_3, `[2, 3, 2]` in train\_4), the corresponding output row consists entirely of White (0) pixels.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    Task: Transform an input grid to an output grid of the same dimensions based on row properties.
    Elements:
      - Input_Grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
      - Output_Grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0 or 5).
      - Row: A horizontal line of pixels within a grid.
    Properties:
      - Row_Uniformity: A boolean property indicating whether all pixels in a row share the same color.
    Transformation:
      - Row_Mapping: Each row in the input grid maps to a corresponding row in the output grid.
      - Color_Assignment:
        - If a row in the Input_Grid has Row_Uniformity = True (all pixels same color), the corresponding row in the Output_Grid is filled entirely with Gray (5).
        - If a row in the Input_Grid has Row_Uniformity = False (pixels have different colors), the corresponding row in the Output_Grid is filled entirely with White (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  For each row in the input grid:
        a.  Check if all pixels in the current row have the same color value.
        b.  If all pixels in the row have the same color, fill the corresponding row in the output grid entirely with Gray (5).
        c.  If the pixels in the row have different colors, fill the corresponding row in the output grid entirely with White (0).
    3.  Return the completed output grid.
