  - description: Input grid contains a single non-white pixel.
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      quantity: 1
  - description: Output grid matches input dimensions.
  - description: The original red pixel location becomes white (0) in the output.
  - description: Four potential output pixels are generated based on the input red pixel's location.
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
        location_rule: Relative to input pixel at (r, c), place at (r-1, c-1)
      - color: magenta (6)
        location_rule: Relative to input pixel at (r, c), place at (r-1, c+1)
      - color: azure (8)
        location_rule: Relative to input pixel at (r, c), place at (r+1, c-1)
      - color: orange (7)
        location_rule: Relative to input pixel at (r, c), place at (r+1, c+1)
  - description: Placement constraint for output pixels.
    properties:
      condition: The calculated row and column indices must be within the grid boundaries (0 <= row < height, 0 <= col < width).
      action_if_false: Do not place the pixel.
