The position of the red pixel varies across examples.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Each output grid has the same dimensions as its corresponding input grid. The original red pixel from the input is replaced with white (color 0). Several new non-white pixels appear in the output grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves locating the single red pixel in the input. Four specific colors (green-3, magenta-6, azure-8, orange-7) are placed in the output grid at positions diagonally adjacent to the original red pixel's location.\n4.  **Diagonal Placement:**\n    *   Green (3) appears at the position diagonally up-left (-1 row, -1 column) relative to the red pixel.\n    *   Magenta (6) appears diagonally up-right (-1 row, +1 column).\n    *   Azure (8) appears diagonally down-left (+1 row, -1 column).\n    *   Orange (7) appears diagonally down-right (+1 row, +1 column).\n5.  **Boundary Condition:** A colored pixel is only placed in the output if its calculated diagonal position falls within the bounds of the grid. If a diagonal position is outside the grid (e.g., row index < 0 or column index >= width), no pixel is placed for that direction.\n6.  **Consistency:** The colors associated with each diagonal direction are consistent across all examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
