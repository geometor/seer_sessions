Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids in the examples are 10 rows high and 4 columns wide.
2.  **Content Distribution:** In both input examples, the top half (rows 0-4) is entirely white (0), while the bottom half (rows 5-9) contains various colored pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid appears to be constructed based solely on the content of the *bottom half* of the input grid.
4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid's bottom half (rows 5-9) is an exact copy of the input grid's bottom half. The output grid's top half (rows 0-4) is a vertically flipped (mirrored) version of the input grid's bottom half.
5.  **Symmetry:** The output grid exhibits a form of vertical symmetry centered around the horizontal line between row 4 and row 5. The bottom half is copied directly, and the top half is its reflection across this midline.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Create an output grid by reflecting the bottom half of the input grid into the top half and copying it into the bottom half.
grid_properties:
  - input_height: 10
  - input_width: 4
  - output_height: 10
  - output_width: 4
  - background_color: 0 (white) # Predominant color, especially in the input's top half
regions:
  - region_name: input_top_half
    rows: 0 to 4 (inclusive)
    content: Primarily background color (ignored in transformation)
  - region_name: input_bottom_half
    rows: 5 to 9 (inclusive)
    content: Contains the relevant pattern/objects for the transformation.
  - region_name: output_top_half
    rows: 0 to 4 (inclusive)
    content: Derived from input_bottom_half.
  - region_name: output_bottom_half
    rows: 5 to 9 (inclusive)
    content: Derived from input_bottom_half.
transformations:
  - action: split_input_vertically
    parameters:
      split_point: Midpoint of height (between row index H//2 - 1 and H//2)
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - input_top_half (implicitly discarded)
      - input_bottom_half
  - action: copy
    parameters:
      source: input_bottom_half
      destination: output_bottom_half
  - action: flip_vertical
    parameters:
      source: input_bottom_half
    outputs:
      - flipped_bottom_half
  - action: copy
    parameters:
      source: flipped_bottom_half
      destination: output_top_half
relationships:
  - output_top_half is the vertical reflection of input_bottom_half.
  - output_bottom_half is identical to input_bottom_half.
  - The final output grid is formed by concatenating output_top_half and output_bottom_half vertically.
assumptions:
  - The input grid height (H) is assumed to be even, allowing a clean split into two equal halves.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) of the input grid.
3.  Calculate the middle row index `mid = H // 2`.
4.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to the bottom half of the input grid (rows from index `mid` to `H-1`). Call this `BottomHalf`.
5.  Create a vertically flipped copy of `BottomHalf`. Call this `FlippedBottomHalf`.
6.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
7.  Place `FlippedBottomHalf` into the top half of the output grid (rows from index 0 to `mid-1`).
8.  Place `BottomHalf` into the bottom half of the output grid (rows from index `mid` to `H-1`).
9.  Return the resulting output grid.
