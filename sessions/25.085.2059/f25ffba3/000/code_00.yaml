task_description: Create an output grid by reflecting the bottom half of the input grid into the top half and copying it into the bottom half.
grid_properties:
  - input_height: 10
  - input_width: 4
  - output_height: 10
  - output_width: 4
  - background_color: 0 (white) # Predominant color, especially in the input's top half
regions:
  - region_name: input_top_half
    rows: 0 to 4 (inclusive)
    content: Primarily background color (ignored in transformation)
  - region_name: input_bottom_half
    rows: 5 to 9 (inclusive)
    content: Contains the relevant pattern/objects for the transformation.
  - region_name: output_top_half
    rows: 0 to 4 (inclusive)
    content: Derived from input_bottom_half.
  - region_name: output_bottom_half
    rows: 5 to 9 (inclusive)
    content: Derived from input_bottom_half.
transformations:
  - action: split_input_vertically
    parameters:
      split_point: Midpoint of height (between row index H//2 - 1 and H//2)
    inputs:
      - input_grid
    outputs:
      - input_top_half (implicitly discarded)
      - input_bottom_half
  - action: copy
    parameters:
      source: input_bottom_half
      destination: output_bottom_half
  - action: flip_vertical
    parameters:
      source: input_bottom_half
    outputs:
      - flipped_bottom_half
  - action: copy
    parameters:
      source: flipped_bottom_half
      destination: output_top_half
relationships:
  - output_top_half is the vertical reflection of input_bottom_half.
  - output_bottom_half is identical to input_bottom_half.
  - The final output grid is formed by concatenating output_top_half and output_bottom_half vertically.
assumptions:
  - The input grid height (H) is assumed to be even, allowing a clean split into two equal halves.
