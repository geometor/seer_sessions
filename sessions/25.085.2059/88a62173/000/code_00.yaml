InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Shape: 5x5
    - Contains: One dominant non-white color and white (0) pixels.
    - Structure: Can be conceptually divided into four 2x2 quadrants by ignoring the middle row (index 2) and middle column (index 2).

Quadrants:
  Definition: Four 2x2 subgrids extracted from the InputGrid.
  Coordinates:
    - TopLeft (TL): Rows 0-1, Columns 0-1
    - TopRight (TR): Rows 0-1, Columns 3-4
    - BottomLeft (BL): Rows 3-4, Columns 0-1
    - BottomRight (BR): Rows 3-4, Columns 3-4

Relationship:
  - Comparison: The four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR) are compared to each other based on their pixel content.
  - Uniqueness: In the provided examples, exactly one quadrant differs in content from the other three.

Action:
  - Selection: Identify the unique quadrant among the four.
  - Extraction: Copy the unique quadrant.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Shape: 2x2
    - Content: Identical to the unique quadrant identified in the InputGrid.
