White pixels (color 0) may also be present in both.\n3.  **Grid Division:** The input grid has a consistent structure: a central row (row index 2) and a central column (column index 2) that seem to act as separators, though they are not always filled with white pixels. These effectively divide the grid into four 2x2 corner regions or \"quadrants\".\n4.  **Quadrant Extraction:** The output grid appears to be an exact copy of one of these four 2x2 quadrants from the input grid.\n    *   Top-Left (TL): Input rows 0-1, columns 0-1\n    *   Top-Right (TR): Input rows 0-1, columns 3-4\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): Input rows 3-4, columns 0-1\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): Input rows 3-4, columns 3-4\n5.  **Selection Rule:** By comparing the contents of the four quadrants in each example, a pattern emerges: the quadrant selected as the output is the one that is *unique* among the four. In each example, three quadrants are identical, and one is different. This unique quadrant becomes the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
