Okay, I will analyze the task examples and provide the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is always a 5x5 grid, and the output is always a 2x2 grid.
2.  **Color Preservation:** The primary non-white color present in the input grid is the only non-white color present in the output grid. White pixels (color 0) may also be present in both.
3.  **Grid Division:** The input grid has a consistent structure: a central row (row index 2) and a central column (column index 2) that seem to act as separators, though they are not always filled with white pixels. These effectively divide the grid into four 2x2 corner regions or "quadrants".
4.  **Quadrant Extraction:** The output grid appears to be an exact copy of one of these four 2x2 quadrants from the input grid.
    *   Top-Left (TL): Input rows 0-1, columns 0-1
    *   Top-Right (TR): Input rows 0-1, columns 3-4
    *   Bottom-Left (BL): Input rows 3-4, columns 0-1
    *   Bottom-Right (BR): Input rows 3-4, columns 3-4
5.  **Selection Rule:** By comparing the contents of the four quadrants in each example, a pattern emerges: the quadrant selected as the output is the one that is *unique* among the four. In each example, three quadrants are identical, and one is different. This unique quadrant becomes the output.

**Facts**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Shape: 5x5
    - Contains: One dominant non-white color and white (0) pixels.
    - Structure: Can be conceptually divided into four 2x2 quadrants by ignoring the middle row (index 2) and middle column (index 2).

Quadrants:
  Definition: Four 2x2 subgrids extracted from the InputGrid.
  Coordinates:
    - TopLeft (TL): Rows 0-1, Columns 0-1
    - TopRight (TR): Rows 0-1, Columns 3-4
    - BottomLeft (BL): Rows 3-4, Columns 0-1
    - BottomRight (BR): Rows 3-4, Columns 3-4

Relationship:
  - Comparison: The four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR) are compared to each other based on their pixel content.
  - Uniqueness: In the provided examples, exactly one quadrant differs in content from the other three.

Action:
  - Selection: Identify the unique quadrant among the four.
  - Extraction: Copy the unique quadrant.

OutputGrid:
  Properties:
    - Shape: 2x2
    - Content: Identical to the unique quadrant identified in the InputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Given the input 5x5 grid.
2.  Extract four 2x2 subgrids (quadrants) from the input grid, ignoring the middle row (index 2) and the middle column (index 2):
    *   Quadrant 1 (Top-Left): Copy the pixels from input rows 0-1 and columns 0-1.
    *   Quadrant 2 (Top-Right): Copy the pixels from input rows 0-1 and columns 3-4.
    *   Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Left): Copy the pixels from input rows 3-4 and columns 0-1.
    *   Quadrant 4 (Bottom-Right): Copy the pixels from input rows 3-4 and columns 3-4.
3.  Compare the four extracted quadrants based on their pixel contents.
4.  Identify the single quadrant whose content is different from the other three quadrants.
5.  The identified unique quadrant is the output grid.
