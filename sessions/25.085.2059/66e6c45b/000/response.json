In the first example, these are gray (5), magenta (6), azure (8), and green (3). In the second example, they are green (3), yellow (4), orange (7), and magenta (6).\n\nThe output grid is also a 4x4 grid with a white background. The four non-white pixels from the input's central 2x2 block have been moved to the four corners of the output grid. Specifically:\n- The pixel that was at the top-left of the 2x2 block in the input moves to the top-left corner (0,0) of the output.\n- The pixel that was at the top-right of the 2x2 block in the input moves to the top-right corner (0, width-1) of the output.\n- The pixel that was at the bottom-left of the 2x2 block in the input moves to the bottom-left corner (height-1, 0) of the output.\n- The pixel that was at the bottom-right of the 2x2 block in the input moves to the bottom-right corner (height-1, width-1) of the output.\n\nAll other positions in the output grid are filled with the background color (white, 0). The size of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

These pixels form a 2x2 block. Let the coordinates of the top-left pixel of this block be (r, c). The four pixels will be at (r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), and (r+1, c+1).\n3.  **Map Pixels to Corners**:\n    a.  Take the pixel value from input grid location (r, c) and place it at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.\n    b.  Take the pixel value from input grid location (r, c+1) and place it at the top-right corner (0, width-1) of the output grid, where 'width' is the width of the grid.\n    c.  Take the pixel value from input grid location (r+1, c) and place it at the bottom-left corner (height-1, 0) of the output grid, where 'height' is the height of the grid.\n    d.  Take the pixel value from input grid location (r+1, c+1) and place it at the bottom-right corner (height-1, width-1) of the output grid.\n4.  **Return Output**: The resulting grid is the final output."
