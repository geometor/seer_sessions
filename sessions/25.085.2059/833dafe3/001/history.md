Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both examples show an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
2.  **Size Transformation:** In both examples, the output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the input grid's dimensions.
    *   Example 1: Input 4x4 -> Output 8x8
    *   Example 2: Input 3x3 -> Output 6x6
3.  **Content Relationship:** The colors present in the input grid are the same colors present in the output grid. The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging transformed versions of the input grid.
4.  **Quadrant Structure:** The output grid seems visually divisible into four equal quadrants, each having the same dimensions as the original input grid.
5.  **Transformation Identification:** By comparing the input grid to each quadrant of the output grid, specific geometric transformations become apparent:
    *   The **bottom-right** quadrant of the output is identical to the input grid.
    *   The **bottom-left** quadrant is a horizontal reflection (mirrored left-to-right) of the input grid.
    *   The **top-right** quadrant is a vertical reflection (mirrored top-to-bottom) of the input grid.
    *   The **top-left** quadrant is both a horizontal and vertical reflection of the input grid (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation). It can also be seen as a horizontal reflection of the top-right quadrant or a vertical reflection of the bottom-left quadrant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Create an output grid by arranging four transformed versions of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      attributes: [height, width, pixels]
  - output_grid:
      attributes: [height, width, pixels]
      height: ट(input_grid.height * 2)
      width: ट(input_grid.width * 2)
transformation:
  type: Geometric Tiling
  steps:
    - name: Define quadrants
      details: Divide the output grid conceptually into four equal quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), each the size of the input grid.
    - name: Populate bottom-right quadrant
      operation: Copy
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: bottom-right
    - name: Populate bottom-left quadrant
      operation: Horizontal Reflection
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: bottom-left
    - name: Populate top-right quadrant
      operation: Vertical Reflection
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: top-right
    - name: Populate top-left quadrant
      operation: Horizontal and Vertical Reflection (or 180-degree rotation)
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: top-left
relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - Output grid is composed of four quadrants.
  - Each quadrant's content is derived from the input grid via specific reflections or a direct copy.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 2H and width 2W.
3.  Copy the input grid directly into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
4.  Create a horizontally reflected version of the input grid. Place this reflected grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
5.  Create a vertically reflected version of the input grid. Place this reflected grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
6.  Create a version of the input grid that is reflected both horizontally and vertically (or rotated 180 degrees). Place this transformed grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
