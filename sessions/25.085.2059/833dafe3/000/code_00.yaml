task_description: Create an output grid by arranging four transformed versions of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      attributes: [height, width, pixels]
  - output_grid:
      attributes: [height, width, pixels]
      height: ट(input_grid.height * 2)
      width: ट(input_grid.width * 2)
transformation:
  type: Geometric Tiling
  steps:
    - name: Define quadrants
      details: Divide the output grid conceptually into four equal quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), each the size of the input grid.
    - name: Populate bottom-right quadrant
      operation: Copy
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: bottom-right
    - name: Populate bottom-left quadrant
      operation: Horizontal Reflection
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: bottom-left
    - name: Populate top-right quadrant
      operation: Vertical Reflection
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: top-right
    - name: Populate top-left quadrant
      operation: Horizontal and Vertical Reflection (or 180-degree rotation)
      source: input_grid
      target_quadrant: top-left
relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - Output grid is composed of four quadrants.
  - Each quadrant's content is derived from the input grid via specific reflections or a direct copy.
