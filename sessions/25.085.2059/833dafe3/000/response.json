The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging transformed versions of the input grid.\n4.  **Quadrant Structure:** The output grid seems visually divisible into four equal quadrants, each having the same dimensions as the original input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Identification:** By comparing the input grid to each quadrant of the output grid, specific geometric transformations become apparent:\n    *   The **bottom-right** quadrant of the output is identical to the input grid.\n    *   The **bottom-left** quadrant is a horizontal reflection (mirrored left-to-right) of the input grid.\n    *   The **top-right** quadrant is a vertical reflection (mirrored top-to-bottom) of the input grid.\n    *   The **top-left** quadrant is both a horizontal and vertical reflection of the input grid (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation). It can also be seen as a horizontal reflection of the top-right quadrant or a vertical reflection of the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
