Input:
  type: grid
  size: 3x3
  pixels: Various colors (magenta, blue, orange, yellow, red, green, white, maroon)

Output:
  type: grid
  size: 9x9
  structure: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of subgrids.

Subgrids:
  count: 9
  size: 3x3
  source: Each subgrid is derived from the entire input grid.
  transformation_rule: Depends on the subgrid's position (row_idx, col_idx) in the 3x3 arrangement (0-indexed).

Transformations:
  - type: Identity
    condition: Position is (1, 1) # Center
    result: Subgrid is identical to the input grid.
  - type: Flip Horizontal
    condition: Position is (1, 0) or (1, 2) # Middle row, excluding center
    result: Subgrid is the input grid flipped horizontally.
  - type: Flip Vertical
    condition: Position is (0, 1) or (2, 1) # Middle column, excluding center
    result: Subgrid is the input grid flipped vertically.
  - type: Rotate 180 degrees (or Flip Horizontal then Flip Vertical)
    condition: Position is (0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), or (2, 2) # Corners
    result: Subgrid is the input grid rotated 180 degrees.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions (9x9) are 3 times the input grid dimensions (3x3).
  - The transformation applied to create a subgrid is determined solely by its relative position within the output grid's 3x3 structure.
