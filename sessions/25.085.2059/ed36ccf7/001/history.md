Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids in the examples are 3x3.
2.  **Colors:** Each example uses two colors: 'white' (0) and one other distinct color (maroon (9), magenta (6), red (2)).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to rearrange the pixels within the grid. Comparing the input and output grids element by element suggests a specific geometric transformation.
4.  **Example 1 (maroon):**
    *   Input row 1 `(0 0 9)` becomes Output column 3 `(9 9 9)`.
    *   Input row 2 `(0 0 9)` becomes Output column 2 `(0 0 9)`.
    *   Input row 3 `(9 9 9)` becomes Output column 1 `(9 0 0)`.
    This doesn't seem right. Let's retry.
    *   Input column 1 `(0 0 9)` becomes Output row 1 `(9 0 0)`. Error in my previous analysis, let me recheck the provided train_1 output.
    Ah, the output for `train_1` is:
    
```
    9 9 9
    0 0 9
    0 0 9
    ```

    Let's re-evaluate:
    *   Input row 1 `(0 0 9)` becomes Output column 1 `(9 0 0)`. This does *not* match.
    *   Input column 1 `(0 0 9)` becomes Output row 1 `(9 9 9)`. This does *not* match.

    Let's look at the relationship `input[r][c]` -> `output[c][r]` (transposition).
    *   `input[0][0]=0` -> `output[0][0]=9`. Doesn't match.
    *   `input[0][1]=0` -> `output[1][0]=0`. Matches.
    *   `input[0][2]=9` -> `output[2][0]=0`. Doesn't match.

    Let's look at the relationship `input[r][c]` -> `output[r][c]` (identity). No change. Clearly wrong.
    Let's look at the relationship `input[r][c]` -> `output[c][r]` again for all examples, maybe I misread an earlier example.

    *   **train_1:**
        Input: `[[0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9]]`
        Output: `[[9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9]]`
        Transposed Input: `[[0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9]]`. **Does not match output.**

    *   **train_2:**
        Input: `[[6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0]]`
        Output: `[[6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 0]]`
        Transposed Input: `[[6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 0]]`. **Matches output.**

    *   **train_3:**
        Input: `[[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]]`
        Output: `[[2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]]`
        Transposed Input: `[[2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]]`. **Matches output.**

    *   **train_4:**
        Input: `[[9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]`
        Output: `[[9, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9]]`
        Transposed Input: `[[9, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9]]`. **Matches output.**

5.  **Revised Observation:** It seems `train_1` might be an anomaly or there's a misunderstanding in the provided example pair for `train_1`. Examples 2, 3, and 4 consistently show a **transposition** of the input grid. The element at input position `(row, column)` moves to the output position `(column, row)`.

Assuming the pattern from examples 2, 3, and 4 is the correct one:

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transposition
Examples_Consistent: train_2, train_3, train_4
Potential_Anomaly: train_1 (Input/Output does not match transposition)

Input_Object:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: H rows, W columns (Observed: 3x3 in examples)
    - Pixels: Each cell has a color value (integer 0-9)

Output_Object:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: W rows, H columns (Observed: 3x3 in examples, as W=H)
    - Pixels: Each cell has a color value (integer 0-9)

Transformation:
  Name: Transposition
  Rule: The pixel value at input grid position (row `r`, column `c`) is moved to the output grid position (column `c`, row `r`).
  Scope: Applies to the entire grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with width H and height W.
4.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to H-1 of the input grid.
5.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to W-1 of the input grid.
6.  Get the color value of the pixel located at `(r, c)` in the input grid.
7.  Place this color value into the output grid at position `(c, r)`.
8.  After iterating through all pixels, return the completed output grid.
