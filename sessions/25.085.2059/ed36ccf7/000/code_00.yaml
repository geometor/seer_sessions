Task: Grid Transposition
Examples_Consistent: train_2, train_3, train_4
Potential_Anomaly: train_1 (Input/Output does not match transposition)

Input_Object:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: H rows, W columns (Observed: 3x3 in examples)
    - Pixels: Each cell has a color value (integer 0-9)

Output_Object:
  Type: Grid
  Properties:
    - Dimensions: W rows, H columns (Observed: 3x3 in examples, as W=H)
    - Pixels: Each cell has a color value (integer 0-9)

Transformation:
  Name: Transposition
  Rule: The pixel value at input grid position (row `r`, column `c`) is moved to the output grid position (column `c`, row `r`).
  Scope: Applies to the entire grid.
