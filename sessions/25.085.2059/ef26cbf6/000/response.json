            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature prominent horizontal and vertical lines of yellow pixels (color 4). These lines appear to act as separators or boundaries.\n2.  **Separated Regions:** The yellow lines divide the grid into distinct rectangular regions. In `train_1`, there are three horizontal bands separated by yellow lines. Within each band, a vertical yellow line further divides it into a left and a right sub-region. In `train_2`, there is one horizontal band below a yellow line, divided into three vertical sections by yellow lines.\n3.  **Content within Regions:**\n    *   Within each \"band\" or major horizontal section defined by the yellow lines, there seems to be a consistent pattern.\n    *   On the left side of a vertical yellow separator within a band, there is typically a single, non-white, non-yellow pixel (e.g., orange, green, azure in `train_1`; green, red, magenta in `train_2`). Let's call this the \"source color\".\n    *   On the right side of the same vertical yellow separator within the same band, there are multiple blue pixels (color 1) arranged in a pattern.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The yellow lines (color 4) remain unchanged between input and output.\n    *   The white pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.\n    *   The \"source color\" pixel on the left side of a vertical separator remains unchanged.\n    *   The blue pixels (color 1) on the right side of a vertical separator are replaced by the \"source color\" found on the left side *within the same horizontal band*.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
