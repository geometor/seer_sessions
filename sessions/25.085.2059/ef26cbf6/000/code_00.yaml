features:
  - name: grid_structure
    description: Grids are divided by horizontal and vertical lines of yellow pixels (color 4).
    properties:
      - separator_color: 4 (yellow)
      - orientation: horizontal and vertical
  - name: regions
    description: The yellow lines partition the grid into distinct rectangular regions or bands.
    properties:
      - type: horizontal_bands
      - subdivision: vertical_subregions_within_bands
  - name: source_color_object
    description: Within a horizontal band, a single non-white, non-yellow pixel exists to the left of a vertical yellow separator.
    properties:
      - location: left_subregion
      - quantity: typically_one
      - color: variable (e.g., orange, green, azure, red, magenta)
      - excludes: [0, 4] # white, yellow
  - name: target_pixels
    description: Pixels of a specific color (blue, color 1) exist to the right of a vertical yellow separator within the same horizontal band as a source_color_object.
    properties:
      - location: right_subregion
      - color: 1 (blue)
  - name: transformation
    description: Modifies pixels within the grid based on region structure and specific colors.
    properties:
      - type: color_replacement
      - target_color: 1 (blue)
      - replacement_rule: Replace target_color pixels with the source_color_object's color from the corresponding horizontal band.
      - scope: Applied independently within each horizontal band defined by yellow lines.
      - invariant_elements:
          - yellow lines (color 4)
          - white pixels (color 0)
          - source_color_object pixels
