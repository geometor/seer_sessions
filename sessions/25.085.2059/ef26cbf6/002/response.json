            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the \"source\" color and the \"target\" blue pixels were within the same horizontal band, separated only by a vertical yellow line. The examples show that this is incorrect. The source color is located in one band (typically the first non-separator band), and it influences the blue pixels in corresponding vertical regions within *subsequent* bands.\n\nThe core issue was searching for the source color within the same band where the blue pixels reside. The correct approach seems to be:\n\n1.  Identify **global** vertical separators (columns of yellow spanning relevant rows).\n2.  Identify horizontal separators (rows of yellow).\n3.  Use these separators to define a grid of regions.\n4.  Locate the \"source\" color within each region of the **first** horizontal band.\n5.  For regions in **subsequent** horizontal bands, replace any blue (1) pixels with the source color found in the vertically aligned region of the first band.\n\n**Metrics and Evidence Gathering**\n\nLet's gather some specific data about the examples.\n"

The previous code's logic for finding these seems adequate, although checking vertical separators globally (`grid[:, c]`) might be slightly more robust than checking within each band.\n*   **Color Counts:** Comparing input and output counts confirms the transformation:\n    *   Example 1: 16 blue (1) pixels disappear. The counts of orange (7), green (3), and azure (8) increase, matching the source colors found in the first band.\n    *   Example 2: 16 blue (1) pixels disappear. The counts of green (3), red (2), and magenta (6) increase, matching the source colors found in the first band.\n*   **Structure:** The grid is divided into horizontal bands by yellow rows. Within each band, the grid is divided into vertical regions by yellow columns.\n*   **Source Locations:** In both examples, the source colors (7, 3, 8 in Ex1; 3, 2, 6 in Ex2) are single, non-white, non-yellow pixels located in the *first* horizontal band (above the first yellow row). Each source color is in a different vertical region defined by the yellow columns.\n*   **Target Locations:** The blue (1) pixels that get changed are located in the *subsequent* horizontal bands (below the first yellow row). They fall within the same vertical regions as their corresponding source colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n"
