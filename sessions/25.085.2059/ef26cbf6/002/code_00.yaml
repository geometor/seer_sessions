task_description: Replace blue pixels in lower regions with a source color found in the corresponding upper region.

grid_properties:
  - Latticework structure defined by separators.
  - Separators are solid lines of a single color (yellow, 4).
  - Horizontal separators: Complete rows of yellow pixels.
  - Vertical separators: Complete columns of yellow pixels.

objects:
  - separator_h: Horizontal line object (row) composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels.
  - separator_v: Vertical line object (column) composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels.
  - source_pixel: A single pixel in the first horizontal band (above the first separator_h), not white (0) or yellow (4). There is one source_pixel per vertical region defined by separator_v.
  - target_pixel: Any blue (1) pixel located in horizontal bands below the first separator_h.

regions:
  - horizontal_bands: Areas between horizontal separators (or grid boundaries).
  - vertical_regions: Areas between vertical separators (or grid boundaries).
  - cells: Intersections of horizontal_bands and vertical_regions, excluding separators.

actions:
  - identify: Locate horizontal and vertical separators.
  - define: Establish boundaries for horizontal_bands and vertical_regions based on separators.
  - locate_source: Find the color of the source_pixel within each vertical_region in the *first* horizontal_band.
  - locate_target: Find all target_pixels (blue) within each vertical_region in *subsequent* horizontal_bands.
  - replace: Change the color of each located target_pixel to the color of the source_pixel found in the vertically aligned region of the first band.

relationships:
  - vertical_alignment: A target_pixel's vertical_region corresponds to a source_pixel's vertical_region.
  - band_order: Source_pixels are in the first band; target_pixels are in subsequent bands.

invariants:
  - Separator pixels (yellow) remain unchanged.
  - White pixels (0) remain unchanged.
  - Source pixels remain unchanged.
  - Pixels other than blue (1) in target regions remain unchanged.
