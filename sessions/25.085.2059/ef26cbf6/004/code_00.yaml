observations:
  - task_type: "Color replacement within segmented grid"
  - grid_features:
      - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors 0-9).
      - output_grid: 2D array of the same dimensions as the input.
  - separators:
      - type: "Lines of a single color"
      - color: "Yellow (4)"
      - orientation: "Horizontal (full rows) and Vertical (full columns)"
      - function: "Divide the grid into independent rectangular regions."
  - regions:
      - definition: "Rectangular areas bounded by separators or grid edges."
      - properties:
          - location: Defined by row and column ranges.
          - content: Pixels of various colors.
          - band_index: Vertical position relative to horizontal separators (0 for top band).
          - column_index: Horizontal position relative to vertical separators (0 for leftmost region).
  - target_pixels:
      - color: "Blue (1)"
      - location: "Found within specific regions."
  - source_color:
      - definition: "The first pixel encountered within a specified 'source' region that is NOT White (0), Yellow (4), or Blue (1)."
      - role: "Used to replace the target (Blue) pixels."
  - transformation_rule:
      - condition: "A region contains Blue (1) pixels."
      - action: "Replace all Blue (1) pixels within that region."
      - source_determination_priority:
          1. "Check the region directly ABOVE (same column_index, band_index - 1)."
          2. "If no source color found above (or no region above), check the region immediately to the LEFT (same band_index, column_index - 1)."
      - color_application: "Use the source_color found via the priority rule."
  - invariance:
      - "Yellow separator lines remain unchanged."
      - "Regions not containing Blue pixels remain unchanged (unless they serve as a source)."
      - "Grid dimensions remain unchanged."
      - "Pixels that are not Blue (1) within a Blue-containing region remain unchanged."
