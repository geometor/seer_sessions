Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids feature prominent horizontal and vertical lines of yellow pixels (color 4). These lines appear to act as separators or boundaries.
2.  **Separated Regions:** The yellow lines divide the grid into distinct rectangular regions. In `train_1`, there are three horizontal bands separated by yellow lines. Within each band, a vertical yellow line further divides it into a left and a right sub-region. In `train_2`, there is one horizontal band below a yellow line, divided into three vertical sections by yellow lines.
3.  **Content within Regions:**
    *   Within each "band" or major horizontal section defined by the yellow lines, there seems to be a consistent pattern.
    *   On the left side of a vertical yellow separator within a band, there is typically a single, non-white, non-yellow pixel (e.g., orange, green, azure in `train_1`; green, red, magenta in `train_2`). Let's call this the "source color".
    *   On the right side of the same vertical yellow separator within the same band, there are multiple blue pixels (color 1) arranged in a pattern.
4.  **Transformation:**
    *   The yellow lines (color 4) remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   The white pixels (color 0) remain unchanged.
    *   The "source color" pixel on the left side of a vertical separator remains unchanged.
    *   The blue pixels (color 1) on the right side of a vertical separator are replaced by the "source color" found on the left side *within the same horizontal band*.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all horizontal lines composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4). These lines define horizontal "bands" in the grid. The areas above the first line, between lines, and below the last line are considered separate bands.
2.  For each horizontal band identified in step 1:
    a.  Identify all vertical lines composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4) *within that band*. These vertical lines define left and right sub-regions within the band.
    b.  Scan the sub-region(s) to the *left* of a vertical yellow line within the current band to find the first non-white (0) and non-yellow (4) pixel. Record this pixel's color as the "source color" for this band. If multiple vertical separators exist in a band (like `train_2`), find the source color associated with each left-hand section relative to its right-hand section.
    c.  Scan the sub-region(s) to the *right* of the same vertical yellow line(s) within the current band.
    d.  Replace every blue pixel (color 1) found in these right sub-region(s) with the corresponding "source color" identified in step 2b for that specific pairing across the vertical yellow line.
3.  Leave all yellow pixels (color 4), white pixels (color 0), and the original "source color" pixels unchanged.
4.  Output the modified grid.
