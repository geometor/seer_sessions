task_description: Combine information from two spatially corresponding sections of the input grid, separated by a specific marker line, based on the presence or absence of color.

grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      height: 9
      width: 4
      separator:
        color: 4 # yellow
        row_index: 4 # 5th row
      sections:
        - name: top_half
          rows: 0-3
          colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
        - name: bottom_half
          rows: 5-8
          colors: [0, 2] # white, red
  - output_grid:
      height: 4
      width: 4
      colors: [0, 3] # white, green

transformation:
  type: pixel-wise_combination
  input_sections: [top_half, bottom_half]
  output_grid_size: same as input_sections
  rule:
    for_each_pixel: (r, c) from 0 to height-1, 0 to width-1
    condition:
      - if: input[top_half][r, c] == 0 AND input[bottom_half][r + separator_row_index + 1, c] == 0
        then: output[r, c] = 0 # white
      - else: # if either input pixel is non-white (blue or red)
        then: output[r, c] = 3 # green
