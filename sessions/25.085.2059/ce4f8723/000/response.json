It's consistently divided into three sections by a horizontal line of yellow pixels (color 4).\n    *   A top section above the yellow line.\n    *   The yellow separator line itself.\n    *   A bottom section below the yellow line.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   The top section uses only blue (1) and white (0).\n    *   The separator line uses only yellow (4).\n    *   The bottom section uses only red (2) and white (0).\n    *   The output grid uses only green (3) and white (0).\n3.  **Dimensions:**\n    *   The input grids are always 9 rows high and 4 columns wide.\n    *   The yellow separator line is always at the 5th row (index 4).\n    *   The top and bottom sections are each 4 rows high.\n    *   The output grids are always 4 rows high and 4 columns wide, matching the dimensions of the top/bottom sections of the input.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a result of combining information from the top and bottom sections of the input grid. The yellow separator line is discarded. The spatial correspondence between the input sections and the output grid is preserved (i.e., the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output relates to the pixels at `(r, c)` in the top section and `(r + 5, c)` in the bottom section).\n5.  **Core Logic:** By comparing pixels at corresponding positions `(r, c)` in the top section and `(r + 5, c)` in the bottom section, a rule emerges:\n    *   If a pixel in the top section is blue (1) OR the corresponding pixel in the bottom section is red (2), the resulting pixel in the output grid at `(r, c)` is green (3).\n    *   If a pixel in the top section is white (0) AND the corresponding pixel in the bottom section is white (0), the resulting pixel in the output grid at `(r, c)` is white (0).\n    *   Essentially, the output pixel is green if there is *any* color (non-white) present at that position in either the top or bottom sections, otherwise it's white.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
