Task: Grid Transformation
Input_Components:
  - Grid: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - Background: Predominantly white (0) pixels.
  - Objects:
    - Type: Contiguous blocks of non-background pixels.
    - Color: Azure (8) in all examples.
    - Shape: Varies (single pixel, 2x2 square, 1x3 rectangle).
Output_Components:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Background: White (0) pixels, same as input where no object is placed.
  - Transformed_Objects:
    - Source: Derived from the azure objects in the input.
    - Color: Red (2).
    - Shape: Same as the corresponding input object.
    - Position: Shifted one row down compared to the input object's position.
Transformation:
  - Action_1: Identify all pixels with the color azure (8).
  - Action_2: Group connected azure pixels into objects.
  - Action_3: For each identified azure object:
    - Translate: Move the entire object one cell down vertically.
    - Recolor: Change the color of all pixels within the object from azure (8) to red (2).
  - Action_4: Preserve the background color (white, 0) in all other locations.
Relationships:
  - Input azure object maps directly to the output red object.
  - The shape of the object is preserved during the transformation.
  - The position changes predictably (down by 1 row).
  - The color changes predictably (azure to red).
