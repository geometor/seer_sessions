Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Sizes:** The input grids are 3x3, and the output grids are 9x9. This suggests a scaling or transformation related to a factor of 3.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input grids contain white (0), red (2), and green (3) pixels.
    *   Output grids contain only white (0) and green (3) pixels. The red pixel from the input does not appear in the output.
3.  **Key Objects/Features:**
    *   **Input:** A single red pixel and a configuration of green pixels. The background is white. The red pixel is at the same location (1, 1) in both examples. The green pixels form different patterns relative to the red pixel.
    *   **Output:** Two distinct 4x4 square blocks of green pixels on a white background.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   The red pixel seems to be ignored or replaced in the output.
    *   The white pixels in the input correspond to white areas in the output.
    *   The green pixels in the input dictate the placement of the two 4x4 green blocks in the output.
    *   Specifically, the top-leftmost coordinate occupied by any green pixel in the input grid appears to define the top-left coordinate of the first 4x4 green block in the output grid.
    *   The second 4x4 green block is positioned diagonally down and right relative to the first block, with its top-left corner exactly 4 rows down and 4 columns right from the first block's top-left corner.
    *   The size of the output grid (9x9) and the size of the green blocks (4x4) seem constant for this task.

```yaml
task_description: Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on the positions of green pixels.

definitions:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    pixels: [white, red, green]
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    pixels: [white, green]

transformation_rule:
  conditions:
    - if: input grid contains green pixels.
      then: proceed with block placement.
    - else: output grid is all white (0).
  steps:
    - identify: all green (3) pixels in the input_grid.
    - calculate: the minimum row index (min_r) and minimum column index (min_c) among the green pixels.
    - create: output_grid of size 9x9, initialized with white (0).
    - place_block_1:
        object: output_block
        color: green (3)
        size: 4x4

    - place_block_2:
        object: output_block
        color: green (3)
        size: 4x4
        top_left_corner: (min_r + 4, min_c + 4) # Offset by block size

input_elements_ignored:
  - red (2) pixel: Its value and position do not directly determine the output pattern, although its presence might signal the task type.
  - white (0) pixels: Serve as background.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize a 9x9 output grid with all white (0) pixels.
2.  Find all coordinates `(r, c)` in the 3x3 input grid where the pixel value is green (3).
3.  If no green pixels are found, return the all-white 9x9 grid.
4.  If green pixels are found, determine the minimum row index (`min_r`) and minimum column index (`min_c`) among these coordinates.
5.  Define the size `S = 4`.
6.  Calculate the top-left corner of the first green block: `(R1, C1) = (min_r, min_c)`.
7.  Calculate the top-left corner of the second green block: `(R2, C2) = (min_r + S, min_c + S)`.
8.  Fill a 4x4 area in the output grid with green (3) pixels, starting from `(R1, C1)` (i.e., rows `R1` to `R1+S-1`, columns `C1` to `C1+S-1`).
9.  Fill a 4x4 area in the output grid with green (3) pixels, starting from `(R2, C2)` (i.e., rows `R2` to `R2+S-1`, columns `C2` to `C2+S-1`).
10. Return the resulting 9x9 output grid.
