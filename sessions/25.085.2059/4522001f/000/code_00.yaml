task_description: Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid based on the positions of green pixels.

definitions:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    pixels: [white, red, green]
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    pixels: [white, green]
  green_pixel_group:
    description: The set of all green (3) pixels in the input grid.
  output_block:
    description: A square block of green (3) pixels in the output grid.
    size: 4x4
    count: 2

transformation_rule:
  conditions:
    - if: input grid contains green pixels.
      then: proceed with block placement.
    - else: output grid is all white (0).
  steps:
    - identify: all green (3) pixels in the input_grid.
    - calculate: the minimum row index (min_r) and minimum column index (min_c) among the green pixels.
    - create: output_grid of size 9x9, initialized with white (0).
    - place_block_1:
        object: output_block
        color: green (3)
        size: 4x4
        top_left_corner: (min_r, min_c)
    - place_block_2:
        object: output_block
        color: green (3)
        size: 4x4
        top_left_corner: (min_r + 4, min_c + 4) # Offset by block size

input_elements_ignored:
  - red (2) pixel: Its value and position do not directly determine the output pattern, although its presence might signal the task type.
  - white (0) pixels: Serve as background.
