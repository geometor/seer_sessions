This suggests a scaling or transformation related to a factor of 3.\n2.  **Colors:**\n    *   Input grids contain white (0), red (2), and green (3) pixels.\n    *   Output grids contain only white (0) and green (3) pixels. The red pixel from the input does not appear in the output.\n3.  **Key Objects/Features:**\n    *   **Input:** A single red pixel and a configuration of green pixels. The background is white. The red pixel is at the same location (1, 1) in both examples. The green pixels form different patterns relative to the red pixel.\n    *   **Output:** Two distinct 4x4 square blocks of green pixels on a white background.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   The red pixel seems to be ignored or replaced in the output.\n    *   The white pixels in the input correspond to white areas in the output.\n    *   The green pixels in the input dictate the placement of the two 4x4 green blocks in the output.\n    *   Specifically, the top-leftmost coordinate occupied by any green pixel in the input grid appears to define the top-left coordinate of the first 4x4 green block in the output grid.\n    *   The second 4x4 green block is positioned diagonally down and right relative to the first block, with its top-left corner exactly 4 rows down and 4 columns right from the first block's top-left corner.\n    *   The size of the output grid (9x9) and the size of the green blocks (4x4) seem constant for this task.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
