## Perception

1.  **Input:** The input is always a small 2x2 grid of pixels, each having a specific color.
2.  **Output:** The output is always a larger 6x6 grid of pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be constructed by repeating the input grid pattern, but with some modification. Specifically, the output grid is a 3x3 tiling of 2x2 blocks.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:**
    *   The output grid's dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid's dimensions (2x3=6 height, 2x3=6 width).
    *   The 2x2 blocks used for tiling are derived from the input grid.
    *   Observing the arrangement:
        *   The blocks in the 1st and 3rd rows of the 3x3 tiling are identical to the original 2x2 input grid.
        *   The blocks in the 2nd row of the 3x3 tiling are a horizontally flipped version of the original 2x2 input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Tile a 3x3 grid using the input pattern and its horizontal flip.

Input:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 2x2
  - content: 4 distinct pixels (colors) arranged in a square.

Output:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: 6x6 (always 3x height and 3x width of input)
  - content: constructed from tiling 2x2 blocks.

Relationships:
  - output_height = input_height * 3
  - output_width = input_width * 3
  - The output grid is composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 2x2 blocks.

Derived Patterns:
  - block_original: The 2x2 input grid itself.
  - block_flipped: The 2x2 input grid flipped horizontally.
    - Example 1 Input: [[7, 9], [4, 3]] -> Flipped: [[9, 7], [3, 4]]
    - Example 2 Input: [[8, 6], [6, 4]] -> Flipped: [[6, 8], [4, 6]]

Tiling Rule:
  - The 3x3 grid of blocks uses the following pattern:
    ```

    block_original, block_original, block_original
    block_flipped,  block_flipped,  block_flipped
    block_original, block_original, block_original
    
```
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input 2x2 grid. Let's call it `input_block`.
2.  Create a second 2x2 grid by flipping `input_block` horizontally. Let's call it `flipped_block`.
3.  Determine the output grid dimensions: height = input height * 3, width = input width * 3 (which will be 6x6).
4.  Create an empty output grid of the calculated dimensions.
5.  Tile the output grid using a 3x3 arrangement of 2x2 blocks:
    *   Place `input_block` at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) in the 3x3 block grid (corresponding to top-left, top-middle, top-right 2x2 areas in the output grid).
    *   Place `flipped_block` at positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) in the 3x3 block grid (corresponding to middle-left, middle-middle, middle-right 2x2 areas in the output grid).
    *   Place `input_block` at positions (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) in the 3x3 block grid (corresponding to bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right 2x2 areas in the output grid).
6.  Return the constructed 6x6 output grid.
