The grid dimensions vary across examples.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors in the input grids are green (3) and white (0). The output grids introduce azure (8) while retaining green (3) and white (0).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation involves changing *some* green (3) pixels to azure (8) pixels. White (0) pixels always remain white (0). Some green (3) pixels also remain green (3).\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The decision to change a green pixel seems dependent on its immediate surroundings. Looking at the examples, green pixels that are part of a larger group or cluster (connected orthogonally) tend to change to azure, while isolated green pixels or those only touching other green pixels diagonally often remain green.\n5.  **Rule Identification:** By comparing input and output green pixels:\n    *   A green pixel changes to azure if it has at least one **orthogonally adjacent** neighbor that is also green.\n    *   A green pixel remains green if it has **no orthogonally adjacent** green neighbors.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
