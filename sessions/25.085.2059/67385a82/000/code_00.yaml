task_description: Change the color of certain green pixels based on their neighbors.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - Contains pixels with colors.
      - Colors present: green(3), white(0) in input; green(3), white(0), azure(8) in output.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
      - neighbors: orthogonal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal.
objects:
  - name: green_pixel
    is_a: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 3
  - name: azure_pixel
    is_a: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 8
  - name: white_pixel
    is_a: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    applies_to: [pixel, pixel]
    properties:
      - orthogonal
      - diagonal
actions:
  - name: change_color
    input: green_pixel
    output: azure_pixel
    condition: The input green_pixel has at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor that is also a green_pixel.
  - name: keep_color
    input: pixel
    output: pixel (same color)
    condition: Applies to white_pixels and green_pixels that do not meet the change_color condition.
