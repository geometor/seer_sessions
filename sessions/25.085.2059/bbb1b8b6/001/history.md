*   **Perception:**
    *   All input grids share a common structure: a vertical line of gray pixels (color 5) separating the grid into two equally sized halves, a left half and a right half.
    *   The left half typically contains patterns made of blue pixels (color 1) and white pixels (color 0).
    *   The right half contains patterns made of various other colors (magenta, red, green, yellow, orange, blue) and white pixels (color 0).
    *   The output grid always has the same dimensions as the *left half* of the input grid.
    *   The output grid seems to be derived primarily from the left half of the input grid.
    *   Specifically, the non-white pixels from the left half appear in the same positions in the output grid.
    *   The white pixels (color 0) in the left half of the input grid seem to be replaced in the output grid by the pixels found at the corresponding positions in the *right half* of the input grid.
    *   The gray separator line itself is discarded in the output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: OverlayRightOntoLeftWhitePixels
    
    elements:
      - object: separator_line
        description: A single vertical column of gray pixels (color 5).
        properties:
          - color: gray (5)
          - orientation: vertical
        role: Divides the input grid into two equal halves.
    
      - object: left_grid
        description: The portion of the input grid to the left of the separator_line.
        properties:
          - contains: patterns, typically blue (1) and white (0).
          - size: H x W/2 (where W is input width minus 1).
        role: Base template for the output grid.
    
      - object: right_grid
        description: The portion of the input grid to the right of the separator_line.
        properties:
          - contains: various colored patterns and white (0).
          - size: H x W/2 (where W is input width minus 1).
        role: Source of replacement colors for white pixels in the left_grid.
    
      - object: output_grid
        description: The final transformed grid.
        properties:
          - size: Same dimensions as left_grid.
    
    relationships:
      - type: positional_mapping
        description: Pixels in the left_grid and right_grid at the same row (y) and column (x, relative to the start of their respective halves) correspond to each other.
    
    transformation:
      - action: identify_separator
        input: input_grid
        output: column_index_of_separator
    
      - action: split_grid
        input: input_grid, column_index_of_separator
        output: left_grid, right_grid
    
      - action: construct_output
        description: Create the output grid based on left_grid and right_grid.
        steps:
          - Initialize output_grid as a copy of left_grid.
          - Iterate through each pixel (y, x) in the left_grid.
          - condition: If the pixel at (y, x) in left_grid is white (0).
          - consequence: Replace the pixel at (y, x) in output_grid with the pixel at (y, x) in the right_grid.
          - otherwise: Keep the original pixel from left_grid in output_grid.
    
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the vertical column composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5); this is the separator line.
    2.  Determine the column index of the separator line.
    3.  Define the 'left grid' as the portion of the input grid to the left of the separator line.
    4.  Define the 'right grid' as the portion of the input grid to the right of the separator line.
    5.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the 'left grid'.
    6.  Iterate through each pixel position (row `r`, column `c`) within the dimensions of the 'left grid'.
    7.  Get the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the 'left grid'.
    8.  If the color from the 'left grid' is white (0):
        a.  Get the color of the pixel at the corresponding position (`r`, `c`) in the 'right grid'.
        b.  Set the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to this color from the 'right grid'.
    9.  Else (if the color from the 'left grid' is not white):
        a.  Set the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to the color from the 'left grid'.
    10. Return the completed output grid.
