"""
The transformation rule involves splitting the input grid based on a vertical gray separator line and conditionally merging the two halves.

1.  Identify the vertical column composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5). This column acts as a separator.
2.  Divide the input grid into two subgrids: the 'left grid' (columns to the left of the separator) and the 'right grid' (columns to the right of the separator).
3.  Examine the 'right grid' to determine if it contains any solid 2x2 square composed of a single non-white color (any color other than 0).
4.  Decision based on the check in step 3:
    a. If the 'right grid' *does* contain at least one such 2x2 solid non-white square, the output grid is an exact copy of the 'left grid'.
    b. If the 'right grid' *does not* contain any such 2x2 solid non-white square, the output grid is constructed as follows:
        i.  Start with a copy of the 'left grid'.
        ii. Iterate through each pixel position (r, c) within the dimensions of the 'left grid'.
        iii. If the pixel at `left_grid[r, c]` is white (color 0), replace the corresponding pixel in the output grid at `output_grid[r, c]` with the color of the pixel at the same position in the 'right grid' (`right_grid[r, c]`).
        iv. If the pixel at `left_grid[r, c]` is not white, keep its original color in the output grid.
5.  The final output grid has the same dimensions as the 'left grid'.
