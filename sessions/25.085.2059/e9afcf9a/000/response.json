The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows high, same width as input). The output grid is filled with the two colors found in the input grid, arranged in an alternating pattern.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The first row of the output grid alternates between the color of the first input row and the color of the second input row, starting with the color of the first input row.\n- The second row of the output grid also alternates between the two input colors, but starts with the color of the second input row.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
