## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

**Perception**

The input consists of a grid with two rows. Each row is composed of a single, solid color. The two rows have different colors. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows high, same width as input). The output grid is filled with the two colors found in the input grid, arranged in an alternating pattern.

Specifically:
- The first row of the output grid alternates between the color of the first input row and the color of the second input row, starting with the color of the first input row.
- The second row of the output grid also alternates between the two input colors, but starts with the color of the second input row.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: pattern_generation
grid_properties:
  - dimensions:
      input: 2 rows, W columns (W=6 in examples)
      output: 2 rows, W columns (same as input)
  - background_color: None (implicitly white if dimensions change, but not relevant here)
objects:
  - type: row
    count: 2 (in input)
    properties:
      - index: 0 (top row)
      - index: 1 (bottom row)
      - color: uniform within the row, different between rows
      - width: W (same for both rows)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two input rows are vertically adjacent.
actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: color1 (from row 0), color2 (from row 1)
  - name: create_output_grid
    inputs: dimensions (from input)
    outputs: empty_output_grid
  - name: fill_output_row_0
    inputs: color1, color2, width W
    outputs: filled_row_0
    rule: alternate color1 and color2 starting with color1 for columns 0 to W-1
  - name: fill_output_row_1
    inputs: color1, color2, width W
    outputs: filled_row_1
    rule: alternate color2 and color1 starting with color2 for columns 0 to W-1
pattern:
  - type: alternation/interleaving
    scope: rows and columns
    details:
      - Row 0: Starts with Color1, alternates Color1, Color2, Color1, Color2...
      - Row 1: Starts with Color2, alternates Color2, Color1, Color2, Color1...

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the color of the first row in the input grid (let's call it `Color1`).
2.  Identify the color of the second row in the input grid (let's call it `Color2`).
3.  Determine the width (`W`) of the input grid.
4.  Create a new output grid with 2 rows and `W` columns.
5.  For each column index `c` from 0 to `W-1`:
    a.  If `c` is an even number (0, 2, 4,...), set the pixel at `(row=0, column=c)` in the output grid to `Color1` and the pixel at `(row=1, column=c)` to `Color2`.
    b.  If `c` is an odd number (1, 3, 5,...), set the pixel at `(row=0, column=c)` in the output grid to `Color2` and the pixel at `(row=1, column=c)` to `Color1`.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
