Okay, the metrics confirm the observations. Ready to structure the response.## General Assessment

The provided code implemented a transformation rule based on the Manhattan distance from a single white anchor pixel. The rule stated that pixels at an even distance become white (0), and pixels at an odd distance retain their original color. This rule correctly transformed Example 2 but failed on Examples 1 and 3.

The errors in Examples 1 and 3 indicate that the initial rule was too simplistic. Comparing the `Expected Output` with the `Transformed Output` reveals that the code incorrectly changed some pixels that should have retained their original color, specifically those at an even distance but located on the same row or column as the anchor pixel.

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to account for this exception. The revised rule needs to differentiate between pixels at even distances based on whether they share a row or column with the anchor pixel.

## Metrics

Based on the provided examples and the code execution results:

**Example 1:**
- Dimensions: 5x5
- Anchor Pixel (white, 0): Coordinates (2, 2)
- Input Colors: white (0), red (2)
- Output Colors: white (0), red (2)
- Non-anchor Input Color: red (2)
- Code Result: Failed (4 pixels incorrect). The code changed pixels at (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2) from red (2) to white (0), whereas the expected output kept them red (2). These pixels are all at an even distance (d=2) but lie on the same row or column as the anchor.

**Example 2:**
- Dimensions: 3x3
- Anchor Pixel (white, 0): Coordinates (1, 1)
- Input Colors: white (0), blue (1)
- Output Colors: white (0), blue (1)
- Non-anchor Input Color: blue (1)
- Code Result: Success. All pixels at even distance (d=2) are *not* on the same row or column as the anchor, so changing them to white (0) was correct according to the expected output.

**Example 3:**
- Dimensions: 7x7
- Anchor Pixel (white, 0): Coordinates (3, 3)
- Input Colors: white (0), green (3)
- Output Colors: white (0), green (3)
- Non-anchor Input Color: green (3)
- Code Result: Failed (12 pixels incorrect). Similar to Example 1, the code changed pixels at even distances (d=2, d=4, d=6) to white (0), regardless of their row/column alignment with the anchor. The expected output keeps pixels green (3) if they are at an even distance *but* on the same row or column as the anchor.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Transform an input grid based on the Manhattan distance and relative position to a single white anchor pixel.
grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - Input grids contain exactly one white pixel (color 0), acting as an anchor.
  - All other pixels in the input grid have the same, non-white color (e.g., red, blue, green).
  - Output grids contain only white (0) and the non-white color from the input.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - coordinates: (row, column)
      - manhattan_distance_from_anchor: integer >= 0
      - is_anchor: boolean (true if color is 0)
      - shares_row_or_col_with_anchor: boolean
transformation_rule_elements:
  - anchor_pixel: The single pixel with color 0 in the input grid. Coordinates (r0, c0).
  - target_pixel: Any pixel in the grid at coordinates (r, c) with original color C.
  - distance: Manhattan distance `d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)`.
  - condition_distance_parity: Check if `d` is even or odd.
  - condition_position: Check if `r == r0` or `c == c0`.
actions:
  - find: Locate the anchor pixel (r0, c0).
  - iterate: Process each pixel (r, c) in the input grid.
  - calculate: Compute the Manhattan distance `d`.
  - conditional_change: Modify the color of the pixel based on distance and position relative to the anchor.
    - Keep original color if:
      - `d == 0` (anchor pixel)
      - `d` is odd
      - `d` is even AND (`r == r0` OR `c == c0`)
    - Change color to white (0) if:
      - `d` is even AND `d > 0` AND (`r != r0` AND `c != c0`)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the coordinates (`r0`, `c0`) of the single white pixel (color 0) in the input grid. This is the "anchor pixel".
2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same colors as the input grid.
3.  For each pixel at coordinates (`r`, `c`) in the input grid:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d` between this pixel (`r`, `c`) and the anchor pixel (`r0`, `c0`): `d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)`.
    b.  Check if the distance `d` is even and greater than 0.
    c.  Check if the pixel is *not* on the same row as the anchor (`r != r0`) and *not* on the same column as the anchor (`c != c0`).
    d.  If both conditions (3b and 3c) are true (i.e., the distance `d` is even and positive, *and* the pixel is not on the same row or column as the anchor), change the color of the corresponding pixel (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to white (0).
    e.  Otherwise (if `d` is 0, `d` is odd, or `d` is even but the pixel is on the same row or column as the anchor), the pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
