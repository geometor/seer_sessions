            "text": "Okay, the metrics confirm the observations. Ready to structure the response.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code implemented a transformation rule based on the Manhattan distance from a single white anchor pixel. The rule stated that pixels at an even distance become white (0), and pixels at an odd distance retain their original color. This rule correctly transformed Example 2 but failed on Examples 1 and 3.\n\nThe errors in Examples 1 and 3 indicate that the initial rule was too simplistic. Comparing the `Expected Output` with the `Transformed Output` reveals that the code incorrectly changed some pixels that should have retained their original color, specifically those at an even distance but located on the same row or column as the anchor pixel.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule to account for this exception. The revised rule needs to differentiate between pixels at even distances based on whether they share a row or column with the anchor pixel.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided examples and the code execution results:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Dimensions: 5x5\n- Anchor Pixel (white, 0): Coordinates (2, 2)\n- Input Colors: white (0), red (2)\n- Output Colors: white (0), red (2)\n- Non-anchor Input Color: red (2)\n- Code Result: Failed (4 pixels incorrect). The code changed pixels at (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2) from red (2) to white (0), whereas the expected output kept them red (2). These pixels are all at an even distance (d=2) but lie on the same row or column as the anchor.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Dimensions: 3x3\n- Anchor Pixel (white, 0): Coordinates (1, 1)\n- Input Colors: white (0), blue (1)\n- Output Colors: white (0), blue (1)\n- Non-anchor Input Color: blue (1)\n- Code Result: Success. All pixels at even distance (d=2) are *not* on the same row or column as the anchor, so changing them to white (0) was correct according to the expected output.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Dimensions: 7x7\n- Anchor Pixel (white, 0): Coordinates (3, 3)\n- Input Colors: white (0), green (3)\n- Output Colors: white (0), green (3)\n- Non-anchor Input Color: green (3)\n- Code Result: Failed (12 pixels incorrect). Similar to Example 1, the code changed pixels at even distances (d=2, d=4, d=6) to white (0), regardless of their row/column alignment with the anchor. The expected output keeps pixels green (3) if they are at an even distance *but* on the same row or column as the anchor.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
