"""
Transforms an input grid based on the Manhattan distance and relative position to a single white anchor pixel (color 0).

1.  Identify the coordinates (`r0`, `c0`) of the single white pixel (color 0) in the input grid. This is the "anchor pixel".
2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same colors as the input grid.
3.  For each pixel at coordinates (`r`, `c`) in the input grid:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d` between this pixel (`r`, `c`) and the anchor pixel (`r0`, `c0`): `d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)`.
    b.  Check if the distance `d` is even and greater than 0.
    c.  Check if the pixel is *not* on the same row as the anchor (`r != r0`) and *not* on the same column as the anchor (`c != c0`).
    d.  If both conditions (3b and 3c) are true (i.e., the distance `d` is even and positive, *and* the pixel is not on the same row or column as the anchor), change the color of the corresponding pixel (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to white (0).
    e.  Otherwise (if `d` is 0, `d` is odd, or `d` is even but the pixel is on the same row or column as the anchor), the pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code successfully solved the first two examples but failed on the third. The failure analysis revealed that the original rule, based on even Manhattan distance and excluding the anchor's row/column, was incorrect. The transformed output for Example 3 using the previous code differed significantly from the expected output, particularly for pixels where the Manhattan distance was even, but the relative row and column differences were unequal. A new hypothesis is needed that correctly identifies which pixels should turn white.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Compare the input, expected output, and the failed transformed output for Example 3 to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the previous rule failed.
2.  **Identify Correct Pattern:** Re-examine all three examples, focusing on the relationship between the anchor pixel's position and the positions of pixels that change to white in the expected outputs.
3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule based on the relative coordinates (row and column differences) with respect to the anchor pixel.
4.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the new hypothesis against all training examples, potentially using code execution to confirm calculations.
5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding of the transformation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - task_type: transformation
  - grid_properties:
      - dimensions: variable square grids (3x3, 5x5, 7x7 in examples)
      - colors: Multiple colors possible (white, blue, red, green in examples).
      - background_color: A single dominant color (blue, red, or green in examples) fills most of the grid initially.
  - objects:
      - type: anchor_pixel
        count: 1 per input grid
        color: white (0)
        property: Always present.
        location: Variable, appears central in examples.
        role: Defines the center/origin for the transformation pattern.
      - type: other_pixels
        color: Any color other than white (0). Initially, mostly one background color.
        role: Pixels subject to potential color change based on position relative to the anchor.
  - transformation_rule: positional_relative_to_anchor
  - geometry: The transformation creates a pattern based on diagonals centered on the anchor pixel.
  - conditions_for_change:
      - identify the anchor pixel coordinates (r0, c0).
      - for each pixel (r, c):
          - calculate row difference relative to anchor: dr = r - r0
          - calculate column difference relative to anchor: dc = c - c0
          - evaluate condition: Is the absolute row difference equal to the absolute column difference? `abs(dr) == abs(dc)`
  - action_if_condition_met:
      - change pixel color at (r, c) to white (0).
  - action_if_condition_not_met:
      - pixel at (r, c) retains its original color from the input grid.
  - output_grid:
      - dimensions: same as input grid.
      - content: Contains pixels turned white along the diagonals passing through the original anchor location, with other pixels retaining their input color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the coordinates (`anchor_r`, `anchor_c`) of the single white pixel (color 0) in the input grid. This pixel serves as the anchor.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel position (`r`, `c`) in the grid.
4.  For the current pixel position (`r`, `c`), calculate its row difference (`dr`) and column difference (`dc`) relative to the anchor pixel:
    `dr = r - anchor_r`
    `dc = c - anchor_c`
5.  Check if the absolute value of the row difference is equal to the absolute value of the column difference: `abs(dr) == abs(dc)`. This condition identifies pixels lying on the main diagonals passing through the anchor pixel.
6.  If the condition `abs(dr) == abs(dc)` is true, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to white (0).
7.  If the condition `abs(dr) == abs(dc)` is false, copy the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) from the *input* grid to the corresponding position in the *output* grid.
8.  After iterating through all pixel positions, return the completed output grid.
