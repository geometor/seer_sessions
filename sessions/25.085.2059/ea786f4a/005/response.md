"""
Transforms an input grid by changing the color of pixels lying on the diagonals passing through a single white anchor pixel (color 0) to white.

1.  Identify the coordinates (`anchor_r`, `anchor_c`) of the single white pixel (color 0) in the input grid. This pixel serves as the anchor.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same colors as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel position (`r`, `c`) in the grid.
4.  For the current pixel position (`r`, `c`), calculate its row difference (`dr`) and column difference (`dc`) relative to the anchor pixel: `dr = r - anchor_r`, `dc = c - anchor_c`.
5.  Check if the absolute value of the row difference is equal to the absolute value of the column difference: `abs(dr) == abs(dc)`. This condition identifies pixels lying on the main diagonals passing through the anchor pixel.
6.  If the condition `abs(dr) == abs(dc)` is true, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to white (0).
7.  If the condition is false, the pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid (achieved by initializing the output grid as a copy).
8.  After iterating through all pixel positions, return the completed output grid.
