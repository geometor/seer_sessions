Identify the coordinates (`anchor_r`, `anchor_c`) of the single white pixel (color 0) in the input grid. This pixel serves as the anchor.\n2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same colors as the input grid.\n3.  Iterate through each pixel position (`r`, `c`) in the grid.\n4.  For the current pixel position (`r`, `c`), calculate its row difference (`dr`) and column difference (`dc`) relative to the anchor pixel: `dr = r - anchor_r`, `dc = c - anchor_c`.\n5.  Check if the absolute value of the row difference is equal to the absolute value of the column difference: `abs(dr) == abs(dc)`. This condition identifies pixels lying on the main diagonals passing through the anchor pixel.\n6.  If the condition `abs(dr) == abs(dc)` is true, set the color of the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the *output* grid to white (0).\n7.  If the condition is false, the pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid (achieved by initializing the output grid as a copy).\n8.
