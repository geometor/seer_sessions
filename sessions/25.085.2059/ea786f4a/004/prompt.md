"""
Transforms an input grid based on the Manhattan distance and relative position to a single white anchor pixel (color 0).

1.  Identify the coordinates (`r0`, `c0`) of the single white pixel (color 0) in the input grid. This is the "anchor pixel".
2.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same colors as the input grid.
3.  For each pixel at coordinates (`r`, `c`) in the input grid:
    a.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d` between this pixel (`r`, `c`) and the anchor pixel (`r0`, `c0`): `d = abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)`.
    b.  Check if the distance `d` is even and greater than 0.
    c.  Check if the pixel is *not* on the same row as the anchor (`r != r0`) and *not* on the same column as the anchor (`c != c0`).
    d.  If both conditions (3b and 3c) are true (i.e., the distance `d` is even and positive, *and* the pixel is not on the same row or column as the anchor), change the color of the corresponding pixel (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to white (0).
    e.  Otherwise (if `d` is 0, `d` is odd, or `d` is even but the pixel is on the same row or column as the anchor), the pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
