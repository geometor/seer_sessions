            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code successfully solved the first two examples but failed on the third. The failure analysis revealed that the original rule, based on even Manhattan distance and excluding the anchor's row/column, was incorrect. The transformed output for Example 3 using the previous code differed significantly from the expected output, particularly for pixels where the Manhattan distance was even, but the relative row and column differences were unequal. A new hypothesis is needed that correctly identifies which pixels should turn white.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Compare the input, expected output, and the failed transformed output for Example 3 to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the previous rule failed.\n2.  **Identify Correct Pattern:** Re-examine all three examples, focusing on the relationship between the anchor pixel's position and the positions of pixels that change to white in the expected outputs.\n3.  **Formulate New Hypothesis:** Develop a revised rule based on the relative coordinates (row and column differences) with respect to the anchor pixel.\n4.  **Verify Hypothesis:** Test the new hypothesis against all training examples, potentially using code execution to confirm calculations.\n5.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and the natural language program to reflect the corrected understanding of the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n"
