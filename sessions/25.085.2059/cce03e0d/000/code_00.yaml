facts:
  - grid_dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 9x9 (3 times input dimensions)
  - output_structure: The 9x9 output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of 'slots'.
  - slot_dimensions: Each slot is 3x3, matching the input grid size.
  - background_color: white (0). This is the initial color of the output grid and fills any slots not overwritten.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        properties: [source_pattern, 3x3 size, contains pixels with colors 0-9]
      - name: output_grid
        type: grid
        properties: [target_canvas, 9x9 size, composition derived from input]
      - name: pixel
        type: cell
        properties: [color_value (0-9), position (row, column)]
      - name: slot
        type: conceptual_region
        properties: [3x3 area in output_grid, corresponds 1:1 with an input pixel position]
  - relationships:
      - input_pixel_to_output_slot: The pixel at input_grid[r][c] corresponds to the slot at the top-left corner output_grid[r*3][c*3].
      - trigger_condition: The color value of input_grid[r][c] determines the content of the corresponding output slot.
  - transformation_rule:
      - rule: Selective replication of the input grid onto the output grid.
      - condition: Replication into slot (r, c) occurs if input_grid[r][c] > 1.
      - action: If the condition is true, the entire input_grid is copied into the output_grid, with its top-left corner aligned with the slot's top-left corner (r*3, c*3).
