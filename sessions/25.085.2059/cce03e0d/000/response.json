This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.\n2.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by selectively placing copies of the entire input grid onto the larger 9x9 canvas. The 9x9 grid can be visualized as a 3x3 grid of \"slots,\" where each slot is the same size as the input grid (3x3).\n3.  **Placement Rule:** The content of the input grid itself dictates where copies are placed in the output grid. By comparing the input grid's pixel values at coordinates `(r, c)` with the placement of copies in the output slots `(r, c)`, a pattern emerges.\n4.  **Trigger Condition:** A copy of the input grid seems to be placed in the output slot `(r, c)` *if and only if* the pixel value in the input grid at `(r, c)` is greater than 1 (i.e., it is red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, or maroon). White (0) and blue (1) pixels in the input do *not* trigger a copy in their corresponding slots.\n5.  **Background:** Slots in the output grid that do not receive a copy of the input grid remain filled with the background color, which is white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If `v` is 0 (white) or 1 (blue), do nothing for this corresponding position `(r, c)` in the output grid (leaving it as the initial white background).\n7.
