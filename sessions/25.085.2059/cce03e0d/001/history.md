Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.
2.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by selectively placing copies of the entire input grid onto the larger 9x9 canvas. The 9x9 grid can be visualized as a 3x3 grid of "slots," where each slot is the same size as the input grid (3x3).
3.  **Placement Rule:** The content of the input grid itself dictates where copies are placed in the output grid. By comparing the input grid's pixel values at coordinates `(r, c)` with the placement of copies in the output slots `(r, c)`, a pattern emerges.
4.  **Trigger Condition:** A copy of the input grid seems to be placed in the output slot `(r, c)` *if and only if* the pixel value in the input grid at `(r, c)` is greater than 1 (i.e., it is red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, or maroon). White (0) and blue (1) pixels in the input do *not* trigger a copy in their corresponding slots.
5.  **Background:** Slots in the output grid that do not receive a copy of the input grid remain filled with the background color, which is white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 9x9 (3 times input dimensions)
  - output_structure: The 9x9 output grid can be viewed as a 3x3 grid of 'slots'.
  - slot_dimensions: Each slot is 3x3, matching the input grid size.
  - background_color: white (0). This is the initial color of the output grid and fills any slots not overwritten.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        properties: [source_pattern, 3x3 size, contains pixels with colors 0-9]
      - name: output_grid
        type: grid
        properties: [target_canvas, 9x9 size, composition derived from input]
      - name: pixel
        type: cell
        properties: [color_value (0-9), position (row, column)]
      - name: slot
        type: conceptual_region
        properties: [3x3 area in output_grid, corresponds 1:1 with an input pixel position]
  - relationships:
      - input_pixel_to_output_slot: The pixel at input_grid[r][c] corresponds to the slot at the top-left corner output_grid[r*3][c*3].
      - trigger_condition: The color value of input_grid[r][c] determines the content of the corresponding output slot.
  - transformation_rule:
      - rule: Selective replication of the input grid onto the output grid.
      - condition: Replication into slot (r, c) occurs if input_grid[r][c] > 1.
      - action: If the condition is true, the entire input_grid is copied into the output_grid, with its top-left corner aligned with the slot's top-left corner (r*3, c*3).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize a new output grid with dimensions 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid, filling it entirely with white pixels (color 0).
2.  Examine each pixel in the input grid, identified by its row `r` and column `c`.
3.  Retrieve the color value `v` of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
4.  Check if the color value `v` is greater than 1.
5.  If `v` is greater than 1, then copy the *entire* original input grid onto the output grid. The top-left corner of this copied grid should be placed at the output grid coordinates `(r * 3, c * 3)`.
6.  If `v` is 0 (white) or 1 (blue), do nothing for this corresponding position `(r, c)` in the output grid (leaving it as the initial white background).
7.  After checking all pixels in the input grid, the resulting output grid is the final result.
