Input_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - height: H
    - width: W
    - pixels: each has a color (integer 0-9) and a position (row, column)

Output_Grid:
  type: 2D array of integers (pixels)
  properties:
    - height: H (same as Input_Grid)
    - width: W (same as Input_Grid)
    - pixels: each has a color (integer 0-9) and a position (row, column)

Transformation:
  type: Geometric Rotation
  action: Rotate the Input_Grid by 180 degrees around its center point.
  details:
    - A pixel at position (r, c) in the Input_Grid moves to position (H - 1 - r, W - 1 - c) in the Output_Grid.
    - The color of the pixel remains unchanged during the move.
