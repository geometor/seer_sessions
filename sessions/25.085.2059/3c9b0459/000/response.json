Each example shows an input grid and a corresponding output grid.\n- The dimensions (height and width) of the input grid are the same as the output grid in all examples.\n- The set of colors (pixel values) present in the input grid is the same as the set of colors in the output grid.\n- The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the pixels within the grid.\n- Comparing the input and output grids across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the output grid is the input grid rotated by 180 degrees.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
