"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a diagonal pattern determined by the unique non-white colors present in the input.

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all unique non-white pixel values (colors).
2.  Create a sorted list `C` containing these unique colors. Ensure there are exactly three unique colors.
3.  Define the color sequence `S` based on the specific content of the sorted list `C`:
    *   If `C` is `[1, 2, 4]`, set `S` to `[2, 4, 1]`.
    *   If `C` is `[2, 3, 8]`, set `S` to `[2, 8, 3]`.
    *   If `C` is `[3, 4, 8]`, set `S` to `[4, 8, 3]`.
    *   (Assumption: These three cases cover all possibilities for this task).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the output grid, where `r` is the row index (from 0 to height-1) and `c` is the column index (from 0 to width-1).
6.  Calculate the index `idx = (r + c) % 3`.
7.  Set the color of the output grid cell `(r, c)` to the color `S[idx]`.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
