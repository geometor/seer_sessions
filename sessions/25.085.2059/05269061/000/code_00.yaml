Input:
  type: grid
  content: mostly white pixels (0), some non-white pixels (1-9)
  properties:
    - contains_white_pixels: true
    - contains_non_white_pixels: true
    - non_white_colors_set: the set of unique non-white pixel values present in the grid
    - num_unique_non_white_colors: 3 (in all examples)

Output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: same as input grid
  content: entirely non-white pixels, forming a repeating pattern
  properties:
    - contains_white_pixels: false
    - pattern: diagonal, repeating
    - pattern_colors: a sequence S of 3 colors, derived from input's non_white_colors_set
    - pattern_rule: color at (r, c) is S[(r + c) % 3]

Transformation:
  - Step 1: Identify the unique non-white colors from the input grid.
  - Step 2: Sort these unique colors numerically into a list C.
  - Step 3: Determine the specific permutation to apply to C to get the output sequence S, based on the contents of C:
      - If C = [1, 2, 4], apply left cycle: S = [2, 4, 1].
      - If C = [2, 3, 8], apply swap last two: S = [2, 8, 3].
      - If C = [3, 4, 8], apply left cycle: S = [4, 8, 3].
  - Step 4: Generate the output grid by filling each cell (r, c) with the color S[(r + c) % 3].

Relationships:
  - Output grid dimensions match input grid dimensions.
  - Colors used in the output pattern are exactly the unique non-white colors from the input.
  - The specific arrangement of the output pattern depends only on the set of unique non-white input colors and the grid coordinates, not the positions of the input colors.
