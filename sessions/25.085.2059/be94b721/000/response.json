            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input:** Each input is a grid of pixels with various colors (represented by integers 0-9). The background is consistently white (0). Within the grid, there are distinct shapes or \"objects\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.\n2.  **Output:** Each output is also a grid, generally smaller than the input. It contains a single object from the input grid, placed on a white background. The object in the output retains its original color and shape.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core task seems to involve identifying all the distinct colored objects in the input, selecting one specific object based on some criteria, and then extracting that object into a new, tightly cropped grid.\n4.  **Object Definition:** Objects appear to be groups of connected pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity seems to include diagonals (8-way connectivity).\n5.  **Selection Criteria:** Comparing the input objects to the output object across the examples, the object that appears in the output is consistently the one with the largest area (most pixels).\n6.  **Extraction/Cropping:** The output grid's dimensions correspond exactly to the bounding box of the selected object in the input grid. The object is placed within this output grid, maintaining its internal structure, and the rest of the output grid is filled with the background color (white).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-way connectivity).\n  - object_size: The total number of pixels belonging to an object.\n  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object. Defined by min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col.\n  - grid_dimensions: Height (number of rows) and Width (number of columns).\n\ninput_features:\n  - Contains multiple distinct objects.\n  - Objects have varying colors, shapes, and sizes.\n  - Objects are placed on a white background.\n\noutput_features:\n  - Contains a single object from the input.\n  - The object is the one with the largest size (pixel count) from the input.\n  - The grid dimensions match the bounding box dimensions of the selected object.\n  - The object retains its original color and shape relative to its bounding box.\n  - The background is white.\n\nrelationships:\n  - Input objects are compared based on their size.\n  - The output grid is derived from the bounding box of the largest input object.\n  - The content of the output grid is the pixel data of the largest object, extracted from the input grid relative to its bounding box origin.\n\nassumptions:\n  - There will be a unique largest object in the input grid (no ties in size).\n  - Objects are defined by 8-way connectivity.\n  - The background color is always white (0).\n```"

Use 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) to determine contiguity for pixels of the same color. Record the color, pixel coordinates, and total size (pixel count) for each object found.\n2.  **Select Largest Object:** Compare the sizes of all identified objects. Select the object that has the maximum size (the greatest number of pixels).\n3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the pixels of the selected largest object. These define its bounding box.\n4.  **Calculate Output Dimensions:** The height of the output grid is `max_row - min_row + 1`. The width of the output grid is `max_col - min_col + 1`.\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a new grid with the calculated output dimensions, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).\n6.  **Copy Object:** Iterate through the pixels of the selected largest object in the input grid. For each pixel at `(input_row, input_col)` belonging to the object, copy its color to the corresponding position `(input_row - min_row, input_col - min_col)` in the output grid.\n7.  **Final Output:** The populated output grid is the result."
