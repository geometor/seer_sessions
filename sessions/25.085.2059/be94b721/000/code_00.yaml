task_description: Extract the single largest object from the input grid into a new grid corresponding to its bounding box.

definitions:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
  - background_color: white (0).
  - object: A contiguous group of pixels of the same non-white color. Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-way connectivity).
  - object_size: The total number of pixels belonging to an object.
  - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of an object. Defined by min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col.
  - grid_dimensions: Height (number of rows) and Width (number of columns).

input_features:
  - Contains multiple distinct objects.
  - Objects have varying colors, shapes, and sizes.
  - Objects are placed on a white background.

output_features:
  - Contains a single object from the input.
  - The object is the one with the largest size (pixel count) from the input.
  - The grid dimensions match the bounding box dimensions of the selected object.
  - The object retains its original color and shape relative to its bounding box.
  - The background is white.

relationships:
  - Input objects are compared based on their size.
  - The output grid is derived from the bounding box of the largest input object.
  - The content of the output grid is the pixel data of the largest object, extracted from the input grid relative to its bounding box origin.

assumptions:
  - There will be a unique largest object in the input grid (no ties in size).
  - Objects are defined by 8-way connectivity.
  - The background color is always white (0).
