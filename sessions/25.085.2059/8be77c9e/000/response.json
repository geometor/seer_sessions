The outputs are 6x3 grids.\n2.  **Relationship:** The output grid appears to be composed of two parts stacked vertically.\n3.  **Top Half:** The top 3 rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n4.  **Bottom Half:** The bottom 3 rows of the output grid seem to be a reflection of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like a vertical reflection (flipped upside down). The last row of the input becomes the first row of the bottom half of the output, the second-to-last row of the input becomes the second row of the bottom half, and so on.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The colors (pixel values) themselves are preserved during the transformation; only their positions change in the reflected part.\n6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true across all three examples provided.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
