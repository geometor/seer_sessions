## Perception

1.  **Input and Output Structure:** The inputs are 3x3 grids of pixels (colors). The outputs are 6x3 grids.
2.  **Relationship:** The output grid appears to be composed of two parts stacked vertically.
3.  **Top Half:** The top 3 rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
4.  **Bottom Half:** The bottom 3 rows of the output grid seem to be a reflection of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like a vertical reflection (flipped upside down). The last row of the input becomes the first row of the bottom half of the output, the second-to-last row of the input becomes the second row of the bottom half, and so on.
5.  **Color Preservation:** The colors (pixel values) themselves are preserved during the transformation; only their positions change in the reflected part.
6.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true across all three examples provided.

## Facts


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      pixels: colored (0-9)

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      height: 2 * H
      width: W
      pixels: colored (0-9)

Transformation:
  - name: vertical_concatenation
  - steps:
      - step_1:
          action: copy
          source: input_grid
          destination: top_half_output (rows 0 to H-1)
      - step_2:
          action: vertical_reflection
          source: input_grid
          result: reflected_grid
      - step_3:
          action: copy
          source: reflected_grid
          destination: bottom_half_output (rows H to 2*H - 1)
  - details:
      vertical_reflection: Flips the grid upside down. The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Create a new grid with the same width as the input grid but twice the height.
3.  Copy the input grid into the top half of the new grid (from row 0 to row H-1, where H is the height of the input grid).
4.  Create a vertically reflected version of the input grid (flip the input grid upside down).
5.  Copy this reflected grid into the bottom half of the new grid (from row H to row 2*H - 1).
6.  The resulting grid is the output.
