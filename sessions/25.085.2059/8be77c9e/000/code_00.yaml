Input:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      pixels: colored (0-9)

Output:
  - type: grid
  - properties:
      height: 2 * H
      width: W

Transformation:
  - name: vertical_concatenation
  - steps:
      - step_1:
          action: copy
          source: input_grid
          destination: top_half_output (rows 0 to H-1)
      - step_2:
          action: vertical_reflection
          source: input_grid
          result: reflected_grid
      - step_3:
          action: copy
          source: reflected_grid
          destination: bottom_half_output (rows H to 2*H - 1)
  - details:
      vertical_reflection: Flips the grid upside down. The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.
