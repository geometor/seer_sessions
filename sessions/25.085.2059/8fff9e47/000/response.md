Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Relation:** The core transformation appears to be a scaling operation. The input grid is significantly smaller than the output grid.
2.  **Scaling Factors:**
    *   In `train_1`, the input is 6x4 and the output is 12x12. The height is scaled by 12/6 = 2, and the width is scaled by 12/4 = 3.
    *   In `train_2`, the input is 4x6 and the output is 12x12. The height is scaled by 12/4 = 3, and the width is scaled by 12/6 = 2.
3.  **Mechanism:** Each pixel (color value) in the input grid is expanded into a rectangular block of pixels of the same color in the output grid. The dimensions of this block correspond to the calculated scaling factors (Height Scale x Width Scale).
4.  **Output Size:** Both examples produce a 12x12 output grid. This suggests the target output size might be fixed for this task.
5.  **Color Preservation:** The color of each pixel in the input grid is preserved and used to fill the corresponding expanded block in the output grid. No color changes occur.

## Facts

  properties:
    - variable_dimensions (height_in, width_in)
    - contains_pixels: yes

  properties:
    - fixed_dimensions: [12, 12] # Based on examples
    - contains_pixels: yes

  details:
    - calculate_height_scale: 12 / height_in
    - calculate_width_scale: 12 / width_in
    - for each pixel in the input grid at (row_in, col_in) with color C:
        - create a block in the output grid
        - block_top_left: (row_in * height_scale, col_in * width_scale)
        - block_dimensions: (height_scale, width_scale)
        - fill the block with color C
relationships:
  - each input pixel maps directly to a rectangular block in the output grid
  - the color of the input pixel determines the color of the output block
  - the position of the input pixel determines the position of the output block
  - the scaling factors are derived from the ratio of output dimensions to input dimensions
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W_in`) of the input grid.
2.  Define the target output grid dimensions as height `H_out = 12` and width `W_out = 12`.
3.  Calculate the integer scaling factor for height: `Scale_H = H_out / H_in`.
4.  Calculate the integer scaling factor for width: `Scale_W = W_out / W_in`.
5.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions `H_out` x `W_out`, initialized with a default color (e.g., white/0, although initialization color doesn't matter as it will be overwritten).
6.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. For each input pixel at row `r_in` and column `c_in` with color `C`:
    a.  Determine the top-left corner coordinates for the corresponding block in the output grid: `r_out_start = r_in * Scale_H`, `c_out_start = c_in * Scale_W`.
    b.  Fill a rectangular block in the output grid starting at (`r_out_start`, `c_out_start`) with dimensions `Scale_H` (height) and `Scale_W` (width) using the color `C`. This means setting the color of all pixels from row `r_out_start` to `r_out_start + Scale_H - 1` and column `c_out_start` to `c_out_start + Scale_W - 1` to `C`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
