"""
Transforms the input grid by identifying non-white 'seed' pixels and generating a vertical pattern below each seed. 
The pattern alternates based on row distance: 
- For odd distances (k), pixels are placed diagonally below and to the left/right of the seed's column.
- For even distances (k), a pixel is placed directly below the seed's column.
The pattern uses the color of the seed pixel and respects grid boundaries.

    Returns:
