Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** Contain pixels with two distinct colors: Orange (7) and Magenta (6). The dimensions vary across examples.
2.  **Output Grids:** Have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They contain pixels with two distinct colors: Orange (7) and Red (2).
3.  **Color Transformation:** A consistent change occurs across all examples: Magenta (6) pixels in the input become Red (2) pixels in the output.
4.  **Color Preservation:** Orange (7) pixels in the input remain Orange (7) pixels in the output.
5.  **Transformation Scope:** The change appears to be applied independently to each pixel based solely on its color value. The position or neighboring pixels do not seem to influence the transformation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: true
      - dimensions: variable (input matches output)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
transformation:
  type: pixel_wise_color_substitution
  details:
    - input_color: 6 (Magenta)
      output_color: 2 (Red)
    - input_color: 7 (Orange)
      output_color: 7 (Orange) # Preserved
relationships:
  - input_output_dimension_match: true
  - transformation_dependency: based solely on the pixel's input color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  For each pixel in the input grid:
    a.  Read the color value of the pixel.
    b.  If the color value is 6 (Magenta), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to 2 (Red).
    c.  Otherwise (if the color value is not 6), copy the original color value from the input pixel to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
3.  Return the completed output grid.
