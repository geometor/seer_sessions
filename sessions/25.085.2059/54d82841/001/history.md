Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids contain one or more distinct "U" shaped objects made of a single color (green, magenta, azure). The background is white (0).
2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, except for the addition of one or more yellow pixels (4).
3.  **Object Definition**: The "U" shape appears consistently defined:
    *   A horizontal bar of 3 pixels of the same color.
    *   Two single pixels of the same color extending downwards from the ends of the horizontal bar.
    *   The pixel directly below the *center* of the horizontal bar is white (0).
    *   This forms a 3x2 bounding box containing 5 pixels of the object color and 1 white pixel in the center of the bottom row.
4.  **Transformation**: For each "U" shape identified in the input:
    *   A single yellow pixel (4) is added to the output grid.
    *   The *column* of the added yellow pixel matches the *column* of the central pixel of the top horizontal bar of the corresponding "U" shape.
    *   The *row* of the added yellow pixel is always the *last row* of the grid.
5.  **Color Independence**: The color of the "U" shape (green, magenta, azure) does not seem to affect the transformation rule itself, only the identification of the shape. The output pixel is always yellow.
6.  **Grid Size**: The grid size varies, but the placement logic (last row, center column relative to the 'U') holds across different sizes.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: U_shape
    definition: A 3x2 area where pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2) are the same non-white color (C), and the pixel at relative coordinate (1,1) is white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color (C) forming the shape.
      - center_column_index: The column index of the middle pixel of the top row (relative coordinate (0,1)).
  - object: background
    definition: Pixels with value 0 (white).
  - object: marker_pixel
    definition: A pixel with value 4 (yellow).

actions:
  - action: identify_U_shapes
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_U_shapes
    description: Scan the grid to find all instances matching the U_shape definition. Record their top-left corner coordinates and center_column_index.
  - action: place_marker
    input:
      - output_grid (initially a copy of input_grid)
      - center_column_index (from a found U_shape)
      - grid_height
    output: modified_output_grid
    description: Set the pixel in the last row (grid_height - 1) at the specified center_column_index to yellow (4).

relationships:
  - relationship: marker_placement
    subject: marker_pixel
    verb: is placed

    conditions:
      - For each identified U_shape in the input_grid.
      - Row: The last row of the grid.
      - Column: The center_column_index of the U_shape.

grid_properties:
  - property: height
    description: The number of rows in the grid.
  - property: width
    description: The number of columns in the grid.
  - property: last_row_index
    value: height - 1
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the `input_grid`.
3.  Iterate through each possible top-left position (`r`, `c`) for a 3x2 shape within the grid boundaries (i.e., `r` from 0 to `H-2`, `c` from 0 to `W-3`).
4.  At each position (`r`, `c`), check if it is the top-left corner of a "U" shape:
    a.  Identify the color `C` of the pixel at (`r`, `c+1`). If `C` is white (0), this cannot be a "U" shape; continue to the next position.
    b.  Verify that the pixels at (`r`, `c`), (`r`, `c+2`), (`r+1`, `c`), and (`r+1`, `c+2`) are all also color `C`.
    c.  Verify that the pixel at (`r+1`, `c+1`) is white (0).
    d.  If all these conditions are met, a "U" shape is found.
5.  If a "U" shape is found starting at (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Identify the column index of the center of the top bar: `center_col = c + 1`.
    b.  Identify the index of the last row: `last_row = H - 1`.
    c.  Set the pixel in the `output_grid` at position (`last_row`, `center_col`) to yellow (4).
6.  After checking all possible positions, return the `output_grid`.
