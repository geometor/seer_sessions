            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure**: The input grids contain one or more distinct \"U\" shaped objects made of a single color (green, magenta, azure). The background is white (0).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure**: The output grids are identical to the input grids, except for the addition of one or more yellow pixels (4).\n3.  **Object Definition**: The \"U\" shape appears consistently defined:\n    *   A horizontal bar of 3 pixels of the same color.\n    *   Two single pixels of the same color extending downwards from the ends of the horizontal bar.\n    *   The pixel directly below the *center* of the horizontal bar is white (0).\n    *   This forms a 3x2 bounding box containing 5 pixels of the object color and 1 white pixel in the center of the bottom row.\n4.  **Transformation**: For each \"U\" shape identified in the input:\n    *   A single yellow pixel (4) is added to the output grid.\n    *   The *column* of the added yellow pixel matches the *column* of the central pixel of the top horizontal bar of the corresponding \"U\" shape.\n    *   The *row* of the added yellow pixel is always the *last row* of the grid.\n5.  **Color Independence**: The color of the \"U\" shape (green, magenta, azure) does not seem to affect the transformation rule itself, only the identification of the shape. The output pixel is always yellow.\n6.  **Grid Size**: The grid size varies, but the placement logic (last row, center column relative to the 'U') holds across different sizes.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
