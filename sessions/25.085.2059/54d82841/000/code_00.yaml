elements:
  - object: U_shape
    definition: A 3x2 area where pixels at relative coordinates (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2) are the same non-white color (C), and the pixel at relative coordinate (1,1) is white (0).
    properties:
      - color: The non-white color (C) forming the shape.
      - center_column_index: The column index of the middle pixel of the top row (relative coordinate (0,1)).
  - object: background
    definition: Pixels with value 0 (white).
  - object: marker_pixel
    definition: A pixel with value 4 (yellow).
