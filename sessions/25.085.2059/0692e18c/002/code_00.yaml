task_description: Upscale a 3x3 grid to 9x9 based on pixel values, using a color-swapped version of the input as a pattern.
grid_properties:
  - input_dimensions: 3x3
  - output_dimensions: 9x9 (3x scale factor)
  - color_palette: Primarily white (0) and one other non-white color (C).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0) or non-white (C)
      - position: (row, column) in the input grid
  - type: grid_block
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - position: (block_row, block_col) in the output grid, corresponding to input pixel (block_row, block_col)
      - content: Either all white or a specific 3x3 pattern grid P.
  - type: pattern_grid (P)
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - derivation: Created from the input grid (I) by swapping the white color (0) and the non-white color (C).
        rule: P[i, j] = C if I[i, j] == 0; P[i, j] = 0 if I[i, j] == C.
transformation_rule:
  - step: Identify the unique non-white color (C) in the 3x3 input grid (I).
  - step: Generate a 3x3 pattern grid (P) where white pixels in I become color C, and pixels of color C in I become white.
  - step: Create a 9x9 output grid, initialized to white.
  - step: Iterate through each pixel I[r, c] of the input grid.
  - step: Define the target 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (r*3, c*3).
  - condition: If I[r, c] is white (0):
    action: Fill the target block with white (0).
  - condition: If I[r, c] is the non-white color (C):
    action: Fill the target block with the pre-computed pattern grid (P).
