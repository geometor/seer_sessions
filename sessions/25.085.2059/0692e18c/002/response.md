## General Assessment

The previous code failed because it misinterpreted the rule for filling the 3x3 blocks in the output grid when the corresponding input pixel was non-white. The assumption was that the original input grid was copied, but the actual transformation is more complex. The expected outputs show a consistent pattern: when an input pixel `(r, c)` is non-white (color `C`), the corresponding 3x3 output block is filled with a *specific transformation* of the original input grid, not a direct copy. This transformed 3x3 pattern appears to be constant for all non-white input pixels within a single example. The transformation involves swapping the white background color (0) and the non-white color `C` found in the input grid. When the input pixel is white (0), the output block is correctly filled with white.

The strategy is to:
1.  Identify the single non-white color (`C`) present in the input grid.
2.  Pre-compute the 3x3 "pattern grid" (`P`) by taking the input grid and swapping color `C` with white (0).
3.  Construct the 9x9 output grid by iterating through the 3x3 input grid:
    *   If `input[r, c]` is white (0), place a 3x3 block of white in the output at `(r*3, c*3)`.
    *   If `input[r, c]` is the non-white color `C`, place the pre-computed pattern grid `P` in the output at `(r*3, c*3)`.

## Metrics

We can use code execution to find the non-white color and generate the pattern grid for verification.


``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid_list):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid_list, dtype=int)
    unique_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    non_white_colors = unique_colors[unique_colors != 0]

    if len(non_white_colors) == 0:
        # Handle all-white input if necessary, though examples suggest one non-white color
        non_white_color = -1 # Indicate no non-white color found
        pattern_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid) # Default pattern
    elif len(non_white_colors) > 1:
        # Handle multiple non-white colors if necessary, though examples suggest one
        non_white_color = -2 # Indicate multiple non-white colors found
        pattern_grid = np.full_like(input_grid, -1) # Error pattern
    else:
        non_white_color = non_white_colors[0]
        # Generate pattern grid P: swap non_white_color and 0
        pattern_grid = np.where(input_grid == 0, non_white_color, 0)

    return {
        "input_grid": input_grid.tolist(),
        "non_white_color": int(non_white_color) if non_white_color >= 0 else non_white_color,
        "pattern_grid": pattern_grid.tolist()
    }

# Example 1
input1 = [[0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0]]
analysis1 = analyze_example(input1)
print("--- Example 1 Analysis ---")
print(f"Input:\n{np.array(input1)}")
print(f"Non-white color: {analysis1['non_white_color']}")
print(f"Derived Pattern Grid:\n{np.array(analysis1['pattern_grid'])}")
expected_pattern1 = [[6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6]]
print(f"Matches Expected Pattern: {analysis1['pattern_grid'] == expected_pattern1}")

# Example 2
input2 = [[0, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 0]]
analysis2 = analyze_example(input2)
print("\n--- Example 2 Analysis ---")
print(f"Input:\n{np.array(input2)}")
print(f"Non-white color: {analysis2['non_white_color']}")
print(f"Derived Pattern Grid:\n{np.array(analysis2['pattern_grid'])}")
expected_pattern2 = [[7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7]]
print(f"Matches Expected Pattern: {analysis2['pattern_grid'] == expected_pattern2}")

# Example 3
input3 = [[4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 4]]
analysis3 = analyze_example(input3)
print("\n--- Example 3 Analysis ---")
print(f"Input:\n{np.array(input3)}")
print(f"Non-white color: {analysis3['non_white_color']}")
print(f"Derived Pattern Grid:\n{np.array(analysis3['pattern_grid'])}")
expected_pattern3 = [[0, 0, 4], [4, 4, 0], [4, 4, 0]]
print(f"Matches Expected Pattern: {analysis3['pattern_grid'] == expected_pattern3}")
```
```
--- Example 1 Analysis ---
Input:
[[0 0 6]
 [0 6 0]
 [6 0 0]]
Non-white color: 6
Derived Pattern Grid:
[[6 6 0]
 [6 0 6]
 [0 6 6]]
Matches Expected Pattern: True

--- Example 2 Analysis ---
Input:
[[0 7 0]
 [7 7 7]
 [0 7 0]]
Non-white color: 7
Derived Pattern Grid:
[[7 0 7]
 [0 0 0]
 [7 0 7]]
Matches Expected Pattern: True

--- Example 3 Analysis ---
Input:
[[4 4 0]
 [0 0 4]
 [0 0 4]]
Non-white color: 4
Derived Pattern Grid:
[[0 0 4]
 [4 4 0]
 [4 4 0]]
Matches Expected Pattern: True

```
The analysis confirms the hypothesis: the pattern grid (`P`) used to fill output blocks corresponding to non-white input pixels is generated by swapping the white color (0) and the unique non-white color (`C`) from the original input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the single non-white color, `C`, present in the 3x3 input grid `I`.
2.  Create a new 3x3 grid, called the `pattern_grid` `P`. For each cell `(i, j)` in the input grid `I`:
    *   If `I[i, j]` is white (0), set `P[i, j]` to color `C`.
    *   If `I[i, j]` is color `C`, set `P[i, j]` to white (0).
3.  Create the 9x9 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
4.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the 3x3 input grid `I` (where `r` is the row index 0-2, and `c` is the column index 0-2).
5.  Locate the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid, which starts at row `r * 3` and column `c * 3`.
6.  If the input cell `I[r, c]` contains the non-white color `C`, copy the entire `pattern_grid` `P` into this 3x3 output block.
7.  If the input cell `I[r, c]` contains white (0), leave the corresponding 3x3 output block filled with white (0).
8.  Return the completed 9x9 output grid.
