The output grid's dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid's dimensions.\n2.  **Grid Structure**: The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.\n3.  **Content Mapping**: The content of each 3x3 block in the output grid seems determined by the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 input grid.\n4.  **Conditional Copying**:\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid is *not* white (color 0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is a direct copy of the *entire* original 3x3 input grid.\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid *is* white (color 0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled entirely with white (color 0).\n5.  **Color Invariance**: The specific non-white color in the input grid (magenta, orange, yellow) doesn't change the *content* being copied (which is always the original input grid), only *whether* a copy is placed or an all-white block is placed.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
