task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - input_size: 3x3 (consistent across examples)
  - output_size: 9x9 (consistent across examples)
  - scale_factor: 3 (output dimension / input dimension)
relationship:
  - output_grid: composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 3x3 subgrids (blocks)
transformation:
  - mapping: Each pixel (input_row, input_col) in the input grid maps to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (input_row * 3, input_col * 3).
  - rule: Conditional placement based on input pixel color.
    - condition: If input_pixel(input_row, input_col) != 0 (white)
      - action: The corresponding 3x3 output block is filled with a copy of the original 3x3 input grid.
    - condition: If input_pixel(input_row, input_col) == 0 (white)
      - action: The corresponding 3x3 output block is filled entirely with 0 (white).
objects:
  - input_grid: A 3x3 grid acting as both a template for content and a map for placement.
  - output_grid: A 9x9 grid constructed based on the input grid.
  - subgrid_block: A 3x3 section within the output grid.
  - all_white_block: A 3x3 subgrid filled with white (0).
