Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: All training examples have a 3x3 input grid and a 9x9 output grid. The output grid's dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid's dimensions.
2.  **Grid Structure**: The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 blocks.
3.  **Content Mapping**: The content of each 3x3 block in the output grid seems determined by the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 input grid.
4.  **Conditional Copying**:
    *   If a pixel in the input grid is *not* white (color 0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is a direct copy of the *entire* original 3x3 input grid.
    *   If a pixel in the input grid *is* white (color 0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled entirely with white (color 0).
5.  **Color Invariance**: The specific non-white color in the input grid (magenta, orange, yellow) doesn't change the *content* being copied (which is always the original input grid), only *whether* a copy is placed or an all-white block is placed.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - input_size: 3x3 (consistent across examples)
  - output_size: 9x9 (consistent across examples)
  - scale_factor: 3 (output dimension / input dimension)
relationship:
  - output_grid: composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 3x3 subgrids (blocks)
transformation:
  - mapping: Each pixel (input_row, input_col) in the input grid maps to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (input_row * 3, input_col * 3).
  - rule: Conditional placement based on input pixel color.
    - condition: If input_pixel(input_row, input_col) != 0 (white)
      - action: The corresponding 3x3 output block is filled with a copy of the original 3x3 input grid.
    - condition: If input_pixel(input_row, input_col) == 0 (white)
      - action: The corresponding 3x3 output block is filled entirely with 0 (white).
objects:
  - input_grid: A 3x3 grid acting as both a template for content and a map for placement.
  - output_grid: A 9x9 grid constructed based on the input grid.
  - subgrid_block: A 3x3 section within the output grid.
  - all_white_block: A 3x3 subgrid filled with white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with dimensions 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid (resulting in a 9x9 grid for a 3x3 input). Fill it initially with white (0).
2.  Define a 3x3 "white block" consisting entirely of white (0) pixels.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to height-1) and column index `c` (from 0 to width-1).
4.  For the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid:
    a.  Check its color.
    b.  If the color is white (0):
        i.  Identify the target 3x3 block in the output grid starting at row `r * 3` and column `c * 3`.
        ii. Place the "white block" into this target block.
    c.  If the color is *not* white (0):
        i.  Identify the target 3x3 block in the output grid starting at row `r * 3` and column `c * 3`.
        ii. Place a copy of the *original complete 3x3 input grid* into this target block.
5.  Return the completed output grid.
