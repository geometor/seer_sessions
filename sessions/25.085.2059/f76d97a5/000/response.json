One of these colors is always gray (5). The second color varies across examples (magenta (6), yellow (4), maroon (9)).\n3.  **Pattern Identification:** The gray pixels (5) in the input grid form a specific spatial pattern or mark a set of locations. The non-gray color occupies the remaining cells.\n4.  **Output Composition:** The output grid is composed of only two colors: white (0) and the non-gray color identified from the input grid.\n5.  **Transformation Core:** The key transformation appears to be based on the location of the gray pixels. The positions occupied by gray (5) in the input grid are occupied by the *other* input color in the output grid. All positions that were *not* gray (5) in the input grid become white (0) in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid. One color will be gray (5); identify the other color (let's call it `target_color`).\n3.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row and column index.\n4.  For each cell, check if its color is gray (5).\n5.  If the input cell's color is gray (5), set the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to `target_color`.\n6.  If the input cell's color is not gray (5), the corresponding output cell remains white (0) (as initialized in step 1).\n7.  After checking all cells, the constructed output grid is the result."
