**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task operates on grids of pixels, transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions.
2.  **Colors:** Each input grid consistently features exactly two distinct colors. One of these colors is always gray (5). The second color varies across examples (magenta (6), yellow (4), maroon (9)).
3.  **Pattern Identification:** The gray pixels (5) in the input grid form a specific spatial pattern or mark a set of locations. The non-gray color occupies the remaining cells.
4.  **Output Composition:** The output grid is composed of only two colors: white (0) and the non-gray color identified from the input grid.
5.  **Transformation Core:** The key transformation appears to be based on the location of the gray pixels. The positions occupied by gray (5) in the input grid are occupied by the *other* input color in the output grid. All positions that were *not* gray (5) in the input grid become white (0) in the output grid.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Transforms a grid based on the locations of gray pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - input_colors: Exactly two distinct colors per input grid.
  - constant_input_color: One of the input colors is always gray (5).
  - variable_input_color: The second input color varies (e.g., magenta, yellow, maroon).
  - output_colors: Consists only of white (0) and the variable_input_color from the corresponding input.

objects_and_patterns:
  - object_type: Pixels
  - property: Color
  - identified_pattern: The spatial arrangement of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.

transformation_rule:
  - identify: The locations of all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
  - identify: The non-gray color present in the input grid.
  - create_output: Generate an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - mapping:
      - For each location (row, col):
        - If input[row, col] is gray (5), then output[row, col] is the non-gray input color.
        - If input[row, col] is not gray (5), then output[row, col] is white (0).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with white (0).
2.  Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid. One color will be gray (5); identify the other color (let's call it `target_color`).
3.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row and column index.
4.  For each cell, check if its color is gray (5).
5.  If the input cell's color is gray (5), set the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid to `target_color`.
6.  If the input cell's color is not gray (5), the corresponding output cell remains white (0) (as initialized in step 1).
7.  After checking all cells, the constructed output grid is the result.
