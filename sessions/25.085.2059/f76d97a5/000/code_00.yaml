task_description: Transforms a grid based on the locations of gray pixels.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - input_colors: Exactly two distinct colors per input grid.
  - constant_input_color: One of the input colors is always gray (5).
  - variable_input_color: The second input color varies (e.g., magenta, yellow, maroon).
  - output_colors: Consists only of white (0) and the variable_input_color from the corresponding input.

objects_and_patterns:
  - object_type: Pixels
  - property: Color
  - identified_pattern: The spatial arrangement of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.

transformation_rule:
  - identify: The locations of all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
  - identify: The non-gray color present in the input grid.
  - create_output: Generate an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - mapping:
      - For each location (row, col):
        - If input[row, col] is gray (5), then output[row, col] is the non-gray input color.
        - If input[row, col] is not gray (5), then output[row, col] is white (0).
