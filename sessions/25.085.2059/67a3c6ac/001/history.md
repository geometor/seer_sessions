Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors present in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed entirely (unless a color only appeared once in a row that happened to be a palindrome).
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output grids, it appears that the pixels within each row have been rearranged. Specifically, the order of pixels in each row of the input grid is reversed to produce the corresponding row in the output grid. This operation is consistent across all rows and all examples.
4.  **Independence:** The transformation applied to one row does not seem to affect any other row. Each row is processed independently.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
input_type: grid
output_type: grid
dimensions_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions
color_relation: output grid uses the same set of colors as the input grid
transformation_scope: row-wise
row_transformation:
  action: reverse
  target: sequence of pixels within the row
column_transformation: none identified (columns are implicitly rearranged due to row reversal)
object_focus: none identified (transformation applies uniformly to pixels based on position)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  For each row in the input grid, starting from the top row (row index 0) and proceeding to the bottom row:
    a.  Read the sequence of pixels in the current row from left to right.
    b.  Reverse the order of this sequence of pixels.
    c.  Place the reversed sequence of pixels into the corresponding row of the output grid.
3.  The resulting grid is the final output.
