The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid are identical to the input grid in all examples.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors present in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed entirely (unless a color only appeared once in a row that happened to be a palindrome).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing input and output grids, it appears that the pixels within each row have been rearranged. Specifically, the order of pixels in each row of the input grid is reversed to produce the corresponding row in the output grid. This operation is consistent across all rows and all examples.\n4.  **Independence:** The transformation applied to one row does not seem to affect any other row. Each row is processed independently.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
