Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Each example consists of a 3x3 input grid and a 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Input Content:** The input grids contain a variety of colors (pixel values).
3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are uniformly filled with a single color.
4.  **Color Relationship:** The color used to fill the output grid is always present in the corresponding input grid.
5.  **Frequency Analysis:** Comparing the input and output colors across the examples reveals a pattern:
    *   In `train_1`, maroon (9) appears 3 times in the input, more than any other color. The output is filled with maroon (9).
    *   In `train_2`, yellow (4) appears 3 times in the input, more than any other color. The output is filled with yellow (4).
    *   In `train_3`, magenta (6) appears 3 times in the input, more than any other color. The output is filled with magenta (6).
6.  **Transformation Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the color that occurs most frequently in the input grid and then creates an output grid of the same dimensions, filled entirely with that most frequent color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: Transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D
  - size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in examples).
input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    attributes:
      - Contains pixels of various colors.
      - Dimensions are 3x3.
output_elements:
  - type: Grid
    attributes:
      - Contains pixels of a single, uniform color.
      - Dimensions are 3x3.
transformation:
  - type: Analysis
    description: Analyze the frequency of each color (pixel value) within the input grid.
  - type: Selection
    description: Identify the color with the highest frequency.
  - type: Construction
    description: Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: Filling
    description: Fill the entire output grid with the selected most frequent color.
relationship:
  - The color used to fill the output grid is the mode (most frequent value) of the pixel values in the input grid.
constraints:
  - The examples provided always have a unique most frequent color. The behavior in case of a tie is not defined by these examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Count the occurrences of each distinct color within the input grid.
3.  Determine the color that has the highest count (the most frequent color).
4.  Create a new grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
5.  Fill every cell of the new grid with the most frequent color identified in step 3.
6.  Output the new grid.
