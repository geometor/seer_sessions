The output is filled with maroon (9).\n    *   In `train_2`, yellow (4) appears 3 times in the input, more than any other color. The output is filled with yellow (4).\n    *   In `train_3`, magenta (6) appears 3 times in the input, more than any other color. The output is filled with magenta (6).\n6.  **Transformation Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the color that occurs most frequently in the input grid and then creates an output grid of the same dimensions, filled entirely with that most frequent color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
