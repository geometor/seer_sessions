task_type: Transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D
  - size_relation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in examples).
input_elements:
  - type: Grid
    attributes:
      - Contains pixels of various colors.
      - Dimensions are 3x3.
output_elements:
  - type: Grid
    attributes:
      - Contains pixels of a single, uniform color.
      - Dimensions are 3x3.
transformation:
  - type: Analysis
    description: Analyze the frequency of each color (pixel value) within the input grid.
  - type: Selection
    description: Identify the color with the highest frequency.
  - type: Construction
    description: Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: Filling
    description: Fill the entire output grid with the selected most frequent color.
relationship:
  - The color used to fill the output grid is the mode (most frequent value) of the pixel values in the input grid.
constraints:
  - The examples provided always have a unique most frequent color. The behavior in case of a tie is not defined by these examples.
