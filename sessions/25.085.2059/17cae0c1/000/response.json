            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are consistently 3 rows high and 9 columns wide.\n2.  **Input Content:** The input grids consist solely of white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The gray pixels form distinct patterns within the grid.\n3.  **Output Content:** The output grids are composed of three adjacent, solid-colored 3x3 blocks. The colors used in the output vary across examples (Magenta, Green, Blue, Maroon, Yellow).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to operate on 3x3 subgrids. The input grid can be naturally divided into three 3x3 subgrids placed side-by-side horizontally. The pattern formed by the gray (5) pixels within each 3x3 input subgrid determines the single color used to fill the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output. White pixels in the input seem to define the structure of the gray pattern but are otherwise ignored in the direct output mapping.\n5.  **Mapping:** There is a consistent mapping between specific 3x3 patterns of gray pixels in the input and the resulting solid color in the corresponding 3x3 output block. For instance:\n    *   A pattern with only the top row gray maps to Magenta (6).\n    *   A pattern with only the bottom row gray maps to Blue (1).\n    *   A pattern with only the center pixel gray maps to Yellow (4).\n    *   A pattern with gray pixels along the anti-diagonal maps to Maroon (9).\n    *   Two distinct patterns (one U-shaped, one G-shaped) map to Green (3).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
