Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input examples show a grid primarily composed of white pixels (0). Each input grid contains exactly one row with non-white pixels. This row features two distinct non-white pixels located at the very beginning (column 0) and the very end (last column) of that row. All other pixels in the grid are white.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as the inputs. The transformation is confined entirely to the single row that contained non-white pixels in the input.
3.  **Transformation Details:**
    *   The original non-white pixels at the start and end of the row remain in their positions in the output.
    *   The white pixels *between* these two boundary pixels are filled in.
    *   The filling seems to happen in two segments:
        *   The segment from the column immediately after the left boundary pixel up to, but not including, the exact middle column is filled with the color of the left boundary pixel.
        *   The pixel in the exact middle column of the row is filled with gray (5).
        *   The segment from the column immediately after the middle gray pixel up to, but not including, the right boundary pixel is filled with the color of the right boundary pixel.
4.  **Color Usage:** The colors used for filling are derived directly from the boundary pixels in the input. A new color, gray (5), is introduced in the exact center of the modified row segment.
5.  **Invariance:** Rows that were entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output. The positions and colors of the initial boundary pixels are preserved.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: "Fill the gap between two boundary pixels in a row, using their respective colors and placing a gray separator in the middle."

grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same height and width as the input.
  - background_color: white (0)

objects:
  - object_type: boundary_pixel
    count_per_input: 2
    location: Always in the same row, one at column 0, one at the last column.
    properties:
      - color: Any non-white color. Colors can differ between the two boundary pixels.
  - object_type: fill_segment
    count_per_output: 2 (left and right)
    location: In the row defined by boundary pixels, between them, excluding the middle column.
    properties:
      - color: Inherited from the nearest boundary pixel (left segment uses left pixel color, right segment uses right pixel color).
  - object_type: separator_pixel
    count_per_output: 1
    location: In the row defined by boundary pixels, at the exact middle column index `(width - 1) // 2`.
    properties:
      - color: Always gray (5).

actions:
  - action: identify_target_row
    condition: Row contains exactly two non-white pixels, located at the first and last columns.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: row_index
  - action: identify_boundary_pixels
    inputs: input_grid, row_index
    outputs: left_pixel_color, right_pixel_color, grid_width
  - action: calculate_middle_column
    inputs: grid_width
    outputs: middle_column_index
  - action: fill_left_segment
    inputs: output_grid, row_index, left_pixel_color, middle_column_index
    effect: Changes colors of pixels in the target row from column 1 up to `middle_column_index - 1` to `left_pixel_color`.
  - action: place_separator
    inputs: output_grid, row_index, middle_column_index
    effect: Changes color of the pixel at `(row_index, middle_column_index)` to gray (5).
  - action: fill_right_segment
    inputs: output_grid, row_index, right_pixel_color, middle_column_index, grid_width
    effect: Changes colors of pixels in the target row from `middle_column_index + 1` up to `grid_width - 2` to `right_pixel_color`.

relationships:
  - The transformation only occurs in the row containing the boundary pixels.
  - The colors used for filling are determined by the boundary pixels on either side.
  - The gray separator pixel is positioned exactly halfway between the boundary pixels horizontally.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid to find the target row. The target row is identified as the one containing exactly two non-white pixels, with one pixel located at the first column (index 0) and the other at the last column (index `width - 1`).
3.  If no such row is found, return the copied input grid as the output.
4.  If the target row is found:
    a.  Record the index of this row (`target_row_index`).
    b.  Record the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, 0) as `color_left`.
    c.  Record the color of the pixel at (`target_row_index`, `width - 1`) as `color_right`.
    d.  Calculate the middle column index: `middle_column = (width - 1) // 2`.
    e.  Fill the pixels in the output grid's `target_row_index`:
        i.  From column index 1 up to (but not including) `middle_column`, set the pixel color to `color_left`.
        ii. Set the pixel color at column index `middle_column` to gray (5).
        iii. From column index `middle_column + 1` up to (but not including) `width - 1`, set the pixel color to `color_right`.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
