            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input examples show a grid primarily composed of white pixels (0). Each input grid contains exactly one row with non-white pixels. This row features two distinct non-white pixels located at the very beginning (column 0) and the very end (last column) of that row. All other pixels in the grid are white.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the same dimensions as the inputs. The transformation is confined entirely to the single row that contained non-white pixels in the input.\n3.  **Transformation Details:**\n    *   The original non-white pixels at the start and end of the row remain in their positions in the output.\n    *   The white pixels *between* these two boundary pixels are filled in.\n    *   The filling seems to happen in two segments:\n        *   The segment from the column immediately after the left boundary pixel up to, but not including, the exact middle column is filled with the color of the left boundary pixel.\n        *   The pixel in the exact middle column of the row is filled with gray (5).\n        *   The segment from the column immediately after the middle gray pixel up to, but not including, the right boundary pixel is filled with the color of the right boundary pixel.\n4.  **Color Usage:** The colors used for filling are derived directly from the boundary pixels in the input. A new color, gray (5), is introduced in the exact center of the modified row segment.\n5.  **Invariance:** Rows that were entirely white in the input remain entirely white in the output. The positions and colors of the initial boundary pixels are preserved.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
