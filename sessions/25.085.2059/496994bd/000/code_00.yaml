Task: Reflect top colored rows to the bottom

Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid Dimensions: 10x5
      Objects:
        - Type: Horizontal Line
          Color: Red (2)
          Location: Row 0
        - Type: Horizontal Line
          Color: Azure (8)
          Location: Row 1
        - Type: Background
          Color: White (0)
          Location: Rows 2-9
    Output:
      Grid Dimensions: 10x5
      Objects:
        - Type: Horizontal Line
          Color: Red (2)
          Location: Row 0
        - Type: Horizontal Line
          Color: Azure (8)
          Location: Row 1
        - Type: Background
          Color: White (0)
          Location: Rows 2-7
        - Type: Horizontal Line (Reflected)
          Color: Azure (8)
          Location: Row 8 (from input Row 1)
        - Type: Horizontal Line (Reflected)
          Color: Red (2)
          Location: Row 9 (from input Row 0)
      Relationship: Rows 0 and 1 from the input are reflected vertically to Rows 9 and 8 respectively in the output. The reflection preserves the horizontal structure of the rows.

        - Type: Horizontal Line (Reflected)
          Color: Green (3)
          Location: Row 7 (from input Row 2)
        - Type: Horizontal Line (Reflected)
          Color: Red (2)
          Location: Rows 8, 9 (from input Rows 1, 0 respectively)
      Relationship: Rows 0, 1, and 2 from the input are reflected vertically to Rows 9, 8, and 7 respectively in the output.

Transformation:
  Action: Identify the block of non-white rows starting from the top row of the input grid.
  Action: Determine the height (H) of the grid.
  Action: For each row `i` (0-based index) within this top non-white block:
    Copy the contents of input row `i` to the output row `H - 1 - i`.
  Action: Ensure the original top non-white rows and any intermediate white rows remain unchanged in the output grid.
