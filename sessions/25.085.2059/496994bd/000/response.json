The output grids retain the original colored rows at the top and the white rows immediately following them. However, at the very bottom of the output grid, there's a vertically mirrored copy of the initial block of colored rows from the top of the input. The mirroring seems to happen across the horizontal centerline of the grid. For example, the color pattern in row 1 appears in the last row, the pattern in row 2 appears in the second-to-last row, and so on, only for the initial non-white rows.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
