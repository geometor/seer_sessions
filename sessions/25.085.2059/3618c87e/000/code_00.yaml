task_context:
  grid_dimensions: ثابت 5x5 grid for all examples.
  colors_involved: white (0), blue (1), gray (5).
  background_color: white (0).
elements:
  - object: blue_pixel
    color: 1
    count: variable (1 or 2 in examples)
    initial_position: rows 2 or 3, variable columns.
    action: moves vertically downwards within its column.
    destination: the cell in the bottom-most row of the same column.
    effect_on_origin: origin cell becomes white (0).
    effect_on_destination: destination cell becomes blue (1), overwriting previous content.
  - object: gray_pixel
    color: 5
    count: variable
    initial_position: often below blue pixels, always fills the bottom row.
    action: remains stationary.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Blue pixels often have a gray pixel directly below them in the input.
  - type: spatial
    description: The bottom row is always entirely gray in the input.
  - type: transformation
    description: Each blue pixel's final row position is the last row of the grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: Each blue pixel's final column position is the same as its initial column position.
  - type: transformation
    description: Gray pixels do not move. White pixels (other than those resulting from moved blue pixels) do not change.
