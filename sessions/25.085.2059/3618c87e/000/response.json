The original gray (5) pixels in those bottom-row positions are replaced by blue (1).\n    *   All other pixels remain unchanged from the input.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation appears to be a \"gravity\" or \"teleportation\" effect specifically for the blue pixels. Each blue pixel moves from its starting position directly down to the last row of the grid within the same column. Its original position is cleared (becomes white), and it overwrites whatever color was in the destination cell in the last row. All non-blue pixels remain stationary.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
