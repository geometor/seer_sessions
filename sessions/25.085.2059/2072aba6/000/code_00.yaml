task_description: Pixel expansion and pattern replacement based on color.

grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      description: Contains white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
      size: Variable (e.g., 3x3 in examples).
  - output_grid:
      description: Contains white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.
      size: Always 2 times the height and 2 times the width of the input grid.

objects:
  - name: input_pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0) or gray (5)
      - position: (row, col)
  - name: output_block
    properties:
      - size: 2x2 pixels
      - position: Top-left corner at (input_row * 2, input_col * 2)
      - content: A 2x2 pattern determined by the corresponding input pixel's color.

transformation:
  actions:
    - action: Scale grid dimensions
      details: Multiply input height and width by 2 to get output dimensions.
    - action: Map pixels to blocks
      details: Each input pixel at (r, c) maps to the 2x2 output block starting at (r*2, c*2).
    - action: Replace based on color
      rules:
        - condition: Input pixel color is white (0).
          result: Corresponding 2x2 output block is filled with white (0). Pattern `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
        - condition: Input pixel color is gray (5).
          result: Corresponding 2x2 output block is filled with the pattern `[[1, 2], [2, 1]]` (blue, red; red, blue).

relationships:
  - type: Positional scaling
    description: Output block position is derived by multiplying the input pixel coordinates by 2.
  - type: Color-based pattern substitution
    description: The color of the input pixel dictates the 2x2 pattern placed in the corresponding output block.
