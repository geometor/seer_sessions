All examples show input grids with an even number of rows, facilitating this split.\n3.  **Content Placement:**\n    *   The top half of the input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid, preserving its dimensions and content.\n    *   The bottom half of the input grid is placed in the bottom-right portion of the output grid. Specifically, it's shifted down by one row and right by one column relative to where the top half ends.\n4.  **Padding/Filling:** The newly created row and the remaining parts of the newly created column space are filled entirely with the color maroon (value 9). This creates an \"L\" shaped divider of maroon pixels between the relocated top and bottom halves of the original input.\n    *   The row inserted exactly in the middle (at index `input_height / 2`) is filled with maroon.\n    *   The rightmost column is filled with maroon for the rows corresponding to the top half.\n    *   The leftmost column is filled with maroon for the rows corresponding to the bottom half (in its new position).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
