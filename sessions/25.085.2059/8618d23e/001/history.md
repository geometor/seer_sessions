Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Resizing:** The output grid is always one row taller and one column wider than the input grid.
2.  **Input Segmentation:** The input grid appears to be conceptually divided into two horizontal halves: a top half and a bottom half. All examples show input grids with an even number of rows, facilitating this split.
3.  **Content Placement:**
    *   The top half of the input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid, preserving its dimensions and content.
    *   The bottom half of the input grid is placed in the bottom-right portion of the output grid. Specifically, it's shifted down by one row and right by one column relative to where the top half ends.
4.  **Padding/Filling:** The newly created row and the remaining parts of the newly created column space are filled entirely with the color maroon (value 9). This creates an "L" shaped divider of maroon pixels between the relocated top and bottom halves of the original input.
    *   The row inserted exactly in the middle (at index `input_height / 2`) is filled with maroon.
    *   The rightmost column is filled with maroon for the rows corresponding to the top half.
    *   The leftmost column is filled with maroon for the rows corresponding to the bottom half (in its new position).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid: height `H` and width `W`. (Assume `H` is even based on examples).
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `(H + 1) x (W + 1)`.
3.  Identify the top half of the input grid (rows 0 to `H/2 - 1`, all columns).
4.  Identify the bottom half of the input grid (rows `H/2` to `H - 1`, all columns).
5.  Copy the top half of the input grid to the top-left corner of the output grid (rows 0 to `H/2 - 1`, columns 0 to `W - 1`).
6.  Copy the bottom half of the input grid to the output grid, starting at row `H/2 + 1` and column 1 (covering rows `H/2 + 1` to `H`, columns 1 to `W`).
7.  Fill the entire row at index `H/2` in the output grid with the color maroon (9).
8.  Fill the cells in the last column (index `W`) of the output grid from row 0 up to row `H/2 - 1` with the color maroon (9).
9.  Fill the cells in the first column (index 0) of the output grid from row `H/2 + 1` down to row `H` with the color maroon (9).
10. The resulting grid is the final output.
