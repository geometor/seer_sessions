Based on the provided examples:\n\n1.  **Input and Output Dimensions:** The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid are always identical to the dimensions of the input grid in all examples.\n2.  **Content Preservation:** The individual pixel values (colors) present in the input grid are all present in the output grid, and no new colors are introduced.\n3.  **Structural Change:** The arrangement of the pixels changes between input and output. Comparing the rows, the top row of the input consistently appears as the bottom row of the output. The second row from the top in the input becomes the second row from the bottom in the output, and this pattern continues. The bottom row of the input becomes the top row of the output.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** This pattern strongly suggests a vertical reflection or flip along the horizontal midline of the grid. The order of rows is reversed. The content within each row (the order of pixels horizontally) remains unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
