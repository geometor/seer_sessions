Task: Grid Duplication and Horizontal Concatenation

Examples:
  - Example 1:
    Input_Grid:
      Dimensions: 4x3 (height x width)
      Content: [[3, 0, 0], [2, 3, 0], [2, 1, 8], [0, 1, 0]]
    Output_Grid:
      Dimensions: 4x6 (height x width)
      Content: [[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0], [2, 1, 8, 2, 1, 8], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
      Relationship_to_Input: The output grid is formed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally. The left half (columns 0-2) is identical to the input grid, and the right half (columns 3-5) is also identical to the input grid.

  - Example 2:
    Input_Grid:
      Dimensions: 3x3 (height x width)
      Content: [[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 2], [0, 0, 0]]
    Output_Grid:
      Dimensions: 3x6 (height x width)
      Content: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
      Relationship_to_Input: The output grid is formed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally.

  - Example 3:
    Input_Grid:
      Dimensions: 4x4 (height x width)
      Content: [[5, 2, 3, 0], [2, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 8, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0]]
    Output_Grid:
      Dimensions: 4x8 (height x width)
      Content: [[5, 2, 3, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0], [2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 8, 8, 5, 2, 8, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]
      Relationship_to_Input: The output grid is formed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally.

General_Observations:
  - The height of the output grid is always the same as the height of the input grid.
  - The width of the output grid is always exactly twice the width of the input grid.
  - The content of the output grid is consistently the input grid repeated twice, placed side-by-side.
