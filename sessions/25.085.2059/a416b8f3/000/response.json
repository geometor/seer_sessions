The content of the output grid consists of two identical copies of the input grid placed horizontally next to each other.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

The left half (columns 0-2) is identical to the input grid, and the right half (columns 3-5) is also identical to the input grid.\n\n  - Example 2:\n    Input_Grid:\n      Dimensions: 3x3 (height x width)\n      Content: [[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 2], [0, 0, 0]]\n    Output_Grid:\n      Dimensions: 3x6 (height x width)\n      Content: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n      Relationship_to_Input: The output grid is formed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally.\n\n  - Example 3:\n    Input_Grid:\n      Dimensions: 4x4 (height x width)\n      Content: [[5, 2, 3, 0], [2, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 8, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0]]\n    Output_Grid:\n      Dimensions: 4x8 (height x width)\n      Content: [[5, 2, 3, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0], [2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 8, 8, 5, 2, 8, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]\n      Relationship_to_Input: The output grid is formed by concatenating the input grid with itself horizontally.\n\nGeneral_Observations:\n  - The height of the output grid is always the same as the height of the input grid.\n  - The width of the output grid is always exactly twice the width of the input grid.\n  - The content of the output grid is consistently the input grid repeated twice, placed side-by-side.\n```"
