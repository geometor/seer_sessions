Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Sizes:** All input grids are 9x9, and all output grids are 3x3.
2.  **Content Relationship:** The pixels in the output grid appear to be directly copied from a specific region within the input grid.
3.  **Location Identification:** By comparing the pixel values and their arrangement in the first example, the 3x3 output grid `[[0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 1], [9, 4, 0]]` corresponds precisely to the pixels in the input grid located at rows 0 through 2 and columns 6 through 8.
4.  **Consistency Check:** This location (top-right 3x3 subgrid) holds true for all four training examples. No other transformations like rotation, mirroring, or color changes are observed. The task seems to be a simple extraction or cropping operation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: extraction
input_grid:
  size: 9x9
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
transformation:
  type: subgrid_extraction
  source_region:
    rows:
      start: 0
      end: 2 # inclusive
    columns:
      start: 6
      end: 8 # inclusive
  details: The output grid is a direct copy of the pixels from the specified region in the input grid.
constraints:
  - Input grid size is constant (9x9).
  - Output grid size is constant (3x3).
  - The extraction region is fixed across all examples (top-right corner).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Select the subgrid region defined by rows 0, 1, and 2, and columns 6, 7, and 8.
3.  Create the output grid by copying the pixels from this selected region.
