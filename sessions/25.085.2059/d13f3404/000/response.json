The output grid dimensions are consistently double the input grid dimensions (height and width).\n2.  **Content Preservation:** The original pattern of non-white pixels from the input grid appears in the top-left 3x3 corner of the output grid.\n3.  **Pattern Replication:** The pattern from the input grid seems to be repeatedly copied and shifted diagonally downwards and to the right within the output grid.\n4.  **Overlap Rule:** Where shifted copies overlap, the non-white pixels seem to take precedence. A pixel in the output grid takes the color of the first non-white pixel encountered when tracing back diagonally (up-left) into the input grid coordinates corresponding to different shifts. If no non-white pixel is found along this diagonal trace back into the input grid, the output pixel remains white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new output grid, initialized with white (0) pixels, having dimensions `2H` rows and `2W` columns.\n3.  For each row `r` from 0 to `2H - 1` and each column `c` from 0 to `2W - 1` in the output grid:\n    a.  Initialize a variable `found_color` to false.\n    b.  Iterate through a shift value `k` starting from 0.\n    c.  Calculate the potential source coordinates in the input grid: `input_row = r - k`, `input_col = c - k`.\n    d.  Check if `input_row` is within the input grid height bounds (0 <= `input_row` < `H`) and `input_col` is within the input grid width bounds (0 <= `input_col` < `W`).\n    e.  If the coordinates (`input_row`, `input_col`) are valid:\n        i.   Retrieve the `color` value from the input grid at (`input_row`, `input_col`).\n        ii.

If `input_row` becomes less than 0 or `input_col` becomes less than 0 (meaning we've traced back beyond the input grid boundaries), stop iterating through `k` for the current output cell (`r`, `c`).\n    g.  If `found_color` is true after checking a value of `k`, continue to the next output cell (`r`, `c`).\n4.  Return the completed output grid."
