Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - Size: H rows x W columns (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
    - Content: Contains pixels with colors 0-9. Pixels with color 0 are considered background (white). Pixels > 0 form patterns.

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - Size: 2H rows x 2W columns (e.g., 6x6 in examples)
    - Content: Derived from the input grid. Initialized as all white (0).

Transformation:
  Action: Generate Output Grid from Input Grid
  Rule:
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the Output Grid.
    - For each Output cell (r, c), iterate through possible diagonal shifts 'k' starting from 0 upwards (k=0, 1, 2, ...).
    - Calculate potential Input Grid coordinates (ir, ic) = (r - k, c - k).
    - Check if (ir, ic) are within the bounds of the Input Grid (0 <= ir < H and 0 <= ic < W).
    - If (ir, ic) is within bounds:
      - Get the color 'input_color' at Input Grid cell (ir, ic).
      - If 'input_color' is non-white ( > 0):
        - Set the Output Grid cell (r, c) to 'input_color'.
        - Stop checking further shifts 'k' for this Output cell (r, c) and move to the next Output cell.
    - If no non-white 'input_color' is found for any valid (ir, ic) across all checked shifts 'k', the Output Grid cell (r, c) remains white (0).
