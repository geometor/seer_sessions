Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are 3x3. The output grids are 6x6. The output grid dimensions are consistently double the input grid dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Content Preservation:** The original pattern of non-white pixels from the input grid appears in the top-left 3x3 corner of the output grid.
3.  **Pattern Replication:** The pattern from the input grid seems to be repeatedly copied and shifted diagonally downwards and to the right within the output grid.
4.  **Overlap Rule:** Where shifted copies overlap, the non-white pixels seem to take precedence. A pixel in the output grid takes the color of the first non-white pixel encountered when tracing back diagonally (up-left) into the input grid coordinates corresponding to different shifts. If no non-white pixel is found along this diagonal trace back into the input grid, the output pixel remains white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - Size: H rows x W columns (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
    - Content: Contains pixels with colors 0-9. Pixels with color 0 are considered background (white). Pixels > 0 form patterns.

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - Size: 2H rows x 2W columns (e.g., 6x6 in examples)
    - Content: Derived from the input grid. Initialized as all white (0).

Transformation:
  Action: Generate Output Grid from Input Grid
  Rule:
    - Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the Output Grid.
    - For each Output cell (r, c), iterate through possible diagonal shifts 'k' starting from 0 upwards (k=0, 1, 2, ...).
    - Calculate potential Input Grid coordinates (ir, ic) = (r - k, c - k).
    - Check if (ir, ic) are within the bounds of the Input Grid (0 <= ir < H and 0 <= ic < W).
    - If (ir, ic) is within bounds:
      - Get the color 'input_color' at Input Grid cell (ir, ic).
      - If 'input_color' is non-white ( > 0):
        - Set the Output Grid cell (r, c) to 'input_color'.
        - Stop checking further shifts 'k' for this Output cell (r, c) and move to the next Output cell.
    - If no non-white 'input_color' is found for any valid (ir, ic) across all checked shifts 'k', the Output Grid cell (r, c) remains white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Define the input grid dimensions as height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid, initialized with white (0) pixels, having dimensions `2H` rows and `2W` columns.
3.  For each row `r` from 0 to `2H - 1` and each column `c` from 0 to `2W - 1` in the output grid:
    a.  Initialize a variable `found_color` to false.
    b.  Iterate through a shift value `k` starting from 0.
    c.  Calculate the potential source coordinates in the input grid: `input_row = r - k`, `input_col = c - k`.
    d.  Check if `input_row` is within the input grid height bounds (0 <= `input_row` < `H`) and `input_col` is within the input grid width bounds (0 <= `input_col` < `W`).
    e.  If the coordinates (`input_row`, `input_col`) are valid:
        i.   Retrieve the `color` value from the input grid at (`input_row`, `input_col`).
        ii.  If the `color` is not white (value > 0):
            1.  Set the value of the output grid at (`r`, `c`) to this `color`.
            2.  Set `found_color` to true.
            3.  Break out of the loop iterating through `k` (since we found the first non-white color tracing back diagonally).
    f.  If `input_row` becomes less than 0 or `input_col` becomes less than 0 (meaning we've traced back beyond the input grid boundaries), stop iterating through `k` for the current output cell (`r`, `c`).
    g.  If `found_color` is true after checking a value of `k`, continue to the next output cell (`r`, `c`).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
