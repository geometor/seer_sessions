The width is halved.\n    *   Example 2 (4x8 -> 4x4): The output is the left half of the input. The width is halved.\n    *   Example 3 (6x2 -> 3x2): The output is the top half of the input. The height is halved.\n    *   It appears the transformation involves selecting either the left half or the top half of the input grid.\n    *   The choice between selecting the left half or the top half seems to depend on the relative dimensions (height and width) of the input grid. When the width is greater than the height (examples 1 and 2), the left half is kept. When the height is greater than the width (example 3), the top half is kept.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
