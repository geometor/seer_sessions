"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
1. Find the top-leftmost pixel of the orange color (7). This is the 'seed' pixel.
2. Determine the height (H) of the vertical orange line starting downwards from the seed pixel.
3. Create an output grid of the same dimensions, initialized to white (0).
4. For each pixel (r, c) in the output grid:
   a. Calculate the Manhattan distance 'd' from the seed pixel: d = abs(r - seed_r) + abs(c - seed_c).
   b. If d < H:
      - If d is even, set the output pixel to orange (7).
      - If d is odd, set the output pixel to azure (8).
   c. Else (d >= H), leave the pixel as white (0).
