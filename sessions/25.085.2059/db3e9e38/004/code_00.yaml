Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels of various colors, including white (0) and orange (7).
  - Features a single vertical line composed of orange (7) pixels.

Output Grid:
  - Has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - Contains pixels of white (0), orange (7), and azure (8).
  - Features a diamond shape centered around a specific point.

Objects:
  - Orange Line: A contiguous vertical line of orange pixels in the input.
    - Properties:
      - Topmost pixel coordinates (seed_r, seed_c).
      - Height (H).
  - Diamond Pattern: A pattern in the output grid defined by Manhattan distance.
    - Properties:
      - Center: Same coordinates as the seed pixel (seed_r, seed_c).
      - Extent: Limited by Manhattan distance < H.
      - Color Pattern: Alternating colors based on Manhattan distance parity.

Actions:
  1. Identify: Locate the topmost, then leftmost orange pixel (seed pixel) in the input grid.
  2. Measure: Determine the height (H) of the continuous vertical orange line starting downwards from the seed pixel.
  3. Initialize: Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
  4. Calculate: For each pixel (r, c) in the grid, compute the Manhattan distance (d) from the seed pixel: d = abs(r - seed_r) + abs(c - seed_c).
  5. Condition & Color:
     - If d < H:
       - If d is even, set the output pixel at (r, c) to orange (7).
       - If d is odd, set the output pixel at (r, c) to azure (8).
     - If d >= H, the output pixel at (r, c) remains white (0).
