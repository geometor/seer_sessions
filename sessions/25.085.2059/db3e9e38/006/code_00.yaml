task_description: Generate a colored pattern based on Manhattan distance from a seed point, where the distance threshold and color alternation rule are determined by an object in the input grid.

input_features:
  - object_type: vertical_line
    color: orange (7)
    properties:
      - location: Can appear anywhere in the grid.
      - height: Variable, determines a threshold H.
      - seed_pixel: The top-most, left-most pixel of the orange line. Defined by (seed_r, seed_c).

output_features:
  - pattern_type: Manhattan distance diamond/square centered at seed_pixel.
  - colors:
      - orange (7)
      - azure (8)
      - white (0)
  - extent: Limited by the threshold H derived from the input orange line's height. Pixels with Manhattan distance `d >= H` are white.
  - color_rule: For pixels with `d < H`, the color depends on the parity of `d` and the parity of the absolute row difference `dr = abs(r - seed_r)`:
      - If `dr` is even: color is orange (7) if `d` is even, azure (8) if `d` is odd.
      - If `dr` is odd: color is azure (8) if `d` is even, orange (7) if `d` is odd.

transformation_steps:
  1. Identify the orange (7) vertical line object in the input grid.
  2. Determine the seed pixel (seed_r, seed_c) as the top-leftmost pixel of the orange line. If no orange pixel exists, the output is an all-white grid.
  3. Calculate the height (H) of the vertical orange line starting downwards from the seed pixel.
  4. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
  5. Iterate through each pixel (r, c) in the grid.
  6. Calculate the Manhattan distance `d = abs(r - seed_r) + abs(c - seed_c)`.
  7. Calculate the absolute row difference `dr = abs(r - seed_r)`.
  8. If `d < H`:
     a. Check the parity of `dr`:
        i. If `dr` is even: Set output pixel to orange (7) if `d` is even, else set to azure (8).
        ii. If `dr` is odd: Set output pixel to azure (8) if `d` is even, else set to orange (7).
     b. Else (`d >= H`): Leave the output pixel as white (0).
  9. Return the completed output grid.

constants:
  - seed_color: orange (7)
  - pattern_color_1: orange (7)
  - pattern_color_2: azure (8)
  - background_color: white (0)
