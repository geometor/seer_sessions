task_description: Compare the left and right halves of an input grid and mark common background locations.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H
    - width: W (where W = 2 * H', H' being the width of each half)
    - contains_colors: [white (0), green (3), red (2)]
  structure:
    - composed_of: two equal vertical halves (Left_Grid, Right_Grid)
    - Left_Grid:
        - dimensions: H x (W/2)
        - contains_colors: [white (0), green (3)]
    - Right_Grid:
        - dimensions: H x (W/2)
        - contains_colors: [white (0), red (2)]

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H
    - width: W/2
    - contains_colors: [white (0), gray (5)]
  derivation: Based on a positional comparison between Left_Grid and Right_Grid.

transformation_rule:
  - name: Split and Compare Background
  - steps:
      - Divide the input grid vertically into two equal halves: `Left_Grid` and `Right_Grid`.
      - Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as `Right_Grid` (or `Left_Grid`), initialized with white (0).
      - Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) within the dimensions of the halves.
      - Check if the cell at `Left_Grid[r, c]` is white (0) AND the cell at `Right_Grid[r, c]` is white (0).
      - If both conditions are true, set the corresponding cell in the output grid `Output[r, c]` to gray (5).
      - Otherwise, the output cell `Output[r, c]` remains white (0).

relationship:
  - type: Positional comparison
  - input_elements: Corresponding cells in `Left_Grid` and `Right_Grid`.
  - condition: Both cells must be white (0).
  - output_effect: The corresponding cell in the output grid becomes gray (5).
