This strongly suggests the grid is conceptually divided into two equal halves, a left half and a right half.\n2.  **Color Palette:**\n    *   Inputs use white (0), green (3), and red (2). White seems to act as a background or neutral color. Green pixels are exclusively in the left half, and red pixels are exclusively in the right half.\n    *   Outputs use only white (0) and gray (5).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid always has the same height as the input grid but exactly half the width. Its dimensions match the dimensions of either the left or the right half of the input grid (e.g., 4x7).\n4.  **Transformation Clue:** The output seems derived from a comparison or interaction between the left and right halves of the input grid. The gray pixels in the output appear at specific locations that seem related to the patterns in both input halves. Specifically, gray pixels (5) in the output appear precisely where *both* the left half and the right half of the input grid had white pixels (0) at the corresponding location. All other positions in the output are white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create two temporary grids: `Left_Grid` by taking columns 0 to W_half-1 from the input, and `Right_Grid` by taking columns W_half to W-1 from the input. Both will have dimensions H x W_half.\n4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions H x W_half, and initialize all its cells to white (0).\n5.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to H-1.\n6.  Inside the row loop, iterate through each column `c` from 0 to W_half-1.\n7.  At each position (`r`, `c`), check if the pixel value in `Left_Grid` at (`r`, `c`) is white (0) AND the pixel value in `Right_Grid` at (`r`, `c`) is also white (0).\n8.  If both pixel values are white (0), set the pixel value in the output grid at position (`r`, `c`) to gray (5).\n9.  If the condition in step 7 is not met, the output grid pixel at (`r`, `c`) remains white (0).\n10. After iterating through all positions, the resulting output grid is the final answer."
