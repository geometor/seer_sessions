"""
Split the input grid vertically into two equal halves (left and right).
Create an output grid with the dimensions of one half.
Iterate through each corresponding cell position (r, c) in the left and right halves.
If the cell in the left half at (r, c) is white (0) AND the cell in the right half at (r, c) is also white (0), set the output grid cell at (r, c) to gray (5).
Otherwise, the output grid cell remains white (0).
