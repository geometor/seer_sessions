**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** No adjacent reds. Boundary candidates: Rows 0, 3. Internal candidates: None. Expected output: Rows 0, 3 filled. Consistent with hypothesis: Fill boundary if no internal exist.
*   **Example 2:** Adjacent reds found. Expected output: Input grid. Consistent with hypothesis: Return input if adjacent reds found.
*   **Example 3:** No adjacent reds. Boundary candidates: Row 2. Internal candidates: Rows 1, 3. Expected output: Rows 1, 3 filled. Consistent with hypothesis: Fill internal if internal exist.
*   **Example 4:** Adjacent reds found. Expected output: Input grid. Consistent with hypothesis: Return input if adjacent reds found.
*   **Example 5:** No adjacent reds. Boundary candidates: Rows 0, 3. Internal candidates: Rows 1, 2. Expected output: Rows 1, 2 filled. Consistent with hypothesis: Fill internal if internal exist.

The metrics confirm the refined hypothesis.

**Final Check on Logic:**
The core idea is filling white segments between pairs of red pixels in a row. There are two conditions:
1.  Global Inhibitor: The presence of *any* horizontally adjacent red pixels (`2 2`) anywhere in the grid prevents *any* filling.
2.  Filling Rule (if no global inhibitor):
    *   Identify all rows that are potential candidates for filling (exactly 2 red pixels, only white pixels between them).
    *   Check if *any* of these candidate rows have their red pixels *within* the grid boundaries (not spanning edge-to-edge). Call these 'internal candidates'.
    *   If there are *any* internal candidates, fill *only* the internal candidates.
    *   If there are *no* internal candidates (meaning all candidates, if any, are 'boundary candidates' spanning edge-to-edge), then fill *all* the boundary candidates.

This seems robust and covers all observed cases.## General Assessment

The initial code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example but failed on examples 3 and 5. This indicates the initial hypothesis was incomplete and did not account for variations present in other examples. Specifically, the code filled segments between red pixels whenever the segment contained only white pixels, provided no adjacent red pixels existed globally. The failures suggest a more nuanced condition determines *which* segments should be filled.

The failures occurred in cases where the input grid contained *both* rows with edge-to-edge red pairs (`2 0 ... 0 2`) and rows with internal red pairs (`0 ... 2 0 ... 0 2 ... 0`). In these mixed cases (Examples 3 and 5), only the segments corresponding to the *internal* red pairs were filled in the expected output, while the code incorrectly filled *all* qualifying segments. In contrast, when *only* edge-to-edge pairs existed (Example 1), those segments *were* filled. The presence of adjacent red pixels anywhere acts as a global inhibitor, correctly handled by the previous code (Examples 2 and 4).

The strategy is to refine the transformation rule to differentiate between 'boundary' and 'internal' pairs of red pixels and apply filling selectively based on the presence of 'internal' pairs.

## Metrics

Based on the analysis and `tool_code` execution:

| Example   | Input Has Adjacent Red | Input Boundary Candidates (Rows) | Input Internal Candidates (Rows) | Expected Action                         | Previous Code Action                  | Match |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---- |
| Example 1 | False                  | [0, 3]                           | []                               | Fill Boundary Candidates (Rows 0, 3)    | Fill Boundary Candidates (Rows 0, 3)  | True  |

| Example 3 | False                  | [2]                              | [1, 3]                           | Fill Internal Candidates (Rows 1, 3)    | Fill All Candidates (Rows 1, 2, 3)  | False |
| Example 4 | True                   | []                               | []                               | No Change (Adjacent Red Found)        | No Change (Adjacent Red Found)      | True  |
| Example 5 | False                  | [0, 3]                           | [1, 2]                           | Fill Internal Candidates (Rows 1, 2)    | Fill All Candidates (Rows 0, 1, 2, 3) | False |

**Key Observations from Metrics:**

*   The `has_adjacent_red` condition acts as a primary filter. If true, no further action occurs.
*   When `has_adjacent_red` is false, the presence or absence of `internal_candidates` determines the filling strategy.
*   If `internal_candidates` exist, only they are filled.
*   If only `boundary_candidates` exist, they are filled.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Global Check:** Examine the entire input grid. If any row contains two red pixels immediately adjacent horizontally (`[..., 2, 2, ...]`), stop and output the input grid unchanged.
2.  **Identify Candidates:** If the global check passes, proceed to analyze each row independently:
    *   Find all rows containing exactly two red pixels.
    *   For each such row, check if the pixels strictly between the two red pixels are all white.
    *   Rows satisfying both conditions are "candidate rows".
3.  **Classify Candidates:** Categorize the candidate rows identified in step 2:
    *   If a candidate row's red pixels are in the first column (index 0) AND the last column (index `width-1`), it is a "boundary candidate".
    *   Otherwise (if at least one red pixel is not on the edge column), it is an "internal candidate".
4.  **Apply Filling Logic:**
    *   Determine if any "internal candidates" were found in step 3.
    *   **If internal candidates exist:** Modify the grid by filling the segment (between the two red pixels) with red *only* for the "internal candidates". Do not modify "boundary candidates".
    *   **If no internal candidates exist:** Modify the grid by filling the segment (between the two red pixels) with red for *all* "boundary candidates" (if any exist).
5.  **Output:** Output the modified grid. Rows that were not identified as candidates to be filled remain unchanged from the input.
