task_description: Fill horizontal segments between pairs of red pixels with red, subject to specific conditions.

definitions:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - row_index
      - column_index
  - name: segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels within a single row.
    properties:
      - start_column
      - end_column
      - row_index
      - pixels (list of pixel objects or values)
  - name: candidate_row
    description: A row potentially eligible for filling.
    conditions:
      - Contains exactly two red pixels (value 2).
      - The segment strictly between the two red pixels exists (i.e., red pixels are not adjacent).
      - All pixels in the segment between the two red pixels are white (value 0).
  - name: boundary_candidate_row
    description: A candidate_row where the two red pixels are at the grid boundaries.
    conditions:
      - Is a candidate_row.
      - The first red pixel is in column 0.
      - The second red pixel is in the last column (width - 1).
  - name: internal_candidate_row
    description: A candidate_row where at least one of the red pixels is not at the grid boundary.
    conditions:
      - Is a candidate_row.
      - Is NOT a boundary_candidate_row.

global_inhibitor:
  condition: The input grid contains any horizontally adjacent red pixels (2 2) in any row.
  action: If true, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

transformation_logic:
  condition: The global_inhibitor condition is false.
  steps:
    - Identify all candidate_rows in the input grid.
    - Classify candidate_rows into boundary_candidate_rows and internal_candidate_rows.
    - Check if any internal_candidate_rows exist.
    - scenario_A: # Internal candidates exist
        condition: The set of internal_candidate_rows is not empty.
        action: For each internal_candidate_row, fill the segment between its two red pixels with red (value 2). Boundary_candidate_rows remain unchanged.
    - scenario_B: # Only boundary candidates exist (or no candidates exist)
        condition: The set of internal_candidate_rows is empty.
        action: For each boundary_candidate_row, fill the segment between its two red pixels with red (value 2).
    - Keep all non-candidate rows and non-filled candidate rows unchanged.
