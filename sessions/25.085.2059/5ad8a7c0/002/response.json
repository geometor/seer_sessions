Consistent with hypothesis: Fill boundary if no internal exist.\n*   **Example 2:** Adjacent reds found. Expected output: Input grid. Consistent with hypothesis: Return input if adjacent reds found.\n*   **Example 3:** No adjacent reds. Boundary candidates: Row 2. Internal candidates: Rows 1, 3. Expected output: Rows 1, 3 filled. Consistent with hypothesis: Fill internal if internal exist.\n*   **Example 4:** Adjacent reds found. Expected output: Input grid. Consistent with hypothesis: Return input if adjacent reds found.\n*   **Example 5:** No adjacent reds. Boundary candidates: Rows 0, 3. Internal candidates: Rows 1, 2. Expected output: Rows 1, 2 filled. Consistent with hypothesis: Fill internal if internal exist.\n\nThe metrics confirm the refined hypothesis.\n\n**Final Check on Logic:**\nThe core idea is filling white segments between pairs of red pixels in a row. There are two conditions:\n1.  Global Inhibitor: The presence of *any* horizontally adjacent red pixels (`2 2`) anywhere in the grid prevents *any* filling.\n2.  Filling Rule (if no global inhibitor):\n    *   Identify all rows that are potential candidates for filling (exactly 2 red pixels, only white pixels between them).\n    *   Check if *any* of these candidate rows have their red pixels *within* the grid boundaries (not spanning edge-to-edge). Call these 'internal candidates'.\n    *   If there are *any* internal candidates, fill *only* the internal candidates.\n    *   If there are *no* internal candidates (meaning all candidates, if any, are 'boundary candidates' spanning edge-to-edge), then fill *all* the boundary candidates.\n\nThis seems robust and covers all observed cases.## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example but failed on examples 3 and 5. This indicates the initial hypothesis was incomplete and did not account for variations present in other examples. Specifically, the code filled segments between red pixels whenever the segment contained only white pixels, provided no adjacent red pixels existed globally. The failures suggest a more nuanced condition determines *which* segments should be filled.\n\nThe failures occurred in cases where the input grid contained *both* rows with edge-to-edge red pairs (`2 0 ... 0 2`) and rows with internal red pairs (`0 ... 2 0 ... 0 2 ... 0`). In these mixed cases (Examples 3 and 5), only the segments corresponding to the *internal* red pairs were filled in the expected output, while the code incorrectly filled *all* qualifying segments. In contrast, when *only* edge-to-edge pairs existed (Example 1), those segments *were* filled. The presence of adjacent red pixels anywhere acts as a global inhibitor, correctly handled by the previous code (Examples 2 and 4).\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule to differentiate between 'boundary' and 'internal' pairs of red pixels and apply filling selectively based on the presence of 'internal' pairs.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis and `tool_code` execution:\n\n| Example   | Input Has Adjacent Red | Input Boundary Candidates (Rows) | Input Internal Candidates (Rows) | Expected Action                         | Previous Code Action                  | Match |\n| :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---- |\n| Example 1 | False                  | [0, 3]                           | []                               | Fill Boundary Candidates (Rows 0, 3)    | Fill Boundary Candidates (Rows 0, 3)  | True  |\n| Example 2 | True                   | []                               | []                               | No Change (Adjacent Red Found)        | No Change (Adjacent Red Found)      | True  |\n| Example 3 | False                  | [2]                              | [1, 3]                           | Fill Internal Candidates (Rows 1, 3)    | Fill All Candidates (Rows 1, 2, 3)  | False |\n| Example 4 | True                   | []                               | []                               | No Change (Adjacent Red Found)        | No Change (Adjacent Red Found)      | True  |\n| Example 5 | False                  | [0, 3]                           | [1, 2]                           | Fill Internal Candidates (Rows 1, 2)    | Fill All Candidates (Rows 0, 1, 2, 3) | False |\n\n**Key Observations from Metrics:**\n\n*   The `has_adjacent_red` condition acts as a primary filter. If true, no further action occurs.\n*   When `has_adjacent_red` is false, the presence or absence of `internal_candidates` determines the filling strategy.\n*   If `internal_candidates` exist, only they are filled.\n*   If only `boundary_candidates` exist, they are filled.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
