If any such horizontally adjacent red pixels exist anywhere in the grid, the transformation does nothing, and the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n3.  If no horizontally adjacent red pixels are found, proceed to process each row independently.\n4.  For each row:\n    a.  Find all red pixels in the row.\n    b.
