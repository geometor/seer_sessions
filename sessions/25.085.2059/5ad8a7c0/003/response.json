If any row contains two red pixels (value 2) immediately adjacent horizontally (`[..., 2, 2, ...]`), stop and output the input grid unchanged.\n2.  **Identify Candidates:** If the global check passes, proceed to analyze each row independently:\n    *   Find all rows containing exactly two red pixels.\n    *   For each such row, check if the pixels strictly between the two red pixels are all white (value 0).\n    *   Rows satisfying both conditions are \"candidate rows\". Ensure the red pixels are not adjacent (i.e., the segment between them exists).\n3.  **Classify Candidates:** Categorize the candidate rows identified in step 2:\n    *   If a candidate row's red pixels are in the first column (index 0) AND the last column (index `width-1`), it is a \"boundary candidate\".\n    *   Otherwise (if at least one red pixel is not on the edge column), it is an \"internal candidate\".\n4.  **Apply Filling Logic:**\n    *   Determine if any \"internal candidates\" were found in step 3.\n    *   **If internal candidates exist:** Modify the grid by filling the segment (between the two red pixels) with red (value 2) *only* for the \"internal candidates\". Do not modify \"boundary candidates\".\n    *   **If no internal candidates exist:** Modify the grid by filling the segment (between the two red pixels) with red (value 2) for *all* \"boundary candidates\" (if any exist).\n5.  **Output:** Output the modified grid.
