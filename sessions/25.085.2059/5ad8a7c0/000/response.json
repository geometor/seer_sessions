            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels, primarily using white (0) and red (2). The grid dimensions appear constant within each example pair (4x6 in the provided examples), but might vary between tasks.\n2.  **Color Focus:** The transformation primarily involves the red (2) pixels. White (0) pixels might be changed to red, but red pixels never change color or disappear. No other colors are involved.\n3.  **Transformation Type:** The core transformation seems to be a \"filling\" operation. Specifically, it fills horizontal gaps between pairs of red pixels within a row, under certain conditions.\n4.  **Conditional Nature:** The filling action doesn't always occur, even when there are two red pixels in a row with white space between them (e.g., train_2, train_4). This suggests a global condition or an interaction that can inhibit the filling.\n5.  **Inhibiting Condition:** Observing train_2 and train_4 (which show no change), we see the presence of horizontally adjacent red pixels (`2 2`) somewhere in the grid (row 2 in train_2, row 0 in train_4). In the examples where filling *does* occur (train_1, train_3, train_5), there are no such adjacent red pixels. This suggests that the presence of any horizontally adjacent red pixels anywhere in the grid prevents the filling transformation.\n6.  **Filling Condition:** When the inhibiting condition is *not* met, the filling seems to occur on a row-by-row basis. A row is modified if:\n    *   It contains exactly two red pixels.\n    *   All the pixels horizontally located *between* these two red pixels are white (0).\n    *   If these conditions are met, the white pixels between the two red pixels are changed to red.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
