task_elements:
  - description: Input grid contains multiple distinct 3x3 subgrids.
    attributes:
      shape: 3x3
      composition: Contains non-white pixels (1-9) and potentially white pixels (0).
      arrangement: Can be arranged horizontally or vertically within the larger input grid.
  - description: Separators exist between 3x3 subgrids.
    attributes:
      type: Rows or columns.
      composition: Entirely composed of white pixels (0).
  - description: Output grid is a single 3x3 subgrid.
    attributes:
      shape: 3x3
      origin: Extracted directly from the input grid.
properties:
  - object: 3x3 subgrid
    property: count_non_white_pixels
    description: The number of pixels within the 3x3 subgrid that are not white (value > 0).
actions:
  - name: identify_subgrids
    description: Scan the input grid to locate all potential 3x3 subgrids, often separated by white pixel rows/columns.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list_of_3x3_subgrids
  - name: calculate_density
    description: For each identified 3x3 subgrid, calculate the count of non-white pixels.
    inputs: list_of_3x3_subgrids
    outputs: list_of_counts
  - name: select_max_density_subgrid
    description: Choose the 3x3 subgrid that has the maximum count of non-white pixels. If multiple subgrids share the maximum count, the specific selection rule isn't definitively shown by these examples but seems consistent with selecting the one found first during a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan, or potentially the last one. However, in all provided examples, there is a unique maximum.
    inputs: list_of_3x3_subgrids, list_of_counts
    outputs: selected_3x3_subgrid
relationships:
  - type: selection_criterion
    description: The output 3x3 grid corresponds to the input 3x3 subgrid possessing the highest number of non-white pixels.
