            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids vary in size (e.g., 3x15, 3x12, 12x3, 9x3). They appear to contain multiple smaller, distinct 3x3 patterns.\n2.  **Separators:** These 3x3 patterns seem to be separated from each other by columns or rows composed entirely of white pixels (0).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.\n4.  **Content Relationship:** The output 3x3 grid is always identical to one of the 3x3 patterns found within the corresponding input grid.\n5.  **Selection Criterion:** The core of the task is to determine *which* of the 3x3 patterns from the input is selected as the output. Observing the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`, the yellow pattern (6 non-white pixels) is chosen over green (5), red (4), azure (5), and blue (4).\n    *   In `train_2`, the orange pattern (6 non-white pixels) is chosen over red (4), green (4), and blue (4).\n    *   In `train_3`, the orange pattern (6 non-white pixels) is chosen over green (5), red (4), and azure (5).\n    *   In `train_4`, the azure pattern (7 non-white pixels) is chosen over magenta (6) and yellow (6).\n    *   It appears the 3x3 pattern with the highest number of non-white pixels is selected.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
