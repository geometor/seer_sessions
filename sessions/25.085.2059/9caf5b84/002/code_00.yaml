task_description: Transform the input grid by selectively keeping pixels of certain colors based on their frequency and changing all other pixels to orange (7).
grid_properties:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - The background color for replaced pixels is always orange (7).
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
frequency_analysis:
  - action: Count the occurrences of each color in the entire input grid.
  - rule: Determine the set of 'special' colors to keep based on frequency counts.
    conditions:
      - condition: Check if more than one color shares the single highest frequency count.
        true_action: The 'special' colors are only those tied for the highest frequency.
        false_action:
          - condition: Check if there are at least two distinct frequency counts.
            true_action: The 'special' colors are the unique color with the highest frequency AND all colors sharing the second highest frequency.
            false_action: The 'special' colors are just the single color with the highest frequency (applies if only one color exists or all colors have the same frequency).
transformation:
  - action: Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
  - rule:
    - If the pixel's color is in the set of 'special' colors, keep its color in the output grid.
    - Otherwise, change the pixel's color to orange (7) in the output grid.
