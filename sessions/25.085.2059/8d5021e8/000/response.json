            "text": "*   **Perception**:\n    *   The task involves transforming a small input grid (3 rows x 2 columns) into a larger output grid (9 rows x 4 columns).\n    *   The output grid's dimensions are related to the input: height is 3 times the input height, and width is 2 times the input width.\n    *   The content of the output grid appears to be derived from the input grid and its horizontal reflection.\n    *   There seems to be a tiling or repetition pattern involved.\n    *   A key observation across the examples reveals two distinct modes of transformation, potentially triggered by a property of the input grid.\n    *   In `train_1` and `train_2`, the input grids possess vertical symmetry (the first row is identical to the third row). The output grid seems to be formed by repeating a specific 3x4 block three times vertically. This block is constructed by concatenating the horizontally reflected input grid with the original input grid.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input grid lacks vertical symmetry. The output grid is still 9x4 and uses the same fundamental 3x4 block (horizontally reflected input concatenated with original input), but the vertical stacking involves permutations of the rows within this block. Specifically, it looks like a block with reversed rows, followed by the original block, followed by the reversed-row block again.\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
