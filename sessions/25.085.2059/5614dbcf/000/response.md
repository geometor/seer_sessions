Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task involves transforming a 9x9 input grid into a 3x3 output grid. This immediately suggests a partitioning of the input grid into 3x3 subgrids, where each subgrid corresponds to one pixel in the output grid.
2.  **Color Content:** The input grids contain various colored blocks (Red, Orange, Green, Azure, Magenta, Maroon) typically occupying a 3x3 area within one of the larger 3x3 partitions. There are also scattered gray pixels (color 5) and a white background (color 0).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to summarize the content of each 3x3 input subgrid into a single output pixel.
4.  **Ignoring Noise:** The gray pixels (5) appear within some colored blocks or on the white background but do not seem to influence the primary color chosen for the output pixel corresponding to that subgrid. Similarly, the white background (0) seems to be the default or "empty" state.
5.  **Rule Identification:** If a 3x3 subgrid in the input contains a color other than white (0) or gray (5), that specific color becomes the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid. If a 3x3 subgrid contains only white (0) and/or gray (5) pixels, the corresponding output pixel is white (0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  - Size: 9x9
  - Content:
    - Background: Primarily white (0)
    - Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-white, non-gray colors (e.g., Red(2), Orange(7), Green(3), Azure(8), Magenta(6), Maroon(9)), often 3x3 in size.
    - Noise: Scattered gray pixels (5), sometimes within colored blocks, sometimes on the background.

Output Grid:
  - Size: 3x3

Transformation:
  - Type: Summarization / Downsampling
  - Partitioning: Input grid is conceptually divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.
  - Mapping: Each 3x3 subgrid in the input maps to a single pixel in the output grid at the corresponding relative position (e.g., top-left subgrid maps to top-left output pixel).
  - Rule:
    - For each 3x3 input subgrid:
      - Identify all unique colors present.
      - Filter out white (0) and gray (5).
      - If one distinct color remains after filtering:
        - The corresponding output pixel takes this color.
      - If zero distinct colors remain after filtering (i.e., the subgrid contains only white and/or gray):
        - The corresponding output pixel is white (0).
  - Ignored Elements: Gray pixels (5) do not determine the output color; they are treated similarly to the white background (0) in the decision process unless no other color is present.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
2.  Iterate through the 9x9 input grid using 3x3 steps, effectively processing nine 3x3 subgrids. For each subgrid at row index `R` (0, 3, 6) and column index `C` (0, 3, 6):
    a.  Examine all 9 pixels within the subgrid defined by rows `R` to `R+2` and columns `C` to `C+2`.
    b.  Find the color(s) present in this subgrid, excluding white (0) and gray (5).
    c.  If exactly one such unique color is found, set the pixel in the output grid at row `R/3` and column `C/3` to this color.
    d.  If no such color is found (meaning the subgrid contains only white and/or gray pixels), the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains white (0).
3.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
