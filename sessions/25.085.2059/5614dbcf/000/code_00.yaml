Input Grid:
  - Size: 9x9
  - Content:
    - Background: Primarily white (0)
    - Objects: Contiguous blocks of non-white, non-gray colors (e.g., Red(2), Orange(7), Green(3), Azure(8), Magenta(6), Maroon(9)), often 3x3 in size.
    - Noise: Scattered gray pixels (5), sometimes within colored blocks, sometimes on the background.

Output Grid:
  - Size: 3x3

Transformation:
  - Type: Summarization / Downsampling
  - Partitioning: Input grid is conceptually divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.
  - Mapping: Each 3x3 subgrid in the input maps to a single pixel in the output grid at the corresponding relative position (e.g., top-left subgrid maps to top-left output pixel).
  - Rule:
    - For each 3x3 input subgrid:
      - Identify all unique colors present.
      - Filter out white (0) and gray (5).
      - If one distinct color remains after filtering:
        - The corresponding output pixel takes this color.
      - If zero distinct colors remain after filtering (i.e., the subgrid contains only white and/or gray):
        - The corresponding output pixel is white (0).
  - Ignored Elements: Gray pixels (5) do not determine the output color; they are treated similarly to the white background (0) in the decision process unless no other color is present.
