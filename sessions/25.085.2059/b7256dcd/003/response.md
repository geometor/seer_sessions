"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Identify all 'source' pixels (colors other than gray(6) and orange(7)).
2. Find all connected components of gray(6) pixels using 8-connectivity (including diagonals).
3. For each gray component, find all orthogonally adjacent (4-connectivity, sharing an edge) source pixels and their unique colors.
4. Create the output grid, initially as a copy of the input grid.
5. If a gray component is orthogonally adjacent to exactly one unique source color, change all pixels in that component to that unique source color in the output grid. Otherwise, the gray component's pixels remain gray.
6. Change all original source pixels to orange(7) in the output grid.
