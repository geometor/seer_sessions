Orange appears to be a background or neutral color. Gray seems to be a mutable color. Green, yellow, and blue act as \"source\" colors in the transformation.\n3.  **Key Transformation:** The core change involves gray pixels adopting the color of certain nearby pixels. Specifically, connected regions of gray pixels change color based on adjacent non-gray, non-orange pixels.\n4.  **Connectivity:** Adjacency, including diagonals (8-connectivity), is crucial for defining connected regions of gray and for determining which source colors influence a gray region.\n5.  **Rule Specificity:** A gray region changes color *only if* it is adjacent to exactly one *unique* type of source color (non-gray, non-orange). If a gray region touches no source colors, or touches multiple different source colors, it remains unchanged.\n6.  **Source Pixel Fate:** After the gray pixels potentially change, the original source pixels (the non-gray, non-orange ones in the input) are changed to the background color (orange).\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
