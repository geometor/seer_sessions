task_description: |
  The task involves transforming a grid by recoloring connected regions of gray pixels based on the color of nearby "source" pixels, and then changing the original source pixels to orange.

definitions:
  - name: background_color
    value: orange (7)
  - name: target_color
    value: gray (6)
  - name: source_colors
    description: All colors except gray(6) and orange(7).
    values: [blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6), azure(8), maroon(9)] # Note: magenta(6) is gray, corrected list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9]
  - name: gray_component
    description: A connected region of gray(6) pixels. Connectivity includes diagonals (8-way).
  - name: orthogonally_adjacent_source
    description: A source pixel that shares an edge (not just a corner) with any pixel belonging to a specific gray_component.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: identify_objects
    object_type: pixel
    properties: [color]
    details: Classify pixels into source_colors, target_color(gray), and background_color(orange).
  - step: 2
    action: group_objects
    object_type: pixel
    input_property: color == gray(6)
    output: gray_components
    details: Find all connected components of gray pixels using 8-way connectivity.
  - step: 3
    action: relate_objects
    input_objects: [gray_components, source_pixels]
    output: mapping from each gray_component to a set of unique colors of orthogonally_adjacent_source pixels.
    details: For each gray_component, find all source pixels sharing an edge with any pixel in the component. Collect the unique colors of these source pixels.
  - step: 4
    action: modify_properties
    object_type: gray_component
    condition: The set of unique orthogonally adjacent source colors for the component has exactly one element.
    modification: Change the color of all pixels within the gray_component to the single unique source color found in step 3.
    details: Gray components with zero or more than one unique orthogonally adjacent source color remain unchanged.
  - step: 5
    action: modify_properties
    object_type: pixel
    condition: The pixel had an original color belonging to source_colors.
    modification: Change the color of the pixel to orange(7).

output_grid:
  description: The final grid after applying all modifications. Contains original background pixels, potentially recolored gray components, unchanged gray components, and orange pixels where source pixels used to be.
