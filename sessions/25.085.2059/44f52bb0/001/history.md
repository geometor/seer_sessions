*   **Perception**: The task involves analyzing the spatial arrangement of red pixels (value 2) within an input grid. The output is always a single pixel (1x1 grid) whose color depends on the structure formed by the red pixels. The background is white (value 0).

*   **Analysis**:
    *   The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    *   The output is always a 1x1 grid containing either blue (1) or orange (7).
    *   The key seems to be identifying the red pixels and grouping them into connected components. 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) appears relevant based on the 'X' shape in example 6 forming a single object.
    *   Examples 1 and 5 have multiple disconnected groups (components) of red pixels, and both output blue (1).
    *   Examples 2, 3, 4, and 6 each have a single connected component of red pixels.
    *   Within the single-component examples, Examples 2, 3, and 4 output orange (7), while Example 6 outputs blue (1).
    *   The difference seems related to the symmetry of the single component. The shapes in Examples 2, 3, and 4 (variants of 'L' shapes) lack rotational or reflectional symmetry. The shape in Example 6 ('X' shape) possesses multiple symmetries (180-degree rotational, horizontal reflection, vertical reflection).

*   **Hypothesis**: The rule appears to be:
    1.  Identify connected components of red pixels using 8-way connectivity.
    2.  If there is more than one component, output blue (1).
    3.  If there is exactly one component, examine its symmetry (considering only the red pixels, perhaps within their minimal bounding box).
    4.  If the single component has 180-degree rotational symmetry OR horizontal reflectional symmetry OR vertical reflectional symmetry, output blue (1).
    5.  If the single component has none of these symmetries, output orange (7).

*   **YAML Facts**:

      - color: red (2)
      - color: white (0)
      - grid_dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3, 3x2)
      - pixel_arrangement: spatial patterns formed by red pixels

      - possible_colors: [blue (1), orange (7)]
    transformation_logic:

        sub_steps:
          - extract_shape: Isolate the single red component.
          - check_symmetry: Test for 180-degree rotation, horizontal reflection, vertical reflection.
          - condition: any symmetry exists
            action: output blue (1)
          - condition: no symmetry exists
            action: output orange (7)
    relevant_priors:
      - Objectness: Red pixels form objects (connected components).
      - Basic geometry & topology: Connectivity (8-way), symmetry (rotation, reflection).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Find all distinct groups of connected red pixels, considering pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same group.
    2.  Count the number of these groups (connected components).
    3.  If the number of groups is greater than one, the output is a single blue pixel.
    4.  If there is exactly one group:
        a.  Isolate the shape formed by the red pixels in this single group.
        b.  Check if this shape looks identical to itself after being rotated 180 degrees, flipped horizontally, or flipped vertically.
        c.  If the shape has any of these symmetries (it looks identical after any of these transformations), the output is a single blue pixel.
        d.  If the shape does not have any of these symmetries, the output is a single orange pixel.
