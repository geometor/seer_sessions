            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves analyzing the spatial arrangement of red pixels (value 2) within an input grid. The output is always a single pixel (1x1 grid) whose color depends on the structure formed by the red pixels. The background is white (value 0).\n\n*   **Analysis**:\n    *   The input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n    *   The output is always a 1x1 grid containing either blue (1) or orange (7).\n    *   The key seems to be identifying the red pixels and grouping them into connected components. 8-way connectivity (including diagonals) appears relevant based on the 'X' shape in example 6 forming a single object.\n    *   Examples 1 and 5 have multiple disconnected groups (components) of red pixels, and both output blue (1).\n    *   Examples 2, 3, 4, and 6 each have a single connected component of red pixels.\n    *   Within the single-component examples, Examples 2, 3, and 4 output orange (7), while Example 6 outputs blue (1).\n    *   The difference seems related to the symmetry of the single component. The shapes in Examples 2, 3, and 4 (variants of 'L' shapes) lack rotational or reflectional symmetry. The shape in Example 6 ('X' shape) possesses multiple symmetries (180-degree rotational, horizontal reflection, vertical reflection).\n\n*   **Hypothesis**: The rule appears to be:\n    1.  Identify connected components of red pixels using 8-way connectivity.\n    2.  If there is more than one component, output blue (1).\n    3.  If there is exactly one component, examine its symmetry (considering only the red pixels, perhaps within their minimal bounding box).\n    4.  If the single component has 180-degree rotational symmetry OR horizontal reflectional symmetry OR vertical reflectional symmetry, output blue (1).\n    5.  If the single component has none of these symmetries, output orange (7).\n\n*   **YAML Facts**:\n    "
