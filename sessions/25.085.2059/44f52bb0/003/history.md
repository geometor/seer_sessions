Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1. Find all distinct groups of connected red pixels (color 2) in the input grid. Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-way connectivity).
2. Count the number of these distinct groups (connected components).
3. If the number of groups is greater than one, the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single blue pixel (color 1).
4. If there is exactly one group:
    a. Isolate the shape formed by the red pixels of this single group, creating a minimal bounding box representation where red pixels are 2 and others are 0.
    b. Check if this isolated shape possesses any of the following symmetries:
        i. 180-degree rotational symmetry (looks the same when rotated 180 degrees).
        ii. Horizontal reflectional symmetry (looks the same when flipped top-to-bottom).
        iii. Vertical reflectional symmetry (looks the same when flipped left-to-right).
    c. If the shape has at least one of these symmetries, the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single blue pixel (color 1).
    d. If the shape has none of these symmetries, the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single orange pixel (color 7).

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.

**General Assessment**

The previous code successfully identified the number of connected components of red pixels (color 2) using 8-way connectivity. The rule for multiple components (>1) resulting in a blue output (color 1) worked correctly for Examples 1 and 5.

The discrepancy occurred in Example 2, where a single red component was present. The initial hypothesis was that *any* symmetry (180 rotational, horizontal, or vertical) in the single component's shape would lead to a blue output. Example 2's shape *does* have 180 rotational symmetry, but the expected output is orange (color 7). This contradicts the initial hypothesis.

By comparing Example 2 (180 symmetry only, expected orange) with Example 6 (180, horizontal, *and* vertical symmetry, expected blue), and Examples 3 & 4 (no symmetry, expected orange), a refined pattern emerges:

- If there is more than one red component, the output is blue (1).
- If there is exactly one red component:
    - If its shape has horizontal *or* vertical reflectional symmetry, the output is blue (1).
    - If its shape lacks both horizontal and vertical symmetry (regardless of 180 rotational symmetry), the output is orange (7).

This revised logic successfully explains all training examples. The strategy will be to update the natural language program and subsequently the code to reflect this focus on horizontal and vertical symmetry for the single-component case.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's gather metrics for each example based on the refined logic. We need component count and, for single components, the presence of horizontal (H) or vertical (V) symmetry.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Components**: Find all distinct groups of connected red pixels (color 2) in the input grid. Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors (8-way connectivity).
2.  **Count Components**: Count the number of these distinct red groups.
3.  **Determine Output based on Count and Symmetry**:
    *   If the number of red components is **greater than one**, the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single **blue** pixel (color 1).
    *   If the number of red components is **exactly one**:
        *   Isolate the shape formed by the red pixels of this single component within its minimal bounding box.
        *   Check if this isolated shape has **horizontal reflectional symmetry** (looks the same when flipped top-to-bottom).
        *   Check if this isolated shape has **vertical reflectional symmetry** (looks the same when flipped left-to-right).
        *   If the shape possesses **either** horizontal **or** vertical symmetry (or both), the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single **blue** pixel (color 1).
        *   If the shape possesses **neither** horizontal **nor** vertical symmetry, the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single **orange** pixel (color 7).
    *   If the number of red components is **zero**, the output is a 1x1 grid containing a single **blue** pixel (color 1). (This handles cases not present in the examples, assuming a default behavior consistent with the multi-component rule).
4.  **Produce Output**: Create the 1x1 output grid with the determined color.
