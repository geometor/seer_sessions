Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 6x6, while the output grids are consistently 5x5. This indicates a transformation involving a size reduction or selection.
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as a background and azure (8) to form shapes or patterns.
3.  **Content:** The azure pixels (8) form various configurations within the input grids. The arrangement of these azure pixels seems crucial.
4.  **Output Patterns:** Observing the outputs reveals only two distinct 5x5 patterns across all examples:
    *   **Pattern A (Examples 1, 2):**
        
```
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

    *   **Pattern B (Examples 3, 4, 5):**
        
```
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation does not seem to be a simple cropping or direct manipulation of the input pixels based on position alone. Instead, a property derived from the input grid determines which of the two predefined output patterns is generated.
6.  **Key Property - Bounding Box Width:** By examining the input grids, we can identify the non-white (azure) pixels and calculate the dimensions of the smallest bounding box that encloses all of them.
    *   For inputs 1 and 2, the width of this bounding box (the horizontal extent of azure pixels) is 6 columns. These inputs correspond to Output Pattern A.
    *   For inputs 3, 4, and 5, the width of this bounding box is 5 columns. These inputs correspond to Output Pattern B.
7.  **Hypothesis:** The rule appears to be: calculate the width of the bounding box containing all non-white (azure) pixels in the input. If the width is 6, produce Pattern A. If the width is 5, produce Pattern B.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Define two constant 5x5 grids: `Pattern_A` and `Pattern_B`.
    *   `Pattern_A` is:
        
```
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        8 8 0 8 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

    *   `Pattern_B` is:
        
```
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 8
        8 8 0 8 8
        ```

2.  Receive the input 6x6 grid.
3.  Identify the locations (row and column indices) of all pixels that are not white (i.e., pixels with color 8, azure).
4.  If no non-white pixels are found, the behavior is undefined by the examples (assume this won't happen based on training data, or default to one pattern, e.g., Pattern_B as it corresponds to a potentially smaller width).
5.  Determine the minimum and maximum row index (`min_row`, `max_row`) and the minimum and maximum column index (`min_col`, `max_col`) among the locations found in step 3. This defines the bounding box of the non-white pixels.
6.  Calculate the width of the bounding box: `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
7.  If the calculated `width` is 6, the output is `Pattern_A`.
8.  If the calculated `width` is 5, the output is `Pattern_B`.
9.  Return the selected pattern as the final output grid.
