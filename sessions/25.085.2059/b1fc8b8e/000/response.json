This indicates a transformation involving a size reduction or selection.\n2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use white (0) as a background and azure (8) to form shapes or patterns.\n3.  **Content:** The azure pixels (8) form various configurations within the input grids. The arrangement of these azure pixels seems crucial.\n4.  **Output Patterns:** Observing the outputs reveals only two distinct 5x5 patterns across all examples:\n    *   **Pattern A (Examples 1, 2):**\n        "

Instead, a property derived from the input grid determines which of the two predefined output patterns is generated.\n6.  **Key Property - Bounding Box Width:** By examining the input grids, we can identify the non-white (azure) pixels and calculate the dimensions of the smallest bounding box that encloses all of them.\n    *   For inputs 1 and 2, the width of this bounding box (the horizontal extent of azure pixels) is 6 columns. These inputs correspond to Output Pattern A.\n    *   For inputs 3, 4, and 5, the width of this bounding box is 5 columns. These inputs correspond to Output Pattern B.\n7.  **Hypothesis:** The rule appears to be: calculate the width of the bounding box containing all non-white (azure) pixels in the input. If the width is 6, produce Pattern A. If the width is 5, produce Pattern B.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
