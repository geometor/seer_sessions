Okay, let's analyze the task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Grids:** All examples show a 3x3 input grid and a 6x3 output grid.
*   **Color Palette:** Various colors are used (orange, maroon, gray, blue, yellow, red, green, azure). The background color (white) is not used.
*   **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be formed by taking the input grid and appending a vertically mirrored version of the input grid below it.
*   **Structure:** The output grid's height is exactly double the input grid's height, while the width remains the same. The top half of the output grid is identical to the input grid. The bottom half of the output grid is the input grid flipped along its horizontal midline.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Vertically mirror and append the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - description: Input Grid
    attributes:
      height: H
      width: W
  - description: Output Grid
    attributes:
      height: 2 * H
      width: W
transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: Copy Input Grid
    destination: Top half of Output Grid (rows 0 to H-1)
  - step: 2
    action: Vertically Flip Input Grid
    source: Input Grid
    result: Flipped Grid
  - step: 3
    action: Copy Flipped Grid
    source: Flipped Grid
    destination: Bottom half of Output Grid (rows H to 2*H-1)
relationship: The Output Grid is the Input Grid stacked above its own vertical reflection.
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    description: The entire input grid treated as a single entity.
  - id: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after transformation.
  - id: flipped_input
    description: The input grid after being vertically flipped.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define the input grid.
2.  Create an output grid with the same width as the input grid but twice the height.
3.  Copy the contents of the input grid into the top half of the output grid.
4.  Generate a vertically mirrored version of the input grid (the last row becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on).
5.  Copy the contents of the vertically mirrored input grid into the bottom half of the output grid.
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
