The background color (white) is not used.\n*   **Transformation:** The output grid appears to be formed by taking the input grid and appending a vertically mirrored version of the input grid below it.\n*   **Structure:** The output grid's height is exactly double the input grid's height, while the width remains the same. The top half of the output grid is identical to the input grid. The bottom half of the output grid is the input grid flipped along its horizontal midline.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
