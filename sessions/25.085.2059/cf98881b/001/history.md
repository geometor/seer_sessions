Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 14 columns. The output grids are always 4 rows by 4 columns.
2.  **Key Colors:** The colors red (2), white (0), yellow (4), blue (1), and maroon (9) are prominent. Red seems to play a structural role in the input.
3.  **Input Structure:** In all input examples, there are two vertical lines composed entirely of red pixels (color 2). These lines are located at column index 4 and column index 9.
4.  **Dividing Role:** These red lines appear to act as delimiters, effectively dividing the 4x14 input grid into three main 4x4 sections (excluding the red lines themselves):
    *   Section 1: Columns 0-3
    *   Section 2: Columns 5-8
    *   Section 3: Columns 10-13
5.  **Transformation:** The 4x4 output grid seems to be a composite image formed by combining information from the three 4x4 sections identified in the input. The combination process involves selecting a single color for each position (row, column) based on the colors present at that same position within the three input sections.
6.  **Selection Logic:** By comparing the input sections and the output cell-by-cell, a priority emerges. If the cell at (row, col) in Section 1 is non-white, its color is used in the output. If it *is* white, the color from the corresponding cell in Section 2 is checked; if Section 2's cell is non-white, its color is used. If both Section 1 and Section 2 cells are white, the color from the corresponding cell in Section 3 is used, regardless of whether it's white or not. This suggests a prioritized overlay: Section 1 on top, then Section 2, then Section 3.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: [4, 14]
  - contains_delimiters: true
  - delimiter_type: vertical_line
  - delimiter_color: red (2)
  - delimiter_positions:
      - column_index: 4
      - column_index: 9

Output Grid Properties:
  - dimensions: [4, 4]

Derived Objects (Input):
  - name: Section 1
    type: subgrid
    location: columns 0-3
    dimensions: [4, 4]
  - name: Section 2
    type: subgrid
    location: columns 5-8
    dimensions: [4, 4]
  - name: Section 3
    type: subgrid
    location: columns 10-13
    dimensions: [4, 4]

Transformation:
  - name: Prioritized Overlay
  - inputs: [Section 1, Section 2, Section 3]
  - output: Output Grid
  - process: For each cell position (row, column) from (0,0) to (3,3):
      - Get color_1 from Section 1 at (row, column).
      - Get color_2 from Section 2 at (row, column).
      - Get color_3 from Section 3 at (row, column).
      - Determine output_color based on priority:
          - If color_1 is not white (0), output_color is color_1.
          - Else if color_2 is not white (0), output_color is color_2.
          - Else, output_color is color_3.
      - Place output_color into the Output Grid at (row, column).

Relationships:
  - The red vertical lines in the input define the boundaries for extracting Section 1, Section 2, and Section 3.
  - The output grid dimensions match the dimensions of the extracted sections.
  - Each cell in the output grid corresponds directly to a cell at the same (row, column) index within each of the three input sections.
  - There is a clear priority order (Section 1 > Section 2 > Section 3) for selecting the non-white pixel to contribute to the output cell.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the vertical red lines (color 2) in the input grid. Assume these occur at fixed column indices 4 and 9.
2.  Extract three 4x4 subgrids from the input grid:
    *   `Section 1`: The subgrid covering rows 0-3 and columns 0-3.
    *   `Section 2`: The subgrid covering rows 0-3 and columns 5-8.
    *   `Section 3`: The subgrid covering rows 0-3 and columns 10-13.
3.  Create a new 4x4 grid, initialized with white (0) pixels, to serve as the output grid.
4.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `3`.
5.  For the current position (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Check the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in `Section 1`.
    b.  If this color is *not* white (0), assign this color to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
    c.  If the color in `Section 1` *is* white (0), then check the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in `Section 2`.
    d.  If the color in `Section 2` is *not* white (0), assign this color to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
    e.  If the colors in both `Section 1` and `Section 2` *are* white (0), then assign the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in `Section 3` to the output grid at position (`r`, `c`).
6.  Return the completed 4x4 output grid.
