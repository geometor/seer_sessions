            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 14 columns. The output grids are always 4 rows by 4 columns.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The colors red (2), white (0), yellow (4), blue (1), and maroon (9) are prominent. Red seems to play a structural role in the input.\n3.  **Input Structure:** In all input examples, there are two vertical lines composed entirely of red pixels (color 2). These lines are located at column index 4 and column index 9.\n4.  **Dividing Role:** These red lines appear to act as delimiters, effectively dividing the 4x14 input grid into three main 4x4 sections (excluding the red lines themselves):\n    *   Section 1: Columns 0-3\n    *   Section 2: Columns 5-8\n    *   Section 3: Columns 10-13\n5.  **Transformation:** The 4x4 output grid seems to be a composite image formed by combining information from the three 4x4 sections identified in the input. The combination process involves selecting a single color for each position (row, column) based on the colors present at that same position within the three input sections.\n6.  **Selection Logic:** By comparing the input sections and the output cell-by-cell, a priority emerges. If the cell at (row, col) in Section 1 is non-white, its color is used in the output. If it *is* white, the color from the corresponding cell in Section 2 is checked; if Section 2's cell is non-white, its color is used. If both Section 1 and Section 2 cells are white, the color from the corresponding cell in Section 3 is used, regardless of whether it's white or not. This suggests a prioritized overlay: Section 1 on top, then Section 2, then Section 3.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new 4x4 grid, initialized with white (0) pixels, to serve as the output grid.\n4.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r=0` to `3` and `c=0` to `3`.\n5.  For the current position (`r`, `c`):\n    a.  Check the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in `Section 1`.\n    b.
