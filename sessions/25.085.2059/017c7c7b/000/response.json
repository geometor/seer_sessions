The width remains the same.\n    *   The output grid appears to be constructed by first taking the entire input grid (with colors changed) and then appending the top half of that modified grid to its bottom. In the examples, the input height is 6, so the top half is the first 3 rows. These top 3 rows (after color change) are appended below the original 6 rows (after color change) to form the 9-row output.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
