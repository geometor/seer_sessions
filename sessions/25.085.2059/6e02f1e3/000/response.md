Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 3x3.
2.  **Input Colors:** The input grids contain pixels of green (3), yellow (4), and red (2). White (0) is not present in the inputs.
3.  **Output Colors:** The output grids contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
4.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid consistently has exactly three gray (5) pixels and six white (0) pixels.
5.  **Pattern Variation:** The arrangement of the three gray pixels in the output changes based on the input grid's color composition.
    *   **Monochromatic Inputs:** When the input grid consists of only one color (e.g., all green in `train_1`, all yellow in `train_3`), the output grid has its top row filled with gray (5) and the remaining cells are white (0).
    *   **Multi-color Inputs:** When the input grid contains multiple distinct colors, the output grid displays a diagonal pattern of gray (5) pixels.
        *   If the input contains exactly *two* distinct non-white colors (e.g., yellow and green in `train_4`, red and green in `train_5`), the output has gray pixels along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
        *   If the input contains exactly *three* distinct non-white colors (green, yellow, and red in `train_2`), the output has gray pixels along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).

**Facts YAML:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Identify all unique pixel color values present in the input grid, ignoring white (0) if it were present.
3.  Count the number of these unique non-white colors. Let this count be `N`.
4.  Initialize a new 3x3 output grid, filling it entirely with white (0) pixels.
5.  Based on the value of `N`:
    *   If `N` is 1: Change the color of the pixels in the first row (row index 0) of the output grid to gray (5).
    *   If `N` is 2: Change the color of the pixels along the main diagonal (where row index equals column index: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)) of the output grid to gray (5).
    *   If `N` is 3: Change the color of the pixels along the anti-diagonal (where row index + column index equals 2: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)) of the output grid to gray (5).
6.  Return the generated 3x3 output grid.
