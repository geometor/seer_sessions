White (0) is not present in the inputs.\n3.  **Output Colors:** The output grids contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels.\n4.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid consistently has exactly three gray (5) pixels and six white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Pattern Variation:** The arrangement of the three gray pixels in the output changes based on the input grid's color composition.\n    *   **Monochromatic Inputs:** When the input grid consists of only one color (e.g., all green in `train_1`, all yellow in `train_3`), the output grid has its top row filled with gray (5) and the remaining cells are white (0).\n    *   **Multi-color Inputs:** When the input grid contains multiple distinct colors, the output grid displays a diagonal pattern of gray (5) pixels.\n        *   If the input contains exactly *two* distinct non-white colors (e.g., yellow and green in `train_4`, red and green in `train_5`), the output has gray pixels along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n        *   If the input contains exactly *three* distinct non-white colors (green, yellow, and red in `train_2`), the output has gray pixels along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
