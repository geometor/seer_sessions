task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  size_relation: input and output grids have identical dimensions
  color_palette: integers 0-9, with 0 (white) acting as a background/empty state
transformation_scope: column-wise, independent for each column
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: column
    properties:
      - contains pixels
      - index
actions:
  - name: find_topmost_non_white_pixel
    inputs: column
    outputs:
      - color of the pixel (if found)
      - row index of the pixel (if found)
      - flag indicating if found
  - name: fill_downwards
    inputs:
      - column index
      - starting row index
      - fill color
      - grid height
    outputs: modified column segment
relationships:
  - type: vertical_adjacency
    description: Pixels within the same column are vertically adjacent.
  - type: propagation
    description: The color of the topmost non-white pixel in a column propagates downwards to fill cells below it in the output grid.
rule_logic:
  - For each column, identify the first non-white pixel encountered scanning from top to bottom.
  - If a non-white pixel is found, its color is used.
  - All pixels in that column, starting from the row where the first non-white pixel was found down to the last row, are set to that color in the output grid.
  - If a column contains only white pixels, it remains unchanged in the output grid.
