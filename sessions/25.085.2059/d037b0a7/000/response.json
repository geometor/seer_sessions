White (0) seems to act as a background or empty space. Other colors (red, orange, azure, magenta, yellow, green) are present.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to operate column by column. Within each column, there's a downward propagation or filling effect.\n4.  **Source Pixels:** The non-white pixels in the input seem to act as the source of color for the filling process.\n5.  **Filling Logic:** In each column, the color of the *topmost* non-white pixel seems to determine the color used for filling downwards. All pixels below this topmost non-white pixel (including itself if it was originally white, but that doesn't happen in the examples) are filled with that color down to the bottom of the grid.\n6.  **Empty Columns:** If a column contains only white pixels, it remains unchanged (as seen implicitly in train_3, column 2).\n7.  **Overwriting:** The filling process overwrites existing white pixels and potentially other non-white pixels if they are below the topmost non-white pixel in that column (though the latter case isn't explicitly shown, the logic implies it).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
