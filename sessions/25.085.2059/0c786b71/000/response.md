Okay, let's analyze the provided task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grids in all examples have dimensions 3x4. The corresponding output grids have dimensions 6x8. This suggests the output grid's height and width are double the input grid's height and width, respectively.
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be composed of four copies (quadrants) of the input grid, each potentially transformed. Each quadrant has the same dimensions as the original input grid (3x4).
3.  **Transformations:** By comparing the input grid to each quadrant of the output grid, we can identify the transformations:
    *   **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant seems to be the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically (rotated 180 degrees).
    *   **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant appears to be the input grid flipped vertically.
    *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant appears to be the input grid flipped horizontally.
    *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant appears to be the original input grid, untransformed.
4.  **Color Preservation:** The colors (pixel values) present in the input are the only colors present in the output. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed or replaced. The transformation only rearranges the existing pixels.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern of doubling dimensions and arranging flipped/original versions of the input grid into four quadrants holds true for all three training examples provided.

## Facts


```yaml
InputGrid:
  - Property: Dimensions
    Value: Height H, Width W (e.g., 3x4 in examples)
  - Property: Content
    Value: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9)
OutputGrid:
  - Property: Dimensions
    Value: Height 2*H, Width 2*W (e.g., 6x8 in examples)
  - Property: Structure
    Value: Composed of four quadrants, each of size HxW.
Relationships:
  - Quadrant: Top-Left (Rows 0 to H-1, Cols 0 to W-1)
    Source: InputGrid
    Action: Flipped Horizontally AND Flipped Vertically
  - Quadrant: Top-Right (Rows 0 to H-1, Cols W to 2*W-1)
    Source: InputGrid
    Action: Flipped Vertically
  - Quadrant: Bottom-Left (Rows H to 2*H-1, Cols 0 to W-1)
    Source: InputGrid
    Action: Flipped Horizontally
  - Quadrant: Bottom-Right (Rows H to 2*H-1, Cols W to 2*W-1)
    Source: InputGrid
    Action: Copied (No Transformation)

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 2\*H and width 2\*W.
3.  Generate four transformed versions of the input grid:
    a.  `original`: The input grid itself.
    b.  `h_flipped`: The input grid flipped horizontally (left becomes right, right becomes left).
    c.  `v_flipped`: The input grid flipped vertically (top becomes bottom, bottom becomes top).
    d.  `hv_flipped`: The input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically.
4.  Place these transformed grids into the output grid as follows:
    a.  Copy `hv_flipped` into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    b.  Copy `v_flipped` into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2\*W-1).
    c.  Copy `h_flipped` into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2\*H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    d.  Copy `original` into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2\*H-1, columns W to 2\*W-1).
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
