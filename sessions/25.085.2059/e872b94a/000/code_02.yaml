elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - contains pixels of different colors (white=0, gray=5)
  - type: object
    definition: A contiguous region of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      - connectivity: Pixels are considered part of the same object if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-way adjacency).
  - type: count
    description: The number of distinct gray objects in the input grid.

transformation:
  - input: grid (contains white and gray pixels)
  - process:
    - step: Identify all distinct gray objects using 8-way adjacency.
    - step: Count the number of identified gray objects (let this be N).
    - step: Determine the output grid dimensions: height = N + 1, width = 1.
  - output: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height = N + 1, width = 1
      - content: all pixels are white (0)
