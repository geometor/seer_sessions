facts:
  - grid: represents the input and output state as a 2D array of pixels.
  - colors: pixels have colors, specifically white (0) and gray (5) are used in the input. The output only uses white (0).
  - objects: contiguous regions of gray pixels form objects.
  - adjacency: connectivity between gray pixels is defined by 8-way adjacency (including diagonals).
  - count: the number of distinct gray objects is a key property.
  - output_dimensions: the output grid is always a single column (width 1).
  - output_height_rule: the height of the output column is determined by the number of gray objects in the input.
  - relationship: output_height = count(gray_objects) + 1.
