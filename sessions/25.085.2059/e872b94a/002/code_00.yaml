task_description: Transforms an input grid based on the count of distinct gray objects within it.
observations:
  - The input grid contains pixels of various colors.
  - The focus is on objects composed of contiguous gray (5) pixels.
  - Connectivity for defining objects appears to be 8-way (including diagonals), based on the analysis matching the expected outputs.
  - Let N be the number of distinct gray objects found using 8-way connectivity.
  - The output grid is always a single column (width = 1).
  - The height of the output grid is consistently N + 1.
  - All pixels in the output grid are white (0).
input_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (colors).
  - gray_objects: Contiguous groups of pixels with value 5.
    - property: count (N) - determined using 8-way connectivity.
output_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers (colors).
    - property: shape - (N + 1, 1) where N is the count of 8-way connected gray objects in the input.
    - property: color - All pixels are white (0).
actions:
  - identify_objects: Find all distinct groups of contiguous gray (5) pixels in the input grid, using 8-way adjacency.
  - count_objects: Determine the total number (N) of these gray objects.
  - construct_output: Create a new grid with dimensions (N + 1) rows and 1 column.
  - fill_output: Set all pixels in the newly created output grid to white (0).
