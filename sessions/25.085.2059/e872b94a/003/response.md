Identify all distinct objects formed by contiguous gray (5) pixels in the input grid, using 8-way adjacency (including diagonals). Count the total number of these objects (N). Create an output grid as a single column (width 1) with a height equal to N + 1. Fill all pixels in the output grid with the white (0) color.
