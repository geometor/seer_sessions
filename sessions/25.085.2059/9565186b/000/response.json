            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All examples use 3x3 grids for both input and output.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved across examples are red (2), azure (8), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), and gray (5). White (0) is not present. Gray (5) only appears in the output grids.\n3.  **Input-Output Comparison:**\n    *   In every example, some pixels change from their input color to gray (5) in the output.\n    *   Azure (8) pixels *always* change to gray (5).\n    *   Other pixels *sometimes* change to gray (5).\n    *   Some pixels *always* remain unchanged.\n4.  **Identifying the Unchanged Pixels:**\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Example 2: Blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged.\n    *   Example 4: Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.\n5.  **Pattern Hypothesis:** It seems the grid has a 'dominant' or 'background' color that is preserved. All other colors, including azure (8), are replaced by gray (5). Let's test how this 'dominant' color might be determined.\n    *   Example 1: Input `2 2 2 / 8 8 2 / 2 2 2`. Colors: Red (6 times), Azure (2 times). Red is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Red.\n    *   Example 2: Input `1 1 1 / 8 1 3 / 8 2 2`. Colors: Blue (4 times), Azure (2 times), Green (1 time), Red (2 times). Blue is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Blue.\n    *   Example 3: Input `3 3 8 / 4 4 4 / 8 1 1`. Colors: Green (2 times), Azure (2 times), Yellow (3 times), Blue (2 times). Yellow is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Yellow.\n    *   Example 4: Input `2 2 2 / 2 1 8 / 2 8 8`. Colors: Red (5 times), Blue (1 time), Azure (3 times). Red is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Red.\n6.  **Refined Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the most frequent color in the input grid, *excluding* azure (8) and white (0). This color is designated as the 'preserved color'. The output grid is generated by keeping all pixels of the 'preserved color' and changing all other pixels to gray (5).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
