Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Size:** All examples use 3x3 grids for both input and output.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved across examples are red (2), azure (8), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), and gray (5). White (0) is not present. Gray (5) only appears in the output grids.
3.  **Input-Output Comparison:**
    *   In every example, some pixels change from their input color to gray (5) in the output.
    *   Azure (8) pixels *always* change to gray (5).
    *   Other pixels *sometimes* change to gray (5).
    *   Some pixels *always* remain unchanged.
4.  **Identifying the Unchanged Pixels:**
    *   Example 1: Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.
    *   Example 2: Blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged.
    *   Example 4: Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.
5.  **Pattern Hypothesis:** It seems the grid has a 'dominant' or 'background' color that is preserved. All other colors, including azure (8), are replaced by gray (5). Let's test how this 'dominant' color might be determined.
    *   Example 1: Input `2 2 2 / 8 8 2 / 2 2 2`. Colors: Red (6 times), Azure (2 times). Red is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Red.
    *   Example 2: Input `1 1 1 / 8 1 3 / 8 2 2`. Colors: Blue (4 times), Azure (2 times), Green (1 time), Red (2 times). Blue is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Blue.
    *   Example 3: Input `3 3 8 / 4 4 4 / 8 1 1`. Colors: Green (2 times), Azure (2 times), Yellow (3 times), Blue (2 times). Yellow is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Yellow.
    *   Example 4: Input `2 2 2 / 2 1 8 / 2 8 8`. Colors: Red (5 times), Blue (1 time), Azure (3 times). Red is most frequent (excluding Azure). Output preserves Red.
6.  **Refined Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the most frequent color in the input grid, *excluding* azure (8) and white (0). This color is designated as the 'preserved color'. The output grid is generated by keeping all pixels of the 'preserved color' and changing all other pixels to gray (5).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  size: constant (3x3 in examples)
  colors_present_input: variable, includes red(2), blue(1), green(3), yellow(4), azure(8)
  colors_present_output: variable, includes gray(5) and one other color from the input.
objects:
  - type: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer value 0-9
transformation_rule:
  - action: identify_frequency
    target: all pixels in the input grid
    filter: exclude colors azure(8) and white(0)
    result: find the color with the highest frequency (let's call it 'preserved_color')
  - action: generate_output_grid
    based_on: input_grid
    details: |
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
      If the pixel color matches the 'preserved_color', keep it.
      Otherwise, change the pixel color to gray(5).
relationship:
  - input pixel color frequency (excluding azure and white) determines which color is preserved in the output. All other pixels become gray.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input grid and count the occurrences of each color, ignoring any azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
2.  Identify the color that appears most frequently among the counted colors. This is the 'preserved color'.
3.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the color of the cell matches the 'preserved color', copy that color to the corresponding cell in the new grid.
    *   If the color of the cell does *not* match the 'preserved color', set the color of the corresponding cell in the new grid to gray (5).
5.  The new grid is the output.
