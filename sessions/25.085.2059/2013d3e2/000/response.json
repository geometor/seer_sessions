            "text": "Okay, let's break down the perception and logic for this task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 10x10 grids containing mostly white pixels (0) and a central, non-contiguous pattern of various colored pixels. In `train_1`, there are also two isolated blue pixels (1).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are smaller 3x3 grids containing a portion of the pattern from the input grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve locating a specific region within the input grid and extracting a fixed-size (3x3) subgrid from that location.\n4.  **Key Feature:** The crucial part is identifying the correct starting point (top-left corner) for the 3x3 extraction. In `train_1`, the extraction starts at `(1, 1)`, which is the location of the top-leftmost non-white pixel (a blue pixel). In `train_2`, the extraction starts at `(2, 2)`.\n5.  **General Observation:** Observing both examples, the extraction point seems related to the overall placement of the non-white pixels. Calculating the bounding box containing all non-white pixels reveals that the top-left corner of this bounding box corresponds precisely to the starting point for the 3x3 extraction in both cases.\n    *   `train_1`: Non-white pixels span rows 1-6 and columns 1-6. The bounding box top-left is `(1, 1)`.\n    *   `train_2`: Non-white pixels span rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. The bounding box top-left is `(2, 2)`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
