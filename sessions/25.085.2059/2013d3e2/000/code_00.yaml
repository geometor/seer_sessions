input_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
    properties:
      - size: variable (10x10 in examples)
      - background_color: white (0)
      - foreground_elements:
          - type: collection of pixels
            description: Pixels with color values > 0.
            properties:
              - spatial_distribution: concentrated in a region, sometimes with outliers.
output_features:
  - type: grid
    description: A smaller 2D grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - size: fixed (3x3)
      - content: a subgrid copied from the input grid.
transformation:
  - action: locate_region
    inputs: input_grid
    criteria:
      - description: Find the minimum bounding box encompassing all non-white pixels.
      - details: Determine the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column that contain at least one non-white pixel.
    outputs:
      - top_left_coordinate: (min_row, min_col) of the bounding box.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - top_left_coordinate
    parameters:
      - subgrid_size: 3x3
    outputs: output_grid
    description: Copy the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid starting at the identified top_left_coordinate.
relationships:
  - The output grid's content and position are solely determined by the spatial distribution of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - The top-left corner of the output grid corresponds to the top-left corner of the bounding box containing all non-white pixels in the input grid.
