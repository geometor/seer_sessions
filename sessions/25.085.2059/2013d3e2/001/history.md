Okay, let's break down the perception and logic for this task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are 10x10 grids containing mostly white pixels (0) and a central, non-contiguous pattern of various colored pixels. In `train_1`, there are also two isolated blue pixels (1).
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are smaller 3x3 grids containing a portion of the pattern from the input grid.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve locating a specific region within the input grid and extracting a fixed-size (3x3) subgrid from that location.
4.  **Key Feature:** The crucial part is identifying the correct starting point (top-left corner) for the 3x3 extraction. In `train_1`, the extraction starts at `(1, 1)`, which is the location of the top-leftmost non-white pixel (a blue pixel). In `train_2`, the extraction starts at `(2, 2)`.
5.  **General Observation:** Observing both examples, the extraction point seems related to the overall placement of the non-white pixels. Calculating the bounding box containing all non-white pixels reveals that the top-left corner of this bounding box corresponds precisely to the starting point for the 3x3 extraction in both cases.
    *   `train_1`: Non-white pixels span rows 1-6 and columns 1-6. The bounding box top-left is `(1, 1)`.
    *   `train_2`: Non-white pixels span rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. The bounding box top-left is `(2, 2)`.

relationships:
  - The output grid's content and position are solely determined by the spatial distribution of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - The top-left corner of the output grid corresponds to the top-left corner of the bounding box containing all non-white pixels in the input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color value is not 0).
2.  Determine the coordinates (row and column indices) of the top-leftmost position occupied by any of these non-white pixels. This involves finding the minimum row index (`min_row`) and the minimum column index (`min_col`) among all non-white pixels.
3.  Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid starting at the determined top-left coordinate (`min_row`, `min_col`).
4.  The extracted 3x3 subgrid is the output grid.
