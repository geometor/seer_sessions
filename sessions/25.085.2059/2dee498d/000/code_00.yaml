task_type: pattern_extraction
input_properties:
  - description: Input grid is composed of three identical subgrids concatenated horizontally.
  - grid_height: H
  - grid_width: W_in
output_properties:
  - description: Output grid is the leftmost subgrid from the input.
  - grid_height: H
  - grid_width: W_out
relationships:
  - W_out = W_in / 3
  - H_out = H_in
  - The output grid corresponds to the columns 0 to (W_out - 1) of the input grid.
objects:
  - type: subgrid
    description: The basic repeating unit within the input grid.
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W_in / 3
    count: 3 (concatenated horizontally in the input)
actions:
  - name: identify_repeating_unit_width
    description: Calculate the width of the repeating subgrid by dividing the input width by 3.
  - name: extract_leftmost_unit
    description: Select the portion of the input grid corresponding to the first (leftmost) repeating unit.
    inputs: input_grid, unit_width
