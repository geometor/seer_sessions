The output grids are also rectangular and have the same height as their corresponding input grids, but are narrower.\n2.  **Content Repetition:** In each example, the input grid appears to be composed of a smaller pattern (a subgrid) that is repeated horizontally exactly three times.\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid in each case is identical to the leftmost subgrid found in the input.\n4.  **Dimensional Relationship:** The width of the output grid is exactly one-third of the width of the input grid.
