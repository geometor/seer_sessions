## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All input grids are rectangular. The output grids are also rectangular and have the same height as their corresponding input grids, but are narrower.
2.  **Content Repetition:** In each example, the input grid appears to be composed of a smaller pattern (a subgrid) that is repeated horizontally exactly three times.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid in each case is identical to the leftmost subgrid found in the input.
4.  **Dimensional Relationship:** The width of the output grid is exactly one-third of the width of the input grid. The height remains unchanged.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: pattern_extraction
input_properties:
  - description: Input grid is composed of three identical subgrids concatenated horizontally.
  - grid_height: H
  - grid_width: W_in
output_properties:
  - description: Output grid is the leftmost subgrid from the input.
  - grid_height: H
  - grid_width: W_out
relationships:
  - W_out = W_in / 3
  - H_out = H_in
  - The output grid corresponds to the columns 0 to (W_out - 1) of the input grid.
objects:
  - type: subgrid
    description: The basic repeating unit within the input grid.
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W_in / 3
    count: 3 (concatenated horizontally in the input)
actions:
  - name: identify_repeating_unit_width
    description: Calculate the width of the repeating subgrid by dividing the input width by 3.
  - name: extract_leftmost_unit
    description: Select the portion of the input grid corresponding to the first (leftmost) repeating unit.
    inputs: input_grid, unit_width
    outputs: output_grid
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W_in) of the input grid.
2.  Calculate the width of the repeating subgrid (W_out) by dividing the input width (W_in) by 3.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions H by W_out.
4.  Copy the pixels from the input grid, specifically from row 0 to H-1 and column 0 to W_out-1, into the new output grid.
5.  The resulting grid is the output.
