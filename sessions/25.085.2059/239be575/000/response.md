Okay, let's analyze this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input:** The input is a grid containing pixels of three colors: white (0), red (2), and azure (8).
2.  **Output:** The output is a single pixel value, either white (0) or azure (8).
3.  **Objects:** The significant elements appear to be contiguous blocks (objects) of red pixels and contiguous blocks of azure pixels. The white pixels seem to act as background or separators. In the examples, the red objects are often 2x2 squares, usually two of them per grid. The azure objects vary in shape and size.
4.  **Relationship:** The output value (0 or 8) seems to depend on the spatial relationship between the azure objects and the red objects. Specifically, it appears related to whether a *single* azure object manages to connect or touch *all* the red objects present in the grid.
5.  **Adjacency:** The crucial factor seems to be whether an azure object is adjacent (sharing a side or corner - Moore neighborhood) to pixels belonging to *all* distinct red objects.
6.  **Transformation Goal:** The task asks us to determine if there's a single azure "bridge" or "connector" object that touches every red object. If such a connector exists, the output is azure (8); otherwise, it's white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
Colors:
  - Background: White (0)
  - Object1_Type: Red (2)
  - Object2_Type: Azure (8)
  - Output_Value: White (0) or Azure (8)

Objects:
  - Type: Red_Object
    Description: Contiguous block of red (2) pixels.
    Quantity: Variable (often 2 in examples).
    Shape: Variable (often 2x2 squares in examples).
  - Type: Azure_Object
    Description: Contiguous block of azure (8) pixels.
    Quantity: Variable.
    Shape: Variable.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Defined as pixels sharing a side or a corner (Moore neighborhood).
  - Core_Condition: Whether a single Azure_Object is adjacent to pixels belonging to *every* distinct Red_Object present in the input grid.

Transformation:
  - Rule: If the Core_Condition is met (a single Azure_Object touches all Red_Objects), the output is Azure (8).
  - Rule: Otherwise (no single Azure_Object touches all Red_Objects), the output is White (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify all distinct contiguous groups of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Call these the "Red Objects".
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Call these the "Azure Objects".
3.  If there are no Red Objects, the output is white (0).
4.  Iterate through each Azure Object found in step 2.
5.  For the current Azure Object, check if it is adjacent (shares a side or corner) to at least one pixel from *every* Red Object identified in step 1.
6.  If an Azure Object is found that satisfies the condition in step 5, the transformation result is azure (8). Stop checking and output 8.
7.  If, after checking all Azure Objects, none satisfy the condition in step 5, the transformation result is white (0). Output 0.
