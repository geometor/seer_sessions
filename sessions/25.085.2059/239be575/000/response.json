The white pixels seem to act as background or separators. In the examples, the red objects are often 2x2 squares, usually two of them per grid. The azure objects vary in shape and size.\n4.  **Relationship:** The output value (0 or 8) seems to depend on the spatial relationship between the azure objects and the red objects. Specifically, it appears related to whether a *single* azure object manages to connect or touch *all* the red objects present in the grid.\n5.  **Adjacency:** The crucial factor seems to be whether an azure object is adjacent (sharing a side or corner - Moore neighborhood) to pixels belonging to *all* distinct red objects.\n6.  **Transformation Goal:** The task asks us to determine if there's a single azure \"bridge\" or \"connector\" object that touches every red object. If such a connector exists, the output is azure (8); otherwise, it's white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
