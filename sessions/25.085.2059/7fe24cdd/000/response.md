Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size Transformation**: The input grid is always 3x3, and the output grid is always 6x6. The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.
2.  **Output Structure**: The 6x6 output grid appears to be composed of four 3x3 subgrids arranged in a 2x2 pattern.
3.  **Subgrid Relationship to Input**: Each of the four 3x3 subgrids in the output is a transformed version of the original 3x3 input grid.
    *   The **top-left** subgrid is identical to the input grid.
    *   The **top-right** subgrid appears to be the input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The **bottom-left** subgrid appears to be the input grid rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise).
    *   The **bottom-right** subgrid appears to be the input grid rotated 180 degrees.
4.  **Consistency**: This pattern of composing the output grid from four rotations of the input grid holds true across all three provided examples.

**Facts**

task_context:
  - description: The task transforms a smaller input grid into a larger output grid by arranging rotated copies of the input.
  - input_grid_size: H x W (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
  - output_grid_size: 2H x 2W (e.g., 6x6 in examples)

transformation_details:
  - operation: Create a 2x2 arrangement of transformed input grids to form the output.
  - quadrants:
      - quadrant: Top-Left (TL)
        position: Rows 0 to H-1, Columns 0 to W-1
        source: Input grid
        action: No transformation (Identity or 0-degree rotation)
      - quadrant: Top-Right (TR)
        position: Rows 0 to H-1, Columns W to 2W-1
        source: Input grid

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W.
3.  **Populate the Top-Left Quadrant**: Copy the input grid directly into the output grid's top-left section (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
4.  **Populate the Top-Right Quadrant**: Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. Place this rotated grid into the output grid's top-right section (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
5.  **Populate the Bottom-Left Quadrant**: Rotate the input grid 270 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise). Place this rotated grid into the output grid's bottom-left section (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
6.  **Populate the Bottom-Right Quadrant**: Rotate the input grid 180 degrees. Place this rotated grid into the output grid's bottom-right section (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
7.  Return the completed 2H x 2W output grid.
