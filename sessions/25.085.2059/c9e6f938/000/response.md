*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid.
    *   All examples show input grids being transformed into output grids that are the same height but exactly twice the width.
    *   The left half of the output grid is consistently identical to the input grid.
    *   The right half of the output grid appears to be a horizontal reflection (mirror image across a vertical axis) of the left half (or equivalently, of the input grid).
    *   The transformation seems independent of the specific colors or shapes present; it's a geometric operation on the grid structure itself.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: geometric_transformation
    transformation: horizontal_reflection_concatenation
    grid_properties:
      - input_dimensions: H x W (variable)
      - output_dimensions: H x (2 * W)
    content_mapping:
      - rule: Output grid columns 0 to W-1 are identical to the input grid columns 0 to W-1.
      - rule: Output grid columns W to (2*W)-1 are a horizontal reflection of the input grid columns 0 to W-1.
      - detail: For a pixel at input[row][col], the corresponding pixels in the output are output[row][col] and output[row][(2*W - 1) - col].

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with height H and width (2 * W).
    3.  Iterate through each row (from 0 to H-1) and column (from 0 to W-1) of the input grid.
    4.  For each input pixel at `(row, col)`, copy its value to two locations in the output grid:
        a.  `output[row][col]` (preserving the original position in the left half).
        b.  `output[row][(2 * W - 1) - col]` (placing it in the reflected position in the right half).
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
