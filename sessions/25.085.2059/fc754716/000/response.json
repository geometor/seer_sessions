The corresponding output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The transformation involves using the color of the single non-white pixel from the input to draw a border around the output grid. The interior of the output grid (excluding the border) is filled with white pixels. The original position of the non-white pixel in the input does not seem relevant to the final output structure, only its color matters.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
