"""
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify the azure (8) vertical segment in the input grid. Note its column index (`col_idx`).
3. Identify the red (2) horizontal segment in the input grid. Note its row index (`row_idx`).
4. Modify the output grid: For the row `row_idx`, change all pixels across the entire width to red (2).
5. Modify the output grid: For the column `col_idx`, clear it first. Then, starting from row 0, place the azure vertical segment (height 2), skip the next row (leaving it white), place the segment again, skip a row, and repeat this pattern until the bottom of the grid is reached. Overwrite existing pixels during this process.
6. Finally, change the color of the pixel at the coordinate (`row_idx`, `col_idx`) in the output grid to yellow (4).
