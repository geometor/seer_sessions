*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids contain two distinct non-white objects: a short vertical azure (8) line and a short horizontal red (2) line.
    *   The background is white (0).
    *   In the output grids, both lines are extended or replicated.
    *   The azure vertical line is replicated down its column, maintaining its height (2 pixels) and leaving a one-pixel white gap between copies. This replication fills the column's height.
    *   The red horizontal line is extended across the entire width of the grid, maintaining its row position.
    *   A new yellow (4) pixel appears in the output grid. This yellow pixel is located at the intersection of the row containing the extended red line and the column containing the replicated azure lines.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the azure (8) vertical segment in the input grid. Note its column index (`col_idx`) and height (which appears to be consistently 2).
    3.  Identify the red (2) horizontal segment in the input grid. Note its row index (`row_idx`).
    4.  Modify the output grid: For the row `row_idx`, change all pixels across the entire width to red (2).
    5.  Modify the output grid: For the column `col_idx`, starting from row 0, place the azure vertical segment (height 2), skip the next row (leaving it or making it white), place the segment again, skip a row, and repeat this pattern until the bottom of the grid is reached. Overwrite existing pixels during this process.
    6.  Finally, change the color of the pixel at the coordinate (`row_idx`, `col_idx`) in the output grid to yellow (4).
