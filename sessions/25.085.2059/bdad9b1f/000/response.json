This replication fills the column's height.\n    *   The red horizontal line is extended across the entire width of the grid, maintaining its row position.\n    *   A new yellow (4) pixel appears in the output grid. This yellow pixel is located at the intersection of the row containing the extended red line and the column containing the replicated azure lines.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Modify the output grid: For the row `row_idx`, change all pixels across the entire width to red (2).\n    5.  Modify the output grid: For the column `col_idx`, starting from row 0, place the azure vertical segment (height 2), skip the next row (leaving it or making it white), place the segment again, skip a row, and repeat this pattern until the bottom of the grid is reached. Overwrite existing pixels during this process.\n    6.  Finally, change the color of the pixel at the coordinate (`row_idx`, `col_idx`) in the output grid to yellow (4)."
