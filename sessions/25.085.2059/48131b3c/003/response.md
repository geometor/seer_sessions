"""
Transforms an input grid according to the following rules:
1. Identifies the single non-white color (C) in the input grid.
2. Creates an intermediate 'tile_grid' of the same dimensions (H x W) as the input.
3. Handles the first two rows:
    - If H >= 2, swaps the first two rows (index 0 and 1) from the input and places them into the 'tile_grid' (input row 1 -> tile row 0, input row 0 -> tile row 1).
    - If H == 1, copies the single input row to the 'tile_grid'.
4. For rows from index 2 onwards in the input grid:
    - Copies them to the corresponding rows in 'tile_grid', but inverts the colors:
        - Pixels with the dominant color C become white (0).
        - White pixels (0) become the dominant color C.
5. Creates the final output grid, which is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
6. Tiles the 'tile_grid' into the output grid in a 2x2 pattern.
