White pixels (color 0) are sometimes preserved and sometimes replaced by the primary non-white color.\n3.  **Structure:** The output grid appears to be a 2x2 tiling of a transformed version of the input grid.\n4.  **Transformation Details:**\n    *   The transformation involves row manipulation.\n    *   The first two rows of the input grid seem to be swapped in the intermediate (tile) grid.\n    *   Rows from the third row onwards in the input are modified: all white pixels (0) in these rows are replaced by the single non-white color present in the input grid. Non-white pixels in these rows remain unchanged.\n    *   This modified grid (let's call it the 'tile grid') has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    *   The final output is created by tiling this 'tile grid' two times horizontally and two times vertically.\n5.  **Color Identification:** Each input grid contains only white (0) and one other color. This single non-white color is used for the replacement operation.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
