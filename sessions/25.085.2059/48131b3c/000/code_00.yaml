task_description: "Transforms an input grid by creating a modified version and tiling it 2x2."
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - colors: contains white (0) and exactly one other non-white color (C)
      - dimensions: H rows, W columns
  - object: intermediate_grid (tile_grid)
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: H rows, W columns (same as input)
    derivation:
      - step: "Swap the first two rows of the input grid."
        - target: intermediate_grid row 0 receives input_grid row 1
        - target: intermediate_grid row 1 receives input_grid row 0
      - step: "Modify subsequent rows (from index 2 onwards)."
        - for_each: row `i` from 2 to H-1
          - source: input_grid row `i`
          - action: "Replace all white (0) pixels with the non-white color C."
          - action: "Keep all non-white pixels unchanged."
          - target: intermediate_grid row `i`
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - dimensions: 2H rows, 2W columns
    derivation:
      - step: "Tile the intermediate_grid 2x2."
        - placement:
          - top-left quadrant: intermediate_grid
          - top-right quadrant: intermediate_grid
          - bottom-left quadrant: intermediate_grid
          - bottom-right quadrant: intermediate_grid
