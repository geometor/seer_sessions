Data:
  - Grid: Input grid (H x W).
  - Grid: Output grid (2H x 2W).
  - Grid: Intermediate tile grid (H x W).

Properties:
  - Input grid contains only white (0) and one other dominant color (C).
  - Output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - Output grid is formed by tiling the intermediate grid 2x2.

Objects:
  - Pixels: Individual cells in the grids.
  - Rows: Horizontal lines of pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify: Find the dominant color (C) in the input grid.
  - Create: Generate an intermediate tile grid of the same size as the input.
  - Modify (Rows 0 & 1):
    - If input H >= 2: Swap input row 0 and input row 1 into tile grid rows 1 and 0, respectively.
    - If input H == 1: Copy input row 0 to tile grid row 0.
  - Modify (Rows i >= 2):
    - For each pixel `p` at `(i, j)` in the input grid (where `i >= 2`):
      - If `p == C`, set `tile_grid[i, j] = 0`.
      - If `p == 0`, set `tile_grid[i, j] = C`.
  - Tile: Arrange the intermediate tile grid in a 2x2 pattern to form the final output grid.
