The size varies between examples but remains consistent within each example pair.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are orange (7), red (2), and gray (5). Orange acts as a background color.\n3.  **Input Pattern:** In all examples, the input grid has a specific structure:\n    *   The top row (row 0) contains a sequence of orange, red, and gray pixels.\n    *   All subsequent rows are initially filled entirely with orange pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the grid iteratively, row by row, starting from the second row (row 1).\n    *   The top row (row 0) remains unchanged in the output.\n    *   Pixels in rows below the top row can change from orange to red or gray.\n    *   The change in a pixel at `(row r+1, col c)` depends on the colors of two specific pixels in the row directly above it (`row r`).\n5.  **Rule Identification:** The core logic appears to be a local rule applied iteratively:\n    *   Consider a cell at `(r+1, c)`. Its new state depends on the cells at `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` in the row above.\n    *   If both `grid[r, c-1]` and `grid[r, c+1]` are non-orange (i.e., red (2) or gray (5)), the cell `grid[r+1, c]` changes color based on the specific combination of the two pixels above and offset.\n    *   The specific color change rules observed are:\n        *   Red (2) and Red (2) -> Gray (5)\n        *   Gray (5) and Gray (5) -> Red (2)\n        *   Gray (5) and Red (2) -> Red (2)\n        *   Red (2) and Gray (5) -> Gray (5)\n    *   This rule is applied sequentially to generate row 1 from row 0, then row 2 from the generated row 1, and so on, until the bottom of the grid is reached.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
