Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of pixels. The size varies between examples but remains consistent within each example pair.
2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are orange (7), red (2), and gray (5). Orange acts as a background color.
3.  **Input Pattern:** In all examples, the input grid has a specific structure:
    *   The top row (row 0) contains a sequence of orange, red, and gray pixels.
    *   All subsequent rows are initially filled entirely with orange pixels.
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation modifies the grid iteratively, row by row, starting from the second row (row 1).
    *   The top row (row 0) remains unchanged in the output.
    *   Pixels in rows below the top row can change from orange to red or gray.
    *   The change in a pixel at `(row r+1, col c)` depends on the colors of two specific pixels in the row directly above it (`row r`).
5.  **Rule Identification:** The core logic appears to be a local rule applied iteratively:
    *   Consider a cell at `(r+1, c)`. Its new state depends on the cells at `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` in the row above.
    *   If both `grid[r, c-1]` and `grid[r, c+1]` are non-orange (i.e., red (2) or gray (5)), the cell `grid[r+1, c]` changes color based on the specific combination of the two pixels above and offset.
    *   The specific color change rules observed are:
        *   Red (2) and Red (2) -> Gray (5)
        *   Gray (5) and Gray (5) -> Red (2)
        *   Gray (5) and Red (2) -> Red (2)
        *   Red (2) and Gray (5) -> Gray (5)
    *   This rule is applied sequentially to generate row 1 from row 0, then row 2 from the generated row 1, and so on, until the bottom of the grid is reached.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: Variable (3 to 5 in examples)
      - width: Variable (5 to 9 in examples)
      - pixels: Cells containing color values (0-9).
  - object: background
    description: The default color filling most of the grid initially.
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
  - object: pattern_row
    description: The first row (row 0) of the input grid.
    properties:
      - content: A sequence of orange (7), red (2), and gray (5) pixels.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: active_pixels
    description: Pixels with red (2) or gray (5) color.
    properties:
      - color: red (2) or gray (5)
      - role: Determine changes in the row below.

actions:
  - action: propagate_change
    description: Modifying the color of a pixel based on the row above it.
    conditions:
      - The pixel is not in the first row (r > 0).
      - The two pixels in the row above, offset by one column left and right (grid[r-1, c-1] and grid[r-1, c+1]), are both 'active_pixels' (red or gray).
    effects:
      - The pixel at (r, c) changes color based on a specific rule applied to the pair of active pixels above it.
      - The grid is updated row by row, with changes in row `r` calculated based on the state of row `r-1`.

relationships:
  - relationship: dependency
    description: The color of a pixel at (r, c) for r > 0 potentially depends on the colors of pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1).
    rule: |
      Input Pair ((r-1, c-1), (r-1, c+1)) | Output Color at (r, c)
      ------------------------------------|-------------------------
      (red, red)                          | gray
      (gray, gray)                        | red
      (gray, red)                         | red
      (red, gray)                         | gray
      (any other combination)             | (no change - remains orange or previous state)

process:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Iterate row by row, from r = 1 to height - 1.
  - step: For each cell (r, c) in the current row:
      - Check the colors of cells (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) (handling boundary conditions implicitly, as only non-orange pairs trigger changes, and boundaries are orange).
      - If both are non-orange (red or gray), determine the new color for cell (r, c) using the defined relationship rules.
      - Update the cell (r, c) in the output grid with the new color.
  - step: After iterating through all relevant rows, the final output grid is complete.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  Create a result grid, initially identical to the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` of the grid, starting from row 1 up to the last row (`height - 1`).
4.  For each column `c` in the current row `r` (from column 1 to `width - 2` to allow checking neighbors `c-1` and `c+1`):
    a.  Get the color `ColorLeft` from the cell directly above and one column to the left: `grid[r-1, c-1]`.
    b.  Get the color `ColorRight` from the cell directly above and one column to the right: `grid[r-1, c+1]`.
    c.  Check if both `ColorLeft` and `ColorRight` are non-orange (i.e.,
