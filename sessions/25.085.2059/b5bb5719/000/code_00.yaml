elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
    properties:
      - height: Variable (3 to 5 in examples)
      - width: Variable (5 to 9 in examples)
      - pixels: Cells containing color values (0-9).
  - object: background
    description: The default color filling most of the grid initially.
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
  - object: pattern_row
    description: The first row (row 0) of the input grid.
    properties:
      - content: A sequence of orange (7), red (2), and gray (5) pixels.
      - state: Remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: active_pixels
    description: Pixels with red (2) or gray (5) color.
    properties:
      - color: red (2) or gray (5)
      - role: Determine changes in the row below.

actions:
  - action: propagate_change
    description: Modifying the color of a pixel based on the row above it.
    conditions:
      - The pixel is not in the first row (r > 0).
      - The two pixels in the row above, offset by one column left and right (grid[r-1, c-1] and grid[r-1, c+1]), are both 'active_pixels' (red or gray).
    effects:
      - The pixel at (r, c) changes color based on a specific rule applied to the pair of active pixels above it.
      - The grid is updated row by row, with changes in row `r` calculated based on the state of row `r-1`.

relationships:
  - relationship: dependency
    description: The color of a pixel at (r, c) for r > 0 potentially depends on the colors of pixels at (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1).
    rule: |
      Input Pair ((r-1, c-1), (r-1, c+1)) | Output Color at (r, c)
      ------------------------------------|-------------------------
      (red, red)                          | gray
      (gray, gray)                        | red
      (gray, red)                         | red
      (red, gray)                         | gray
      (any other combination)             | (no change - remains orange or previous state)

process:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Iterate row by row, from r = 1 to height - 1.
  - step: For each cell (r, c) in the current row:
      - Check the colors of cells (r-1, c-1) and (r-1, c+1) (handling boundary conditions implicitly, as only non-orange pairs trigger changes, and boundaries are orange).
      - If both are non-orange (red or gray), determine the new color for cell (r, c) using the defined relationship rules.
      - Update the cell (r, c) in the output grid with the new color.
  - step: After iterating through all relevant rows, the final output grid is complete.
