    description: Pixels are organized into rows and columns within a grid.
  - type: selection
    description: Pixels located in the middle column are selected.
    criteria:
      - column_index == floor(grid_width / 2)
actions:
  - name: identify_middle_column
    inputs: grid_width
    outputs: middle_column_index
  - name: create_output_grid
    inputs: input_grid_dimensions
    initial_state: filled with white (0)
  - name: copy_column_pixels
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    condition: pixel is in the middle column
    effect: Corresponding pixel in the output grid takes the color of the input pixel.
transformation_logic:
  - The transformation isolates the content of the middle vertical column of the input grid.
  - All pixels outside this middle column are changed to the background color (white, 0).
  - Pixels within the middle column retain their original colors.
