Okay, here's the analysis of the provided task example.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5 in this example).
2.  **Color Preservation/Removal:** Some colors from the input grid persist in the output grid, while others are removed (replaced by white, color 0). The background color (white, 0) remains white.
3.  **Spatial Pattern:** Observing the positions of the pixels that remain in the output grid compared to the input grid:
    *   Input (0, 2) = Green (3) -> Output (0, 2) = Green (3)
    *   Input (1, 2) = Gray (5) -> Output (1, 2) = Gray (5)
    *   Input (2, 2) = Green (3) -> Output (2, 2) = Green (3)
    *   Input (4, 2) = Maroon (9) -> Output (4, 2) = Maroon (9)
    All these preserved pixels are located in the 3rd column (index 2).
4.  **Column Focus:** All non-white pixels *not* in the 3rd column of the input grid are replaced with white (0) in the output grid. Pixels *in* the 3rd column retain their original color.
5.  **Generalization:** The 3rd column is the exact middle column for a 5-wide grid. The rule appears to isolate the middle column, preserving its contents and making everything else white.

  - name: identify_middle_column

  - name: copy_column_pixels
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    condition: pixel is in the middle column
    effect: Corresponding pixel in the output grid takes the color of the input pixel.
transformation_logic:
  - The transformation isolates the content of the middle vertical column of the input grid.
  - All pixels outside this middle column are changed to the background color (white, 0).
  - Pixels within the middle column retain their original colors.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid.
2.  Determine the width of the input grid.
3.  Calculate the index of the middle column by taking the floor of the width divided by 2.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same height and width as the input grid, initializing all its pixels to white (0).
5.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from row index 0 to height - 1.
6.  For each row index `r`, get the color of the pixel in the input grid at position (`r`, `middle_column_index`).
7.  Set the pixel at position (`r`, `middle_column_index`) in the output grid to this retrieved color.
8.  Return the final output grid.
