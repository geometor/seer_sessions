The background color (white, 0) remains white.\n3.  **Spatial Pattern:** Observing the positions of the pixels that remain in the output grid compared to the input grid:\n    *   Input (0, 2) = Green (3) -> Output (0, 2) = Green (3)\n    *   Input (1, 2) = Gray (5) -> Output (1, 2) = Gray (5)\n    *   Input (2, 2) = Green (3) -> Output (2, 2) = Green (3)\n    *   Input (4, 2) = Maroon (9) -> Output (4, 2) = Maroon (9)\n    All these preserved pixels are located in the 3rd column (index 2).\n4.  **Column Focus:** All non-white pixels *not* in the 3rd column of the input grid are replaced with white (0) in the output grid. Pixels *in* the 3rd column retain their original color.\n5.  **Generalization:** The 3rd column is the exact middle column for a 5-wide grid. The rule appears to isolate the middle column, preserving its contents and making everything else white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
