Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle. The remaining cells are white (color 0), forming the background.\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The two azure rectangles remain unchanged in their position and shape in the output grid.\n\n3. **Place Blue next to objects:** \n    For the azure object on the left side of the grid, a new single blue cell (color 1) is generated adjacent to the object right border, in the middle of the object y axis.\n    For the azure object on the right side, a new single blue cell (color 1) is generated adjacent to the object left border, in the middle of the object y axis.\n\n4. **Background remains:** The rest of the background color is unchanged.\n\n**Step-by-step transformation:**\n\n1.  Copy the two azure rectangles from the input to the output grid.\n2.  Locate the azure rectangle on the left. Add a blue cell to its immediate right in the middle of the object height.\n3.  Locate the azure rectangle on the right. Add a blue cell to its immediate left in the middle of the object height.\n4.  The white background remains the same.\n"
