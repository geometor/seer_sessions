Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
      position: 
        - One rectangle at (row 1, col 1) and (row 2, col 1)
        - One rectangle at (row 3, col 4) and (row 4, col 4)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid

  output_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles
      position: Same as in the input
        - One rectangle at (row 1, col 1) and (row 2, col 1)
        - One rectangle at (row 3, col 4) and (row 4, col 4)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: two single cells.
      position:
        - One cell at (row 1, col 2) directly to the right of the first azure rectangle
        - One cell at (row 4, col 5) directly to the left of the second azure rectangle
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid

```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct azure (color 8) objects. Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle. The remaining cells are white (color 0), forming the background.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The two azure rectangles remain unchanged in their position and shape in the output grid.

3. **Place Blue next to objects:** 
    For the azure object on the left side of the grid, a new single blue cell (color 1) is generated adjacent to the object right border, in the middle of the object y axis.
    For the azure object on the right side, a new single blue cell (color 1) is generated adjacent to the object left border, in the middle of the object y axis.

4. **Background remains:** The rest of the background color is unchanged.

**Step-by-step transformation:**

1.  Copy the two azure rectangles from the input to the output grid.
2.  Locate the azure rectangle on the left. Add a blue cell to its immediate right in the middle of the object height.
3.  Locate the azure rectangle on the right. Add a blue cell to its immediate left in the middle of the object height.
4.  The white background remains the same.

```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the two azure (color 8) 2x1 vertical rectangles in the input grid.
2. Preserve these rectangles in the output grid without any changes.
3. For the left azure rectangle, add a blue (color 1) cell immediately to its right,
    in the middle of the object height.
4. For the right azure rectangle, add a blue (color 1) cell immediately to its left,
    in the middle of the object height.
5. The rest of the grid (background color 0) remains unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: three separate objects
      position:
        - A 2x2 square at (row 2, col 2) and (row 3, col 2), (row 2, col 3) and (row 3, col 3)
        - A 2x1 vertical rectangle at (row 0, col 4) and (row 1, col 4)
        - A 1x2 horizontal rectangle at (row 5, col 4) and (row 5, col 5)
    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid

  output_objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: three separate objects.
      position: Same as input
        - A 2x2 square at (row 2, col 2) and (row 3, col 2), (row 2, col 3) and (row 3, col 3)
        - A 2x1 vertical rectangle at (row 0, col 4) and (row 1, col 4)
        - A 1x2 horizontal rectangle at (row 5, col 4) and (row 5, col 5)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: three single cells
      position:
        - One cell at (row 2, col 3) adjacent to the left of the top right azure rectangle
        - One cell at (row 1, col 5) adjacent to the top right azure rectangle
        - One cell at (row 5, col 3) adjacent to the top right azure square

    - color: 0 (white)
      shape: background
      position: fills the entire grid
```

**Natural Language Description of Transformation Rule:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input, there are three azure (color 8) objects: a 2x2 square, a 2x1 vertical rectangle, and a 1x2 horizontal rectangle. The rest is white background (color 0).

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The three azure objects are copied to the output grid without changes in shape or position.

3.  **Place Blue next to objects:**
    *   For each azure object, a blue cell is placed directly next to it.
    *   If the object is on the left side, the blue pixel is added to the right side, in the middle of the object height.
    *   If the object is on the right side, the blue pixel is added to the left side, in the middle of the object height.

4.  **Background remains:** The rest of the background is unchanged.

**Step-by-step transformation (Summarized):**
1.  Copy azure objects.
2.  Add a blue cell next to the azure objects depending on their relative position.
3. The white background remains the same.

The provided Python code correctly implements this logic by:
1. Copying the input to the output grid.
2. Finding each object in the input grid.
3. Determining their position.
4. Placing the blue pixel depending on the object's relative position in the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
