The locations are different.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Preserve the azure (color 8) L-shaped objects in their original positions.\n    *   Change the color of one pixel of each object from azure (8) to blue (1):\n        * The right-most pixel of the first object.\n        * The bottom-most pixel for the second object.\n        * The top-most pixel of the third object.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's the program in natural language:\n\n1.  Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n2.  Identify the approximately L-shaped azure objects.\n3.  For the first L-shaped object, change the color of its right-most pixel to blue (1).\n4.  For the second L-shaped object, change the color of its bottom-most pixel to blue (1).\n5.  For the third L-shaped object, change the color of its top-most pixel to blue (1).\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nCopies the input grid to the output grid, then finds three specific L-shaped azure objects and modifies them.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_l_shapes(grid, color):\n    # helper function for finding objects (same as before)\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def is_valid(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= y < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(x, y, current_object):\n        if not is_valid(x, y) or visited[x, y] or grid[x, y] != color:\n            return\n\n        visited[x, y] = True\n        current_object.append((x, y))\n\n        dfs(x + 1, y, current_object)\n        dfs(x - 1, y, current_object)\n        dfs(x, y + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(x, y - 1, current_object)\n\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[x, y] == color and not visited[x, y]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(x, y, current_object)\n                # check for approximate shape and size\n                if 3 <= len(current_object) <= 5:\n                    objects.append(current_object)\n\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rule.\"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    l_shapes = find_l_shapes(output_grid, 8)\n\n    if len(l_shapes) >= 3:\n        # Process the first L-shape (right-most)\n        first_l_shape = l_shapes[0]\n        rightmost_pixel = max(first_l_shape, key=lambda p: p[1])\n        output_grid[rightmost_pixel] = 1\n\n        # Process the second L-shape (bottom-most)\n        second_l_shape = l_shapes[1]\n        bottommost_pixel = max(second_l_shape, key=lambda p: p[0])\n        output_grid[bottommost_pixel] = 1\n\n        # Process the third L-shape (top-most)\n        third_l_shape = l_shapes[2]\n        topmost_pixel = min(third_l_shape, key=lambda p: p[0])  # Use min for top-most\n        output_grid[topmost_pixel] = 1\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThe code uses the same object finding logic. The main difference is the addition of the `topmost_pixel` logic, and ensuring there are at least three L-shaped objects before attempting to modify the third one. The `min` function is used, as smaller row indices are closer to the top of the grid.\n"
