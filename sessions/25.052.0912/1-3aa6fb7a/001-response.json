One is a regular \"L\" shape, and the other is a reversed \"L\".\n\n2.  **Locate Change:** We need to find where within each L-shaped object a blue pixel is inserted. Examining positions (1,2) for first L-shaped object and (4,5) for the second one, we find that these match the right-most and bottom-most pixel location of the L-shaped objects.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Preserve the two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects in their original positions.\n    *   Change the color of the right-most pixel of first azure L-shape from azure (8) to blue (1).\n    *   Change the color of the bottom-most pixel of second azure L-shape from azure (8) to blue (1).\n\n**Natural Language Program**\nHere is the program in natural language:\n1. Copy the input to the output.\n2. For the first L-shaped azure object in the top-left quadrant of the grid:\n   - Find the right-most cell occupied by that object.\n   - Change the color of that cell from 8 to 1.\n\n3. For the second L-shaped azure object in the bottom-right quadrant:\n   - Find the bottom-most cell occupied by that object.\n   - Change the color of that cell from 8 to 1.\n"
