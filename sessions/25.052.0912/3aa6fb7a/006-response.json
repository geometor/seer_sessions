One is a regular \"L\" shape, and the other is a reversed \"L\".\n\n2.  **Locate Change:** We need to find where within each L-shaped object a blue pixel is inserted. Examining positions (1,2) for first L-shaped object and (4,5) for the second one, we find that these match the right-most and bottom-most pixel location of the L-shaped objects.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Preserve the two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects in their original positions.\n    *   Change the color of the right-most pixel of first azure L-shape from azure (8) to blue (1).\n    *   Change the color of the bottom-most pixel of second azure L-shape from azure (8) to blue (1).\n\n**Natural Language Program**\nHere is the program in natural language:\n1. Copy the input to the output.\n2. For the first L-shaped azure object in the top-left quadrant of the grid:\n   - Find the right-most cell occupied by that object.\n   - Change the color of that cell from 8 to 1.\n\n3. For the second L-shaped azure object in the bottom-right quadrant:\n   - Find the bottom-most cell occupied by that object.\n   - Change the color of that cell from 8 to 1.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nCopies the input grid to the output grid, then finds two specific L-shaped azure objects.\nFor the first L-shape, it changes the right-most pixel to blue.\nFor the second L-shape, it changes the bottom-most pixel to blue.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_l_shapes(grid, color):\n    # helper function for finding objects\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def is_valid(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= y < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(x, y, current_object):\n        if not is_valid(x, y) or visited[x, y] or grid[x, y] != color:\n            return\n\n        visited[x, y] = True\n        current_object.append((x, y))\n\n        dfs(x + 1, y, current_object)\n        dfs(x - 1, y, current_object)\n        dfs(x, y + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(x, y - 1, current_object)\n\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[x, y] == color and not visited[x, y]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(x, y, current_object)\n                # check for approximate shape and size (could be enhanced with other geometric checks)\n                if 3 <= len(current_object) <= 5:\n                    objects.append(current_object)\n\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rule.\"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    l_shapes = find_l_shapes(output_grid, 8)\n\n    # assume that two L-shaped will be in this order\n    if len(l_shapes) >= 2:\n\n        # process first L-shape (top-left)\n        first_l_shape = l_shapes[0]\n        # find right-most pixel\n        rightmost_pixel = max(first_l_shape, key=lambda p: p[1])\n        output_grid[rightmost_pixel] = 1\n\n\n        # process second L-shape (bottom-right)\n        second_l_shape = l_shapes[1]\n        # Find the bottom-most pixel\n        bottommost_pixel = max(second_l_shape, key=lambda p: p[0])  # bottom-most\n        output_grid[bottommost_pixel] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
