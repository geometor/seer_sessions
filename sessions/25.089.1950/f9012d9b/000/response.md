Okay, let's analyze the provided example `train_3`.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid:** A 7x7 grid containing red (2), gray (5), and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid:** A 2x2 grid containing gray (5) and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Color Presence:** Colors red and gray are present in both input and output. White is present only in the input.
4.  **Structure in Input:** The input grid exhibits a clear repeating pattern, primarily composed of 2x2 red blocks separated by gray lines (rows/columns). This pattern seems to be based on a 3x3 tile:
    
```
    2 2 5
    2 2 5
    5 5 5
    ```

    Tiling this 3x3 pattern across a 7x7 grid would produce the input grid, *except* for the bottom-right 2x2 area.
5.  **White Pixels:** Four white pixels (0) form a 2x2 block in the bottom-right corner of the input grid, specifically at coordinates (row 5, col 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 6). These white pixels seem to overwrite or mask the underlying pattern in that location.
6.  **Relationship:** The output grid's dimensions (2x2) match the dimensions of the block of white pixels in the input. The *location* of the white block seems to define *where* in the underlying pattern to extract the output.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify a region in the input marked by white (0) pixels, determine the underlying repeating pattern of the grid ignoring the white pixels, and extract the portion of that pattern corresponding to the marked region.

elements:
  - element: grid
    role: input
    attributes:
      colors_present: [red, gray, white]
      size: 7x7
      features:
        - repeating_pattern: A base 3x3 tile [[2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5]] appears tiled across the grid.
        - marker_pixels: A 2x2 block of white (0) pixels exists at the bottom-right corner (rows 5-6, cols 5-6).

  - element: grid
    role: output
    attributes:
      colors_present: [gray, red]
      size: 2x2
      relationship_to_input:
        - size_determination: The output grid dimensions match the dimensions of the white pixel block in the input.
        - content_determination: The output grid content corresponds to the colors that *would* be present in the input grid at the location of the white pixels, if the underlying repeating pattern continued uninterrupted.

transformation:
  - action: identify_marker_region
    source: input grid
    criteria: find all white (0) pixels
    result: bounding box coordinates (min_row, min_col) and dimensions (height, width)

  - action: determine_pattern_periodicity
    source: input grid (excluding white pixels)
    method: Find the smallest vertical (H) and horizontal (W) periods such that the color at (r, c) matches the color at (r+H, c) and (r, c+W) for non-white pixels.
    example_3_result: H=3, W=3

  - action: reconstruct_pattern_at_marker
    inputs:
      - marker_region_location: (min_row, min_col)
      - marker_region_size: (height, width)
      - pattern_periods: (H, W)
      - input_grid
    method: For each position (i, j) within the marker region (0<=i<height, 0<=j<width), determine the corresponding input grid coordinate (r, c) = (min_row+i, min_col+j). Find the reference color by repeatedly subtracting the periods (H, W) from (r, c) until a non-white pixel is found in the input grid at the resulting coordinates (r_ref, c_ref). The color Input(r_ref, c_ref) is the reconstructed pattern color for position (i, j).
    result: A grid of size (height, width) containing the reconstructed pattern colors.

  - action: generate_output
    source: result of reconstruct_pattern_at_marker
    result: the final output grid

example_3_trace:
  - identify_marker_region: White pixels at (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6). Bounding box starts at (min_row=5, min_col=5), size is (height=2, width=2).
  - determine_pattern_periodicity: Pattern repeats every H=3 rows and W=3 columns.
  - reconstruct_pattern_at_marker:
      - Output(0,0) -> Input coords (5,5). Ref coords (5-3, 5-3)=(2,2). Input(2,2)=5 (gray).
      - Output(0,1) -> Input coords (5,6). Ref coords (5-3, 6-3)=(2,3). Input(2,3)=5 (gray).
      - Output(1,0) -> Input coords (6,5). Ref coords (6-3, 5-3)=(3,2). Input(3,2)=5 (gray).
      - Output(1,1) -> Input coords (6,6). Ref coords (6-3, 6-3)=(3,3). Input(3,3)=2 (red).
  - generate_output: [[5, 5], [5, 2]]

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Marker:** Locate all white (color 0) pixels in the input grid. Determine the top-left corner (min_row, min_col) and the size (height, width) of the smallest rectangle enclosing all these white pixels.
2.  **Find Pattern Period:** Analyze the non-white pixels of the input grid to find the smallest vertical period (H) and horizontal period (W) such that the color of any non-white pixel at `(r, c)` is the same as the non-white pixels at `(r+H, c)` and `(r, c+W)`, where these locations are within the grid bounds.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with dimensions `height` x `width`.
4.  **Fill Output Grid:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the new grid (where `0 <= i < height` and `0 <= j < width`):
    a.  Calculate the corresponding coordinates `(r, c)` in the original input grid space: `r = min_row + i`, `c = min_col + j`.
    b.  Initialize reference coordinates `(r_ref, c_ref)` to `(r, c)`.
    c.  **Find Reference Color:** While the pixel at `(r_ref, c_ref)` in the input grid is white (0): update `r_ref` to `r_ref - H` and `c_ref` to `c_ref - W`. (Ensure `r_ref` and `c_ref` remain non-negative; this effectively looks back to the corresponding position in a previous pattern cycle).
    d.  The color of the input grid pixel at the final non-white `(r_ref, c_ref)` is the required color.
    e.  Place this color at cell `(i, j)` in the new grid.
5.  **Return:** The constructed grid is the final output.
