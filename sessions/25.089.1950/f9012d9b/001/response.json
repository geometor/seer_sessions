Find Marker Region: Locate the bounding box (top-left corner and dimensions)\n   of all white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n2. Find Pattern Period: Analyze the non-white pixels to determine the smallest\n   vertical (H) and horizontal (W) periods of the repeating pattern. A period\n   is valid if for all applicable coordinates (r, c), the color at (r, c)\n   matches the color at (r+H, c) and (r, c+W), provided both compared pixels\n   are non-white.\n3. Construct Output Grid: Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions\n   as the marker region found in step 1.\n4. Fill Output Grid: Iterate through each cell (i, j) of the output grid.\n   a. Calculate the corresponding coordinates (r, c) in the input grid space\n      (r = marker_min_row + i, c = marker_min_col + j).\n   b. Initialize reference coordinates (r_ref, c_ref) to (r, c).\n   c. Repeatedly subtract the periods (H, W) from (r_ref, c_ref) as long as\n      the pixel at input_grid[r_ref, c_ref] is white (0) and the coordinates\n      remain within the input grid bounds.\n   d. If the loop finishes because a non-white pixel is found at (r_ref, c_ref),\n      use its color for the output grid cell (i, j).\n   e. If the loop finishes because (r_ref, c_ref) goes out of bounds (meaning\n      the pattern origin needs to be inferred differently), use a fallback:\n      calculate the color from the base pattern element at input_grid[r % H, c % W].\n      If this fallback position is also white, the output cell remains 0 (or its initial value).\n   f. Handle potential infinite loops with a maximum step count, falling back\n      to the modulo method if necessary.\n5. Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on identifying a marked region and reconstructing\n    an underlying periodic pattern.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_"
