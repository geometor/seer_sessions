Identifies a region in the input marked by white (0) pixels, determines
the underlying repeating pattern of the grid (ignoring white pixels),
and extracts the portion of that pattern corresponding to the marked region.

The transformation follows these steps:
1. Find Marker Region: Locate the bounding box (top-left corner and dimensions)
   of all white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2. Find Pattern Period: Analyze the non-white pixels to determine the smallest
   vertical (H) and horizontal (W) periods of the repeating pattern. A period
   is valid if for all applicable coordinates (r, c), the color at (r, c)
   matches the color at (r+H, c) and (r, c+W), provided both compared pixels
   are non-white.
3. Construct Output Grid: Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions
   as the marker region found in step 1.
4. Fill Output Grid: Iterate through each cell (i, j) of the output grid.
   a. Calculate the corresponding coordinates (r, c) in the input grid space
      (r = marker_min_row + i, c = marker_min_col + j).
   b. Initialize reference coordinates (r_ref, c_ref) to (r, c).
   c. Repeatedly subtract the periods (H, W) from (r_ref, c_ref) as long as
      the pixel at input_grid[r_ref, c_ref] is white (0) and the coordinates
      remain within the input grid bounds.
   d. If the loop finishes because a non-white pixel is found at (r_ref, c_ref),
      use its color for the output grid cell (i, j).
   e. If the loop finishes because (r_ref, c_ref) goes out of bounds (meaning
      the pattern origin needs to be inferred differently), use a fallback:
      calculate the color from the base pattern element at input_grid[r % H, c % W].
      If this fallback position is also white, the output cell remains 0 (or its initial value).
   f. Handle potential infinite loops with a maximum step count, falling back
      to the modulo method if necessary.
5. Return the completed output grid.
