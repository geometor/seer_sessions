```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on row index and content.

    1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid using its index `r`.
    3.  If the row index `r` is even, the row remains unchanged (handled by initial copy).
    4.  If the row index `r` is odd:
        a. Check if the grid has at least 3 columns. If not, the row remains unchanged.
        b. If it has 3 or more columns:
            i.   Extract the first three elements `e0`, `e1`, `e2` from the input row `r`.
            ii.  Determine the value `x` for the first element of the output row: `x` is 7 if 7 is in `[e0, e1, e2]`, otherwise `x` is `e0`.
            iii. Set the first element of the output row `r` to `x`.
            iv.  Shift the original content of the input row `r` one position to the right into the output row `r`, starting from the second position (index 1). That is, `output[r, j] = input[r, j-1]` for `j` from 1 to `cols-1`.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
