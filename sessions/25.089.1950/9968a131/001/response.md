def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on row index and the content of the first three cells in odd rows.

    1. Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Iterate through each row of the input grid using its index.
    3. If the row index is even, the row remains unchanged (already handled by copying).
    4. If the row index is odd:
       a. Check if the grid has at least 3 columns. If not, the row remains unchanged.
       b. Extract the first three elements (a, b, c) from the input row.
       c. Check if the color orange (7) is present in [a, b, c].
       d. Determine the new first element (x): 7 if orange is present, otherwise the value of 'a'.
       e. Update the first three elements of the corresponding output row to [x, a, b].
       f. The rest of the row (from index 3 onwards) remains unchanged (already handled by copying).
    5. Return the modified output grid.
