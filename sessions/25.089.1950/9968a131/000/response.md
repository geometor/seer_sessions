*   **Perception**: The task involves modifying input grids based on row index and the content of the first few cells within specific rows.
    *   The grids in the examples have varying dimensions (4x4 and 6x6).
    *   The transformation selectively targets rows based on their index (odd vs. even).
    *   Even-numbered rows (index 0, 2, 4...) remain unchanged between input and output.
    *   Odd-numbered rows (index 1, 3, 5...) undergo a modification, but only within the first three columns (index 0, 1, 2). The rest of the row (from index 3 onwards) remains unchanged.
    *   The modification rule for the first three elements `[a, b, c]` of an odd row transforms them into `[x, a, b]`.
    *   The value of `x` (the first element in the output row's prefix) depends on whether the color orange (7) is present in the input prefix `[a, b, c]`. If orange (7) is present, `x` becomes orange (7). If orange (7) is not present, `x` takes the value of the original first element, `a`.

```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    grid_properties:
      dimensionality: 2D
      color_palette: 0-9
      size_variability: True (input/output dimensions match within examples, but vary between examples)
    transformation_scope: row-based
    row_processing:
      conditional_logic: based on row index (even/odd)
      even_rows: copied verbatim from input to output.
      odd_rows: modified based on content.
    odd_row_modification:
      affected_columns: first three (index 0, 1, 2)
      unaffected_columns: from index 3 onwards (copied verbatim)
      rule:
        input_prefix: Define as the first three elements `[a, b, c]` = `input[row, 0], input[row, 1], input[row, 2]`.
        output_prefix: Defined as `[x, a, b]`.
        determination_of_x:
          condition: Check if the color orange (value 7) exists within the input prefix `[a, b, c]`.
          result_if_true: `x` becomes orange (7).
          result_if_false: `x` becomes the value of `a` (the original first element `input[row, 0]`).
    key_colors:
      - orange (7): Plays a special role in determining the transformation outcome for odd rows.
    object_focus: The transformation doesn't appear to rely on identifying contiguous objects but rather operates on pixel values based on their position (row index, column index) and value (specifically checking for orange/7).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index (starting from 0).
    3.  If the current row index is even (0, 2, 4,...):
        *   Copy the entire row from the input grid to the corresponding row in the output grid.
    4.  If the current row index is odd (1, 3, 5,...):
        *   Extract the first three elements of the input row at indices 0, 1, and 2. Let these be `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.
        *   Check if the color orange (value 7) is present among `a`, `b`, or `c`.
        *   Determine the value for the first element (`x`) of the output row's prefix:
            *   If orange (7) is present in `[a, b, c]`, set `x` to 7.
            *   Otherwise (if orange (7) is not present), set `x` to the value of `a`.
        *   Set the first three elements of the corresponding output row to `[x, a, b]`.
        *   Copy the remaining elements of the input row (from index 3 onwards) to the corresponding positions in the output row.
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
