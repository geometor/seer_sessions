The rest of the row (from index 3 onwards) remains unchanged.\n    *   The modification rule for the first three elements `[a, b, c]` of an odd row transforms them into `[x, a, b]`.\n    *   The value of `x` (the first element in the output row's prefix) depends on whether the color orange (7) is present in the input prefix `[a, b, c]`. If orange (7) is present, `x` becomes orange (7). If orange (7) is not present, `x` takes the value of the original first element, `a`.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
