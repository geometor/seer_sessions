Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation of the entire grid. The colors/numbers themselves remain unchanged; only their positions within the grid are altered. It seems the grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_codes
  - observation: input grid is rotated to produce the output grid
  - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
  - color_preservation: colors of individual cells are maintained during rotation
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels, where each pixel is represented by a single-digit integer.
2.  The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3.  The colors of the pixels are preserved during the rotation; only their positions change.
4.  The rotated grid becomes the output.
