            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine the natural language program and identify any issues.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code implements a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, which correctly handles the first training example. However, further examination of training pairs, specifically with the results, reveals a significant discrepancy in the output. This would suggest that we do not fully comprehend the transformation. The core issue seems to be more than just rotation. We may need to rethink our approach, as a simple rotation is not satisfactory.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully inspect *all* provided training examples, paying close attention to the relationship between input and output grids. Look for patterns beyond simple rotation. There might be color changes, object interactions, or other geometric manipulations.\n2.  **Detailed Observations:** For each example, create detailed observations.\n3.  **Hypothesis Revision:** Based on the re-examination, formulate a new, more comprehensive hypothesis about the transformation rule, making it more accurate.\n4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create the YAML block as requested.\n5.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program based on the revised hypothesis.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using previous test data):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 8], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[5, 5, 8], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Result: PASS\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n    *   Result: PASS\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *  Input: `[[0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0], [7, 0, 0]]`\n    *  Expected Output: `[[7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7]]`\n    *  Actual Output: `[[7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7]]`\n    * Result: PASS\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  example_1:\n    input_objects:\n      - object_1:\n          type: grid\n          properties:\n            shape: 3x3\n            colors: [gray, azure]\n            content: [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8]]\n    output_objects:\n      - object_1:\n          type: grid\n          properties:\n            shape: 3x3\n            colors: [gray, azure]\n            content: [[5, 5, 8], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]\n    transformation:\n      type: rotation\n      degrees: 90\n      direction: counter-clockwise\n\n  example_2:\n    input_objects:\n      - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              shape: 3 x 3\n              colors: [white, blue]\n              content: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n    output_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            properties:\n              shape: 3 x 3\n              colors: [white, blue]\n              content: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n    transformation:\n      type: rotation\n      degrees: 90\n      direction: counterclockwise\n\n  example_3:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1:\n              type: grid\n              properties:\n                shape: 3 x 3\n                colors: [white, orange]\n                content: [[0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0], [7, 0, 0]]\n      output_objects:\n          - object_1:\n              type: grid\n              properties:\n                shape: 3 x 3\n                colors: [white, orange]\n                content:  [[7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7]]\n      transformation:\n        type: rotation\n        degrees: 90\n        direction: counterclockwise\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input is a 3x3 grid. It appears that the current code is working. The operation is to rotate the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The colors of the individual pixels are maintained, but their positions within the grid change according to the rotation. The rotated grid is the output.\n"
