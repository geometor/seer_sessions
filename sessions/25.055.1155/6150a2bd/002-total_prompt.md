## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75AAE3268490>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75AAE32699C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation of the entire grid. The colors/numbers themselves remain unchanged; only their positions within the grid are altered. It seems the grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_codes
  - observation: input grid is rotated to produce the output grid
  - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
  - color_preservation: colors of individual cells are maintained during rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels, where each pixel is represented by a single-digit integer.
2.  The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3.  The colors of the pixels are preserved during the rotation; only their positions change.
4.  The rotated grid becomes the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
