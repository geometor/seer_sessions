            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly implements a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The provided code was tested against other examples and produced correct results. This indicates that the core logic of the transformation (rotation) is accurate. The natural language program is also a good representation of what is physically occurring in the transformation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince the code is producing correct result, the strategy is to simply create and document all of the observations, then rewrite or simply restate the natural language program, incorporating all of the knowledge we have gained by running the function across all of the training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use code execution to confirm the dimensions and other properties. Since the results were correct we do not need to compare them to the expected values.\n\n```python\ndef describe_grid(grid, name):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_array = np.array(grid)\n    print(f\"{name}:\")\n    print(f\"  Shape: {grid_array.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Unique values: {np.unique(grid_array)}\")\n\n#provided examples are in a variable call 'task'\nfor i, example in enumerate(task[\"train\"]):\n    describe_grid(example[\"input\"], f\"Example {i+1} Input\")\n    describe_grid(example[\"output\"], f\"Example {i+1} Output\")\n\n```\n\n```\nExample 1 Input:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [1 3 4]\nExample 1 Output:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [1 3 4]\nExample 2 Input:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [1 4 7]\nExample 2 Output:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [1 4 7]\nExample 3 Input:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [2 3 8]\nExample 3 Output:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [2 3 8]\n```\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        unique_colors: [blue, green, yellow]\n      output:\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        unique_colors: [blue, green, yellow]\n      transformation:\n        type: rotation\n        direction: counter-clockwise\n        degrees: 90\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        unique_colors: [blue, yellow, orange]\n      output:\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        unique_colors: [blue, yellow, orange]\n      transformation:\n        type: rotation\n        direction: counter-clockwise\n        degrees: 90\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        unique_colors: [red, green, azure]\n      output:\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        unique_colors: [red, green, azure]\n      transformation:\n        type: rotation\n        direction: counter-clockwise\n        degrees: 90\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is the rotated 3x3 grid. The colors of the pixels remain the same, but their positions change according to the rotation.\n"
