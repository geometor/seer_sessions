task_context: Grid transformation
transformation_rule: Change 0 to 1 if horizontally adjacent to 8
objects:
  - type: cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
predicates:
  - is_zero: cell.color == 0
  - is_eight: cell.color == 8
  - is_horizontally_adjacent_to_eight: cell is horizontally adjacent to a cell with color 8
actions:
  - change_color_to_one: set cell.color = 1
transformation_steps:
  - For each cell in the input grid:
    - Check if the cell's color is 0.
    - If yes, check its left and right neighbors.
    - If the left neighbor's color is 8 OR the right neighbor's color is 8, change the current cell's color to 1 in the output grid.
    - Otherwise, keep the cell's color as 0 in the output grid.
  - If the cell's color is not 0, keep it unchanged in the output grid.
