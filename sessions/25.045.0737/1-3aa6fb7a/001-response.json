If a cell is on the left edge, it has no left neighbor; if it's on the right edge, it has no right neighbor. In these cases, we only consider the existing neighbor.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_context: Grid transformation\ntransformation_rule: Change 0 to 1 if horizontally adjacent to 8\nobjects:\n  - type: cell\n    properties:\n      color: integer (0-9)\npredicates:\n  - is_zero: cell.color == 0\n  - is_eight: cell.color == 8\n  - is_horizontally_adjacent_to_eight: cell is horizontally adjacent to a cell with color 8\nactions:\n  - change_color_to_one: set cell.color = 1\ntransformation_steps:\n  - For each cell in the input grid:\n    - Check if the cell's color is 0.\n    - If yes, check its left and right neighbors.\n    - If the left neighbor's color is 8 OR the right neighbor's color is 8, change the current cell's color to 1 in the output grid.\n    - Otherwise, keep the cell's color as 0 in the output grid.\n  - If the cell's color is not 0, keep it unchanged in the output grid.\n```"
