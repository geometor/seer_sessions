The output seems to preserve some of the input's spatial information but with significant changes. The bottom row of the input appears to become, mostly, the bottom row of the output, but re-ordered and completed. The strategy will involve identifying:\n\n1.  The set of unique colors present in the input.\n2.  How those colors are reordered and positioned in the output.\n3.  If other properties of the colors or grid are relevant (like position).\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using conceptual analysis, no code execution yet):**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Dimensions: 4x4\n    *   Colors Present: 0 (white), 4 (yellow), 9 (maroon), 6 (magenta), 1 (blue)\n    *   Non-zero pixels: 5\n    *   Zero pixels: 11\n*   **Output:**\n    *   Dimensions: 4x4\n    *   Colors Present: 0 (white), 4 (yellow), 9 (maroon), 6 (magenta), 1 (blue) - Same as input\n    *   Non-zero pixels: 4\n    *   Zero pixels: 12\n*   **Changes:**\n    * It seems that every non-zero number in the input has made it to the last row of the output, and the rest of the non-zero numbers has become zero.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
