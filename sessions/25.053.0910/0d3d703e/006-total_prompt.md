Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and plan for the provided input-output example:

**General Assessment:**

The transformation appears to be a simple color substitution. The input grid consists of three distinct colors (represented by the numbers 5, 8, and 6), and the output grid uses three different colors (1, 9, and 2). The spatial arrangement (a 3x3 grid) remains constant. The core strategy will be to identify the mapping between input colors and output colors.

**Metrics and Observations (using `tool_code` if needed):**

Since this example is straightforward, I can directly observe without code execution:

*   **Input Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Output Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Input Colors:** 5 (gray), 8 (azure), 6 (magenta)
*   **Output Colors:** 1 (blue), 9 (maroon), 2 (red)
*   All rows are the same in input.
*   All rows are the same in output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  input:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      - value: 5
        name: gray
        count: 3
      - value: 8
        name: azure
        count: 3
      - value: 6
        name: magenta
        count: 3
    structure: All rows identical
  output:
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      - value: 1
        name: blue
        count: 3
      - value: 9
        name: maroon
        count: 3
      - value: 2
        name: red
        count: 3
    structure: All rows identical
  transformation:
    type: color substitution
    mapping:
      5: 1
      8: 9
      6: 2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Color Substitution:** Replace every instance of color 5 (gray) with color 1 (blue), color 8 (azure) with color 9 (maroon), and color 6 (magenta) with color 2 (red). The dimensions and structure remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
