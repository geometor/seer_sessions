Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, pattern discernment, and initial strategy formulation.

**General Assessment:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The primary change appears to be the introduction of blue (value 1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (value 8) pixels. The overall shape and location of the azure clusters are preserved. My strategy will be to:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat contiguous blocks of the same color as individual objects.
2.  **Analyze Relationships:** Determine the spatial relationship between the azure objects in the input and the blue pixels in the output. Specifically, I'll investigate adjacency (touching sides or corners).
3.  **Formulate Rule:** Develop a rule based on the observed relationships, likely involving the placement of blue pixels near azure pixels.
4. Document the findings in the requested formats.

**Gather Metrics (using conceptual analysis since I can't execute code yet):**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: 7x7
    *   Colors: 0 (white), 8 (azure)
    *   Azure Objects: Two - one "L" shaped, one mirrored "L" shaped.
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   Dimensions: 7x7
    *   Colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 8 (azure)
    *   Azure Objects: Two - same as input.
    *   Blue pixels. Two, and both touch only one edge of the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
input:
  dimensions: 7x7
  colors:
    white: 0
    azure: 8
  objects:
    azure_L:
      shape: L
      color: azure
      pixels: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    azure_mirrored_L:
      shape: mirrored L
      color: azure
      pixels: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]

output:
  dimensions: 7x7
  colors:
    white: 0
    azure: 8
    blue: 1
  objects:
    azure_L:
      shape: L
      color: azure
      pixels: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    azure_mirrored_L:
      shape: mirrored L
      color: azure
      pixels: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    blue_pixel_1:
        color: blue
        pixels: [[1,2]]
    blue_pixel_2:
        color: blue
        pixels: [[4,4]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) colored objects in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve** the azure objects in their exact positions in the output grid.
3. For the azure object in the top left:
    3. a) **Locate** the right-most pixel on the top row of the shape.
    3. b) **Place** a single blue pixel to the right of that pixel
4. For the azure object in the bottom right:
    4. a) **Locate** the pixel that forms a corner in the top and left side of the shape.
    4. b) **Place** a single blue pixel above that corner.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
