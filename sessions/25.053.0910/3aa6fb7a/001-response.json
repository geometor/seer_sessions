            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, pattern discernment, and initial strategy formulation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The primary change appears to be the introduction of blue (value 1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (value 8) pixels. The overall shape and location of the azure clusters are preserved. My strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat contiguous blocks of the same color as individual objects.\n2.  **Analyze Relationships:** Determine the spatial relationship between the azure objects in the input and the blue pixels in the output. Specifically, I'll investigate adjacency (touching sides or corners).\n3.  **Formulate Rule:** Develop a rule based on the observed relationships, likely involving the placement of blue pixels near azure pixels.\n4. Document the findings in the requested formats.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using conceptual analysis since I can't execute code yet):**\n\n*   **Input Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Colors: 0 (white), 8 (azure)\n    *   Azure Objects: Two - one \"L\" shaped, one mirrored \"L\" shaped.\n*   **Output Grid:**\n    *   Dimensions: 7x7\n    *   Colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 8 (azure)\n    *   Azure Objects: Two - same as input.\n    *   Blue pixels. Two, and both touch only one edge of the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
