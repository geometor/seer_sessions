Some of them are single cells, some of them are 2x1 vertical rectangles.\n\n2.  **Observe Changes:**  The azure objects are the same in the input and output. In the output, a new blue cell is placed. By observation, the blue pixel is put at the right side of the top cell of each 2x1 azure vertical rectangle.\n\n3. **Infer the Rule:** It is confirmed that, for each 2x1 vertical azure rectangle, a blue pixel is added to the right of the upper azure cell of each vertical object.\n\n**Transformation Rule (Concise):**\n\nLocate each 2x1 vertical rectangle of azure color (8). Add a blue cell (1) to the immediate right of the top cell that constitutes the 2x1 azure object.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nLocate each 2x1 vertical rectangle of azure color (8). Add a blue cell (1) to the immediate right of the top cell that constitutes the 2x1 azure object.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_2x1_vertical_rectangles(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates of 2x1 vertical rectangles of the specified color.\n    Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the top and bottom coordinates of a rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    rectangles = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows - 1):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and grid[r + 1, c] == color:\n                rectangles.append(((r, c), (r + 1, c)))\n    return rectangles\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    Locate each 2x1 vertical rectangle of azure color (8).\n    Add a blue cell (1) to the immediate right of the top cell of the 2x1 azure object.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_rectangles = find_2x1_vertical_rectangles(output_grid, 8)\n\n    for top_coord, _ in azure_rectangles:\n        # Add a blue cell to the right of the top cell, if within bounds\n        if top_coord[1] + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n            output_grid[top_coord[0], top_coord[1] + 1] = 1\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
