            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs generated by the current code. The core issue lies in the misinterpretation of \"2x1 vertical rectangle.\" The code identifies *any* two vertically adjacent azure cells, not necessarily isolated 2x1 rectangles. This leads to incorrect placement of the blue cells.\n\nHere's a revised natural language description and the corresponding Python implementation:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Isolated 2x1 Azure Rectangles:** Search the grid for azure (8) colored cells. An isolated 2x1 rectangle is defined as a pair of vertically adjacent azure cells where:\n    *   The cell above the top azure cell is *not* azure.\n    *   The cell below the bottom azure cell is *not* azure.\n    *   The cells to the immediate left and right of *both* azure cells are *not* azure. This ensures it's a standalone 2x1 block.\n\n2.  **Place Blue Cell:** For each identified isolated 2x1 azure rectangle, place a blue (1) cell immediately to the right of the *top* azure cell of the rectangle. Ensure that this placement is within the grid boundaries. If adding to the right of the top azure is out-of-bounds, skip this step.\n\n**Improved Python Code:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_isolated_2x1_vertical_rectangles(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates of *isolated* 2x1 vertical rectangles of the specified color.\n    Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the top and bottom coordinates of a rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    rectangles = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows - 1):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and grid[r + 1, c] == color:\n                # Check for isolation:\n                is_isolated = True\n\n                # Check above and below\n                if r > 0 and grid[r - 1, c] == color:\n                    is_isolated = False\n                if r + 2 < rows and grid[r + 2, c] == color:\n                    is_isolated = False\n\n                # Check left and right of both cells\n                if c > 0:\n                    if grid[r, c - 1] == color or grid[r+1, c-1] == color:\n                        is_isolated = False\n                if c + 1 < cols:\n                    if grid[r, c + 1] == color or grid[r+1, c+1] == color :\n                        is_isolated = False\n                \n\n                if is_isolated:\n                    rectangles.append(((r, c), (r + 1, c)))\n    return rectangles\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the refined rule:\n    Locate each *isolated* 2x1 vertical rectangle of azure color (8).\n    Add a blue cell (1) to the immediate right of the top cell of the 2x1 azure object.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_rectangles = find_isolated_2x1_vertical_rectangles(output_grid, 8)\n\n    for top_coord, _ in azure_rectangles:\n        # Add a blue cell to the right of the top cell, if within bounds\n        if top_coord[1] + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n            output_grid[top_coord[0], top_coord[1] + 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Key Changes and Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`find_isolated_2x1_vertical_rectangles` Function:**\n    *   The core logic change is within this function.  It now includes checks to ensure the 2x1 azure rectangle is *isolated*. It verifies that no adjacent cells (above, below, left, or right of *both* azure cells) are also azure.\n\n2. **Isolation Checks:**\n   - Checks if a cell above exists (`r>0`) before looking for an azure cell (`grid[r-1,c] == color`).\n   - Similar boundary checks for the lower bound (`r + 2 < rows`), as well as left (`c>0`) and right (`c + 1 < cols`).\n\nThis revised code correctly identifies *isolated* 2x1 azure rectangles and places the blue cell accordingly, addressing the errors observed in the previous attempts. This version should now pass the original test cases and be more robust to variations.\n"
