Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs to refine the natural language program and the corresponding Python code.

**Analysis of the Errors**

In both Example 1 and Example 2, the blue cell (1) is being added to the right of *every* azure (8) cell that is part of a 2x1 vertical rectangle, not just the top cell.

*   **Example 1:** The code adds a blue cell to the right of the bottom azure cell in the second 2x1 rectangle.
*   **Example 2:**
    The code adds a blue cell at (0,6), from a supposed azure rectangle at (0,5), (1,5). It also adds a blue cell at (5,4), when there should be one at (5,3)

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify 2x1 Vertical Azure Rectangles:** Scan the input grid to locate all 2x1 vertical rectangles composed of azure (8) colored cells. A 2x1 vertical rectangle is defined as two vertically adjacent cells of the same color.
2.  **Place Blue Cell:** For each identified 2x1 azure rectangle, place a single blue (1) colored cell immediately to the right of the *top* azure cell of the rectangle.
3. **Boundary Condition**: Make sure the added blue cell is still within boundaries.

**Explanation of the changes**

The previous description, while mostly correct was not *precise* enough. I missed to highlight to only use the *top* cell.
The examples show that only 2x1 azure vertical rectangles are considered.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
