task: 005-color_and_fill
summary: |
  The task involves placing a blue (1) pixel adjacent to azure (8) rectangles
  (either 2x1 or 1x2) in specific positions based on whether a 2x2 azure square could be
  formed. It favors completing the 2x2 azure square if possible. If not, and the completion
  can *only* be done in one direction, a blue pixel is placed to force this azure square
  completion if done.

  - can_form_2x2_square_left: Checks if a 2x1 azure rectangle can form a 2x2 square to its left.
  - can_form_2x2_square_below: Checks if a 1x2 azure rectangle can form a 2x2 square below it.
  - can_form_2x2_square_above: Checks if a 1x2 azure rectangle can form a 2x2 square above it.
