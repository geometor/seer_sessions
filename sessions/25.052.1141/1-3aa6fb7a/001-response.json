Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle. There are also a lot of white cells which act as background.\n\n2.  **Observe Changes:** In the output grid, we see the same azure objects have not been altered. However, one new blue cell is added on the right side of each azure object.\n\n3. **Infer the Rule:** It's inferred that for each vertical 2x1 azure (8) rectangle, we perform the action to add a blue(1) pixel at the right of its top and bottom.\n\n**Transformation Rule (Concise):**\n\nLocate each 2x1 vertical rectangle of azure color (8). Add a blue cell (1) to the immediate right of both cells that constitute the 2x1 azure object.\n\n"
