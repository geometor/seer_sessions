Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program description. The previous code attempted to identify *isolated* 2x1 azure rectangles and add a blue cell to the right of the top cell. However, the results show it's not working correctly, indicating an issue with either the isolation logic or the placement of the blue cell, or the core concept itself.

Here's a breakdown of the observations from the examples, focusing on the differences between input and expected output:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**  We see two 2x1 azure (8) vertical rectangles. One is on the left (column 1) and the other on the right (columns 4 and 5). The right-side rectangle is attached to another azure rectangle.
*   **Expected Output:** A blue (1) cell appears to the *right* of the *top* cell of the *leftmost* 2x1 azure rectangle. Also, a blue cell appears to the left of the top of *rightmost* 2x1 azure rectangle.
*   **Key Difference:** The transformation adds blue cells adjacent to the azure rectangles, but is not based on the previously defined isolation.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** There are multiple azure (8) instances, some forming 2x1 vertical rectangles, some 1x2 horizontal, some are isolated pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** Blue (1) cells are added to the *right* of the *top* cell of 2x1 vertical azure rectangles if there is space available.
*    **Key Difference:** Again, focuses only in 2x1 azure vertical rectangles, and places new blue cells in specific locations relative to them.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x1 Vertical Azure Rectangles:** Find all 2x1 vertical rectangles composed of azure (8) colored cells within the grid. These rectangles are defined by two vertically adjacent cells of the same color.

2.  **Place Blue Cell to the Right of Top Azure Cell:** For each identified 2x1 azure rectangle, if the cell immediately to the *right* of the *top* azure cell is empty (color 0) *and* within the grid boundaries, change that cell to blue (1).

**Revised Code Explanation Rationale:**

The prior code had an incorrect isolation function. The core concept is correct (find 2x1 azure vertical rectangles), but we need to check that the right position from the top azure pixel is available (inside the grid, and with color 0).

I will keep the `find_isolated_2x1_vertical_rectangles` name, but I will substantially change the code to implement the corrected behaviour.
