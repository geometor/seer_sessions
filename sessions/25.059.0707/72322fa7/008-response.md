1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Locate all pixels with colors 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure) in the *input* grid.
2.  **Static Pixels:** Pixels with colors 3 (green) and 5 (gray) remain unchanged in the output grid. Copy them directly from the input to the output.
3.  **Magenta Transformation:** All pixels that were color 6 (magenta) in the input grid become color 8 (azure) in the output grid. *Do not mirror them yet*.
4.  **Blue Mirroring:** For each pixel of color 1 (blue) in the input grid, create a mirrored copy with color 1 (blue) on the opposite side of the grid's vertical center. The vertical center is determined by `(number of columns - 1) / 2`.
5.  **Azure Mirroring:** For each pixel of color 8 (azure) in the *input* grid AND for each pixel that *became* color 8 (from the original color 6), create a mirrored copy with color 8 (azure) on the opposite side of the grid's vertical center.
6. **Output Construction:** The output grid is built by combining these actions: preserving static pixels, transforming magenta pixels, and mirroring blue and azure pixels. The order of operations for mirroring is important. Process the *original* color 8s and color 1s, then any newly created 8s.
