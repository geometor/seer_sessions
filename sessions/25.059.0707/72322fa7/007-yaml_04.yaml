facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      size: variable
      cell_values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # Possible pixel colors
    observations:
      - "The grid has a defined width and height."
      - "Each cell in the grid contains a single integer value representing a color."

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0-9]
      position: (row, column)
    observations:
      - "Pixels of color 3 (green) and 5 (gray) are static."
      - "Pixels of color 1 (blue) are mirrored across the vertical center."
      - "Pixels of color 6 (magenta) change to color 8 (azure)."
      - "Pixels of color 8 (azure) are mirrored across the vertical center."

  - action: mirroring
    properties:
      axis: vertical_center
    observations:
      - "Mirroring occurs across the vertical axis calculated from the input grid."
      - "The mirrored pixel's color is the same as the original pixel's color (except for color 6)."
      - "The position of mirrored pixels uses index coordinates (row, col) from 0 to (length - 1)."

  - action: transformation
    properties:
      color_change: 6 -> 8
    observations:
        - "magenta becomes azure"
