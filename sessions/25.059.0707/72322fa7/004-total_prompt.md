Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. There appear to be specific color patterns and arrangements that are being modified. The most notable changes seem to involve the repetition and shifting of certain colored objects, specifically those involving colors 1, 3, 6, and 8. There also appears to be some kind of mirroring or reflection involved.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9)
    properties:
      - height: 13
      - width: 22

  - object: blue_object_1
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: appears as single pixels or 2x1 configurations.
    action:
      - replicated:  A single pixel gets mirrored, or a mirrored pair is added in specific row

  - object: green_object
    color: 3 (green)
    shape: single pixel
    action:
      - maintained: position remains same.

  - object: azure_object
    color: 8 (azure)
    shape: single pixel and connected groups
    action:
      - mirrored: horizontally mirrored with another pixel, and replicated in the same row as '6'

  - object: magenta_object
    color: 6 (magenta)
    shape: single pixel.
    action:
      -  becomes_azure: Turns into azure (8), and potentially is mirrored in the same row.

  - relationship: azure_magenta
    type: spatial proximity
    description:  Azure (8) and Magenta (6) often appear near each other, and their transformations seem linked.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on pixels with colors 1 (blue), 3 (green), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure).
2.  **Blue (1) Replication:**
    *   If a single blue (1) pixel is present in row, create a mirror image of this single pixel in the same row.
    *   If two blue (1) pixels are present, check if they are mirrored, maintain mirrored pixels in the same row.
3.  **Green (3) Preservation:** Green (3) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions.
4.  **Magenta (6) and Azure (8) Transformation:**
    *   All Magenta (6) pixels become Azure (8).
    *   Azure (8) pixel creates a mirror of itself.
    *    If a row has transformed Azure pixels, copy them in the row of the original Azure pixels.

This program aims to capture the mirroring and color transformations observed in the example. The relationship between magenta (6) and azure (8) is crucial, with magenta acting as a precursor to the mirrored azure pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
