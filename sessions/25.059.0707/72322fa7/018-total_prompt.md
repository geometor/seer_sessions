Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, designed for the first training example, performs reasonably well on that specific case. However, it fails to generalize correctly to the other training examples. The core issue is that the hardcoded shifts and offsets in the initial code, specific to the arrangement in the first example, don't apply universally. The strategy needs to shift from absolute, predetermined offsets to a more relative and pattern-based approach. This involves:

1.  **Relative Positioning:** Instead of fixed offsets, determine the movement of objects *relative* to their initial positions or relative to other objects. For example, the L-shape's movement might be defined in relation to its original bounding box.
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** The code correctly identifies object types (L-shape, blue-green pairs, isolated red). However, it needs to be more flexible in detecting variations of these patterns.
3.  **Object Grouping:** Considering the relationship between the L-shape and the embedded red pixel as single unit to simplify movement and avoid errors.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

I'll use `find_objects` from previous code to help analyze the input/output grids of each example.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: L_shape
    color: azure
    property: encloses_red
    movement:
      train_0: shift_left_and_down
      train_1: shift_down_and_split
      train_2: shift_up_and_left
      train_3: combined_shift_and_split # shift left and split, shift right, split
  - type: enclosed_pixel
    color: red
    property: inside_L
    movement: follows_L
  - type: stack
    color_1: blue
    color_2: green
    property: vertical_pair
    movement: replicated_down
  - type: isolated_pixel
    color: red
    property: 'none'
    movement: variable # depends on L-shape
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid. This includes:
    *   An "L-shaped" object composed of three azure pixels.
    *   A red pixel enclosed *within* the bounds of the L-shape. Consider those as single composite object.
    *   Pairs of vertically stacked blue and green pixels (blue on top, green below).
    *   An isolated red pixel (not part of the L-shape).

2.  **Move the Composite L-shape Object:** The entire L-shape composite object (including the enclosed red pixel) is moved. The movement is a combination of shifts:
    * The L can be split and a copy moved horizontally
    *   The L-shape's new position seems to be determined *in relation to* its original bounding box, and in relation to where other objects exist in the scene.

3.  **Replicate Blue-Green Pairs:** Each blue-green stack is duplicated. The duplicate is placed directly below the original stack.

4.  **Move Isolated Red Pixel:** The isolated red pixel is moved. Its new position depends greatly on the positioning of the moved "L".

5. **Preserve spatial relationships:** The spatial arrangement of the *input* objects are preserved *within* the groupings, as objects are moved and replicated.

**Changes from original:** This is a major revision. The original was too rigid. This new program focuses on relative movements, object grouping, and pattern recognition.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
