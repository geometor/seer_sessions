The input grid transforms into the output grid, seemingly with some changes in the arrangement and potentially the values of certain pixels. The dominant color is white (0). There are sparse occurrences of other colors (1-blue, 2-red, 3-green, 8-azure).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also a red pixel appears separately.\n - the output contains modified positions of the identified elements\n - in the output, we see the L-shape pattern repeated multiple times\n - the two-pixel stack element is preserved, blue on top and green on the bottom, and repeats too\n\n```"
