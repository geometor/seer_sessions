facts:
  - observation: "The output grid dimensions are consistently half the input grid dimensions (rounded down)."
    examples: [1, 2, 3]
  - observation: "Objects in the output grid are proportionally smaller than objects in the input grid."
    examples: [1, 2, 3]
  - observation: "The relative positions of objects within the grid appear to be preserved (scaled down)."
    examples: [1, 2, 3]
  - observation: "Object colors are preserved between input and output."
    examples: [0, 1, 2, 3]
  - observation: "Example 0 is an identity transformation where input and output grids are identical, fitting the dimension reduction rule (6/2 = 3, then scale up again 3 * 2 = 6)"
    examples: [0]
