1.  **Preservation:** Pixels with colors 3 (green) and 5 (gray) remain in their original positions and are not modified.
2.  **Color 8 (Azure) Mirroring:**  Pixels with color 8 (azure) create a mirrored copy of themselves on the opposite side of the grid's central column.
3.  **Color 6 (Magenta) Transformation and Mirroring:** Pixels with color 6 (magenta) first change their color to 8 (azure), and *then* create a mirrored copy of themselves (now as color 8) on the opposite side of the grid's central column.
4.  **Color 1 (Blue) Mirroring:** Pixels with color 1 (blue) create a mirrored copy of themselves on the opposite side of the grid's central column.
5.  **Mirror Axis:** The mirroring of pixels for colors 1, 6 and 8 occurs across the vertical axis defined by the center column of the input grid. The center column is determined by (number of columns - 1)/2

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program and observations accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured the core concept of mirroring pixels across the central vertical axis. However, the provided code and natural language program needs refinement. The error analysis highlights a critical flaw: the assumption of *all* colors (1, 6 and 8) are mirrored, but color 6 should only appear on the left side of the output, and *only* color 8 should appear on the right. The tests confirm this. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Precise Pixel Identification:** Accurately identify the locations of pixels of colors 1, 6, and 8 in the *input* grid.
2.  **Conditional Mirroring/Transformation:**
    *   Color 1 (blue) pixels are mirrored.
    *   Color 6 (magenta) pixels *become* color 8 (azure), but are not mirrored. Their *original* locations are important.
    *   Color 8 (azure) pixels are mirrored.
3.  **Precise Mirroring Logic:** Ensure the mirroring is always calculated correctly based on the input grid's dimensions. Ensure that we are using the input grid's shape and not the output grid shape.
4.  **Output-Driven Updates:** Revise both the natural language program and, eventually, the code based on examining *all* training input/output pairs. Focus on a clear, step-by-step description of the transformation process.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

To analyze the examples effectively, I'll use `numpy` to compare the `transformed_grid` with the `expected_output` for each training example. This will provide pixel-by-pixel accuracy metrics. I will then provide detailed findings on each.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_grid):
    """Analyzes the results by comparing the transformed grid with the expected output."""

    correct_pixels = np.sum(transformed_grid == expected_output)
    total_pixels = transformed_grid.size
    accuracy = (correct_pixels / total_pixels) * 100

    diff = transformed_grid != expected_output
    
    changed_pixels = []  # List to store coordinates and values of differing pixels
    for row_index, row in enumerate(diff):
        for col_index, is_different in enumerate(row):
            if is_different:
                changed_pixels.append({
                    'row': row_index,
                    'col': col_index,
                    'expected': expected_output[row_index, col_index],
                    'actual': transformed_grid[row_index, col_index]
                })

    return accuracy, changed_pixels

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Locate all pixels with colors 1 (blue), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure) in the *input* grid.
2.  **Static Pixels:** Pixels with colors 3 (green) and 5 (gray) remain unchanged in the output grid. Copy them directly from the input to the output.
3.  **Magenta Transformation:** All pixels that were color 6 (magenta) in the input grid become color 8 (azure) in the output grid. *Do not mirror them yet*.
4.  **Blue Mirroring:** For each pixel of color 1 (blue) in the input grid, create a mirrored copy with color 1 (blue) on the opposite side of the grid's vertical center. The vertical center is determined by `(number of columns - 1) / 2`.
5.  **Azure Mirroring:** For each pixel of color 8 (azure) in the *input* grid AND for each pixel that *became* color 8 (from the original color 6), create a mirrored copy with color 8 (azure) on the opposite side of the grid's vertical center.
6. **Output Construction:** The output grid is built by combining these actions: preserving static pixels, transforming magenta pixels, and mirroring blue and azure pixels. The order of operations for mirroring is important. Process the *original* color 8s and color 1s, then any newly created 8s.

This revised natural language program provides a much more accurate and detailed description of the transformation, addressing the issues discovered during the analysis of the training examples. It emphasizes the crucial difference between the original color 8 pixels and those that transformed from color 6, and it clarifies the mirroring process.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
