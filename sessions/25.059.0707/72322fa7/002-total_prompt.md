<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3520x1872 at 0x7A43F558ECD0>Okay, I've reviewed the input-output pairs for the three training examples. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both rectangular grids of pixels.
*   **Colors:** Pixels can have integer values 0-9, representing different colors.
*   **Objects:** There appear to be distinct "objects" formed by contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.
*   **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of objects and their arrangements seem important.
*  **Mirroring:** It seems that some parts of input are mirrored in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - description: Contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
      - shape: Determined by the arrangement of pixels

actions:
  - name: Mirror
    description: Reflect some object.
    parameters:
      - axis: horizontal or Vertical

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects have relative positions and can be adjacent.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Mirror some Objects at the edge:**
    *   If there is some colored sub-grid at the border, mirror the sub-grid to the opposite border.
    *   If a colored pixel is not at the border, maintain the color.
3. Result is the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
