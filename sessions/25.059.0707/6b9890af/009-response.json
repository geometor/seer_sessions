            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example and, as expected, doesn't generalize perfectly to all examples. The core idea of extracting a region and placing transformed azure shapes within a red-bordered 8x8 grid is partially correct. However, the exact positioning and transformation logic of the azure shapes need adjustments. The provided code also incorrectly fills white, and is missing important logic for scaling. The strategy for resolving errors involves:\n\n1.  **Refining Object Identification**: Ensure correct identification of azure and red components in all examples.\n2.  **Improving Positional Logic**: Develop a more robust way to determine where, inside the output, to extract and place objects, including relative positions and sizes of the transformed shapes.\n3.  **Correcting Color Handling:** Avoid filling the entire area with white, and set to a value of zero instead.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately analyze, I'll use a consistent reporting format.\n\n```\nExample: input, output, predicted\nCorrect: True/False - overall assessment of the input/output pair\nPixels: total, correct, incorrect, correct%, (for each color if useful)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the predicted output:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nExample: 0, 0, 0\nCorrect: True\nPixels: 64, 64, 0, 100.0%\n  - 0: 36, 36, 0, 100.0%\n  - 2: 28, 28, 0, 100.0%\n  - 8: 0, 0, 0, NaN%\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nExample: 1, 1, 1\nCorrect: False\nPixels: 64, 44, 20, 68.75%\n  - 0: 36, 16, 20, 44.44%\n  - 2: 28, 28, 0, 100.0%\n  - 8: 0, 20, -20, -inf%\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n```\nExample: 2, 2, 2\nCorrect: False\nPixels: 64, 52, 12, 81.25%\n  - 0: 36, 24, 12, 66.67%\n  - 2: 28, 28, 0, 100.0%\n  - 8: 0, 12, -12, -inf%\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 0\n    objects:\n      azure:\n        - shape: rectangle\n          size: variable\n          position: variable, relative to each other\n      red:\n        - shape: rectangle\n          size: 8x8\n          position: bounds of output\n    transformation:\n      - type: resize\n        target: input\n        to: 8x8\n      - type: place\n        target: azure shapes\n        at: within the 8x8 red boundary, scaled based on original sizes and center position\n  - id: 1\n    objects:\n      azure:\n        - shape: rectangle\n          size: variable\n          position: variable, relative to each other\n    transformation:\n      - type: resize\n        target: input\n        to: 8x8\n      - type: place\n        target: azure\n        at: scaled to fit with 8x8, maintains input orientation, centered\n  - id: 2\n     objects:\n      azure:\n        - shape: appears to be composed of smaller rectangles,\n          size: varies.\n          position: different configurations but generally clustered.\n\n     transformation:\n      - type: resize\n        target: input\n        to: 8x8 output grid.\n      - type: place\n        target: azure shapes\n        at: scaled and placed within 8x8 grid keeping their relative positions and configuration.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Output Grid Initialization:** Create an 8x8 output grid.\n2.  **Red Border:** Draw a red border around the entire 8x8 grid.\n3.  **Identify Azure Shapes:** Locate all azure-colored shapes within the input grid. Note original sizes, positions, and how many shapes are present.\n4.  **Center Azure:** Calculate the center position of the group of azure objects.\n5.  **Scale and Place Azure:** Place modified azure shapes within the 8x8 output. Maintain relative positions and aspect ratios of the azure shapes from the input and scale them to fit within the 8x8 grid.\n6. **Background**: All other pixels are set to 0 (black).\n\n"
