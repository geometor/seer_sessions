**Observations from Code Execution**

*   **Example output\_1:**
    *   The predicted output is smaller (3x3) than the expected output (5x5).
    *   The bounding box correctly identifies the '6' object, but the output grid size and border placement are incorrect. The border should fully enclose the non-zero pixels, extending to include any 0-value pixels between the colored pixels.

*   **Example output\_2:**
    *   The predicted output matches the expected output. This is the simplest case, with only one non-zero pixel.

*   **Example output\_3:**
    *  The predicted output is much smaller (3x3) than the expected (14x14).
    *  The identified objects includes two separate pixels of 7 at opposite ends. The bounding box includes *all* pixels, and the border should create a rectangle that includes every pixel, filling all inside cells with 0 (except the original color pixels).
