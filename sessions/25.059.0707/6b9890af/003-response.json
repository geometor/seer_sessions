            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying objects, creating a bounding box, and transferring objects within a red border. However, the test results on the full training set reveal some shortcomings, particularly concerning the precise placement and conditions for the red border and object transfer. The core issue seems to be a too-strict definition of the bounding box and border rules. The code needs to be adapted to account for the actual transformation logic, which seems to be placing a red border *around* internal shapes under specific conditions, rather than simply enclosing all objects.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the presence, position, and characteristics of objects and the red border.\n2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use `code_execution` where helpful to programmatically extract information about object positions, bounding box sizes, and border placement, to confirm or clarify observations.\n3.  **Fact Documentation:** Create a YAML document summarizing the observed facts, focusing on object properties, relationships, and the conditions for border creation.\n4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the accumulated evidence, rewrite the natural language program to describe the transformation logic more accurately.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis**\n\nLet's manually inspect and then gather some metrics.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Two objects (blue and green).\n*   **Expected Output:** A red rectangle surrounds the two internal components.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** One green and one orange object, *close together* vertically.\n*   **Expected Output:** Red rectangle surrounding internal objects.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matched the expected output.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*    **Input:** Blue and Green Object, *further apart*\n*    **Expected Output:** Red rectangle surrounding internal objects.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matched the expected output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects_present: [blue, green]\n    border_present: true\n    border_encloses: \"internal objects\"\n    notes: \"Bounding box of internal objects gets red outline\"\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects_present: [ green, orange]\n    border_present: true\n    border_encloses: \"internal objects\"\n    notes: \"Bounding box of internal objects gets red outline\"\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects_present: [ blue, green]\n    border_present: true\n    border_encloses: \"internal objects\"\n    notes: \"Bounding box of internal objects gets red outline\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous colored regions (objects). Do not include white (0) pixels as separate objects.\n2. **Identify Internal Objects:** Identify objects inside the grid.\n3.  **Draw Bounding Box:** Calculate the minimum bounding box that encloses all the internal objects.\n4. **Create Red Border:** Create an output grid equal to the size of the bounding box. Fill this rectangle's outline with red color (2).\n5. **Copy internal colors**: Transfer the internal objects into the output grid within the red border, maintaining original relative positions.\n\n"
