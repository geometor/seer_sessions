Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous colored regions (objects). Do not include white (0) pixels as separate objects.
2. **Identify Internal Objects:** Identify objects inside the grid.
3.  **Draw Bounding Box:** Calculate the minimum bounding box that encloses all the internal objects.
4. **Create Red Border:** Create an output grid equal to the size of the bounding box. Fill this rectangle's outline with red color (2).
5. **Copy internal colors**: Transfer the internal objects into the output grid within the red border, maintaining original relative positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
