examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: two 3x3 blocks
          position: top-middle-left and top-middle-right, bottom-middle-left, and bottom-middle-right
      output_objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: two 3x3 blocks
          position: top-middle-left and top-middle-right
        - color: red
          shape: two 3x2 blocks
          position: bottom-middle-left and bottom-middle-right, adjacent to green
        - color: green
          shape: 1 x 1
          position: bottom-middle-right, adjacent to red
      transformation: Gray blocks change color based on position: blue at the top, red in the lower region, green at one cell on the bottom right.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: 5x3 block
          position: center
      output_objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: 5x3 block
          position: center
      transformation: Gray blocks are replaced entirely by blue blocks.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: 5x3 block
          position: center
      output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: 5x3 block
          position: center
      transformation: Gray blocks are replaced entirely by red blocks.
  - example_4:
      input_objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: 6x4 block
          position: top
        - color: gray
          shape: 2x2 block
          position: bottom, centered
      output_objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: 6x4 block
          position: top
        - color: red
          shape: 2x2 block
          position: bottom, centered
      transformation: Yellow blocks remain unchanged. Gray blocks are replaced by red blocks below the yellow.
  - example_5:
      input_objects:
        - color: orange
          shape: 4x9 block
          position: top
        - color: gray
          shape: 3x4 block
          position: bottom, centered
      output_objects:
        - color: orange
          shape: 4x9 block
          position: top
        - color: blue
          shape: 3x4 block
          position: bottom, centered
      transformation: Orange blocks remain unchanged. Gray blocks are replaced by blue blocks below the orange.
