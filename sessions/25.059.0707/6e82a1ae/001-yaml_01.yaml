facts:
  - type: input_grid
    description: Contains objects of color gray (5).
    elements:
      - object: gray_object_1
        color: 5
        shape: irregular
        properties: [contiguous]
      - object: gray_object_2
        color: 5
        shape: irregular
        properties: [contiguous]
      - object: gray_object_n  # Representing 'n' distinct objects
        color: 5
        shape: irregular
        properties: [contiguous]

  - type: output_grid
    description: Contains colored objects corresponding to input objects.
    elements:
      - object: colored_object_1
        color: [1, 2, or 3] # Possible colors
        shape: matches corresponding input object
        properties: [contiguous]
      - object: colored_object_2
        color: [1, 2, or 3]
        shape: matches corresponding input object
        properties: [contiguous]
     - object: colored_object_n
        color: [1, 2, or 3]
        shape: matches corresponding input object
        properties: [contiguous]

  - type: transformation
    description: Each distinct gray object is replaced with a uniquely colored object.
    rules:
      - rule_1: "Preserve spatial arrangement and shape."
      - rule_2: "Map each gray object to a unique color (1, 2, or 3)."
      - rule_3: "Background color (0) remains unchanged."
    constraints:
      - constraint_1: "One-to-one mapping between input gray objects and output colored objects."
