The colors used in the output grids are blue (1), red (2), and green (3).  It appears that each distinct gray object in the input is mapped to a unique color in the output. The spatial arrangement and shape of the objects are preserved during the transformation. The background color (white/0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"

Consider each of these blocks as a distinct object.\n\n2.  **Assign Unique Colors:** For each distinct gray object identified, assign a unique color from the set {blue (1), red (2), green (3)}.  The assignment can be arbitrary but must be consistent across all examples (i.e. if the \"first\" object is assigned blue in example one, and the \"first object is present in example two, it should be blue).\n\n3.  **Replace and Preserve:** In the output grid, replace each gray pixel of a given object with the assigned color for that object. Maintain the exact shape and position of the original gray object.\n\n4.  **Maintain Background:** Leave all pixels with the background color (0) unchanged.\n\n5. The order of assigning colors matter, must be consistent across all examples. It seems in this case, the objects in each example are colored with a consistent color, so find connected components, sort them, map the sorted connected components from each example and choose a corresponding color that all example output uses for the input object in the same position of the sorted list.\n"
