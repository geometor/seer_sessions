Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid primarily contains 0s (white) and 5s (gray). The output grid introduces new colors: 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 3 (green), while retaining the 0s (white) from the input. The transformation seems to be a recoloring or replacement of the 5s (gray) based on some spatial or contextual rule. The spatial arrangement and distribution of colored pixels is altered during transformation.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
  - type: values
    description: Cell values are integers 0-9, representing colors.
  - type: input_colors
    description: Input grid primarily contains 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - type: output_colors
    description: Output grid contains 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 3 (green).
  - type: transformation
    description: 5s (gray) in the input are replaced with 1, 2, or 3 in the output.
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description:  The transformation appears to be based on the position and arrangement of the gray pixels.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve** any cell with the value 0 (white).
3.  **Identify** cells with value of 5.
4.  **Replace** the identified gray (5) pixels using these rules:
     *   If it is in the top right quadrant change to blue (1).
    *   If in the bottom right quadrant change to red (2).
    *   If on the middle left region, change to green (3).
