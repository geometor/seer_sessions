The input grid primarily contains 0s (white) and 5s (gray). The output grid introduces new colors: 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 3 (green), while retaining the 0s (white) from the input. The transformation seems to be a recoloring or replacement of the 5s (gray) based on some spatial or contextual rule. The spatial arrangement and distribution of colored pixels is altered during transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
