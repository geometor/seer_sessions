The input grid contains gray (5) pixels, some of which form connected shapes. The output grid seems to have a one-to-one correspondence with the gray shapes in the input, but the gray pixels are replaced with different colors (blue=1, green=3, red=2), and each connected gray shape seems to correspond to a distinct color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
