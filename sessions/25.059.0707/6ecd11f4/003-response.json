The majority of the grid is white (0). There are two large, connected blue (1) regions, and a smaller, multi-colored 3x3 region near the bottom. The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid, mirroring the colors and values of the smaller region in the input, but with all the white(0)'s of the 3x3 square in the input is not shown in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
