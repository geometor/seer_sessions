Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), but there are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of other colors.\n2.  **A Small Output Grid:** A smaller 2D array, seemingly derived from a specific region within the larger input grid. This region appears to be a consistently sized, non-white, dense block of pixels near the bottom. The size might vary.\n\nThe core transformation seems to be an extraction or \"cropping\" of a specific colored rectangular region from the larger input grid, and using this sub-grid as the output. The extracted area is characterized by not including white space (0s).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This block should be contiguous (all pixels connected). It appears there's only one such \"dense\" block of this nature present in each example.\n3. **Determine Boundaries:** Determine rows and columns of the rectangular block.\n4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, smaller grid (the output grid) consisting of *only* the pixels within the identified rectangular block.\n5. **Output:** The output grid should contain exactly and only values inside the identified rectangle, without including surrounding white space.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation \"crops out\" the smallest rectangle of non-white pixels near the bottom of the input grid and presents this rectangle as the output.\n"
