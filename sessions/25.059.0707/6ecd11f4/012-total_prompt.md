Previous Code:
```python
"""
Find the 3x3 block of colored pixels. Copy it, but remove any white pixels, leaving only the colored pixels in their original positions within the 3x3 output.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_non_white_subgrid(grid, size=3):
    # Iterate through the grid to find a subgrid of given size
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for i in range(rows - size + 1):
        for j in range(cols - size + 1):
            subgrid = grid[i:i+size, j:j+size]
            # Check if the subgrid contains any non-white pixels
            if np.any(subgrid != 0):
                return i, j  # Return top-left corner coordinates
    return None, None

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code does a decent job of identifying and extracting a 3x3 subgrid and removing the white pixels. However, the initial assumption that there will always be one dominant colored area makes the code fail in the example with multiple regions. The code works correctly when it is based on the core premise, but it fails when additional or different conditions are presented. We need to adjust our strategy to handle cases with separate colored regions, not just a single, solid 3x3 colored block.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
The main error arises in example 2 where more than one 3x3 block of unique color exists.

1.  **Refine Subgrid Identification:** Instead of stopping at the first non-white 3x3 subgrid, we need to either:
    *   Process *all* 3x3 subgrids.
    *   Identify *multiple* 3x3 subgrids.

2. **Understand non-white:**
    * The instruction specifically says to remove the white pixels - this has been interpreted as any pixel with a value of zero.

3.  **Output Grid Construction:**
    *   The current program creates one output grid.

**Gather Metrics and Reports (via code execution - conceptual):**

To understand the patterns, we'd ideally run code to generate these metrics. Since I'm in the "dreamer" phase, I'll describe what I'd *want* to measure and report on, assuming access to code execution.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Output grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Number of non-white 3x3 subgrids found: 1
    *   Number of colors in that non-white 3x3 region: 1
    *   Pixel colors in the non-white subgrids (value and count)
    *   Success: True (matches expected output)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Output grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Number of non-white 3x3 subgrids found: >1
    *   Number of colors in each non-white 3x3 subgrid
    *   Pixel colors in the non-white subgrids (value and count)
    *   Success: False (doesn't match)
* **Example 3:**
     *   Input grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Output grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Number of non-white 3x3 subgrids found: 1
    *   Number of colors in that non-white 3x3 region: 1
    *   Pixel colors in the non-white subgrids (value and count)
    *   Success: True (matches expected output)
* **Example 4:**
      *   Input grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Output grid dimensions: (report dimensions)
    *   Number of non-white 3x3 subgrids found: 1
    *   Number of colors in that non-white 3x3 region: 1
    *   Pixel colors in the non-white subgrids (value and count)
    *   Success: True (matches expected output)

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - example_set: "training"
  - observation: "Input grids contain 3x3 subgrids of non-white pixels."
  - observation: "White pixels (value 0) within the 3x3 subgrids are removed in the output."
  - observation: "Non-white pixels within the 3x3 subgrids retain their original positions relative to the subgrid within the 3x3 output."
  - observation: "The output grid is always 3x3."
  - observation: "There can be more than one 3x3 subgrid of unique color."
  - action: "Locate 3x3 subgrid(s)."
  - action: "Copy non-white pixels from subgrid(s) to a 3x3 output grid, maintaining relative position."
  - action: "Remove white pixels."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Scan the input grid to identify all 3x3 subgrids.
2.  **Filter:** For each 3x3 subgrid, copy only the non-white pixels (those not equal to 0) to a new 3x3 output grid.
3.  **Maintain Position:** Preserve the relative positions of the non-white pixels within the 3x3 output grid, as they appeared within the original 3x3 subgrid.
4. **Combine**: If there are more than one 3x3 blocks of a unique color, copy the output of each block to the final output grid.

The critical update is handling *all* 3x3 subgrids, not just the first one encountered.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
