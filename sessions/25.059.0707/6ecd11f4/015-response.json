Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A large grid (22x22) mostly filled with white (0) pixels. There are distinct regions of azure (8) pixels forming a large, irregular shape. A smaller, multicolored (various non-zero, non-8 values) rectangular block is present in the lower right corner.\n*   **Output:** A smaller grid (4x4) that appears to be a subsampling or filtered version of the multicolored block in the input. The white (0) pixels in output have special handling.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

It looks like every other pixel of the block is selected, starting at the top-left and going by columns, then rows.\n3.  **Special Color Rule**: if an azure (8) pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel in the original colored block, convert the corresponding pixel in the subsampled block to white (0).\n\nI think that summarizes the relationship I am perceiving. There's strong indication\nthat adjacency to the azure (8) shape drives this.\n"
