Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input appears to be a large grid (27x25) mostly filled with white pixels (0). There are two distinct regions:\n\n1.  A large, irregular shape composed of green pixels (3) in the upper-middle part of the grid.\n2.  A small 3x3 block of multi-colored pixels in the lower-left corner. This block contains the digits/colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, as well as two white (0) pixels.\n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid containing only the non-white pixels from the small multi-colored block in the input, maintaining their relative positions. The position of the smaller box inside the bigger box appears related.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
