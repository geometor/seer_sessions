Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example and try to understand the transformation. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A large grid (22x22) mostly filled with white (0) pixels. There are distinct regions of azure (8) pixels forming a large, irregular shape. A smaller, multicolored (various non-zero, non-8 values) rectangular block is present in the lower right corner.
*   **Output:** A smaller grid (4x4) that appears to be a subsampling or filtered version of the multicolored block in the input. The white (0) pixels in output have special handling.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [22, 22]
      colors: [0, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
      dominant_color: 0
      shapes:
        - type: irregular
          color: 8
          location: fills most of grid, surrounding smaller multicolored block.
        - type: rectangle
          color: mixed
          location: bottom_right

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [4, 4]
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
      relationship_to_input: "subsampled multicolored rectangle, with 0 replacing some colors based on a rule"

actions:
  - type: subsample
    agent: unknown
    target: input_grid.shapes.rectangle
    result: output_grid
  - type: filtering
    agent: unknown
    parameters:
      description: "change some of the subsampled pixels to 0 based on its surroundings in the input"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Locate the multicolored rectangular block of pixels in the lower-right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Subsample:** Extract a 4x4 grid from the multicolored block. It looks like every other pixel of the block is selected, starting at the top-left and going by columns, then rows.
3.  **Special Color Rule**: if an azure (8) pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel in the original colored block, convert the corresponding pixel in the subsampled block to white (0).

I think that summarizes the relationship I am perceiving. There's strong indication
that adjacency to the azure (8) shape drives this.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
