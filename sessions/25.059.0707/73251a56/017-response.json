            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the premise of removing white pixels (0) within a \"main shape\" defined by the bounding box of all non-background colored pixels. This approach works for the first example but fails on others because:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Assumption about \"Main Shape\":** The \"main shape\" isn't always defined by *all* non-background pixels. In some cases, there are clearly distinct shapes, and the rule applies only within a specific one.\n2.  **Ignoring Other Colors:** The presence of other colors besides white within the relevant shape matters. The rule seems to be more nuanced than simply removing all white pixels.\n3. **Background definition** The assumption that the background is 0 is incorrect.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues is:\n\n1.  **Refine Shape Identification:** Instead of a single bounding box for all non-background pixels, we need a way to identify the *specific* shape relevant to the transformation. This may involve looking for connectivity, color patterns, or other distinguishing features.\n2.  **Incorporate Color Context:** The rule should explicitly consider the colors present within the shape and how they interact with the white pixels.\n3. **Determine actual background** Identify the actual color used for the background.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including metrics and observations, background color\n\nExample 0:\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 1 0 1 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nResult:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nCorrect: True\n```\nBackground is 0, main shape defined by blue (1). White (0) pixels are removed within the shape.\n\nExample 1:\n```\nInput:\n[[5 5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 1 0 1 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5 5]]\nOutput:\n[[5 5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5 5]]\nResult:\n[[5 5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 1 1 1 5 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5 5]]\nCorrect: True\n```\nBackground is 5, main shape defined by blue (1). White (0) pixels are removed within the shape.\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInput:\n[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 3 0 3 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]]\nOutput:\n[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]]\nResult:\n[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]]\nCorrect: True\n```\nBackground is 8, main shape defined by green (3). White (0) pixels are removed within the shape.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Remove white pixels within a specific colored shape.\"\n  - objects:\n    - shape:\n        description: \"A contiguous block of pixels of a single, non-white, non-background color.\"\n        properties:\n          - color: \"Varies (blue, green, etc. - not white or background)\"\n          - contiguity: \"Pixels are directly adjacent (not diagonal).\"\n    - white_pixels:\n        description: \"Pixels with the value 0.\"\n        properties:\n            - color: \"white (0)\"\n  - actions:\n    - remove:\n        target: \"white_pixels\"\n        condition: \"Within the identified 'shape'.\"\n  - background:\n    - color: \"The most frequent value on the edges.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Background Color:** Determine the most frequent color along the edges of the input grid. This is the background color.\n2.  **Identify the Target Shape:** Find contiguous blocks of non-white, non-background colored pixels.  There will only be one such shape in each input grid.\n3.  **Remove White Pixels Inside the Shape:** Within the bounds of the identified shape, remove any white (0) pixels. \"Removing\" in this specific task is equivalent to keep them at 0 as background is a non-zero color.\n4. Output is the modified grid.\n\n"
