The primary element seems to be a large, complex shape composed of multiple colors (gray, yellow, magenta, blue, red, green, orange, azure, maroon). The transformation appears to involve the removal of a specific color, seemingly based on its location within the larger shape. In this instance, white (0) colored pixels are removed. Other colored pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
