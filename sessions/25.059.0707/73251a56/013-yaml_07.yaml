      color: varies (1, 7, 4, 5 in the examples)
      location: input_grid_bottom_right
      output_location: output_grid_bottom_right
  - grid: input_grid
    properties:
      shape: varies (10x10 in all examples)
  - grid: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: constant (3x3 in all examples)

actions:
  - action: copy
    source: input_grid.non_white_pixel.location
    destination: output_grid.non_white_pixel.output_location
