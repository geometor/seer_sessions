The input and output grids have the same dimensions (21x21). The most prominent color is magenta (6), which seems to form a large, irregular background shape. Within this magenta area, there are other colored pixels, notably a large area of grey (5) and white(0) pixels. The transformation appears to involve a selective removal of certain pixels. It focuses specifically on the white pixels, making them disappear.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If a pixel's color is white (0), change its color to the background color (6); otherwise, keep a pixel's color unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is: \"Remove all white pixels by changing their color to the background color (magenta).\"\n"
