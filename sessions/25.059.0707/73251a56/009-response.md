Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (21x21). The primary change seems to be the removal of certain pixels, specifically those with the color white (0). Other colors appear to remain in the same positions. The overall shape defined by the non-white pixels is preserved.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [21, 21]

actions:
  - name: remove_pixel
    parameters:
      color: white

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains pixels.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Remove** all the identified pixels
3.  Pixels of all other colors are retained at their original positions.
4. generate the new **output** grid

In essence, the transformation rule is to remove all white pixels from the input grid while preserving the positions of all other colored pixels.
