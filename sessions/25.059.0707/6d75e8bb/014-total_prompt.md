Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs reasonably well on some examples, but makes errors in others. The primary issue appears to be in the generalization of the replacement rule from the 2nd row, 2nd column of the first example to other examples. The original logic was designed with relative positioning and checking whether the pixel being examined is inside the azure region, so it should handle variations, but it does not get all cases right.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each example where the code fails. This includes:
    *   Identifying the exact locations where the output differs from the expected output.
    *   Characterizing the azure region (size, shape) in each example.
    *   Characterizing any differences between the failing cases and the single successful one
2.  **Refine Replacement Logic:** Based on the detailed analysis, we'll adjust the conditions within the `transform` function's replacement logic. This might involve:
    *   Considering the overall dimensions of the azure region, not only the second row.
    *   Adjusting the specific `rel_row` and `rel_col` conditions.
    *   Perhaps adding special case handling for different azure region shapes, or a more dynamic way to calculate which pixels to change based on overall dimensions.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** After each refinement, we'll re-run the code on all examples to ensure the changes improve accuracy without introducing regressions.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To help guide the analysis, the following properties can be determined via code execution.

*   Input and Output grid shapes.
*   Azure region coordinates.
*   Azure region bounding box (min/max row/col).
*   Pixels that differ between the predicted and expected outputs.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Region:** Find the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. If no such region exists, the output is identical to the input.
2.  **Determine Replacement Pattern:** Within the identified azure region, replace specific azure pixels with red (2) pixels based on their relative position *within that region*.

    - If there is a second row in the region, replace pixel(s) with red.
    - If the width of the region is greater than 2, and it's on the second row, replace up to two.
    - if the height of the region is 4, replace two pixels on the second row, otherwise one.
    - If the height is greater than 2, replace based on position, generally in the next to last column of the second row.

3.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the replaced pixels within the azure region.

Key improvements in this version:

*   **Emphasis on Relative Positioning:** The program now explicitly highlights that the replacement is determined by the position of pixels *relative to the boundaries of the azure region itself*, not the entire grid.
*   **More general rule:** The rule is described in terms of the dimensions of the azure area.

This refined natural language program and the associated YAML facts provide a clearer and more accurate description of the transformation rule, incorporating the insights gained from analyzing all training examples. This will form a better basis for the next coding phase.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
