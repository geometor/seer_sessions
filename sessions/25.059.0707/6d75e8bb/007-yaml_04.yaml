facts:
  - description: "Find objects of a specific color and determine if they completely enclose regions of another color"
  - actions:
    - find_object:
        input: grid, color
        output: bounding_box (top_left, bottom_right) or None
        purpose: "Locates the object, defined by a contiguous block of the given 'color'."
    - is_enclosed:
        input: grid, row, col, enclosing_color
        output: boolean
        purpose: "Determines if the pixel at (row, col) of a different color is fully enclosed by the 'enclosing_color'."
    - fill_enclosed:
      input: grid, enclosing_color, fill_color
      purpose: "Find all enclosed areas of other colors within/around the bounding box of the enclosing_color and fill them."
    - transform:
        input: input_grid
        output: output_grid
        purpose: "Combines object finding and enclosure filling to perform the complete transformation. The fill color is always red."
  - objects:
    - object_1: "The object defined by the 'enclosing_color'."
    - object_2: "The regions enclosed by object_1 of colors other than 'enclosing_color'."
  - colors:
      enclosing_color: 8  # Azure. This seems to be the primary enclosing color.
      fill_color: 2       # Red. This is the color used to fill enclosed regions.
      other_colors: [0]       # all other colors could be enclosed
