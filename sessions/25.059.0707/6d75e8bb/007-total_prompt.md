Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Find the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This region can be of any shape.
2.  **Detect Enclosed Regions:** Within and around the bounding box of the azure object, search for regions of white (0) pixels that are *completely enclosed* by the azure object. A region is considered enclosed if, starting from any white pixel within it, you cannot reach the edge of the grid without crossing an azure pixel.
3.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:**  Change *all* pixels within any enclosed white region found in step 2 to red (2).
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid, where all enclosed regions within the azure object are now filled with red.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
