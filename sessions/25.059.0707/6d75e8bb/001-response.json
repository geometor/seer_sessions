The primary element appears to be contiguous regions of azure-colored pixels within the input grid. The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the azure pixels to red, specifically focusing on enclosed or \"interior\" azure pixels. The output maintains the overall shape and structure of the azure regions but \"fills in\" certain areas with red.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
