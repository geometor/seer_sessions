       The azure shape is modified by changing some of its azure pixels to red.
       The change starts from the left edge of an indentation.
       If an azure pixel has a white pixel on it's immediate left,
       the recoloring to red will begin and proceed leftward. The recoloring stops when the left most azure
       pixel of that extent is reached.
