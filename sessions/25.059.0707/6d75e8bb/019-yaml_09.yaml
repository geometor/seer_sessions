observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: irregular, with indentations
          pixels_changed: Leftmost azure pixels within indentations change to red.
          adjacent_colors_before: white to the left of changing pixels
      output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: fills indentation, contiguous
        - color: azure
          shape: remains of original azure, outer part
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: Rectangular block with inward steps.
          pixels_changed:  The inner most pixels where the steps inward occur are changed to red.
          adjacent_colors_before: Not relevant.
      output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: fills the "stepped" area, contiguous
        - color: azure
          shape: remaining parts of original azure block.
  - example_3:
    input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: complex with multiple sections and protrusions.
          pixels_changed: Pixels within protrusions where the change in width begins.
          adjacent_colors_before: Not relevant.
    output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: Fills in the area created by the "protrusion", making it less jagged.
        - color: azure
          shape: remainder of the shape, without the 'protrusion'.
general_rule: |
  Identify contiguous azure regions. Within each region, identify "indentations" or "protrusions".
  An indentation or protrusion can be defined based on a change in the width.
  Change the color of the azure pixels within these indentations/protrusions to red, starting from
  the point where the width changes, and filling inwards or outwards as appropriate to create a contiguous red section.
  The overall effect is to "smooth out" or "fill in" parts of the azure shape.
