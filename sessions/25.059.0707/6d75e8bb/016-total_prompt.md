Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (represented by numbers 0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The input grid contains an azure shape resembling the number "3", and the output grid transforms some of the azure pixels to red, specifically those on the left side of the shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape_1
    type: contiguous_block
    color: azure (8)
    shape: resembles_number_3
    initial_position: centered_vertically, slightly_offcenter_horizontally

actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: shape_1
    affected_area: left_side_pixels
    from_color: azure (8)
    to_color: red (2)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Red pixels replace azure pixels on the left side, maintaining overall shape integrity."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels forming the shape of the number "3".
2.  **Define Affected Area:** Determine the leftmost pixels of the azure shape. These are any azure pixels directly to the right of the white background.
3. **Perform the Transformation** Find every pixel that is azure, is adjacent on the left of a white pixel, change it and every azure pixel touching it on the left to red.
4.  **Apply Color Change:** Change the color of the selected azure pixels to red (2).

In simpler terms, The azure shape has its left-side pixels recolored to red. The core concept here the idea of 'left side' - the azure pixels change color to red by 'filling in' any indentations on the shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
