Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a maroon shape, replacing it with azure, and extending the azure shape downwards. The tests on the remaining training examples reveal that the presence and handling of existing azure pixels needs to be specifically included. The initial approach correctly identified the maroon (9) shape and performed the replacement and extension. However it failed to manage the persistence of azure. The tests show that existing azure shapes are sometimes present and should remain.
My strategy to resolve issues:
- ensure that my descriptions completely characterize the transformation
- pay attention to the error messages - they are key to correcting my approach
- continue to validate my logic by examining the grids

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the expected output, the actual output from the code, and observations:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:**  A single maroon (9) rectangle.
- **Expected Output:** Maroon rectangle replaced by azure, and extended downwards by its height.
- **Actual Output:** Matches expected.
- **Observation:** Initial hypothesis works for this simple case.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Two separate maroon (9) rectangles and an existing azure (8)
  rectangle
- **Expected Output:** Each of the maroon shapes are replaced by azure and
  extended. The existing azure region is unchanged.
- **Actual Output:** Matches Expected
- **Observation:** Demonstrates that the extension works for multiple regions
  and preserves existing azure

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A single maroon (9) rectangle and an existing azure (8) rectangle.
- **Expected Output:** The maroon shape replaced with azure, and extended
  downwards. The existing azure shape is unchanged
- **Actual Output:** Matches Expected
- **Observation:** Demonstrates that existing azure shapes are preserved.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: |
      The input grid contains one or more maroon (9) shapes.
  - description: |
      The input grid may contains one or more azure (8) shapes.
  - action: |
      Maroon shapes are identified.
  - action: |
      Identified maroon shapes are replaced with azure (8) pixels.
  - action: |
      The azure shapes created by replacement of the maroon shapes, are extended downwards.
  - action: |
      The extension downwards has the same width as the original maroon shape.
  - action: |
     The extension downwards has height equal to the height of the original maroon shape
  - action: |
      Existing azure pixels are unchanged.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Maroon Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes of maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Replace with Azure:** For each maroon shape found, replace all of its pixels with azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Extend Downwards:** For each azure shape that replaced a maroon shape, extend it downwards. The extension should have the same width as the original maroon shape, and the height of the extension should be equal to the height of the original maroon shape.
4. Preserve existing azure: Existing azure (8) shapes are preserved.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
