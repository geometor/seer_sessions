Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 20x20 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of colors: white (0), azure (8), and maroon (9).\n*   **Shapes:** There are isolated azure (8) pixels and a connected structure of maroon (9) pixels. The maroon structure appears to be some kind of irregular shape.\n*    **Changes**:It appears as if azure(8) pixels have been inserted in some places, changing.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

If there any azure pixels with the area described in 4 and 5, overwrite them, otherwise just fill the empty space.\n\nEssentially, the transformation seems to be to add azure on and around the maroon shape, and keep the azure pixels where there were before.\n"
