Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all red pixels (value '2') and orange pixels (value '7') within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Orange Structure:** All the orange '7' in the input grid should be present in the output at the exact position.
3.  **Red Replication:** For every red pixel in the input, create a vertical column in the output. The height of each column will be from row position of that red pixel, down to the bottom of the grid, OR until it hits an orange pixel.
4. **Output Construction:** Place these replicated and the original red pixels, and orange structure into a new grid, preserving the background (value '0') where no other objects are present.

In summary: Copy each red pixel downwards, stopping if an orange pixel is encountered, or the edge of the grid is reached, and keep all orange pixels at original position.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
