Extend color 8 (azure) downwards, starting from every color 8 in the original and replacing every 9 by an 8.\n    *  If there's a \"red\" (color 2) object. Extend it with color 2 (red) downwards, starting from every color 2 in the original and replacing every 7 by 2.\n    * If there's a \"green\" (color 3) object that is not adjacent with a color 4.
