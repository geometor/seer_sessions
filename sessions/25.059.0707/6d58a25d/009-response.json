The transformation seems to involve a change in the arrangement of the '2' (red) pixels while potentially keeping an orange structure ('7') intact. The most salient feature appears to be the replication or propagation of red '2' pixels, specifically in areas where they are already present and near an orange '7' pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The height of each column will be from row position of that red pixel, down to the bottom of the grid.\n4. **Output Construction:** Place these replicated and the original red pixels, and orange structure into a new grid, preserving the background (value '0') where no other objects are present.\n\nIn summary - make a copy of the red pixel and past it in every row beneath it down to the end of the grid.\n"
