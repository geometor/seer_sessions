3.  **Draw Vertical Line:** Draw a vertical line down the entire grid, using color 3 (green), at the column index found in step 1.
4.  **Background:** The rest of the grid should consist of pixels with color white(0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved finding a single green pixel and drawing a green cross centered on that pixel. The subsequent training examples reveal that this approach is correct. The tests confirm the initial hypothesis is generally correct.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with observations and potential adjustments:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid with a single green pixel at (2, 2).
*   **Expected Output:** 5x5 grid with a green cross centered at (2, 2), rest is white.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Observations:** The initial logic works perfectly for this case.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid with a single green pixel at (3,4)
*   **Expected Output:** 7x7 grid with green cross centered at (3,4)
*   **Actual output:** Matched the expected output.
*    **Observations:** Reinforces that the existing logic is sound.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 11 x 11 grid, single green at (5,5)
*   **Expected Output:** 11 x 11 grid with green cross centered at (5,5)
*   **Actual Output:** Matched expected output
*   **Observations:** No issues, further confirms the main rule.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: green_pixel
    description: The single pixel with the value 3 (green).
    properties:
      location: (row, column) index within the input grid.
      uniqueness: Only one green pixel exists in the input.

  - object: cross
    description: A shape formed by a horizontal and vertical line intersecting.
    properties:
      color: Green (3).
      center: Same location as the green_pixel in the input.
      horizontal_line: Extends across the entire row of the green_pixel.
      vertical_line: Extends down the entire column of the green_pixel.

  - object: output_grid
    description: a grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
    properties:
      background_color: White (0)
      elements: Contains only the 'cross' object; all other pixels are white.
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here is the refined Natural Language Program:

1.  **Locate the Green Pixel:** Find the single pixel in the input grid that is colored green (value 3). Record its row and column coordinates.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate an output grid that has identical dimensions (height and width) as the input grid. Initialize all pixels in the output grid to white (value 0).

3.  **Draw Horizontal Line:** In the output grid, draw a horizontal line using the color green (value 3). This line should span the entire width of the grid and be positioned at the row coordinate obtained in step 1.

4.  **Draw Vertical Line:** In the output grid, draw a vertical line using the color green (value 3). This line should span the entire height of the grid and be positioned at the column coordinate obtained in step 1.

5. **Output:** return the output_grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
