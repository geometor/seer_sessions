Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Red Rows:** Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, check if it contains at least one red (2) pixel.
2. **Fill Identified Rows:** For each row identified in step 1, change the color of *all* pixels in that row to red (2).
3. **Clear Remaining Pixels:** For all other rows (those that *do not* contain any red pixels in the input), set all pixels in the output grid to white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

    """Transforms the input grid by filling rows containing red pixels with red and clearing others."""

    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)  # Initialize output_grid with zeros (white)

    # Iterate through rows

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
