The input grid contains various colors (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify the input significantly, retaining only one color (green/3) in a specific pattern. The most prominent change is the replacement of all non-green pixels with background color and the formation of a green vertical line, and a green horizontal line through the original green pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
