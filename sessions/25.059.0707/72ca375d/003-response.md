Okay, let's analyze this first example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 10x10 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The output is a 2x4 grid, also of single-digit integers.
*   There are distinct colored regions (objects) in the input grid: red (2), orange (7), and magenta (6).
*   The output grid seems to be related to the magenta (6) region in the input.
*    The output uses only colors present in the input, specifically color 6 and color 0.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    name: input_grid
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 2x4
    elements: integers (0-9)
    name: output_grid
  - type: object
    color: red (2)
    shape: irregular, contiguous
    location: top-left
  - type: object
    color: orange (7)
    shape: irregular, contiguous
    location: top-right
  - type: object
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: rectangle
    location: center, towards bottom
    dimensions: initially 4x2 (but see below)

actions:
  - type: selection
    criteria: color (magenta/6)
    target: input_grid
  - type: extraction
    source: selected region
    target: output_grid
  - type: cropping/resizing
    input_shape: selection from within object 6
    output_shape: 2x4

relationships:
    -   output grid contains a transformed part of the magenta object, possibly with its padding (0's).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Locate the contiguous region of magenta (6) pixels within the input grid.

2. **Isolate with Padding:** It looks like one row of 0's above and below the object of 6's are included and 1 column of 0's to the left and right of the object.

3.  **Extract:** Create the output by cropping the selection found in step 2.

In essence, the transformation isolates the region of magenta pixels in the original, keep 1 pixel of padding around it, and outputs this sub-grid.
