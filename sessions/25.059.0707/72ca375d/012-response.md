Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and correctly identified the transformation for that specific case: extracting a 2x2 yellow square. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the rule isn't universally a 2x2 square. The second example still returns the expected answer. But the third shows that a rectangle, in general, is appropriate. Our strategy should be:

1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Examine the input and output grids of all training examples to identify the common pattern. The current program is too specific (2x2 square).
2.  **Update `find_shape`:** Modify the existing `find_shape` function or logic. The dimensions are not constant.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the generalized transformation rule.
4.  Verify the third example again.

**Metrics and Observations**

I need to find the largest contiguous block of yellow color, its dimensions.
