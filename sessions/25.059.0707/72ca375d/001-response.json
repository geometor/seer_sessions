The input grids contain multiple rectangles of different colors and sizes, surrounded by a background of white (0). The output grids contain *only* one of these rectangles, maintaining its original shape and color, but potentially changing its position and size (by removing padding of 0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Record the color, size (width and height), and top-left corner position of each rectangle.\n\n2.  **Select Target Rectangle**:\n    *   In the first example, select the magenta (6) rectangle.\n    *   In the second example, select the yellow (4) rectangle.\n    *   In the third example, select the gray (5) rectangle.\n    The selection appears to be made choosing a unique color on the input grid.\n\n3.  **Extract and Resize:** Extract the selected rectangle. Remove any rows and columns along the edges of the extracted rectangle that consist entirely of '0' (white/background) pixels.\n\n4. **Output** The output is the smallest possible sub-grid containing the chosen rectangle.\n"
