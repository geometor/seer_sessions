Consider pixels connected horizontally and vertically as part of the same object.\n\n2. Determine Bounding Box: For each gray object, find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that completely encloses it.\n\n3. Create output grid of size 2 x 4\n    - Fill cells within gray object bounding box dimensions with value of 5, fill all other cells with 0.\n\n4.
