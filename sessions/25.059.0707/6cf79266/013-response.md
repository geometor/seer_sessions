Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are the same size (20x20).
*   The dominant colors are orange (7) and white (0).
*   There are a few instances of blue (1) in the output grid that are not in the input grid. These appear in the output where there is white(0).
*   The blue pixels appear in specific regions, specifically in 3x1 blocks.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 20x20
      colors: [0, 7, 1] # White, Orange, Blue
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      color: 7 # Orange
      shape: irregular
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 0   #white
  - type: inserted_block
    properties:
        color: 1 #blue
        shape: 3x1 rectangle

actions:
  - type: insert
    agent: unknown
    target: pixel
    object: inserted_block
    condition: "target pixel is white and surrounded by orange in specific pattern."

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Blue blocks are inserted within white regions surrounded by specific configurations of orange"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Regions:** Scan the input grid for white pixels (0).

2.  **Conditional Insertion:** For selected white areas, check its orange surrounding, if specific configuarations exist.
    Insert 3x1 blue (1) blocks at the bottom of the left, middle and right white areas.

3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (orange (7)) remain unchanged.
