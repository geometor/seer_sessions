The background color is one of the non-zero colors of the grid, let's say color C. The checkerboard alternates between C, and 0 (white). The location of C and 0 in the first cell is the same across input and output, in train\\_1, it is `C 0` on the top row, in others it could be different, e.g. in train\\_2, it is `3 3`.\n\n2.  **Identify Shape Insertion**: Find the position of where a 3x3 square of color 1 (azure) should appear. In input, search for where background pixels of color C exist. Then, change the background color of such cells to be `1`. Other cells remain unchanged.\n\nIn simple words. The output is mostly the same as input. The only changes are: find a sub-region of 3x3, all colored as C and change them to 1.\n"
