The input and output grids are the same dimensions (20x20). The dominant colors are green (3) and white (0). A small, 3x1 block of blue (1) pixels appears in the output grid where there were previously white (0) and green (3) in the input grid. The change isn't merely replacing all of any one color with another, so relative position is important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The shape in this example is a 3x1 block\n3.  **Apply Replacement:** In the input grid, within the identified region and shape, replace with color blue (1).\n4. **Copy Remainder:** Copy all other pixels from the input grid to the output grid unchanged.\n\nThe key here seems to be identifying an insertion point and region, and filling the predefined shape with blue (1).
