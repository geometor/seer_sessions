The first L-shape made of azure color is at row 2-3 and column 2-3, with one arm point to up, and one arm pointing to the right. The second object is at row 4-5, col 5-6, with one arm point up, and one arm point to left. The output grid contains the same two L-shaped azure color at the same location and shape as the input. In addition, the two vertexes' positions of the two azure L-shapes appear single-celled blue color.\n\n**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**\n\n1.  **Identify** all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve** these L-shaped objects in the output grid, maintaining their original positions and shapes.\n3.  **Locate** the vertex (the \"corner\" cell where the two arms of the L-shape meet) of each identified L-shape.\n4. **Introduce** the blue color at the location of the vertexes, as well as the location of the upper arm (the cell above the vertex).\n\nThis rule explains how to go from the input grid to the output grid.\n"
