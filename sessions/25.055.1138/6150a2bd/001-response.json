The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation and possibly a color change.  It's not a simple mirroring or reflection. The central pixel (7, orange) remains constant.  Pixels at corners seem to swap diagonally, and the edge pixels also seem to shift in a rotational pattern. The colors also appear to swap locations rather than transform.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
