## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7E2D8EE64460>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7E2D8EE65990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors.  The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation and possibly a color change.  It's not a simple mirroring or reflection. The central pixel (7, orange) remains constant.  Pixels at corners seem to swap diagonally, and the edge pixels also seem to shift in a rotational pattern. The colors also appear to swap locations rather than transform.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: represented by integer value
      position: row and column index
  - transformation: rotation
    type: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90
  - observation: central pixel remains unchanged
    input_position: (1,1)
    output_position: (1,1)
  - observation: corner pixels swap diagonally
  - observation: edge pixels rotate
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Locate the pixel at the center of the grid (row 1, column 1). This pixel's color and position remain unchanged in the output.

2.  **Rotate Counter-Clockwise:** Imagine rotating the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    - input grid top left becomes output grid bottom left.
    - input grid top center, becomes the output grid left center
    - input top right becomes the output bottom left.
    - and so on.

3.  The output grid reflects a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation of each pixel value of the original grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
