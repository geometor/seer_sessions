Okay, here's a breakdown of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous objects of azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous object is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Process Each Object:** For each identified azure object:
    *   Find the rightmost pixel within that object. If there are multiple pixels sharing a maximal x position, use the one with lowest y.

3. **Change Color of Right Most Pixel** Change the color of the right most pixel in the identified object to blue (color 1).

4.  **Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid, with the color of the right-most azure pixel updated.

**Observations in Relation to Previous Code and Errors:**

*   The provided code attempts to implement the above logic, but there were errors.
*   The `get_last_pixel` function prioritizes maximizing x for last pixel. The tie breaking logic must select minimal y.

**Summary of Transformation:**

The transformation identifies all azure colored objects and changes the color of the rightmost pixel of those objects to blue.
