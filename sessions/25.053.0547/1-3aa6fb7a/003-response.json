A contiguous object is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n2.  **Process Each Object:** For each identified azure object:\n    *   Find the rightmost pixel within that object. If there are multiple pixels sharing a maximal x position, use the one with lowest y.\n\n3. **Change Color of Right Most Pixel** Change the color of the right most pixel in the identified object to blue (color 1).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid, with the color of the right-most azure pixel updated.\n\n**Observations in Relation to Previous Code and Errors:**\n\n*   The provided code attempts to implement the above logic, but there were errors.\n*   The `get_last_pixel` function prioritizes maximizing x for last pixel. The tie breaking logic must select minimal y.\n\n**Summary of Transformation:**\n\nThe transformation identifies all azure colored objects and changes the color of the rightmost pixel of those objects to blue.\n"
