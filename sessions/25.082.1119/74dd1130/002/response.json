This suggests a misunderstanding of the transformation rule, or possibly, multiple rules at play, or, a more complex single rule. The consistent failure, with varying `pixels_off` counts, indicates that the transformation is not simply a column swap. It's crucial to examine *where* the differences occur to discern a more accurate pattern. The sizes are always correct, and the color palettes seem consistent, so the core issue lies in the pixel arrangement/re-coloring. My strategy is first to re-examine the original prompt and then look very closely at the expected input and output pairs.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis:**\n\nI'll use manual visual inspection alongside python tools to better understand the input and output. Here I will focus on comparing the actual output vs expected output.\n"
