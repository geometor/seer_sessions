There are two such objects, both L-shaped and 2x2 in size.\n\n2.  **Insert Blue Pixel:**\n    *   For each L-Shaped Azure Object, imagine you insert a pixel of color 1 (blue) inside.\n    *   This pixel is located at the intersection of the internal sides of the L-Shape.\n\n3. Preserve everyting else.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\n1. Find all L-shaped azure objects (color 8).\n2. For each such object, find the cell where a blue pixel (color 1) should be placed:\n   a. The coordinate can be determined by looking for the intersection of the L shape, or the position \"inside\" the corner of the shape.\n3. Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n4. Paint the identified coordinates to blue (color 1).\n```\n"
