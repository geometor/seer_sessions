An isolated cell means that none of its eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) are also azure.\n\n2.  **Sort by Row:** Sort the isolated azure cells based on their row index, from top to bottom.\n\n3.  **Topmost Azure Cell:** For the topmost isolated azure cell (the one with the smallest row index), place a blue (color 1) cell immediately to its right. If the azure cell is at the rightmost edge of the grid, do nothing for this specific cell.\n\n4.  **Other Azure Cells:** For all other isolated azure cells (i.e., all except the topmost), place a blue (color 1) cell immediately to their left. If an azure cell is at the leftmost edge of the grid, do nothing for that specific cell.\n\n5. **No other Changes**: All other cells in the input should remain untouched.\n\n**Explanation of why the previous code failed:**\nThe previous code correctly identified the isolated azure cells and sorted them. It also implemented logic for inserting blue cells. However, it has not produced the right output. The issue lies in the fact that, while all other conditions are met, the code does not transform at all the input into the correct output. The code did not account for the insertion of the blue cell.\n"
