Okay, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  example_1:
    input:
      objects:
        - color: 8 (azure)
          instances:
            - shape: single cell
              position: (1, 1) # row, col
            - shape: L-shape (2x2 block missing one cell)
              position: Top-left corner at (2, 1)
            - shape: L-shape (2x2 block missing one cell)
              position: Top-left corner at (3, 4)
            - shape: single cell
              position: (4, 5)
      
    output:
        objects:
        - color: 8 (azure)
          instances:
            - shape: single cell
              position: (1, 1)
            - shape: L-shape (2x2 block missing one cell)
              position:  Top-left corner at (2, 1)
            - shape: L-shape (2x2 block missing one cell)
              position: Top-left corner at (3, 4)
            - shape: single cell
              position: (4, 5)
        - color: 1 (blue)
          instances:
            - shape: single cell
              position: (1,2)
            - shape: single cell
              position: (4,4)
  example_2:
    input:
      objects:
       - color: 8
         instances:
           - shape: L (two cells)
             position: Top-left at (0, 4)
           - shape: single
             position: (1, 5)
           - shape: single
             position: (2, 2)
           - shape: L (two cells)
             position: Top-left at (3, 2)
           - shape: single
             position: (5, 4)
           - shape: L (two cells)
             position: Top-left at (6,3)
    output:
      objects:
       - color: 8
         instances:
           - shape: L (two cells)
             position: Top-left at (0, 4)
           - shape: single
             position: (1, 5)
           - shape: single
             position: (2, 2)
           - shape: L (two cells)
             position: Top-left at (3, 2)
           - shape: single
             position: (5, 4)
           - shape: L (two cells)
             position: Top-left at (6,3)
       - color: 1
         instances:
           - shape: single
             position: (1, 4)
           - shape: single
             position: (2,3)
           - shape: single
             position: (5,3)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule)**

1.  **Identify Isolated Azure Cells:** Locate all isolated azure (color 8) cells in the input grid. An isolated cell is one that has no adjacent cells of the same color, including diagonals.

2.  **Sort by Row:** Sort the identified isolated azure cells by their row number, from top to bottom.

3.  **Topmost Isolated Azure:** For the topmost isolated azure cell, place a blue (color 1) cell directly to its *right*.

4. **All other Isolated Azure:** For every other isolated azure cell, place a blue (color 1) cell directly to the *left*.

5.  **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure that when placing blue cells, we do not exceed the boundaries of the grid. If placing a blue cell would go out of bounds, skip that placement.

The previous code was close but missed key parts of the rule: It only dealt with "Top" and "Bottom", but did not place to the left of *every other* isolated azure object. It also used the last object, instead of placing it relative to each object.
