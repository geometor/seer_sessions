An isolated cell is one that has no adjacent cells of the same color, including diagonals.\n\n2.  **Sort by Row:** Sort the identified isolated azure cells by their row number, from top to bottom.\n\n3.  **Topmost Isolated Azure:** For the topmost isolated azure cell, place a blue (color 1) cell directly to its *right*.\n\n4. **All other Isolated Azure:** For every other isolated azure cell, place a blue (color 1) cell directly to the *left*.\n\n5.  **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure that when placing blue cells, we do not exceed the boundaries of the grid. If placing a blue cell would go out of bounds, skip that placement.\n\nThe previous code was close but missed key parts of the rule: It only dealt with \"Top\" and \"Bottom\", but did not place to the left of *every other* isolated azure object. It also used the last object, instead of placing it relative to each object.\n"
