The transformation rule involves the addition of two blue cells (color 1) in specific positions relative to isolated azure cells. One blue cell is placed to the right of the top-isolated azure cell, and the other is placed to the left of the lower-isolated azure cell. The two azure vertical rectangles do not seem to have any influence over the transformation.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
