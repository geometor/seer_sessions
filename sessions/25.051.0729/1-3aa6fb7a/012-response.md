Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.

**Analysis of the Failed Examples**

The previous code failed because it didn't correctly identify *isolated* azure cells. The `is_isolated` function was intended to check for diagonal adjacency as well, but it only checked neighbors, not all same-color cells. Therefore it computed an incorrect list of isolated azure cells. It considered some azure cells as isolate even if they are contiguous to other same-color cells.

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Identify Isolated Azure Cells:** An azure cell is considered isolated if it's not part of a contiguous group of azure cells, considering both direct (up, down, left, right) and diagonal neighbors.

2.  **Sort Isolated Cells:** Order the isolated azure cells by their row index (top to bottom). If two cells are on the same row index, use the column to decide (left to right).

3.  **Place Blue Cell for Topmost Isolated Azure:** For the topmost isolated azure cell, place a blue cell (color 1) immediately to its right. If the right side is the border, skip this cell.

4.  **Place Blue Cell for Remaining Isolated Azure Cells:** For all other isolated azure cells (after the topmost), place a blue cell (color 1) immediately to their left. If the left side is the border, skip.

**Improved Python Implementation (Conceptual - to be coded in the next turn)**

The code needs the following improvements.

1.  **Correct `find_isolated_cells`:**  The `find_isolated_cells` function must correctly identify isolated azure cells. The current implementation is flawed. We need to implement a connected component labeling or flood fill to identify groups of adjacent cells. The isolated cells will be groups of 1 azure cell.

2. No other changes are needed.

The core logic of placing blue cells to the right of the topmost and to the left of the others is correct, *given* that the isolated cells are correctly identified.
