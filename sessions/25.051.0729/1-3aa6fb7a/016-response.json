            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.\n\n**Analysis of the Failed Examples:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it didn't correctly identify \"isolated\" azure cells considering the *diagonal* neighbors. It only checked for horizontal and vertical neighbors when determining isolation, and incorrectly placed blue cells. The sorting and the logic of adding a blue to the right of the first azure cell and left to all others seem to be right *if* isolation is understood.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation, focusing on objects, predicates, and actions:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects are cells of specific colors. We are particularly interested in azure (color 8) and blue (color 1) cells.\n\n2.  **Predicate: Isolation:** Determine which azure cells are \"isolated\". An azure cell is considered isolated if *none* of its eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) are also azure.\n\n3.  **Sort Isolated Cells:** If there are multiple isolated azure cells, sort them based on their position. The sorting is done first by row (top-to-bottom) and then by column (left-to-right).\n\n4. **Action: Topmost Placement:**\n    *   Find the topmost isolated azure cell.\n    *   If there is an empty cell immediately to the *right* of this topmost isolated azure cell, place a blue cell (color 1) in that empty cell.\n\n5.  **Action: Remaining Isolated Cells Placement:**\n    * For every *other* isolated azure cell (i.e., all except the topmost), check if the cell to the *left* is free.\n    *   If there is an empty cell immediately to the *left* of this isolated azure cell, place a blue cell (color 1) there.\n\n6. **Output:** No changes for all other cells. The output grid is identical to the input, except for added blue cells near the isolated azure cells.\n\n**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**\n\n*   **Diagonal Isolation:** The core issue was the definition of \"isolated\". The updated description explicitly states that diagonal neighbors are considered.\n*    **Empty Space Consideration:** The program specifically defines adding a new blue object near an isolated azure object only if the place is empty.\n\nThe Python code already implements these rules once the definition of isolation is corrected to include diagonal neighbors.\n"
