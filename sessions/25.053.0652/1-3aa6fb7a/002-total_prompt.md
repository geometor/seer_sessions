Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and the deduced transformation rule:


```yaml
facts:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 8: azure
  - output_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 1: blue
    - 8: azure
  - object_description: Two separate azure colored objects. One is a vertical line, the other is mirrored horizontal.
  - object_change: A single azure pixel changed to blue.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a vertical line of length 2 in the second column. The other is two horizontal lines on the right-hand side, 2 pixels in length and mirrored about the horizontal center.

2.  **Identify Action:** A single azure pixel is changed to blue.

3. **Determine Rule for Change**: Scanning the azure shapes, the center-most single pixel changes color to blue.

4. **Transformation:** Apply the rule - locate the centermost azure pixel of all the azure pixels and change to color to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
