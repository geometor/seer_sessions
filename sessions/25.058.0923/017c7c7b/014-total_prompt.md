Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The primary change seems to be a color substitution, and possibly an expansion of the grid along the y-axis. The single vertical line of blue pixels becomes red and also seems to double in the y dimension.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, blue]
      dimensions: [6, 3]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, red]
      dimensions: [9, 3]
  - name: blue_line
    type: object
    properties:
      color: blue
      shape: vertical line
      location: column 2
  - name: red_line
    type: object
    properties:
      color: red
      shape: vertical line
      location: column 2

actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    input: blue_line
    output: red_line
  - type: vertical_expansion
    input: red_line
    details: adding 3 rows. original size is doubled and then three rows inserted

relationships:
  - input_grid contains blue_line
  - output_grid contains red_line
  - blue_line transforms to red_line

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Substitute:** Change the color of all pixels in the blue line from blue (1) to red (2).
3. **Expand**: Add three rows of red (2) to the bottom of the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
