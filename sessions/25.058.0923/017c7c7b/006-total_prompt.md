"""
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
If a pixel is blue (1), change it to red (2) in the output grid.
If a pixel is white (0), keep it white (0) in the output grid.
If a pixel is another color, keep it the same in the output grid.
Add one new row to the bottom of the output grid. The values of this row may change based on patterns seen in the other values of the input grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly handles the color change (blue to red) and maintains other colors, as observed in the first example. However, it fails to accurately predict the content of the newly added row. The current implementation adds a row of zeros, except for the last entry, which is 2. This is a simplistic placeholder and needs to be revised based on patterns observed across *all* training examples. The core issue is that we haven't yet identified the rule governing the last row. We need to shift our focus from the simple color change to discerning the logic behind the added row.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed)**

To understand the pattern in the bottom row, I need to examine the input and output grids side-by-side and look for relationships.

*Example 1*
Input:
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1]]
```

Output:
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [0 0 0 0 0 2]]
```
The last row of the provided output is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]` but the generated output will match it, because it was created from this example.

*Example 2*

Input:
```
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 1 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
```

Output:
```
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [2 2 2 2 2]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 2]]
```

The code correctly changes the blue row (1) to a red row (2).
The added row in the *actual* output is `[0 0 0 0 2]`.  The generated output will match this.

*Example 3*

Input:
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

Output:

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [2 2 2 2 2 2 2]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 2]]
```
The added row in the *actual* output is `[0 0 0 0 0 0 2]`.  The generated output will match this.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Blue (1) pixels in the input grid are transformed to red (2) pixels in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Pixels that are not blue in the input grid retain their original color in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      An additional row is added to the bottom of the output grid.
  - observation: |
      In all training examples, the last element of the added row is red (2).
  - observation: |
      All other elements of the added row, except for the last, are white (0).
  - input_objects:
    - object_1: rows of pixels of various colors
  - output_objects:
      - object_1: rows of pixels, some with blue pixels changed to red
      - object_2: a new row with all white pixels except for the last one, which is red

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Color Transformation:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is blue (1), change it to red (2) in the output grid. Otherwise, keep the pixel's original color in the output grid.

2.  **Row Addition:** Add a new row to the bottom of the output grid.

3.  **New Row Population:** Fill the new row as follows: All the pixels of the newly added row are white (0) except for the last pixel in the row, change that pixel's value to a red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
