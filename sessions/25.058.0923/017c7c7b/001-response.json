The input grid contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The dimensions of the output grid seem to be larger than the input grid,specifically one row looks added to the bottom of the grid. The core transformation seems to involve changing the blue pixels to red and adding extra lines of output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
