Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
If a pixel is blue (1), change it to red (2) in the output grid.
If a pixel is white (0), keep it white (0) in the output grid.
If a pixel is another color, keep it the same in the output grid.
Add one new row to the bottom of the output grid. The values of this row may change based on patterns seen in the other values of the input grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
