The input grid contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The primary change seems to be a color substitution, and possibly an expansion of the grid along the y-axis. The single vertical line of blue pixels becomes red and also seems to double in the y dimension.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
