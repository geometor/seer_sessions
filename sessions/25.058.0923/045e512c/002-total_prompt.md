Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored objects within a grid. The primary colors involved are azure (8), green (3), and red (2), all on a background of white (0). The input contains distinct shapes formed by these colors. The output seems to modify these shapes, specifically by extending or replicating them, sometimes changing their structure significantly.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
    - id: shape_1
      color: azure (8)
      type: irregular rectangle
      initial_position: (7,6) # Top-left corner
      initial_dimensions: (3x3) # Height x Width

    - id: shape_2
      color: green (3)
      type: single pixel
      initial_position: (7,10)
      initial_dimensions: (1x1)

    - id: shape_3
      color: red (2)
      type: irregular rectangle
      initial_position: (11,6)
      initial_dimensions: (3x3)
  - actions:
    - type: replication and extension
      target: shape_1
      details: Replicated and extended to the right, maintaining original height, width varies.

    - type: replication and extension
      target: shape_2
      details:  Replicated multiple times to the right, creating a horizontal line, length increases.

    - type: replication and extension
      target: shape_3
      details: Replicated multiple times and filled to make the object taller. Replicated downwards also.

  - relationships:
    - shape_1 and shape_2 are horizontally aligned, some distance.
    - shape_3 independent from others.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-white pixels. Note their color, shape, and position.
2.  **Process Azure (8) Objects:** For each azure object, extend it to the right. Maintain the original height. Increase the length, creating a horizontal series of the shape's height.
3.  **Process Green (3) Objects:** For each green object, extend it *to the right*. Create a series of repetitions, forming a horizontal line. The output object is many times larger, the length of repetition is large and uniform.
4. **Process Red (2) Objects:** For each red object. extend it *down*. Make multiple repetitions forming a vertical shape. Make similar repetition horizontally too.

Essentially, the transformation rule involves replicating and extending existing objects, mostly to the right and sometimes downwards, based on their initial color. The azure and green objects are only extended to the right, while the red ones are extended both horizontally and vertically.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
