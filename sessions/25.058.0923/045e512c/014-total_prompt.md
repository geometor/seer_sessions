Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 21x21 grid with a few distinct colored objects. There's a grey 'C' shaped object (color 5), a magenta object (color 6) at the top, and a blue object (color 1) below. Most of the grid is filled with white (color 0).
*   **Output:**  The grey 'C' object remains unchanged. The magenta object (6) is replicated multiple times, seemingly tracing a diagonal path both up and down from its original position, with some parts overlapping. The blue object (color 1) is also copied and spread, also forming diagonal shapes, but with the original shape more recognizable and expanded. The shapes created from replication have the same size as the original objects.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: 5  # Grey
    shape: C-shape
    initial_position: [7,6]
    action: Remains unchanged
  - id: 2
    color: 6  # Magenta
    shape: Single pixel, then replicated diagonally
    initial_position: [4,10]
    action: Replicated diagonally up and down
  - id: 3
    color: 1  # Blue
    shape: L-shape, then replicated
    initial_position: [11,10]
    action: Replicated, keeping shape, expands diagonally

grid_size: 21x21
background_color: 0 # White
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the grey 'C' shaped object (color 5), the magenta pixel (color 6), and the blue 'L' shaped object (color 1).
2.  **Grey Object (5):**  Keep the grey 'C' shaped object unchanged in its original position.
3.  **Magenta Object (6):** Replicate the magenta pixel diagonally. Create copies extending upwards and to the right, and downwards and to the left. Allow overlapping copies. It should be 2 copies upwards and 2 downwards, following the diagonal lines.
4.  **Blue Object (1):** Replicate the blue 'L' shaped object. The replication maintains the 'L' shape and seems to extend diagonally both upwards-right, and downwards-left. It should generate a 3x3 grid of 1s in a diagonal direction and a 2x2 downwards.

Essentially, the core concept appears to be replication and expansion of colored objects along diagonal lines, with the grey object as a static element.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
