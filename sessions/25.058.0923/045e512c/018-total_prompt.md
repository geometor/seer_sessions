```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate three distinct objects: a grey "C" shaped object (color 5), a magenta pixel (color 6), and a blue "L" shaped object (color 1).
2.  **Grey Object Transformation:** The grey "C" shaped object remains unchanged in both position and shape.
3.  **Magenta Pixel Transformation:** The magenta pixel replicates. One new magenta pixel appears one step diagonally upwards and to the right. A second new magenta pixel is created two steps down and two to the left of the original. A third magenta pixel is created one step down, and to the left of the original magenta pixel.
4.  **Blue "L" Object Transformation:** The blue "L" shaped object replicates diagonally. It expands one unit upwards and to the right, and one unit down and to the left maintaining its "L" shape.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While it performed correctly on that specific instance, the subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors in other examples. This indicates that the initial program was too specific and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformations.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair where the code failed. Identify the specific discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output of the `transform` function.
2.  **Object Identification and Tracking:** Accurately identify and track each distinct object across all examples. Pay close attention to their initial and final states (position, shape, color).
3.  **Rule Generalization:** Based on the error analysis and object tracking, generalize the transformation rules. The goal is to find rules that apply consistently across *all* training examples, not just the first one.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the generalized rules. The description should be precise and unambiguous, covering all observed object transformations.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** We expect to go through several iterations as new information is considered.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output with the code's output. I'll use numpy to help with calculations.

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Checks if two grids are identical and returns a diff."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Different Shapes"
    else:
        diff = grid1 != grid2
        if np.any(diff):
          return np.array(np.where(diff)).T # coordinates of different cells
        else:
          return "Identical"

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - id: grey_c
    color: grey (5)
    shape: C-shape
    behavior: Static

  - id: magenta_pixel
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: Single pixel
    behavior: Replicates diagonally up-right, and down-left. One of the replica is placed one step diagonally upwards and to the right of original magenta pixel. The other replica is place one step down and to the left of the original magenta pixel

  - id: blue_l
    color: blue (1)
    shape: L-shape
    behavior: Replicates diagonally up-right, extending the vertical line of the L.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find three distinct objects: a grey "C" shaped object (color 5), a magenta pixel (color 6), and a blue "L" shaped object (color 1).

2.  **Grey Object Transformation:** The grey "C" shaped object remains unchanged in both position and shape.

3.  **Magenta Pixel Transformation:** The magenta pixel replicates *twice*. One replica appears one step diagonally *upwards and to the right* of the original. The second replica appears one step *downwards and to the left* of the original.

4.  **Blue "L" Object Transformation:** The blue "L" shaped object extends its vertical component diagonally. It adds one blue pixel *upwards and to the right*, and one blue pixel *downwards and to the left*, maintaining its original shape and relative position to the "L" shape. The extension is only for the "vertical bar" of the L shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
