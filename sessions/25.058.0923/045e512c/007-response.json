The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels. The cross shape is not centered and may or may not exist in the input grid.\n*   **Output:** The output grid seems to expand and replicate, in a mirrored and colored fashion, the significant pixels of the cross shape from the input. Yellow pixels appear to replicate and form lines, the other colors are replicated in mirrored cross patterns along those lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
