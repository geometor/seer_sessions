            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observing a \"cross\" shape expansion. It correctly identified the blue pixel as the center and attempted to replicate red and yellow pixels based on their relative positions to the center.  It then fills in between the replicated red lines. However, the replication logic and filling logic isn't generalized.  It appears the previous attempt focused mostly on Example 0. We will address other examples.  The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Verifying Core Assumptions:** Re-examine each example to confirm the blue pixel is always the center of the transformation and what rules govern replication.\n2.  **Precise Relative Positioning:** Develop a robust way to identify the relative positions of the red and yellow pixels *without* hardcoding offsets, since distances might vary in more complex tasks.\n3.  **Generalized Replication:** The replication logic needs to work based on detected patterns (e.g., mirroring, symmetry) and not fixed offsets.  The current approach assumes specific arrangements and line configurations\n4.  **Refine Filling Logic**.  The fill logic must correctly generalize.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nI'll use code execution to gather information about the grids and the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef
