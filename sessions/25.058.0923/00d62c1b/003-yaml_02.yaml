objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      rows: variable (integer)
      columns: variable (integer)
      colors: [0-9] # Representing different colors

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
       color: integer (0-9)
       row: integer
       col: integer
       adjacent_pixels: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: change_color
    precondition:
      - object: pixel
        property: color
        value: 3 # Green
      - object: pixel
        relation: diagonally_adjacent
        target: pixel
        property: color
        value: 3 # Green
    operation:
      - set object.color to 4 #Yellow
      - condition: if source pixel is 'upper-left' compared to target pixel

comparisons:
    - name: upper-left
      description: a pixel is upper-left relative to another if it's row is less, or row is same and col is less.
      type: coordinate
      logic: (row1 < row2) or (row1 == row2 and col1 < col2)
