Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all connected components of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** green connected component:
    a.  **Determine** the bounding box of the component. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle (defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners) that completely encloses the green component.
    b. **Identify** all of the green pixels that would be contained within the extent of the bounding box.
    c.  **Change** the color of the internal green pixels within the bounding box to yellow (4).
3.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
