Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all connected components of green (3) pixels.
2.  **For each** green connected component, **identify** the "internal" green pixels. An internal pixel is defined as a green pixel that is completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right - 4-connectivity). It will not be on the edge of the green region, by definition.
3.  **Change** the color of some of the identified internal green pixels to yellow (4). Starting from the top left, fill horizontally and stop when a different color is hit and do the same vertically and fill vertically.
4.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying green connected components and then attempting to fill "internal" pixels with yellow. However, the "filling" logic (changing the color of *some* internal green pixels to yellow) is not precise and does not accurately capture the transformation observed in all the examples. It looks like we are filling horizontal or vertical lines, but need to fill a rectangle, defined by edge pixels.

The core issue is that the current implementation only fills parts of the internal area. The rule isn't simply "fill *some* internal pixels horizontally and vertically from top left". Instead the correct strategy should be to identify the *bounding box* of each connected green component and change specific "internal" green cells to yellow, defined relative to the boundaries of the component.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered via code execution (I'll describe the process conceptually, as I can't directly execute code here).

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output_grid):
    """
    Analyzes the results and provides metrics.  Returns a dictionary
    of analysis data.
    """
    analysis = {}
    analysis['input_shape'] = input_grid.shape
    analysis['output_shape'] = output_grid.shape
    analysis['expected_output_shape'] = expected_output_grid.shape

    analysis['input_green_count'] = np.sum(input_grid == 3)
    analysis['output_green_count'] = np.sum(output_grid == 3)
    analysis['expected_output_green_count'] = np.sum(expected_output_grid == 3)
     
    analysis['input_yellow_count'] = np.sum(input_grid == 4)
    analysis['output_yellow_count'] = np.sum(output_grid == 4)
    analysis['expected_output_yellow_count'] = np.sum(expected_output_grid == 4)
    
    analysis['correct_pixels'] = np.sum(output_grid == expected_output_grid)
    analysis['total_pixels'] = output_grid.size
    analysis['accuracy'] = analysis['correct_pixels'] / analysis['total_pixels']
    
    return analysis

# Example Usage (replace with actual data for each example)
# Assuming you have loaded: input_grid, output_grid, expected_output_grid
# results = analyze_results(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output_grid)
# print(results)
```

I will describe the conceptual output of `analyze_results` for each training example.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml

  - object: green_connected_component
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - shape: variable  # Can be any shape
      - bounding_box: definable # A rectangle enclosing the component
    actions:
      - find_bounding_box:
          description: Determine the smallest rectangle containing all green pixels of the component.
      - fill_internal_area:
          description: Change the color of internal green pixels within bounding box, defined by extent, to yellow.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** all connected components of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** green connected component:
    a.  **Determine** the bounding box of the component. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle (defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners) that completely encloses the green component.
    b. **Identify** all of the green pixels that would be contained within the extent of the bounding box.
    c.  **Change** the color of the internal green pixels within the bounding box to yellow (4).
3.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
