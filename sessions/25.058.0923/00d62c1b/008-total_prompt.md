Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3).
*   The output introduces a single yellow (4) pixel.
*   The green pixels in the input form a somewhat irregular shape.
*   The yellow pixel in the output appears within the area occupied by the green shape, specifically, near the "center" of the mass of green pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    color_values:
      white: 0
      green: 3
      yellow: 4
  - type: shape
    color: green
    description: Irregular contiguous block of green pixels

actions:
  - type: locate_center
    input: green shape
    output: coordinates
  - type: change_color
    input: pixel coordinates, original color, new color
    output: modified grid

relationships:
    - input grid contains a green shape
    - output grid is identical to the input grid except for one pixel
    - the changed pixel's coordinates are related to the "center" of the green shape
    - the changed pixel's color changes from green to yellow
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the green shape:** Find all green (3) pixels in the input grid that form a contiguous block.
2.  **Locate a "center":** Inspect the shape to find a pixel within it that meets a criteria (to be better defined) for center. It seems in this case that it is a pixel in the shape that does not touch the outer boundary.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified "center" pixel from green (3) to yellow (4).
4.  **Preserve the rest:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

Essentially the program find a green shape, and changes one green pixel in that shape to yellow. The selection criteria is the element that is to be defined better.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
