It seems in this case that it is a pixel in the shape that does not touch the outer boundary.\n3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified \"center\" pixel from green (3) to yellow (4).\n4.  **Preserve the rest:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially the program find a green shape, and changes one green pixel in that shape to yellow.
