The input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and color 3 (green). The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that some of the green pixels (3) adjacent to other green pixels are changed to color 4 (yellow). The change seems to happen specifically where two green pixels connect diagonally.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
