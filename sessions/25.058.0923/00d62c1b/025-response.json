The input grid primarily contains pixels of value 0 (white) and 3 (green). The output grid introduces pixels of value 4 (yellow) in specific locations within the green regions. The overall shape of the green regions appears mostly unchanged, but some green pixels have been replaced by yellow ones. The transformation seems to be focused on the internal parts of green connected components.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

An internal pixel is defined as a green pixel that is completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right - 4-connectivity). It will not be on the edge of the green region, by definition.\n3.  **Change** the color of some of the identified internal green pixels to yellow (4). Starting from the top left, fill horizontally and stop when a different color is hit and do the same vertically and fill vertically.\n4.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the transformation fills the inner regions of the existing green areas with yellow, the boundaries of the green areas should stay as they are.\n"
