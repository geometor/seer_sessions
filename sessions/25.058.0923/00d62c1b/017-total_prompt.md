Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all pixels with the value '3' (green) within the input grid. These pixels collectively form the 'green_shape'. Note that the green shape might consist of multiple disconnected parts.
2.  **Find the Largest Solid Central Rectangle:** Within the 'green_shape', identify the largest *solid* rectangular sub-region. This means:
    *   The rectangle must be composed entirely of green pixels.
    *   It should be the largest possible rectangle fitting this criterion.
    *   It should include all rows and columns that form a continuous section of green pixels.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of all pixels within this identified largest solid central rectangle from '3' (green) to '4' (yellow).
4.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixels within the identified largest solid central rectangle, which are now yellow.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
