Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 20x20 grid of pixels. The input grid primarily contains pixels of value 0 (white) and 3 (green). The output grid introduces pixels of value 4 (yellow) in specific locations within the green regions. The overall shape of the green regions appears mostly unchanged, but some green pixels have been replaced by yellow ones. The transformation seems to be focused on the internal parts of green connected components.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    color: white # 0
    property: static
  - name: green_region
    color: green # 3
    property: connected_component
    action: modified
  - name: yellow_fill
    color: yellow # 4
    property: internal_fill
    relationship: within green_region

actions:
  - name: fill
    target: green_region
    agent: yellow_fill
    condition: internal_pixels

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: yellow pixels are surrounded by green pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all connected components of green (3) pixels.
2.  **For each** green connected component, **identify** the "internal" green pixels. An internal pixel is defined as a green pixel that is completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right - 4-connectivity). It will not be on the edge of the green region, by definition.
3.  **Change** the color of some of the identified internal green pixels to yellow (4). Starting from the top left, fill horizontally and stop when a different color is hit and do the same vertically and fill vertically.
4.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation fills the inner regions of the existing green areas with yellow, the boundaries of the green areas should stay as they are.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
