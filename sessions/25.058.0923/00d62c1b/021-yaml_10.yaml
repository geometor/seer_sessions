      description: Change the color of a pixel.
      preconditions:
        - The pixel is green.
        - The pixel is part of a 2x2 green block.
        - The pixel is at the top-left corner of a 2x2 green block.
      postconditions:
        - The pixel's color changes to yellow.

  context: |
    The input is a grid of colored pixels.
    The transformation identifies 2x2 blocks of green pixels.  Within these
    blocks, it seems like specifically the top-left green pixel is changed to
    yellow.  If there is no 2x2 block, no change is made.
