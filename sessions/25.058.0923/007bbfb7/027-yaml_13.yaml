        description: |
          The input grid is replicated to form the output grid with specific
          tiling and blank insertion
        parameters:
          - source: input_grid
          - destination: output_grid
          - pattern:  The first, third, and seventh rows and columns of the
            output grid are copies of the input grid
          - blank_insertion: row index 1, 3, 5, 7 and column index 1, 3, 5, 7 of
            the 9x9 output grid are all 0 (color white)
