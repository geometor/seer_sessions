Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a report summarizing the analysis of the provided code, example results, and proposed updates to the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept of the transformation: expanding each pixel in the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid. The provided code accurately implements this transformation. The verification results across all training examples confirm that the code performs as expected, and there are no errors. The strategy is sound, and no error resolution is needed. We just need to re-iterate the final natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To be absolutely certain, I'll use a simple check here. I don't need to use code execution, because the notebook already provides a perfect match report. But this is good practice.

Example 1:
- Input shape: (2, 2)
- Output shape: (6, 6)
- Result: Perfect match.

Example 2:
- Input shape: (7, 5)
- Output shape: (21, 15)
- Result: Perfect match.

Example 3:
- Input shape: (1, 1)
- Output shape: (3, 3)
- Result: Perfect match.

Example 4:
-Input shape: (5,2)
- Output shape: (15,6)
- Result: Perfect match

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule performs a pixel-by-pixel expansion of the input grid. Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of pixels of the *same* color in the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are three times the dimensions of the input grid. The color of each pixel in the input grid is preserved in the corresponding 3x3 block of the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
