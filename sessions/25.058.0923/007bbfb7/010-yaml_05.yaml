  - name: grid_expansion
    factor: 3x
    description: The input grid is expanded by a factor of 3 in both height and width.

  - name: yellow_replication
    condition: "presence of yellow pixels"
    description: >
      Yellow pixels in the input grid trigger a replication pattern in the output grid.
      Each yellow pixel becomes the top-left corner of a 3x3 block. If a yellow pixel
      exists, it's guaranteed a block will be formed around it.

  - name: black_filling
    condition: "absence of other colors"
    description:  Areas not filled by the yellow replication are filled with black pixels.
