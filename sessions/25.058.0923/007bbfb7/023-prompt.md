Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input 3x3 grid is used as a tile to construct a larger 9x9 output grid. The input grid is replicated nine times in a 3x3 arrangement, effectively tiling the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a 9x9 array filled with zeros (white).
    output_grid = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=int)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Tile the input grid to create the output grid
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            # Calculate the starting row and column indices for placing the input grid tile.
            row_start = i * input_height
            col_start = j * input_width

            # Place the input grid tile into the output grid.
            output_grid[row_start:row_start + input_height, col_start:col_start + input_width] = input_grid

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
