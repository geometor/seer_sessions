Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved creating vertical stripes with a specific number of white stripes followed by colored stripes. The logic doesn't hold consistently across all examples. The multiplication factor of 3 for calculating the dimensions is not the general rule, and is failing because examples 2 and 3 don't have an output of 3 times the size of their input.

The core issue is that the rule for constructing vertical stripes has edge cases we don't handle correctly, and we should consider the relationship between colors and their position in the input and output. It also appears there are special cases when the grid's width and/or height are equal to 2.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, noting the dimensions, colors, object positions, and the apparent transformation. I will run the code and compare.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint exactly where the current code's output deviates from the expected output.
3.  **Refine the Rule:**  Adjust the natural language program to reflect the observed patterns more accurately.
4. **YAML documentation:** prepare a YAML block that can provide useful information to coder in the next phase.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the code's output, and observations:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)
    *   Input Colors: 0, 1
    *   Output Colors: 0, 1
    *   Code Output Matches Expected: True

*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input Shape: (3, 2)
    *   Output Shape: (9, 6)
    *   Input Colors: 0, 2
    *   Output Colors: 0, 2
    *   Code Output Matches Expected: False. The dimensions calculation did not handle this shape correctly.

*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input Shape: (2, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 9)
    *   Input Colors: 0, 3
    *   Output Colors: 0, 3
    *   Code Output Matches Expected: False. The dimensions calculation did not handle this shape correctly.

  example_3:

    output_shape: [6, 9]
    input_colors: [0, 3]
    output_colors: [0, 3]

    discrepancy: "Incorrect shape and stripe counts. Incorrect factor logic."
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

The output grid's dimensions are determined by multiplying each of the input dimensions by a factor. The x dimension is multiplied by the input's x dimension plus 1. The y dimension is multiplied by the input's y dimension plus 1. The output grid consists of vertical stripes. The first few stripes are white (0). The remaining stripes have the same color as the non-zero color in the input, and the number of these colored stripes corresponds to the number of cells along one side of the input grid. When an input dimension is 2, then instead of the number of white stripes being the input's related dimension value it is that value plus one.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
