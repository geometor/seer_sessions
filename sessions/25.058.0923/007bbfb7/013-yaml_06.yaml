objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 9x9
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color_values: [0, 2]
        color_names: [white, red]

transformations:
  - type: expansion
    factor: 3  # Linear dimension expansion factor
    rules:
     - replicate_and_expand #The object is expanded by three and the other elements are filled with 0.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains red pixels in specific positions.
  - output_grid: red pixels are placed in a patterned arrangement, correlated with their original positions in the input grid, other positions are zero
