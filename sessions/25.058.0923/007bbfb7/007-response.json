The scaling is performed such that the original top-left corner cell (0, 0) remains in the top left corner of the new grid, and each occupied cell creates an expanded pattern, replicating its position.\n    The expanded patter appears to perform these steps for a pixel at (r,c) in input\n      - replicate the pixel at output grid position r \\* 3, c \\* 3\n      - skip two rows, then set another instance of the pixel at r \\* 3 + 2, c \\* 3 + 1 if that pixel was in the lower left corner (r = original_height - 1, c = (original_width - 1) / 2)\n      - skip two cols, then set another instance of the pixel at r \\* 3, c \\* 3 + 2 if that pixel was at the end of the first row(r = 0, c = original_width - 1)\n      - skip one row, two cols, set another pixel at r\\*3 + 2, c \\*3 + 1\n    *   If the input cell is white (0), all corresponding cells in the output grid remain white (0).\n\nIn simpler terms the rule can be stated, replace each pixel with 9, using the color of the input pixel. If the original pixel was color 4, fill some of these with color 4, according to these rules:\nThe top left, top right, and bottom middle positions get the color of the pixel, and every other cell is 0.\n"
