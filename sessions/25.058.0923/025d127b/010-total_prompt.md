Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identifies a mirrored "L" shape formed by azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
Shifts the leftmost vertical line of the "L" shape one pixel to the left, effectively deleting it since it hits grid boundary.
The remaining azure pixels form the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_azure_shape(grid):
    """Finds the azure (8) pixels that form a mirrored "L" shape."""
    azure_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 8)
    #Find leftmost x-coordinate
    if azure_pixels.size > 0:
      min_x = np.min(azure_pixels[:, 1])
    else:
      min_x = -1

    return azure_pixels, min_x

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by removing the leftmost vertical line of the azure shape."""
    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find the azure shape and its leftmost x-coordinate
    azure_pixels, min_x = find_azure_shape(input_grid)
    
    # remove left most veritical line
    if min_x > -1:
      for r,c in azure_pixels:
          if c == min_x:
              output_grid[r,c] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and develop a refined natural language program and YAML facts.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on identifying and partially removing a mirrored "L" shape made of azure pixels. It worked for the first training example, but the subsequent examples reveal a flaw. The code *only* removes the leftmost vertical line of the azure shape. The actual transformation is simpler: it seems to be removing *all* azure pixels that are in the leftmost column that *contains* any azure pixels. The code correctly identifies the leftmost column containing azure, but incorrectly limits the removal to only pixels that form part of what it (incorrectly) assumes to be an "L" shape.  We need to simplify the removal logic.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Accurate Observation:** Carefully re-examine *all* training examples to confirm the corrected transformation rule.
2.  **Metrics:** Use code execution to verify the leftmost azure column for each input.
3.  **YAML Update:** Revise the YAML facts to reflect the simplified object (azure pixels) and action (removal from the leftmost column).
4.  **Natural Language Program Update:**  Rewrite the program to clearly state the actual rule: remove all azure pixels located in the leftmost column containing azure pixels.

**Metrics and Code Execution:**

I will use a simple python script, executed with your `code_execution` tool, to find the leftmost column containing azure and inspect other values. This inspection of the original input and output grids will guide our understanding.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grids(grids):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(grids):
        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
        azure_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)
        if azure_pixels.size > 0:
            min_x = np.min(azure_pixels[:, 1])
        else:
            min_x = -1

        azure_pixels_out = np.argwhere(output_grid == 8)

        results.append({
            "example": i + 1,
            "leftmost_azure_column": int(min_x),
            "input_azure_count": int(azure_pixels.size / 2) if azure_pixels.size > 0 else 0,
            "output_azure_count": int(azure_pixels_out.size / 2) if azure_pixels_out.size > 0 else 0,
            "diff_grid" : np.array_equal(input_grid,output_grid)
        })
    return results

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
