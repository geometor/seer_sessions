Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 vertical and horizontal azure colored "bars"

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate 1x2 and 2x1 vertical and horizontal azure colored "bars"
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: single pixel
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. In this case there two separated objects, one vertical and another one horizontal.

2.  **Blue Pixel Insertion at Top-Left:** For each separate azure objects, insert a blue pixel (color 1) to the right of the topmost-leftmost pixel of the azure object. If the top consists of multiple pixels, it goes with the left one.

**Explanation and Reasoning**

The core transformation rule relies on identifying azure objects, finding their top-left corner, and modifying colors accordingly.

I believe this natural language program covers all aspects of the transformation observed in the single example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
