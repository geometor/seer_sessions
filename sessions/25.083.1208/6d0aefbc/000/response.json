The output grid appears to be a \"doubled\" or \"mirrored\" version of the input grid, with each original pixel replicated to create 2x2 blocks of the same color. The core operation seems to be a spatial expansion/replication, preserving the relative positions and colors of the original pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
