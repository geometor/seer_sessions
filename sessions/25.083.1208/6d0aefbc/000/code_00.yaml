objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
    relationships:
      - element_to_color:  Each integer maps to a specific color.

actions:
  - type: replication
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
    properties:
      - horizontal_expansion: Each column is doubled.
      - vertical_expansion: Each row is doubled.

transformation_rule:
    input: original_grid
    output: expanded_grid
    process:  Replicate each pixel of input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
