The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair. The primary change seems to be the replacement of a specific color (digit) with another, particularly focusing on '6' (magenta) and '2' (red). The transformation doesn't appear to involve complex spatial manipulations or object interactions, but rather a targeted color substitution based on a condition.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
