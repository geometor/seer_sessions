Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to understand the transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The grids consist primarily of the value `2` (red) and `0` (white).
*   The transformation seems to involve changing some `2`s to `1` (blue) or some 0's to 1.
*   The change appears to be positionally specific, the last occurence of a 2 in a row or column becomes a 1.
*   The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - grid_dimensions_constant: true
  - input_colors: [white, red]
  - output_colors: [white, red, blue]
  - changed_color_value: from red to blue or from white to blue #the 2s become 1s and the 0s become 1s
  - change_condition: last red pixel along each row/column that does not touch the edge of the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each row and column of the input grid.
2.  Locate the last occurance of the red color that has an index less than the width or height of the grid.
3. Change the color value red to blue.
4.  If there is a white color after the last occurance of the red pixel, and before the end, locate the last occurance of the white color and convert it to blue.
