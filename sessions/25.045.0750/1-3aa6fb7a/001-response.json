We consider a region as connected if cells of color 8 are adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n2. **Iterate through Objects:** For each identified region of color 8:\n    a. **Find Top-Leftmost Cell:** Locate the cell within the region that has the smallest row index. If there are multiple cells with the same smallest row index, choose the one with the smallest column index among them. Let's call the coordinates of this cell (row, column).\n    b. **Check Right Neighbor:** Examine the cell immediately to the right of the top-leftmost cell, at coordinates (row, column + 1).\n        i. **If Right Neighbor is White (0):** If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue).  After changing the color, move to the next object (if any).\n    c. **Check Bottom Neighbor (if Right Neighbor was not changed):** If the right neighbor was not white (either it was out of bounds, or not color 0), then examine the cell immediately below the top-leftmost cell, at coordinates (row + 1, column).\n        i. **If Bottom Neighbor is White (0):** If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change its color to 1 (blue). After changing the color, move to the next object (if any).\n3. **Output Grid:** The modified grid after processing all regions of color 8 is the output grid.\n\nThis program describes how to transform the input grid to the output grid by identifying contiguous regions of color 8 and changing the color of a neighboring white cell to blue, prioritizing the right neighbor and then the bottom neighbor of the top-leftmost cell of each region."
