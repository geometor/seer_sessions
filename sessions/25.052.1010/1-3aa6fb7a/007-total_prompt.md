"""
The transformation rule involves adding the number "1" (blue color) at specific corners of the azure (color 8) vertical rectangles (2x1). 
- For the topmost part of a vertical azure rectangle, a blue cell is inserted at the top-right corner.
- For other vertical azure rectangles or the bottom part of a longer vertical azure rectangle, a blue cell is inserted at the bottom-left corner.
- Horizontal azure rectangles are ignored.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
