Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure components of different shapes and sizes.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape:  Same as in the input grid.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: Three 1x1 blue components.
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** The input grid contains multiple distinct azure (color 8) objects.

2.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:** Analyze each azure object separately. Then place a single blue (color 1) pixel to the right of each of the azure objects.

3. **Preservation:** Azure objects from the input should be preserved in output.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The general transformation rule is:
Iterate through each azure object, finding the cells where there is azure pixel on column `c`. For each of these, place a blue pixel at `(r,c+1)` if it exists.

The provided Python code correctly implements this transformation rule, as confirmed by its successful application to the first example. The code accurately identifies contiguous azure objects and adds the blue pixel to the right and avoids repetition.
