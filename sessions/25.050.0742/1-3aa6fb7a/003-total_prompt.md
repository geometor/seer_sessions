Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure components.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape:  Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure components.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 2), (5,3)]
      shape: Two 1x1 blue components.
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is at top-left, and another in bottom-right.

2.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:** For each of the separated azure components, add a blue (color 1) pixel to its right.

3. **Preserve the azure components:** Azure components from the input should remain in output.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation identifies azure components. Then, adds a single blue pixel to the right.

    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
