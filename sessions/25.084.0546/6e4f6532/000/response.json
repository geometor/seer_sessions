The unchanged parts seem to outline the structure, acting like a frame, while the changes occur within enclosed areas.\n* Changes are not uniform.\n* There appears to be a focus on certain rectangular subregions of specific colors. These seem to be selectively modified and it looks almost \"random\" filling of blocks with different colors inside the subregions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The input and output has some objects that are the same.\n2.  **Identify Regions:** Within the input grid, locate rectangular regions of uniform color that aren't part of the unchanged frame.\n3.  **Modify Regions:** Within each identified region apply the same changes across the examples:\n    *   Example 1:\n        * The gray (5) region is modified to generate an almost random-looking pattern.\n        * Yellow (4), blue(1), orange(7), magenta(6) regions on the boundary are kept as they are.\n    * Example 2:\n        *   The white (1) region bounded by grey(4), red(2), orange(7), green (3) regions is modified, replacing its contents with a seemingly random pattern of colors.\n        *   The border regions stay the same.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies bounded regions of colors and modifies the inside of each area following the same pattern on all the examples, while maintaining any unchanged region between input and output.\n"
