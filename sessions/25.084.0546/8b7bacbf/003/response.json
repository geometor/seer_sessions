An object is a group of contiguous pixels of the same color (excluding color 0, which is the background, and color 7, which should be ignored). Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Objects:** For each identified object:\n    * If object color is 7, continue to next object\n\n3.  **Red (2) Object Transformation:**\n    *   If the object's color is red (2):\n        *   Check if the object is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to *another* object of color red (2).\n        *   If it *is* adjacent to another red (2) object, *and* it is *not* adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any object of color yellow (4), then change all pixels within the object to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Preservation:** All other objects (colors other than 2 that don't meet the transformation condition above, and ignoring color 7) maintain their original colors.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in the grid, excluding color 0 and 7.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] == 0 or grid[r,c] == 7:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and grid[r,c] != 7 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                if current_object:\n                    objects.append((grid[r,c], current_object)) # Store color and object pixels\n    return objects\n\ndef is_adjacent_to_object_of_color(grid, object_pixels, color, objects):\n    \"\"\"Checks if an object is adjacent to another object of a specific color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    for r, c in object_pixels:\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if is_valid(nr, nc):\n                for other_color, other_object_pixels in objects:\n                    if other_color == color and (nr, nc) in other_object_pixels and other_object_pixels != object_pixels:\n                        return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through all objects found\n    for color, object_pixels in objects:\n\n        # Red (2) Object Transformation\n        if color == 2:\n            adjacent_to_red = is_adjacent_to_object_of_color(input_grid, object_pixels, 2, objects)\n            adjacent_to_yellow = is_adjacent_to_object_of_color(input_grid, object_pixels, 4, objects)\n\n            if adjacent_to_red and not adjacent_to_yellow:\n                for r, c in object_pixels:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
