            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous objects and attempts to apply rules based on color adjacency. However, it's overly simplistic and doesn't capture the nuances of all the transformations, particularly the conditional changes of red (2) to yellow (4). The main issue seems to be the incorrect handling of the adjacency rule and determining what constitutes a valid \"adjacency\" for color transformation. There's also a misunderstanding of how \"7\" interacts.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Adjacency:** The current adjacency check only considers direct horizontal and vertical neighbors. We need to analyze whether diagonal adjacency matters in some cases, especially for the color 7 rule.\n2.  **Refine Red-to-Yellow Transformation:** The conditions for changing red (2) to yellow (4) are not correctly implemented. The code checks if a red object is adjacent to *any* other red object, and if so, *then* it checks for the *absence* of yellow. This logic is flawed. We need to isolate the condition: a red object turns yellow if it's adjacent to *another* red object *and* is *not* adjacent to a yellow object. It also needs to apply this rule at the object level, not within a single red object.\n3.  **Color 7 Interaction**: Color 7 seems to be acting like \"transparent\", it doesn't appear and when the code try to keep it, it makes problems. Need to ignore it.\n4. **Object interaction**: All of the rules seem to be apply between objects, so object interaction is very important and adjacency should be checked accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, not code execution for this dreamer stage):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Many red (2) pixels were incorrectly changed to yellow (4). The rule about adjacency to other red pixels and the absence of yellow was misapplied.\n    *   Pixels of color 7 were incorrectly considered.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar errors as Example 1 with the red-to-yellow transformation.\n    *    The code didn't produce the expected output.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   The same red-to-yellow issue is very prominent.\n    *   The code didn't produce the expected output.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Demonstrates a simpler case of the red-to-yellow rule, but still fails because of the incorrect adjacency and \"no yellow nearby\" logic.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
