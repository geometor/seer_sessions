            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code correctly identifies contiguous objects and implements a depth-first search (DFS) to find them. It also correctly checks for adjacency. However, the transformation logic is flawed, as evidenced by the incorrect outputs in all examples. The primary issue is that it's too strict about which red objects it transforms to yellow, specifically. In example 1, the red next to 7 is NOT becoming yellow, that is incorrect. The red next to 7 SHOULD turn yellow. Additionally, example 2 has red objects that are not next to other reds but are incorrectly turning to yellow. It looks like example 3 has the same problem. In example 4, only some of the reds are changing color to yellow.\n\nThe main strategy will involve revisiting the adjacency and transformation rules. It should be simpler: \"If a red object is next to another red object, change it to yellow. Ignore objects of color 7.\"\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI'll re-emphasize the core logic error: the current code incorrectly handles the case of Red (2) objects by only changes them to Yellow(4) under both conditions:\n* adjacent to other red objects\n* *not* adjacent to yellow objects.\n\n"
