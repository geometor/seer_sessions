An object is defined as a group of one or more contiguous pixels of the same color. Contiguity is defined by horizontal or vertical adjacency (not diagonal).\n\n2. **Ignore 7:** Any object of color 7 should be ignored by the processing, but its position in the grid is maintained.\n\n3.  **Red Object Processing:**\n    *   Iterate through each identified object.\n    *   If an object is red (color value 2), check for adjacency to *any other* red object.\n    *   Adjacency is defined as having at least one pixel in the first object that is directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of a pixel in another distinct red object.\n    *   If any part of a red object is adjacent to any part of another red object, change *all* pixels within *both* of those red objects to yellow (color value 4).\n\n4.  **Preservation:** Any objects that are not red, or red objects that are *not* adjacent to other red objects, remain unchanged.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid should maintain the original dimensions of the input grid, with the transformations applied.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in the grid, including color 7.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c):\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                if current_object:\n                    objects.append((grid[r,c], current_object)) # Store color and object pixels\n    return objects\n\ndef are_objects_adjacent(object1_pixels, object2_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Checks if two objects are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).\"\"\"\n    for r1, c1 in object1_pixels:\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r1 + dr, c1 + dc\n            if (nr, nc) in object2_pixels:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    red_objects = []\n\n    # Identify all red objects\n    for color, object_pixels in objects:\n        if color == 2:\n            red_objects.append(object_pixels)\n    \n    # Check for adjacency and merge objects\n    objects_to_merge = []\n    for i in range(len(red_objects)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(red_objects)):\n             if are_objects_adjacent(red_objects[i], red_objects[j]):\n                objects_to_merge.append((i,j))\n\n    # Merge the object indices to change them to yellow\n    merged_indices = set()\n    for i,j in objects_to_merge:\n        merged_indices.add(i)\n        merged_indices.add(j)\n    \n    # Create new merged objects and convert to yellow\n    for index in merged_indices:\n        for r, c in red_objects[index]:\n            output_grid[r,c] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
