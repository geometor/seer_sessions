1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects within the grid. An object is defined as a group of one or more contiguous pixels of the same color. Contiguity is defined by horizontal or vertical adjacency (not diagonal).

2. **Ignore 7:** Any object of color 7 should be ignored by the processing, but its position in the grid is maintained.

3.  **Red Object Processing:**
    *   Iterate through each identified object.
    *   If an object is red (color value 2), check for adjacency to *any other* red object.
    *   Adjacency is defined as having at least one pixel in the first object that is directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of a pixel in another distinct red object.
    *   If any part of a red object is adjacent to any part of another red object, change *all* pixels within *both* of those red objects to yellow (color value 4).

4.  **Preservation:** Any objects that are not red, or red objects that are *not* adjacent to other red objects, remain unchanged.

5.  **Output:** The output grid should maintain the original dimensions of the input grid, with the transformations applied.
