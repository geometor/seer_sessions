Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core task appears to involve a selective color replacement/copying within the grid. Certain colored objects in the input grid seem to have their colors *selectively* changed in the output grid, under specific geometric and/or color-based rules, which seem quite context-dependent.  The color white (0) acts like a background and doesn't seem to undergo transformations directly. The operations aren't simple global replacements; the context of neighboring pixels matters. Specifically:

1.  **Context-Sensitive Color Changes:** The changes aren't uniform. A color '2' (red) might change to a '4' (yellow) in one location but remain unchanged in another. This suggests a dependency on surrounding pixels.

2.  **Shapes/Objects:** Contiguous regions of the same color can be treated as single objects. This prior is crucial.

3.  **Potential Triggers:** It is important to look at all examples.
    *   In `train_1`, color `1` (blue) is next to a `7` (orange), and there are instances of the same shape of `2`(red) being replaced with `7`(orange).
    *   In `train_2`, it shows instances of some shapes of `2` (red) being replaced with `4` (yellow).
    *   In `train_3`, it shows instances of some shapes of `2` (red) being replaced with `4` (yellow).
    *   In `train_4`, it shows instances of some shapes of `2` (red) being replaced with `4` (yellow).

            If a red object of any size is horizontally or vertically adjacent to another red object of any size, look at adjacent pixels to the first red object.
            If yellow is not adjacent to the first object, convert the first red object to yellow.
            If the red object is adjacent to one or more yellow objects, it remains unchanged.
      actions:

        - detail: |
             For any object color that is next to the color 7, it does not get changed in the output
      actions:
        - from_color: "7"
        - to_color: "7"
  - relations:
    - adjacency: "Horizontal or vertical pixel proximity"
    - color_similarity: "Whether two objects share the same color"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.  Consider each block as a separate object. Note the color, shape, and position of each object.
2.  **Iterate Through Red (2) Objects:** For each object identified as having the color red (2):
    *   **Check Adjacency to another Red Object:** Check adjacent pixels for any other red objects.
        *   If another red object is adjacent:
            *   **Check adjacent pixels for yellow:** Find adjacent pixels to the initial red object and check if any are yellow.
                *   If yellow is present, keep original red color.
                *   If yellow is not present, change the first red color object to yellow (4).
        *   If not next to red, keep original color.
3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other colors, except `7`, remain unchanged, unless they are adjacent to an object of color 7, in which case, it keeps its original color.
4. **Color 7:** Preserve color `7`.

This program focuses on the observed rule governing the change of color 2 (red). It prioritizes checking adjacent pixels for red and yellow before enacting a color change, making the transformation context-sensitive. It also takes into account the `7` color.
