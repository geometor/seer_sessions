            If a red object of any size is horizontally or vertically adjacent to another red object of any size, look at adjacent pixels to the first red object.
            If yellow is not adjacent to the first object, convert the first red object to yellow.
            If the red object is adjacent to one or more yellow objects, it remains unchanged.
