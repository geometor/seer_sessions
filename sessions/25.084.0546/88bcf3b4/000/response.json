The transformation seems to involve a complex interaction between spatially grouped, identical, non-zero pixels within the input grid, and a re-arrangement and potential addition of a new object. The background (0-value pixels) appears mostly unchanged, except where overwritten by shifted objects.  The core challenge is to identify and move or copy existing elements, potentially dependent on their spatial relationships and the object's color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
