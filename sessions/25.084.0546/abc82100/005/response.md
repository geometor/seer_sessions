"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a combination of color swaps,
positional rules, and neighbor interactions.  The current rules include:

- Color 2 always becomes color 1.
- Color 6 always becomes color 7.
- Color 7 always becomes color 6.
- Color 1 becomes color 2 if it is adjacent to a pixel of color 2; otherwise, it becomes 0 (with exceptions).
- Color 8 generally becomes color 0, with exceptions related to neighboring 1s.
- Color 4 has positional rules, particularly at grid edges, turning into color 2.
- Color 0 remains color 0.
