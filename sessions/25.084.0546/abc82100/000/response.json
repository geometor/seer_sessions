The transformation doesn't seem to simply copy colors. It appears to involve a kind of \"color swapping\" or \"shifting\" based on specific rules. The spatial arrangement of colors plays a critical role, meaning relative positions (adjacency, rows, columns) are key. Some colors remain. The output can contain adjacent pixels of the same color.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
