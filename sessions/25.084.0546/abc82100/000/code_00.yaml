facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Colors in the input grid are not directly mapped to the same colors in the output grid; a transformation occurs."
  - observation: "The transformation involves changing some colors, while others might stay the same, indicating a conditional rule."
  - observation: "The rule likely depends on the color and its surrounding pixels."
  - rule_hypothesis: "Specific input colors are consistently transformed to specific output colors, suggesting a color-based rule set, like a color-swap."
  - example_1:
      input_colors: [1, 2, 8, 0]
      output_colors: [0, 2]
      color_changes: {1: 2, 8: 2}
  - example_2:
      input_colors: [6, 2, 4, 8, 7]
      output_colors: [7, 4, 2, 6]
      color_changes: {6: 7, 8: 6, 2:4, 4:2}
  - example_3:
      input_colors: [4,8,2,1,7]
      output_colors: [2,7]
      color_changes: {4:2, 8:0, 1:7, 2:0, 7:0}
  - example_4:
      input_colors: [1,2,8]
      output_colors: [2,1]
      color_changes: {1:2, 8:1, 2:1}
