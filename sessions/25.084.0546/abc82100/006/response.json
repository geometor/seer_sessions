            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code captures some basic color swaps (2 -> 1, 6 -> 7, 7 -> 6) but fails to accurately model the more complex conditional transformations, especially those involving spatial relationships and object interactions. The rules for colors 1, 4, and 8 are particularly problematic. The strategy will involve refining these rules by:\n\n1.  **Focusing on object boundaries:** Instead of just checking for adjacent colors, we need to identify the boundaries of contiguous color regions (objects).\n2.  **Refining positional rules:** The current positional rules for color 4 are too broad and specific to example 3. We need more generalizable positional or contextual rules.\n3.  **Re-evaluating the rule for 8:** The current rule for 8 is a placeholder and needs to based on concrete observations that occur in all examples.\n4.  **Addressing Color 1 transformations correctly** There is complex context for when a 1 should change to a 2 or a 0.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a more detailed analysis:\n\n*Example 1*\n\n*   **Input:** 5x5 grid with colors 1, 2, 8, and 0.\n*   **Expected Output:** Shows '2's forming a diagonal line where the '1's and '8' were.\n*   **Observed Output:** The 2 -> 1 swap worked, but the 1 -> 2 and 8 -> 0 transformations did not.\n*  **Key Issue**: logic error for handling transitions from 1 to 2 and 8 to 0\n\n*Example 2*\n\n*   **Input:** 15x15 grid with a variety of colors (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8).\n*   **Expected Output:** Complex pattern changes, including color swaps and positional shifts.\n*   **Observed Output:** Some color swaps (6 & 7) are correct, but other transformations are inaccurate, especially for colors 2, 4, and 8.\n*  **Key Issue**: handling colors 2, 4, and 8, possibly involving positional or neighbor-based rules, is incorrect.\n\n*Example 3*\n\n*   **Input:** 20x20 grid, again with a variety of colors.\n*   **Expected Output:** Shows a complex pattern, with 4s at the edges becoming 2s, and other intricate changes.\n*   **Observed Output:** The positional rule for 4 (designed based on this example) works *only* for this specific case, and other transformations are incorrect.\n*  **Key Issue**: Overfitting to this example; positional rules are too specific, need to relate the location of the 4s to other aspects of the grid.\n\n*Example 4*\n\n*   **Input:** 8x8 grid with 1s, 2s, and 8s.\n*   **Expected Output**: 1s become 2s and all of the 8s are removed\n*   **Observed Output:** Shows inconsistencies in the transformation of 1s and 8s.\n*  **Key Issue**: The color transformations for '1' are incorrect when '1' is next to '2' and '8' is near '1'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
