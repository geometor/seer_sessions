Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code focused on removing the leftmost pixel of each row within an object, *except* for the topmost row.  The results show this is incorrect for both examples. Example 1 shows extra pixels (with value 0, or white) in the leftmost column. Example 2 also shows that some of the left-most pixels are not removed. It seems like only one pixel must be removed and it can be the top-most pixel, too. The approach of operating on a per-object basis is valid, but the specific pixel removal logic is flawed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The current `get_objects` function seems to correctly identify contiguous regions of the same non-background color as objects. This part is likely correct.
2.  **Pixel Removal:** The core issue is in `remove_leftmost_pixel_per_row_except_top`.  We need to revise this to remove *only* the leftmost pixel of the entire object, not per row (excluding the top).
3. **Metrics Gathering**: I don't see a good way to use tool_code here, yet. I will do a manual inspection.

**Metrics and Observations (Manual Inspection):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Objects:** Three objects are present: blue (1), magenta (6), and red (2).
    *   **Transformation:**  For each object, only the single leftmost pixel is removed.
    * **Error:** There is one additional pixel in the output compared to expected output for all the objects.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Objects:** Three objects: red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4).
    *   **Transformation:** For each object, the leftmost pixel of the entire object is removed. The second object (color 8) is only two pixels wide in the original, so removing one make the entire object only one pixel wide.
    *   **Error**: Only one pixel is removed, it should also be removed from the top row.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Remove Leftmost Pixel"
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: 1  # Blue
          shape: "Irregular"
          action: "Remove leftmost pixel"
        - color: 6  # Magenta
          shape: "Irregular"
          action: "Remove leftmost pixel"
        - color: 2  # Red
          shape: "Irregular"
          action: "Remove leftmost pixel"
  - example_2:
      objects:
        - color: 2  # Red
          shape: "Irregular"
          action: "Remove leftmost pixel"
        - color: 8  # Azure
          shape: "Irregular"
          action: "Remove leftmost pixel"
        - color: 4 # Yellow
          shape: "Irregular"
          action: "Remove leftmost pixel"

```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is defined as a contiguous block of pixels sharing the same color (excluding the background color, 0).
2.  For each identified object:
    *   Find the leftmost pixel of that *entire* object.
    *   Remove this single pixel.

This revised program clarifies that we remove only one pixel – the absolute leftmost – from the entire object, and it's not row based, and also not excluding any rows.
