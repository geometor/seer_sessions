            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code focused on removing the leftmost pixel of each row within an object, *except* for the topmost row.  The results show this is incorrect for both examples. Example 1 shows extra pixels (with value 0, or white) in the leftmost column. Example 2 also shows that some of the left-most pixels are not removed. It seems like only one pixel must be removed and it can be the top-most pixel, too. The approach of operating on a per-object basis is valid, but the specific pixel removal logic is flawed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The current `get_objects` function seems to correctly identify contiguous regions of the same non-background color as objects. This part is likely correct.\n2.  **Pixel Removal:** The core issue is in `remove_leftmost_pixel_per_row_except_top`.  We need to revise this to remove *only* the leftmost pixel of the entire object, not per row (excluding the top).\n3. **Metrics Gathering**: I don't see a good way to use tool_code here, yet. I will do a manual inspection.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Manual Inspection):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Objects:** Three objects are present: blue (1), magenta (6), and red (2).\n    *   **Transformation:**  For each object, only the single leftmost pixel is removed.\n    * **Error:** There is one additional pixel in the output compared to expected output for all the objects.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Objects:** Three objects: red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4).\n    *   **Transformation:** For each object, the leftmost pixel of the entire object is removed. The second object (color 8) is only two pixels wide in the original, so removing one make the entire object only one pixel wide.\n    *   **Error**: Only one pixel is removed, it should also be removed from the top row.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
