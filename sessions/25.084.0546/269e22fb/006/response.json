            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of expanding the grid and propagating colors directionally (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) has some merit, but it's clearly insufficient to capture the full complexity of the transformation. The code fails to correctly reproduce the expected outputs in all five test cases, with a significant number of mismatched pixels. The \"diagonal\" filling and wrapping attempts are also not working as intended. The hardcoded output dimension adjustments are a sign of overfitting to specific examples and a lack of a generalizable rule for determining output size. The strategy needs to move away from simple propagation and consider a more sophisticated pattern-matching or object-based approach, as suggested by the ARC priors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Abandon Simple Propagation:** The current propagation logic is fundamentally flawed. It doesn't account for the complex shapes and arrangements observed in the outputs.\n\n2.  **Object Identification:**  The core issue is that we are not identifying \"objects\" correctly. We need to treat contiguous regions of the *same* color as single objects. This includes diagonally connected regions.\n\n3.  **Object Transformation:** Once we have objects, the transformation rule appears to involve *replicating* these objects and arranging the copies in a specific pattern within a larger output grid. The exact replication and placement rule is what we need to derive. It is likely some form of 2x2 tiling.\n\n4. **Dynamic output sizing**: Instead of hardcoding it, output size is related to input size.\n\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Test the revised logic after each change against *all* examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification where necessary):**\n\n"

The arrangement is not a simple doubling or mirroring. It's more akin to a 2x2 grid replication, but with overlaps and specific placement rules that need to be determined.\n\n4.  **Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are related to the input grid dimensions.
