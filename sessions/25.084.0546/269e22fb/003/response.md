```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into a larger output grid. The output grid's dimensions
are determined by a near-doubling of the input dimensions, with rows typically
increasing slightly more than columns, and a specific offset. The color
modification involves a form of interpolation: expanded pixels retain their
original color, and new pixels take on the color of their nearest neighbor
from the original grid, but with a specific directional bias during expansion.
