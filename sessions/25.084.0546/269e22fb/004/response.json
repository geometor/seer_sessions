            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize improvements.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code, designed based on the first training example, performs poorly on subsequent examples. The core issues stem from two areas:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Expansion Logic:** The `expand_grid_deterministic` function doesn't correctly generalize the expansion pattern. The row and column expansion factors are not consistent across examples, and the simple integer division approach for mapping output coordinates back to input coordinates is flawed. The current logic appears very specific to the first example, it assumed doubling and adding half the input rows, which works for some but not all of the examples.\n\n2.  **Oversimplified Pixel Modification:** The `modify_pixels_directional` function is too simplistic. It only considers the immediate left and top neighbors and changes a pixel's value if it *differs* from these neighbors.  The actual rule is more nuanced and appears to involve a complex interplay between the expanded positions and some form of directional propagation of color values.\n\nThe main strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Expansion:** Carefully examine how the dimensions change from input to output in *all* provided examples. Look for a more robust, potentially mathematical relationship between input and output dimensions, rather than hardcoded formulas.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pixel Relationships:** Instead of just looking at immediate neighbors, we need to understand how pixels are \"filled in\" during expansion.  It's likely that new pixels inherit color from nearby original pixels, but the \"nearest neighbor\" concept is not simply based on Euclidean distance. There might be some diagonal influence or an order in filling. The direction of the fill also need to be considered.\n\n3. **Iteratively use metrics:** Use the input/output examples to validate assumptions and the logic of the Natural Language Program.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nI will use code execution to gather consistent dimension and color information.\n\n"
