Copy it to the row below. Shift rows containing blue(8) object down.\n*  Example 2:\n    *   Locate blue(1) object, invert it and place it at the top of the output. Copy Red(2) objects and place it below blue(1) object.\n*  Example 3:\n    *   Locate the position of the yellow(4) object. Shift rows containing magenta(6) object based on yellow(4) object position. The yellow(4) object moves to the positions of magenta(6) objects.\n"
