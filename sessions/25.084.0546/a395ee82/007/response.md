"""
The transformation rule involves identifying objects of different colors and performing operations based on their relative positions and, in some cases, their absolute positions. Key operations include removing objects, copying objects with offsets (possibly relative to the object's original position or another object), and shifting content.  The transformations are specific to the colors involved and their vertical positioning.

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify distinct objects and the background.
2.  **Relative Positioning and Color-Specific Rules:**
    *   **Azure (8) and Red (2):** Remove the Azure object.  Copy the Red object, shifting it to where the top of the Azure object was. Also, copy the Red object down by one unit.
    *   **Red (2) and Blue (1):** Copy the Red object to a fixed position (row 2). Remove the Blue object. Copy Red one unit below.
    *   **Yellow (4) and Magenta (6):** Remove the Magenta object. Copy the Yellow object, repeating it at the rows previously occupied by the Magenta object. Also copy the Yellow one row above the magenta object, with the same pattern.
3. **Copy object offset by row, col**
