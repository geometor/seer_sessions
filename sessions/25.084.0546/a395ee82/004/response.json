            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to refine the natural language program and address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code captures some aspects of the transformations but fails to generalize correctly across all examples. The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Overly Specific Logic:** The code contains separate `if` blocks tailored to specific color combinations (Red/Azure, Blue/Red, Yellow/Magenta). This approach is brittle and doesn't adapt to variations or new scenarios.\n2.  **Incorrect Object Manipulation:** The object copying and shifting logic is flawed in several cases, leading to incorrect positioning and incomplete transformations. Example 1 has shifting and copying issues, with Azure not being properly cleared first.\n    Example 2 has major errors with the clearing and copies.\n    Example 3 does not copy yellows at all.\n\n3.  **Lack of Generalization:** The code doesn't identify a unifying principle behind the transformations. It treats each case as distinct rather than finding a common underlying rule.\n\n**Strategy for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Relative Transformations:** Instead of hardcoding color-specific rules, identify how objects' *relative positions and properties* dictate the transformation.\n2.  **Unified Object Handling:** Develop a more general approach to object identification, manipulation (copying, shifting, deleting), and placement that can apply to all cases.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test and refine the natural language program and code after analyzing each example, ensuring improvements in one case don't break others.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-Specific):**\n\nI will use `tool_code` blocks to explore the objects and outputs, as well as compare the generated output to the expected one.\n\n"
