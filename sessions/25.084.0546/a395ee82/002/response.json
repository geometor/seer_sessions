            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code attempts to handle different scenarios based on the presence of specific colored objects (red, blue, yellow, magenta). However, it fails to correctly transform the input grids in all three examples. The core issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Object Manipulation:** The code doesn't accurately implement the intended object movements, replacements, and reflections. The logic for shifting rows, copying objects, and replacing colors is flawed. Especially example 2 logic is implemented wrongly.\n2.  **Rigid Conditional Logic:** The `if/elif` structure is too rigid. It checks for specific color combinations (e.g., red and blue) and applies a hardcoded transformation. This approach cannot generalize to variations or new color combinations.\n3. **Missing the Big Picture**: The core idea of reflecting and arranging the small objects based on their color and positions is captured partially, but the code misses reflecting some objects (Example 3).\n\n**Strategy for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The `get_objects` function is a good starting point. Ensure it correctly identifies all objects and their properties (color, position, size).\n2.  **Modularize Transformations:** Break down the transformations into smaller, reusable functions. This will improve readability and make it easier to modify specific parts of the logic. Examples: `reflect_object(grid, object_positions)`, `replace_color(grid, old_color, new_color)`, `move_object(grid, object, new_position)`.\n3.  **Generalized Conditional Logic:** The current code relies on specific `if/elif` conditions based on observed object properties. Need to develop a concise natural program that can handle these variations.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each modification. Use the provided examples as a test suite.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI'll use code execution to calculate some helpful metrics.\n\n"
