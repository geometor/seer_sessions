Specifically, objects of color '8' (azure) are affected.  If an '8' object is adjacent to a '4' (yellow) object, the '4' object may change color based on neighboring colors '1', '2', or '3'. If an '8' object touches a '1' (blue) object, portions of the '1' object may become '3' (green) near the '8' object. Similarly, portions of a '2' (red) object can become yellow if adjacent to an 8.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_all_objects(grid):\n    # Find contiguous regions of *any* color, including what might be considered background\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    objects = []\n    object_locations = []\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r, c]:\n                obj, locs = flood_fill(grid, r, c, visited)\n                objects.append(obj)\n                object_locations.append(locs)\n    return objects, object_locations\n\ndef flood_fill(grid, r, c, visited):\n    # Standard flood fill, but without excluding any colors\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    color = grid[r, c]\n    object_pixels = []\n    locations = []\n    stack = [(r, c)]\n    visited[r, c] = True\n\n    while stack:\n        row, col = stack.pop()\n        object_pixels.append(grid[row,col])\n        locations.append((row,col))\n\n        neighbors = [(row - 1, col), (row + 1, col), (row, col - 1), (row, col + 1)]\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                stack.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return object_pixels, locations\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc, grid[nr, nc]))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n    # Find all objects in the input grid\n    _, input_object_locations = find_all_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # Iterate over the object locations\n    for obj_locs in input_object_locations:\n        first_r, first_c = obj_locs[0]\n        obj_color = input_grid[first_r, first_c]\n        \n        # Apply rules for changing azure (8)\n        if obj_color == 8:\n            for r, c in obj_locs:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n                for nr, nc, ncolor in neighbors:\n                    # If an '8' is adjacent to a '4', check the '4's neighbors.\n                    if ncolor == 4:\n                        four_neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, nr, nc)\n                        neighbor_colors = [c for _,_,c in four_neighbors]\n                        \n                        if 1 in neighbor_colors:\n                            output_grid[nr, nc] = 4\n                        elif 2 in neighbor_colors :\n                            output_grid[nr,nc] = 4\n                        elif 3 in neighbor_colors:\n                            output_grid[nr, nc] = 4\n                        else:\n                            output_grid[nr,nc] = 4\n                    if ncolor == 1:\n                       one_neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid,nr,nc)\n                       if 4 in [c for _,_,c in one_neighbors]:\n                            output_grid[nr,nc] = 3 #turn blue next to yellow and azure into green\n                       \n                    if ncolor == 2:\n                       two_neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid,nr,nc)\n\n                       if 4 in [c for _,_,c in two_neighbors]:\n                            output_grid[nr,nc] = 4\n                       \n    \n    # Iterate over the object locations again, looking for 1's next to 8's\n    for obj_locs in input_object_locations:\n        first_r, first_c = obj_locs[0]\n        obj_color = input_grid[first_r, first_c]\n        \n        if obj_color == 1:\n            for r,c in obj_locs:\n               neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n               for nr, nc, ncolor in neighbors:\n                   if ncolor == 8:\n                       #If the 8 has yellow next to it\n                       eight_neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid,nr,nc)\n                       if 4 in [c for _,_,c in eight_neighbors]:\n                            output_grid[r,c] = 3\n\n    # Iterate over the object locations again, looking for 2's next to 8's\n    for obj_locs in input_object_locations:\n        first_r, first_c = obj_locs[0]\n        obj_color = input_grid[first_r, first_c]\n        if obj_color == 2:\n            for r, c in obj_locs:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n                for nr,nc, ncolor in neighbors:\n                    if ncolor == 8:\n                        eight_neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid,nr,nc)\n                        if 4 in [c for _,_, c in eight_neighbors]:\n                            output_grid[r,c]=4\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
