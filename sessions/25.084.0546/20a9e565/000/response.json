The input grids are significantly larger than the output grids. The output grids seem to be derived from patterns or specific objects within the input grids. There's a strong sense of objectness, with contiguous blocks of the same color likely representing individual objects. The transformation appears to involve selecting and/or reducing specific colored regions based on either shape, and relative position.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The criteria seem different in each example:\n    *   **Example 1:** The output grid is based on a sub-grid of the color 2 (red) within an area delineated by other color regions including colors: 1(blue), 4(yellow), 5(gray).\n    *   **Example 2:** The output appears to be a simplified, two-column representation of adjacent pairs, ordered top to bottom, left to right of repeating patterns of adjacent color regions in the input grid, except for the final gray(5).\n    *   **Example 3:** Selects the largest contiguous block of color 7 (orange). Other blocks of 7 are present but smaller.\n\n2.  **Reduce/Simplify:**\n    *    Example 1: select an inner area withing the input region.\n    *    Example 2: Extract the essential information about each region.\n    *    Example 3: Selects a complete region that matches specific characteristics.\n\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Create a smaller rectangular grid based on the inner region.\n    *   **Example 2:** Create a new grid of shape n x 2, where *n* is the number of identified repeating pair regions, excluding those with color 0 (white). The order matters.\n    *   **Example 3:** Creates a grid of the exact size of the selected region.\n\n4. **Reposition** The transformation places the extracted or processed regions.\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThe natural language program identifies one or more colored regions based on\ntheir properties (color, shape, relative position), and creates a new grid based\non either a simplified representation of the region or a region that matches\nspecific characteristics.\n"
