            "text": "Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code have several issues, as evidenced by the mismatches in the test results. The core problems seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Red Outline:** The red outline logic is flawed. It incorrectly changes yellow and boundary pixels to red, regardless of their relationship to the blue objects. It needs to specifically target pixels adjacent to the *exterior* of blue objects. The provided `get_outer_border` appears to attempt this, however it collects *all* neighboring pixels. It needs conditions.\n2.  **Inaccurate Inner Border:** It appears there is an error where the inner border, is sometimes taking on properties of the fill.\n3.  **Fill Color Errors:** The fill color logic is not correctly identifying the \"central area\" of the blue objects. It appears that it is sometimes stopping early, or skipping some fill.\n4. **Object identification.** It is essential that the code reliably identify separate blue objects. The current approach appears to correctly handle connected components, which is crucial for ARC tasks.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these issues involves these key steps:\n\n1.  **Refine Object and Border Identification:** Focus on making `get_outer_border` and `get_border` functions extremely precise. We need functions that specifically identify the *outer boundary* (pixels of different colors adjacent to a blue object) and the *inner boundary* (blue pixels adjacent to a non-blue pixel).\n2.  **Conditional Red Outline:** Use the refined `get_outer_border` function to apply the red color *only* to non-blue pixels touching the blue object, and check the colors correctly.\n3. **Central area logic:** Develop a robust method for filling. The existing method of checking the label isn't reliable.\n4. **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code *after each change* to isolate the impact of modifications.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using code execution)**\n\nI'll gather some key metrics about the provided examples to better understand the errors.\n\n"
