The input and output grids have the same dimensions. It appears that colored objects (contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels) are being *moved* and, in some cases, *combined* or *split*. There's a strong sense of \"filling in\" blank (white, color 0) spaces with available colored blocks, almost as if the non-zero colors are being \"poured\" into the grid from different directions, with some sort of precedence or ordering. The background (color 0) is acting as empty space.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Extract the subgrid from rows 10-17 and columns 9-16.\n    2. Count the number of pixels of each color, excluding white (0).\n    3. Fill this subgrid with the counted colors from top-left, moving down each column before going to the next column.\n\n3.  **Move Other Objects:** Taking each color in turn, starting with color 3 (green) if available, collect all instances of each object and fill the rest of the output grid with available objects, working from the top-left, moving down each column before going to the next column, omitting the section of the output handled in the \"Complex Center Rearrangement\" step.\n"
