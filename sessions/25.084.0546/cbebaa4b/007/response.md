"""
1. Identify Objects: Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same non-zero color in the input grid.
2. Combine Objects by Color: Group objects of the same color into a single, combined object. The combined object's size is the sum of the sizes of the original objects. The combined objects shape will fill from top to bottom, left to right.
3. Sort Combined Objects: Sort the combined objects first by size in descending order (largest first), and then by color value in ascending order (smallest color value first).
4. Reconstruct Grid: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros. Place the combined objects into the new grid from top to bottom and left to right, in the order determined in step 3. Objects should maintain combined shape.
