These can be considered \"objects.\"\n*   The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. This suggests a process of extraction or summarization, not just simple repainting or filtering.\n*   The output grids seem to maintain the relative spatial relationships of the colored regions from the input, but in a condensed form.\n*    There are only two unique colors in output and there is always one color which is formed of a border of cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The dimension of the grid equals the side of the square, increased by 2.\n5.  Paste the extracted square in the center of this output grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies a central \"object\" of one color, extracts the largest square section from it, and places it into a smaller grid, framed by the \"background\" border color of the original input.\n"
