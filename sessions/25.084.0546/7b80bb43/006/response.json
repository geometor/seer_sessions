            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a reasonable interpretation of the first example, focusing on horizontal expansion of foreground pixels. However, the second example reveals a flaw in this interpretation. Specifically, in row 9, the green (3) pixels *do* expand all the way to the right edge, but they also expand *over* some other green pixels. The original assessment needs refining, the existing code only expands pixels to the right until a *different* color or a boundary is encountered. The code *partially* supports runs of *different* foreground pixels, but misses some edge cases. The updated logic should ensure correct handling.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Foreground Determination:** The `get_foreground_color` function already handles multiple foreground colors. This is good.\n2.  **Correct Expansion Logic:** The core issue is in how expansion is handled in the core of `transform`. Ensure that a run of *any* foreground color will expand until a background color (or edge) is encountered.\n3.    **YAML and Natural Language Program Update:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the corrected logic. Ensure clarity and conciseness.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-Specific):**\nExample 1: the code almost does everything correctly, except row 7 (index 8). Pixels at index 0, 1, 2 should become '6'. The code logic looks for changing colors, so it should expand to 2. Then from index 6, it should keep expanding.\n"
