The primary colors involved appear to be blue (1) and magenta (6) in the first example, and black(0) and green(3) in the second. The transformation seems to involve a selective expansion or \"filling in\" of certain colored regions based on their initial positions and possibly some adjacency rules.  The most obvious change is the expansion of a connected component of the non-background color. It's expanding on specific sides.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
