  - task_type: grid_transformation
  - objects:
    - name: background_pixels
      properties:
        - color: white/black # (0)
        - shape: dispersed
    - name: foreground_pixels
      properties:
        - color: blue/magenta/green #(1, 6, 3)
        - shape: initially dispersed, then forms a connected component
  - actions:
    - name: expansion
      description: Foreground pixels expand to fill adjacent cells.
      constraints:
        - horizontal_only: True  # Seems like expansion primarily happens horizontally
  - relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Expansion occurs based on horizontal adjacency of foreground pixels.
      - type: containment
        description: Final shape contains all initial foreground pixels.
