The other colors often form small 2x2 or 3x3 squares, and sometimes lines.\n*   **Output:** The output is a smaller, seemingly irregular grid (e.g., 11x13 in example 1).\n*    The ouput grid appears to be composed by blocks 3X3 of the input grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve some form of downsampling or summarizing of the input grid. The output grid retains some of the colors from the input, but in a compressed form. There are no obvious rotations, reflections, or complex shape manipulations. The transformation focuses on retaining certain color information while significantly reducing the grid size. The rule must identify some characteristic or a feature of 3x3 sections of input and use the rule output to construct.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
