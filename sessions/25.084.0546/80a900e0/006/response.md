Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors in the generated code:

**General Assessment:**

The code attempts to implement a checkerboard pattern color propagation, but it's making several mistakes:

1.  **Incorrect Propagation Logic:** The code propagates colors based on the parity of the source and target cells. While this captures the checkerboard *idea*, the actual propagation is spreading too far and mixing colors incorrectly. It seems to be propagating diagonally without respecting all of the checkerboard constraints and source cell colors.

2.  **Misinterpretation of "Source Pixels":** It currently identifies source pixels correctly, but propagation from the sources pixels is incorrect.

3.  **First example**: The background is a 2x2 alternating blue (1) / white(0) checkerboard. The colors 3,8 are propogated.

4.  **Second example**: The background is a 2x2 alternating blue (1) / white(0) checkerboard. The colors 2,3,4 are propogated.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Propagation:** We need to tighten the propagation rules. Propagation should only occur:
    *   From "source" cells (non-blue, non-white on a white checkerboard square).
    *   To other white checkerboard cells *diagonally* reachable from the source.
    *   And the propagation needs to respect the distances. Colors should only replace other 0s

2.  **Verify Color Selection:** Ensure we're only using colors from "source" cells.

**Metrics Gathering (Conceptual - Code Execution would be used for real implementation):**

I'll outline the metrics, and how the code would gather them, but won't provide the literal `tool_code` here, as it clutters the explanation.  The real implementation would involve nested loops and comparisons, similar to the `compare_grids` function you provided earlier, but focusing on these specific aspects:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Number of source cells: Count cells where value is not 0 or 1.
    *   Locations of source cells: Record (row, col) of each source cell.
    *   Colors of source cells: List the unique non-0, non-1 values.
    *   Propagation distances:  For each source, calculate distances to incorrectly colored cells.  This will highlight if we're going too far.
    *   Checkerboard adherence: Check if the final colored cells are all on the correct "white" squares of the checkerboard.
*    Number of misplaced pixels in output
*   **Example 2:** (Same metrics as Example 1, but with a larger grid and more source cells)

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    background:
      type: checkerboard
      pattern: 2x2
      colors: [white, blue]  # 0 and 1
    objects:
      - type: source_pixel
        property: color # color is a value other than 0 and 1
        locations: []
        propagation:
          direction: diagonal
          constraints:
            - on_checkerboard_color: white
            - stops_at: blue #blue (1) cells
    actions:
      - name: propagate_color
        from: source_pixel
        to: checkerboard_cell
        rule: replace_if_white # and correct parity.
  - id: 2
    background:
      type: checkerboard
      pattern: 2x2
      colors: [white, blue] # 0 and 1
    objects:
      - type: source_pixel
        property: color
        locations: [] # Need to determine these.
        propagation:
          direction: diagonal
          constraints:
            - on_checkerboard_color: white
            - stops_at: blue
    actions:
      - name: propagate_color
        from: source_pixel
        to: checkerboard_cell
        rule: replace_if_white

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Background:** The background is a 2x2 checkerboard pattern of alternating blue (1) and white (0) cells.

2.  **Identify Source Pixels:** Find cells within the grid that have a color other than blue (1) or white (0). These are the "source pixels."  These source pixels should be located on a white cell of the checkerboard.

3.  **Propagate Colors Diagonally:**  For each source pixel:
    *   Propagate its color diagonally in all four directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).
    *   Only propagate the color to cells that are:
        *   Part of the white squares of the checkerboard pattern.
        *   Currently white (value 0).
        * Distance to target must equal in both row and col, and be an even number.

4.  **Stopping Condition:** Propagation stops when encountering a blue cell or the edge of the grid or if the row/col distance is odd.

This revised natural language program more accurately reflects the transformation observed, particularly the constraints on color propagation.
