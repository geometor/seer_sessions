            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the errors in the generated code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code attempts to implement a checkerboard pattern color propagation, but it's making several mistakes:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Propagation Logic:** The code propagates colors based on the parity of the source and target cells. While this captures the checkerboard *idea*, the actual propagation is spreading too far and mixing colors incorrectly. It seems to be propagating diagonally without respecting all of the checkerboard constraints and source cell colors.\n\n2.  **Misinterpretation of \"Source Pixels\":** It currently identifies source pixels correctly, but propagation from the sources pixels is incorrect.\n\n3.  **First example**: The background is a 2x2 alternating blue (1) / white(0) checkerboard. The colors 3,8 are propogated.\n\n4.  **Second example**: The background is a 2x2 alternating blue (1) / white(0) checkerboard. The colors 2,3,4 are propogated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Propagation:** We need to tighten the propagation rules. Propagation should only occur:\n    *   From \"source\" cells (non-blue, non-white on a white checkerboard square).\n    *   To other white checkerboard cells *diagonally* reachable from the source.\n    *   And the propagation needs to respect the distances. Colors should only replace other 0s\n\n2.  **Verify Color Selection:** Ensure we're only using colors from \"source\" cells.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Conceptual - Code Execution would be used for real implementation):**\n\nI'll outline the metrics, and how the code would gather them, but won't provide the literal `tool_code` here, as it clutters the explanation.  The real implementation would involve nested loops and comparisons, similar to the `compare_grids` function you provided earlier, but focusing on these specific aspects:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Number of source cells: Count cells where value is not 0 or 1.\n    *   Locations of source cells: Record (row, col) of each source cell.\n    *   Colors of source cells: List the unique non-0, non-1 values.\n    *   Propagation distances:  For each source, calculate distances to incorrectly colored cells.  This will highlight if we're going too far.\n    *   Checkerboard adherence: Check if the final colored cells are all on the correct \"white\" squares of the checkerboard.\n*    Number of misplaced pixels in output\n*   **Example 2:** (Same metrics as Example 1, but with a larger grid and more source cells)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
