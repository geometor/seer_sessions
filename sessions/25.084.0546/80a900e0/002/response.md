Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observing a diagonal propagation of non-blue (1) and non-white (0) colors within a checkerboard pattern of 1s and 0s. However, the tests reveal a critical flaw: the propagation direction and pattern are incorrect. The code propagates colors *upwards and to the left*, while the correct transformation appears to propagate colors *downwards and to the right, but only along the diagonals of the checkerboard*. Additionally, example 2 suggests there may also be a pattern of skipping cells between copies.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Checkerboard Pattern:** Confirm the checkerboard pattern (alternating 1s and 0s) is consistent across all examples.
2.  **Correct Propagation Direction:** Modify the code to propagate downwards and to the right.
3.  **Confirm Propagation pattern**: Examine the examples closely to see where the copied color values are placed
4.  **Refine Logic:** After analyzing the results, update the natural language program and the Python code accordingly.

**Metrics and Observations (Example-Specific):**

We need to manually inspect this, as the code is not yet able to produce good analyses.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input has a clear 1/0 checkerboard background.
    *   Colors 8 (azure) and 3 (green) are present.
    *   The azure and green colors appear copied downwards and to the right, along the checkerboard's main diagonals.
    *   The expected output shows these colors propagated along diagonals where 1,0 pattern match
*    **Example 2:**
    * Input has a clear 1/0 checkerboard pattern
    * Colors 2(red), 3(green) and 4(yellow) are present
    * The expected output shows the input colors 2, 3, and 4 propagated downwards and to the right, but only to cells *two* spaces away.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Background:** The input grid has a checkerboard pattern of alternating blue (1) and white (0) pixels.

2.  **Identify Insertion Colors:** Any color other than blue or white is an "insertion color."

3.  **Propagate Insertion Colors:**
    *   For each insertion color, copy its value *downward and to the right* along the diagonals of the checkerboard.
    *   The propagation follows cells that are *two* indices away.
    *   Continue propagating until the edge of the grid is reached.
4. Create the output by copying the original input grid, then applying the above propogation rule to any insertion colors.

**Next Steps**

Update the python code based on the revised natural language program.
