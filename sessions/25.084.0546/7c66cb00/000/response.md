Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to selectively modify certain regions or objects within the grid, while leaving others untouched. There are repeated patterns, specifically rectangular blocks of the same color, which are sometimes altered and sometimes not. The alterations introduce variations in the color patterns within these rectangles and along their borders.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are of the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      There are rectangular blocks of uniform color in both input and output.
  - observation: |
      Some rectangular blocks remain unchanged, while others are modified.
  - observation: |
      Modifications seem to involve introducing new colors within the original rectangle or along its borders.
  - observation: |
        In some cases, sub-areas *inside* the uniform regions are also transformed
  - observation: |
        Some changes seem related to adjacent colors/pixels/objects
  - action: |
        modify the colors inside objects, and at their borders
  - object: |
      Rectangular blocks of uniform color.
  - property: |
      Color of the block.
  - property: |
       Location of the block and size
  - relationship: |
      Blocks can be adjacent to other blocks.
  - relationship: |
        The background is uniform and is only revealed when parts of other
        objects are changed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular regions of uniform color within the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Some Rectangles:** Based on an unknown rule(we will see if we can determine this in the coder phase) keep some rectangles.

3.  **Modify Other Rectangles**: For the other rectangles:
    *   Perform edits *inside* the rectangles, with a pattern we still need to
        determine.
    *   Change the edges of the objects, with a pattern we still need to
        determine.

4. **Output:** return modified grid.

The core of the transformation seems to be identifying rectangular regions and applying a set of rules to *some* of the them, while leaving *some* others unchanged. The precise way edits are performed is still unclear, but there seems to be a local-pattern element to it. Also we need to figure out what differentiate the objects that get modified.
