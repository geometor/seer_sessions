The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Pinpoint the exact nature of the errors. Are they related to:\n    *   Incorrect identification of rectangles?\n    *   Incorrect application of color transformations?\n    *   Missing rules for certain colors or shapes?\n    *   Edge case handling?\n2.  **Iterative Refinement:**\n    *   Update the natural language program to incorporate missing or incorrect rules.\n    *   Modify the code to reflect the updated natural language program.\n    *   Re-test and repeat the process.\n\n**Gather Metrics (Example-Specific Observations)**\nLet's use manual comparison aided by thinking to create a detailed report.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Blue Rectangles (1):** Correctly removed.\n*   **Red Rectangles (2):** Only partially correct, inconsistent gray filling\n*  **Azure Rectangles (8):** only correct on the bottom edge\n* **Other Regions** Unmodified which is expected\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Azure Rectangles (8):** outer edge correctly unmodified, and some interior parts are changed to green.\n*   **Red Rectangles (2):** The central portion is successfully transformed to gray (5), but the edge preservation logic is flawed.\n* **Other Regions** Unmodified which is expected\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Azure Rectangles (8):** Some fills with 3, but incorrect locations\n* **Other Regions** Mostly unmodified\n* **Green (3) in row of (1):** Some parts incorrectly changed to 0\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
