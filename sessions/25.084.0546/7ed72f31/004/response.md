Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy to address the discrepancies between the generated outputs and the expected outputs:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures some key aspects of the transformation, such as identifying objects and applying absorption based on adjacency. However, it fails to correctly model several crucial behaviors:

1.  **Directional Absorption:** The absorption logic doesn't consistently respect the directionality implied in the examples. It seems that an object to the *right* of another object often absorbs it, not the other way around, and the color 2 acts differently.
2.  **Color 2 Behavior**: The code attempts to model that Color 2 absorption logic isn't entirely right, and needs additional rules.
3. **Object 3 Mirroring**: While attempted, the horizontal mirroring/extending for color 3 is not correctly implemented and depends on adjacent cells.
4. **Complex Interactions:** The examples demonstrate more complex interactions where multiple absorptions and extensions might occur in a single transformation. The current code seems to apply transformations sequentially, which might not be the correct approach.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Object Interaction Rules:**
    *   Clearly define the conditions under which one object absorbs another. Prioritize right-to-left absorption and special rules for color 2. The rule for color 3 is not a mirroring, rather an extension based on an adjacent object.
2.  **Iterative Application:** Instead of applying all transformations at once, consider an iterative approach where the grid is updated after each absorption/extension, and the object detection is re-run. This might better reflect the cascading effects observed in the examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, code execution would be used in a real environment):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Contains objects of color 1 (background), 3, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
    *   **Expected Output:** Shows that 4 absorbs 1 on its left, 2 stays. The 3 on the top left is not changed, The 3 does horizontal extension/mirroring. 5 adjacent to 2 on the left is absorbed.
    *   **Observed Errors:** Color 4 absorption not applied. Color 3 mirroring incorrect. Color 5 not properly absorbed.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Contains objects of color 8 (background), 2, 4, 1, and 3.
    *   **Expected output:** Shows color 4 absorbing color 2 to its left. Color 3 extends horizontally. Shows color 2 absorbing color 1 on the left. Color 3 extends vertically.
    * **Observed Errors:** Color 4 absorption incorrect, also absorbing pixels on its right when it should extend. Color 3 mirroring not applied. Color 2 absorbing adjacent color 1 incorrect.

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: 1  # Background in Example 1
    properties:
      - can_be_absorbed: True
  - color: 2
    properties:
      - absorbs_left: True
      - absorbed_by: [4]  # List of colors that absorb color 2
  - color: 3
    properties:
      - extends_horizontal: True
      - extends_vertical: True
      - extends_adjacent: True # extends based on any adjacent object

actions:
  - type: absorption
    conditions:
      - adjacency: "right"  # Object on the right absorbs the object on the left.
      - color_specific: True  # Some colors have unique absorption behaviors.
  - type: extension
    conditions:
      - color: 3  # Only color 3 exhibits this behavior.
      - direction: horizontal # triggered by adjacent object
      - direction: vertical # triggered by adjacent object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all connected components (objects) of the same color, excluding the background color.
2.  **Absorption (Right to Left):**
    * If a non-background object is immediately to the *left* of another non-background object, and are different colors, the object on the *right* absorbs all pixels of the other object to its left.
3.  **Color 2 Specific Absorption:**
    *   Color 2 object absorbs objects of color 1 and 5 that it is directly to the right of.
4.  **Object 3 Extension (Horizontal):**
   * Find all pixels of color 3.
   * For each pixel of color 3:
     * If the color 3 pixel is adjacent to any other non-background color horizontally, extend the object 3 color to the opposite edge of the other object.
     * If the color 3 pixel is adjacent to any other non-background color vertically, extend the object 3 color to the opposite edge of the other object.
