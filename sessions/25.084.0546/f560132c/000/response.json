The output grid seems to be a condensed and simplified representation of the input grid.  Specific colored regions in the input are replaced with different colors, and their shapes seem to be simplified/regularized into rectangles in the output. There appears to be a mapping between input and output colors, but it's not a simple one-to-one correspondence. The spatial relationships between colored regions in the input are somewhat preserved in the output, but significantly altered due to the size reduction and shape simplification. The output grid is always smaller and it is filled without any background color.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

Each of these regions is considered an object.\n2. **Bounding Boxes:** For each identified colored region, determine the smallest bounding box (rectangle) that completely encloses it.\n3. **Color Mapping:**  Apply a color transformation to each region based on following rules:\n    - Input color 2 -> Output color 1\n    - Input color 5 -> Output color 5\n    - Input color 8 -> Output color 1\n    - Input color 9 -> Output color 9\n    - Input color 4 -> Output color 9\n    - Input color 7 -> Output color 5\n    - Input color 1 -> Output color 1\n    - Input color 6 -> Output color 2\n    - Input color 3 -> Output color 3\n\n4.  **Condense and Arrange:**\n    - Find the top most and left most pixel.\n    - remove the all all-background color rows above and all-background color columns to the left.\n    - Starting from the top-left corner of the input, find the topmost, leftmost of the detected bounding boxes.\n    - Place these converted color rectangles adjacent to fill out the output.\n    - Find bounding boxes in reading order, meaning the order a person's eyes would move when reading text on a page, starting from the top-left corner of the page and moving from left to right. Upon reaching the end of a row, the eyes return to the left side of the page to begin reading the next row\n5. **Output Grid Construction:** Create a new, smaller output grid. Populate it with the transformed rectangular regions, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) as closely as possible after the condensing step. The output grid should be densely packed; no background (0) pixels should remain between the colored rectangles.\n\n"
