objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 20x20
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    description: The initial grid containing sparse colored regions.

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (smaller than input)
      - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9]
    description: The transformed grid, smaller and denser than the input.

  - name: colored_regions_input
    type: object_set
    properties:
        - shape: irregular, contiguous
        - color: varies
    description: Distinct regions of non-zero color in the input_grid. These regions are separated by '0' (background).

  - name: colored_regions_output
    type: object_set
    properties:
        - shape: rectangular
        - color: varies, different from the input colors
    description: Rectangular regions in the output, corresponding to regions from input.

  - name: background
    type: color
    value: 0
    description: the color of the background cells of the input

actions:
  - name: condense
    description: Reduce the size of the grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

  - name: simplify_shape
    description: Convert irregular shapes to rectangles.
    input: colored_regions_input
    output: colored_regions_output

  - name: recolor
    description: Change the color of regions based on a mapping.
    input: colored_regions_input
    output: colored_regions_output

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description:  Relative positions of colored regions are *roughly* maintained between input and output, though distorted by condensing and simplification.
    between: colored_regions_input, colored_regions_output

  - type: color_mapping
    description: There's a non-trivial mapping between input and output colors. This needs to be determined.
