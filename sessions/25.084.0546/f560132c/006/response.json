            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the errors and refine the natural language program and the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe errors \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" in both examples 1 and 2 suggest a problem with conditional statements involving NumPy arrays. Specifically, the issue likely lies within the `if current_row.size > 0:` and similar checks within the `transform` function, especially after the concatenation operations. The `current_row` can be a numpy array, and comparing an array with > 0 gives another array. We should check if it's empty.\n\nThe core strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Debugging the conditionals:** Carefully examine the `if` conditions related to `current_row` and replace ambiguous checks with appropriate NumPy functions like `np.any()`, `np.all()`, or, more appropriately `current_row.size != 0` or `current_row.shape[0] != 0` if checking existence, after concatenations and other operations that may result in multi-element arrays.\n2.  **Reviewing array concatenation:** Ensure that row and column concatenations are performed correctly, handling potential shape mismatches, and particularly that empty rows/arrays are handled.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nTo better understand the state of `current_row` at the point of the error, I will add some print statements to the code and rerun it with the inputs. But, since I cannot currently modify the code directly, I will note exactly what I would inspect, which is, just before the offending `if` statement, what is:\n\n- `current_row` itself\n- `current_row.shape`\n- `current_row.size`\n\nThese data points will help pinpoint the root cause related to the array dimensions/contents. Because of prior experience, and because I cannot execute code here to provide metrics, I will proceed directly to facts and the updated natural language program.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

Two pixels are considered part of the same object if they share a side (not just a corner).\n\n2.  **Bounding Boxes:** For each identified object, determine its bounding box. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle (defined by `min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`) that completely encloses the object.\n\n3.  **Color Mapping:** Map the original color of each object to a new color based on the following rules:\n    *   Red (2) becomes Blue (1)\n    *   Blue (1) remains Blue (1)\n    *   Gray (5) remains Gray (5)\n    *   Orange (7) becomes Gray (5)\n    *   Azure (8) remains Azure (8)\n    *   Maroon (9) remains Maroon (9)\n    *   Yellow (4) becomes Maroon(9)\n    *   Green (3) becomes Azure (8)\n    *   If an object's color is not in this mapping, it is mapped to 0 (white)\n\n4.  **Arrange Objects:** Create an output grid by arranging the bounding boxes of the objects. Objects are placed in rows. The total width of a row should not exceed 8. If the next object can fit horizontally (current row width + object width <= 8), combine it with the current row by:\n    *   Determine maximum height: Take the maximum of the current row height and new object's height.\n    *   Pad rows: Pad the current row and new row with 0s to make sure that their heights are the same before concatenation.\n    *   Concatenate horizontally.\n\n    If the next object cannot fit horizontally, start a new row.\n\n5.  **Combine Rows:** Combine rows vertically to construct the final output.\n\n6. **Handle Empty Output:** If no objects were in input, return an empty grid.\n\n7. **Empty Row Check:** Use `current_row.size != 0` to check if the current row is empty.\n"
