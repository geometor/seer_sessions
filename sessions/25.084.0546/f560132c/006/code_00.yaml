      The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid,
      recoloring them based on a predefined mapping, and arranging them into
      a new grid. The arrangement follows a row-wise packing strategy, where
      each row has a maximum width of 8. Objects are placed in rows, and rows are
      stacked vertically. The error lies in how empty rows are checked.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are contiguous regions of non-zero pixels of the same color.
      Adjacency is defined by sharing a side (not just a corner).
  - object_properties:
      - color: Original color of the object in the input grid.
      - bounding_box: Smallest rectangle enclosing the object (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col).
      - mapped_color: New color assigned based on the color_map.
      - width: width of bounding box.
      - height: height of bounding box
  - actions:
      - identify: Find all objects in the input grid.
      - map_color: Change the color of each object based on the color mapping.
      - arrange: Place objects into rows, with a maximum row width of 8.
      - combine_rows: Stack rows vertically to create the final output.
  - error_analysis: |
      The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" occurs
      because of incorrect conditional checks on NumPy arrays, specifically when checking if
      'current_row' is empty or not using 'if current_row.size > 0'.
