Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code identifies and duplicates specific rows based on two patterns: "alternating" and "three-section". The results show the code fails to correctly transform all three examples. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Duplication Logic for Alternating Rows:** The code duplicates the alternating rows and any adjacent solid-color rows, but the location and logic are flawed. It looks for *all* alternating rows in the input, rather than just the ones present at the beginning.
2.  **Incorrect Duplication and insertion logic three-section pattern**: The code attempts to duplicate the row, but it duplicates and insert at the end, the row at the original position. This is not the case for all patterns
3.   **Missing Context:** Example 3 introduces the case where rows are inserted multiple times.

The core strategy to fix this is:
*   Refactor how pattern rows are identified, inserted and how offsets are handled.
*   Iterate through input examples and apply refactoring.

**Metrics and Observations (per example)**

To better understand the errors, let's collect some information about each example.
