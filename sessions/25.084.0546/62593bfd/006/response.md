Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of object identification and stacking. However, the execution on the training examples reveals several critical flaws:

1.  **Incorrect Stacking Order within Row Bands:** Example 1 clearly shows the "1" objects and some of the "2" objects stacked in the incorrect order. My current logic sorts *only* by the maximum row of an object. I need to refine the ordering criteria within each row band. I am currently preserving the column, but not maintaining the original inter-row ordering correctly.
2.  **Misinterpretation of "Row Band":** The program appears to be treating each object's height individually, leading to overlapping and incorrect placement. A "row band" should likely be defined by rows with *any* object pixels, not by the height of a single object.
3. **Inconsistent Vertical Position** In Example 2, all the non-background objects should be re-arranged at the top, preserving the horizontal position, but ordered vertically bottom-to-top.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Focus on Row Bands:** I need to redefine how I determine where to place objects. My current logic is close, and I think I can adapt the `current_row` logic.
2.  **Refine Object Ordering:** Within each identified "row band," I must order objects based on their *original* row position in the input, prioritizing objects that appear lower in the input grid.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** I'll analyze each example, identify specific errors, and adjust the natural language program and code incrementally.

**Metrics and Observations (Examples and Results):**

I will generate reports that analyze specific properties to help me understand the issues:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Observation:** Objects are stacked, but the internal order within row bands is incorrect. The '1' objects are not in the correct locations, and the '2' objects are out of order.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Observation:** Objects are not stacked starting at the top row. The vertical ordering is inconsistent with bottom to top.
