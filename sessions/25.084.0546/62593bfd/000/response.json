The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or filtering of colored objects within the grid, maintaining the relative position of some. There's a sense of object permanence.  Colors appear and disappear, and objects are transposed, mirrored or inverted, but those changes appear based on regular rules.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
