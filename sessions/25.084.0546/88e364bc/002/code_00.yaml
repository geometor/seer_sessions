objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable (rows x columns)

  - name: orange_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange (represented by value 4)
      - position: row, column coordinates within the grid

actions:
  - name: move
    description: Change the position of an orange pixel.
    constraints:
      - target_positions: Must be a location where an orange pixel existed in any of the training input grids.
      - prioritization: Preferentially move to an adjacent cell. If not possible, move within the same row.  If still not possible, move within the same column.  Otherwise, move to any valid location from the training inputs.
