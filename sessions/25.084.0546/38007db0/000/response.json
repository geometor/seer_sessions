The input grids are larger, and the output grids are smaller, cropped versions of the input. The cropping seems to follow a consistent pattern, focusing on a central portion of the input. The outer \"border\" of pixels is removed. There are distinct, repeating sub-patterns *within* each larger grid, almost like a quilt. The crop seems to maintain the integrity of some of these inner patterns. In train_1 the inner pattern is 6x6, and in train_2 it appears to be 7x7.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For train_1 it is a 6x6 block, in train_2 it's a 7x7 block.\n2.  **Determine cropping parameters:**  The output grid is created by removing an equal number of rows from the top and bottom, and an equal number of columns from the left and right of input. The number of removed rows and columns is determined by finding a repeating unit.\n3. **Crop the input:** Remove the determined number of rows and columns and return the new grid. Specifically, remove columns on each side equal to the width of repeating unit, and the same for rows.\n\nIn simpler terms: The transformation crops the input grid to a smaller size. The amount cropped is constant and is determined from the repeating pattern within the input grid. The cropped area maintains some of the repeating sub-patterns of the input.\n"
