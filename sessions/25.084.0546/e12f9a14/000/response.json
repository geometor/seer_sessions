            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements**\n\nThe task involves transforming grids of colored pixels. The dominant color is '8' (azure), which seems to act as a background. Other colors appear in contiguous blocks, forming shapes. The transformation often involves adding, removing, or shifting colors, sometimes mirroring portions of the input, or changing the colors based on specific conditions. There's also an element of identifying and preserving/transforming shapes in the input and some diagonal operations.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

Diagonal mirroring is seen.\n  - observation: |\n      In train_4: A complex color transformation involving colors 3 and 6.\n\n```"

For example the 3s on the left become 9s, the 4s on the right become 3s, the 8s at top become 4s.\n4. **train\\_2**:\n      *   Propagate the color 4 vertically in the top two lines if a 4 is below. Propagate the color 4 horizontally if a four is to its left, up until the boundry of color 8.\n      *   If a block is 3s bordered by 8 on top and 4 on the left, transform the top of the 3s into a four.\n      *   A four below and 8 to its left create a 4 in the cell.\n5. **train\\_3**:\n      *   Mirror the shape in the bottom left (of 7s, 3s) across the diagonal.\n      *   Copy a shape of 2s above the shape of 3s across the diagonal\n      *   If there are shapes to be transformed, translate the colors in the shapes:\n        * 2s become 2\n        * 3s become 2, 3, 4 on the edges\n        * 4s become 4\n        * 7s become 7\n6. **train\\_4**:\n    * If the pixel color is not 3 or 6 or 8, skip the pixel.\n      *   If 8 on the left, become 6.\n      *   If 8 on top, become 6.\n      *   If 3 on top, become 6.\n\n"
