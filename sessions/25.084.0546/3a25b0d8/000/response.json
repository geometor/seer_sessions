Each digit corresponds to a color.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects. There are many objects of many shapes and sizes.\n*   **Background:** There seem to be large areas of uniform color, potentially acting as a background. The first example is mostly azure (8), while the second example is mostly blue (1).\n*   **Changes in Size:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid in both examples. The aspect ratio also changes. This isn't a simple cropping.\n*   **Color Preservation:** While the shape changes, some colors in input are present in the output. Some colors are not present in the output.\n*    **Object Reduction**: The number of objects in output is fewer than input\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

There appears to be some \"stretching\" of pixels vertically.\n"
