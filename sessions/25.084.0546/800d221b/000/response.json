The examples feature objects of various shapes and sizes.\n*   **Transformations:** It's not immediately obvious what the single transformation rule is. There are color changes, but they are not simple one-to-one mappings. There's also apparent object interaction. The transformation logic may be dependant on its adjacent cells/objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It appears the input contains some source colors, and some 'key' colors, and there are other key colors in the output. The program finds a source color and replaces it with a key color, using some rules for adjacency:\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Key Triples:**\n    *   Find all instances of key triples, being one of the colors from a list of triples `[(7,8,6),(9,8,4),(5,2,1)]` that appear in that exact horizontal or vertical order, next to eachother, in either direction.\n3. **Color Replacement**:\n    * Replace the middle number of the triple, with the number on the right, for example `7` in `(7,8,6)` or `9` in `(9,8,4)`.\n4. **Output** is result of all replacements on input.\n\nFurther refinement will likely be needed as we test this program against the examples and consider additional test cases. The \"color context\" relationship seems crucial.\n"
