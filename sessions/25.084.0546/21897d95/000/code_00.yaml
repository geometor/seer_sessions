facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have different dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Colors in the input grid do not directly map to the same colors in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Connected components of the same color in the input appear to be treated as distinct objects.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, the orange 7 object transforms into a green 3 frame.
  - observation: |
      In train_2, the green 3 frame remains a green 3 frame.
  - observation: |
      In train_3, the green 3 object transforms into a light blue 8 frame.
  - observation: |
      In train_4, the green 3 object remains a green 3 frame.
  - observation: |
      Objects composed of colors 1,4,5,6,8 and 9 in the input are not represented in the output.
  - hypothesis: |
      One object, that is a contiguous block of color, is chosen as "foreground".
  - hypothesis: |
      All other objects of the same color as the foreground object will expand to fill all space in the output
  - hypothesis: |
      Colors not present in the foreground will be excluded from the output.
