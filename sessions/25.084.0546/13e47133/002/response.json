            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simplified understanding of the transformation, primarily focusing on mirroring around red \"anchor\" pixels. The results clearly show this is insufficient. The mirroring is not always a simple reflection, and the color transformations are more complex than initially assumed. There's an asymmetry in how the left and right sides of the anchors are handled. Example 2 reveals additional complexities related to interactions between multiple anchors in the same row, color changes based on position, and a \"cascading\" effect of color propagation. The color gray appears to act as an anchor, and the color propagation appears to stop.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to:\n    *   The position and number of anchors (red and other potential anchors).\n    *   The color transformations on both sides of each anchor.\n    *   The extent of propagation (how far a color \"spreads\" from its origin).\n    *   The interactions between multiple anchors in a row.\n    *   The behavior on the edges of the grid.\n\n2.  **Refine Color Transformation Rules:** Establish precise rules for how each input color is transformed to an output color, considering its position relative to the anchors. It seems like a lookup table or a set of conditional statements will be needed for this.\n\n3.  **Update Mirroring/Propagation Logic:** The concept of \"mirroring\" is not entirely accurate. It's more like a directional propagation of transformed colors, potentially with different rules for left and right propagation, and with specific stopping conditions.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use the gathered metrics to verify your assumptions and make small changes.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to get a better breakdown of colors and to analyze the differences.\n\n"
