The transformation isn't a simple one-to-one mapping of colors. Instead, it seems to involve a combination of:\n\n1.  **Color Substitution/Replication:** Certain colors in the input grid seem to trigger the replication of other colors.\n2.  **Neighborhood Influence:** The transformation of a pixel appears to be influenced by its neighboring pixels. This includes direct neighbors and possibly diagonally adjacent pixels.\n3. **Object Creation/Modification**: It seems likely that shapes are altered/created based on some rules.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
