            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and results to refine the natural language program and address the errors in the generated code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and attempted to generalize a rule involving anchor-based (red=2, gray=5) horizontal propagation and mirroring. However, the results on the second training example show significant discrepancies (high \"Pixels Off\" count). This indicates that the initial generalization was too narrow and didn't capture the full complexity of the transformation rule. The propagation rules to the left of the anchor and especially mirroring are incorrect and need significant revisions, also the second example introduces gray=5 as a blocker which is incorrectly implemented.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Analyze Example 2 Carefully:**  We need to meticulously examine the second example's input and expected output to understand how the transformation differs from the first example's logic. Pay close attention to:\n    *   How the presence of `3` influences the propagation.\n    *   The effect of `1` and `8` in different positions.\n    *   The precise mirroring rules around the red anchors (`2`).\n    *   The role of the grey anchors (`5`) and the colors between the anchors.\n\n2. **Refine Transformation Rules:** Based on the analysis of Example 2, we'll rewrite the transformation rules (_transform\\_left and _transform\\_right) and the main `transform` function's logic to handle the variations.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing:** After updating the code, we'll re-run the tests on *both* examples to ensure that the changes improve the overall accuracy and don't introduce regressions.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nI will use python to check some assumptions and record information that will be helpful for generating the natural language program.\n\n"
