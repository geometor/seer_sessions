Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code identifies connected regions (objects) and attempts to apply color transformations based on a predefined `color_map` and a rudimentary `is_inside` check. The results show a significant number of mismatches, indicating that the transformation logic is incomplete and inaccurate. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incomplete Color Mapping:** The `color_map` is not comprehensive enough to handle all color transformations observed in the examples. It needs to be derived from the data, not predefined.
2.  **Inadequate Relationship Handling:** The `is_inside` check is too simplistic. It only checks for complete subset relationships, missing more complex interactions between objects, like partial enclosure and adjacency
3. **Mirroring, Rotation Not Handled**: The code lacks logic to determine if an object is mirrored, rotated, or translated.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Dynamic Color Mapping:** Instead of a hardcoded `color_map`, we'll create a function to dynamically determine the color mapping between input and output objects based on their properties (size, position, relationships).
2.  **Improved Relationship Analysis:** Enhance `is_inside` or create a new function `get_relationship` to capture more nuanced object relationships:
    *   **Complete enclosure:** One object fully contains another.
    *   **Partial enclosure:** One object partially overlaps another.
    *   **Adjacency:** Objects touching side by side or diagonally.
    * Relative position (above, below, left, right)
3. **Consider mirroring:** Detect and apply mirroring transformations.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Apply the updated logic to each example and iteratively adjust the rules based on the results.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**

I need counts of objects, colors and details of the size and relative locations.
