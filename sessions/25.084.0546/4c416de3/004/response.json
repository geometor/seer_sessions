The results show a significant number of mismatches, indicating that the transformation logic is incomplete and inaccurate. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Color Mapping:** The `color_map` is not comprehensive enough to handle all color transformations observed in the examples. It needs to be derived from the data, not predefined.\n2.  **Inadequate Relationship Handling:** The `is_inside` check is too simplistic. It only checks for complete subset relationships, missing more complex interactions between objects, like partial enclosure and adjacency\n3. **Mirroring, Rotation Not Handled**: The code lacks logic to determine if an object is mirrored, rotated, or translated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Dynamic Color Mapping:** Instead of a hardcoded `color_map`, we'll create a function to dynamically determine the color mapping between input and output objects based on their properties (size, position, relationships).\n2.  **Improved Relationship Analysis:** Enhance `is_inside` or create a new function `get_relationship` to capture more nuanced object relationships:\n    *   **Complete enclosure:** One object fully contains another.\n    *   **Partial enclosure:** One object partially overlaps another.\n    *   **Adjacency:** Objects touching side by side or diagonally.\n    * Relative position (above, below, left, right)\n3. **Consider mirroring:** Detect and apply mirroring transformations.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Apply the updated logic to each example and iteratively adjust the rules based on the results.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nI need counts of objects, colors and details of the size and relative locations.\n\n"
