            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code implements a simple color mapping transformation. It's clear from the results that this is insufficient. The code fails to capture the more complex spatial relationships and context-dependent color changes. The \"Pixels Off\" count is very high in all three examples, indicating a fundamental mismatch between the predicted and expected transformations. The strategy needs to consider objectness, adjacency, and potentially mirroring/flipping based on the presence of other objects/colors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We need to go beyond simple pixel-by-pixel color mapping. Identify connected regions of the same color as objects.\n2.  **Contextual Transformation:** Analyze how these objects' colors change based on their neighbors and their position relative to other objects.\n3.  **Mirroring/Flipping Detection:** Several training examples show signs of symmetry. This is crucial to add.\n4. **Refine Based on Feedback:** The code execution outputs are good, we need to update code to handle objects and adjacencies.\n\n**Gather Metrics & YAML Facts:**\n\nI'll start with some high-level observations.\n\n"
