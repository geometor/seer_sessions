Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code implements a simple color mapping transformation. It's clear from the results that this is insufficient. The code fails to capture the more complex spatial relationships and context-dependent color changes. The "Pixels Off" count is very high in all three examples, indicating a fundamental mismatch between the predicted and expected transformations. The strategy needs to consider objectness, adjacency, and potentially mirroring/flipping based on the presence of other objects/colors.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We need to go beyond simple pixel-by-pixel color mapping. Identify connected regions of the same color as objects.
2.  **Contextual Transformation:** Analyze how these objects' colors change based on their neighbors and their position relative to other objects.
3.  **Mirroring/Flipping Detection:** Several training examples show signs of symmetry. This is crucial to add.
4. **Refine Based on Feedback:** The code execution outputs are good, we need to update code to handle objects and adjacencies.

**Gather Metrics & YAML Facts:**

I'll start with some high-level observations.

          shape: small rectangle
        - object_6:

      output_objects:
        - object_1:

        - object_5:
          color: red (2)
        - object_6:
          color: azure (8)
      transformations:
        - blue to green
        - yellow to magenta in black region
        - blue to green around edges of black regions
        - red stays red

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
      - object_1:
        color: azure (8)
      - object_2:
        color: blue(1)
      - object_3:
        color: black(0)
      - object_4:
        color: yellow (4)
      - object_5:
        color: magenta(6)
      - object_6:
          color: green (3)
      - object_7:
          color: red(2)
      - object_8:
          color: orange (7)
      transformations:
        - blue sections change according to adjacency
        - objects inside the blue change according to symmetry
        - black sections get mirrored

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
          - object_1:
            color: red (2)
          - object_2:
            color: black(0)
          - object_3:
            color: blue (1)
          - object_4:
            color: green (3)
          - object_5:
              color: maroon (9)
          - object_6:
            color: yellow(4)
          - object_7:
            color: azure (8)
      transformations:
        - a transformation occurs based on the shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Group contiguous pixels of the same color into objects.
2.  **Color Changes inside objects:**
    -   If an object is inside a larger object of a different color, it should change accordingly.
    -   If two of the same objects are next to each other, they will perform the same transformation.
3.  **Overall Transformation:** Apply a color mapping based on observations, considering spatial context and adjacency.
4. Consider symmetry

This revised natural language program should better guide the "coder" phase to create a more accurate transformation function.
