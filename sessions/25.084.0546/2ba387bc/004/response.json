            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and supporting information:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies rectangular blocks of non-white pixels and groups them by width. However, it fails to arrange the groups correctly in the output. The primary issue is the incorrect ordering and stacking of these groups. The code stacks rectangles of the same width vertically, then arranges these stacks horizontally. However, the examples show that the stacks need to be sorted, and rectangles with internal \"holes\" (0 valued pixels) have their width calculated including the white pixels. Furthermore and most importantly, rectangles are re-arranged based on their original horizontal positions and then re-arranged to minimize empty spaces on top.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Width Calculation:** Modify the `get_rectangles` function to calculate the effective width of each rectangle by considering \"holes\". It should determine width based on minimum and maximum column indices of non-white pixels *of that color* within the rectangle's rows.\n2. **Sorting Groups and Stacking:** It's critical to re-arrange groups based on their *original* column order, not just overall width. Each rectangle group needs to preserve its original order, stacked by column.\n3. **Vertical Compaction.** After stacking, consolidate the layout to remove the empty space at the top.\n4.  **Re-arrange Stacks.** Re-arrange Stacks horizontally by their original horizontal order.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using Python for analysis):**\n\nIt is difficult to use the code tool to create a comparative report in this case. However, it's important to note the following about each example:\n- In all cases, the generated result:\n    - has correct colors\n    - identifies and extracts each colored rectangle based on the min/max\n      indices in the grid\n    - groups the rectangles based on their original width\n- In all cases, the generated result DOES NOT:\n    - calculate the output size based on consolidating stacks vertically\n    - group the rectangles by original horizontal position and stacking order\n- The size (width and height) of the result will not match in any case because\n  the algorithm has the wrong rule for generating the size\n- The pixel positions do not match in any of the cases because of the\n  incorrect size calculations, incorrect order for the horizontal and vertical\n  position of the grouped rectangles.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"

A rectangle is defined by a contiguous block of the same color, but its *width* spans from the leftmost to the rightmost column containing that color *within the rows spanned by the rectangle*.\n2. **Group Rectangles:** Group the identified rectangles first by the *width* (including holes) and then by their horizontal position (min_col).\n3. **Stack Groups:** Within each group, stack the rectangles vertically based on the column and row span.\n4. **Vertical Compaction:** Shift blocks upwards to remove the empty space above each block.\n5. **Arrange Horizontally:** Order the groups horizontally based on their *original* horizontal positions (minimum column of the top-most rectangle).\n6. **Create Output:**  Construct the output grid by placing the stacked and compacted rectangle groups side-by-side in the determined order.\n\nThis refined program addresses the shortcomings of the previous version by incorporating the crucial aspects of rectangle width calculation, sorting and grouping rules, and vertical compaction.\n"
