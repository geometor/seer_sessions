Transforms the input grid by extracting rectangular blocks of non-white pixels,
grouping them by their effective width (including holes), and arranging these groups
horizontally in the output grid. Rectangles within each group are stacked
vertically, maintaining their original horizontal order. The groups are sorted
by the minimum horizontal position of any rectangle within them, and the layout is
compacted vertically.
