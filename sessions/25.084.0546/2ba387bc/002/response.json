            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the situation and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code is attempting to extract rectangular blocks, group them by width, and then stack them. The errors are all \"index out of bounds\" errors, meaning the code is trying to write to rows in the `output_grid` that don't exist. This strongly suggests a problem with how the output grid's height is being calculated. The original logic sums the *number* of rectangles in each width group to compute height. This is incorrect; it should sum the *heights* of the rectangles within each group. The code is also stacking the grouped rectangles vertically within each group *and* then stacking the groups beside each other, horizontally. The examples and the problem prompt appear to want to lay the *groups* out horizontally.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided training examples (1-4) to confirm the intended output structure.  I need to determine *precisely* how the rectangles are being reordered and stacked, paying close attention to the relationship between input and output dimensions.\n2.  **Correct Height Calculation:** Modify the `transform` function to calculate `output_height` by summing the *heights* of the rectangles within each group, not the *number* of rectangles.\n3.  **Verify Grouping and Stacking:** Double-check the logic for grouping and stacking rectangles.  The current approach seems to have a flaw regarding arranging each horizontal group.\n4. **Refine width calculation** Verify that the output_width is the sum of the widths of the *unique* widths represented in the input grid.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Example Analysis:**\n\nI'll use `tool_code` to get dimensions and other properties of each example's input and output.\n\n"
