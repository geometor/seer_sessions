            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe code attempts an erosion strategy, removing pixels that aren't horizontally or vertically connected to pixels of the same color. It also tries to handle lines by removing those that lack vertical support.  However, the results show significant discrepancies across all three examples. The strategy is too aggressive in removing pixels, and it doesn't correctly capture all the nuances of maintaining core connected shapes.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Verify Background Color:**  Double-check the `find_background_color` function's accuracy. It's fundamental, and errors there will cascade.\n2.  **Analyze Connectivity:** Examine how `is_connected` is used.  The current logic might be too strict, removing parts of valid shapes.\n3. **Examine Example Specifics:** Investigate, in detail, the errors to understand what shapes are being incorrectly modified.\n4. Refine the rule and code. It seems we need a more nuanced view of \"connectivity\" that preserves the core connected \"shapes\" of the same color, not just isolated horizontal/vertical lines.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using `tool_code`)**\n\nI need to gather some more specific information about the errors. I'll use python to compute:\n\n*   The predicted background color for each input.\n*   The number of pixels of each color in the input and expected output.\n* Report on locations that were changed incorrectly.\n\n"
