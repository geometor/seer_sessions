The results show that this approach is incorrect for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Shape Preservation:** The code incorrectly modifies shapes that should be preserved. In Example 1, it fails to erode some parts of the connected '4' shapes, and some single pixel anomalies.\n2.  **Incorrect Color Changes:** The code sometimes changes color that are not intended.\n3. **Color Palette and Count issues:** the transformed output includes colors not\n    in the original palette and colors that do not exist in the expected output.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating the Core Concept:** Instead of focusing on removing lines, we need to shift to identifying and preserving *connected components* or *shapes*.\n2.  **Refining \"Connectedness\":** The current `is_vertically_connected` function is too simplistic. We need to consider both horizontal and vertical (and possibly diagonal) connectivity to define a shape accurately.\n3.  **Background Color Detection:** The current approach hardcodes `background_color=1`. This needs to become a dynamic analysis.\n4.  **Isolated Pixel Removal:** The current logic for isolated pixel removal can probably be integrated with the main shape processing.\n5. **Revising Assumptions:** The code seems to oversimplify and it does not account for the complexities, and requires revision.\n\n**Gathering Metrics**\n\nLet's use code execution to gather more specific information about the examples. We will examine the color palettes and compare the shapes.\n\n"
