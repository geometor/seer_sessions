  - description: "Colored regions within the grid, excluding white (0)"
    properties:
      - color: "Integer representing the color of the object (1-9)"
      - pixels: "List of (row, column) tuples representing the object's location"
      - category: "Initial position category (top_left, top_right, middle_left, other)"
      - shape: "Implicitly rectangular, defined by the extent of its pixels"

actions:
  - name: "Move"
    description: "Objects are moved based on their initial category"
    rules:
      - category: "top_left"
        movement: "Shifted down to the 'middle_left' region, maintaining relative position and size."
      - category: "top_right"
        movement: "Shifted down to the 'middle_right' region, maintaining relative position and size."
      - category: "middle_left"
        movement: "Shifted down to the 'bottom_middle' region, maintaining relative position and size."
      - category: "other"
        movement: "No movement (remains in original position)." # This might need adjustment after full task understanding

grid:
  - description: "2D array of integers representing colors"
  - properties:
    - dimensions: "(rows, columns) representing the height and width of the grid"
