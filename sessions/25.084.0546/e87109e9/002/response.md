Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting data.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code failed to correctly transform the input grids for all three examples. The primary issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Azure Expansion:** The expansion of the azure (8) color is not consistent with the desired output in the examples. It seems to be expanding in places it should not, specifically where the initial background was. It also doesn't account for cases when there are other colors near azure.
2.  **Top Row Removal Interference:** The removal of top rows appears to interfere with azure color expansion in the subsequent step.
3.   **Incorrect Object Identification**: Azure region identification seems wrong. It needs to grow vertically.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Azure Expansion Logic:** Modify the expansion logic to consider only the bottom part of the image and, expand vertically only if there is background color beneath, and stop when non-background is met.
2.  **Prioritize Actions**: Correctly prioritize and order operations to avoid the azure expansion errors.

**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis (using code execution):**

Let's examine the color counts and dimensions of the input and output grids for each example to identify patterns.
