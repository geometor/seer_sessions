Here's a breakdown of the task, incorporating the results from the attempted code execution and outlining a strategy for improvement:

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempted a flood-fill-like expansion of azure (8) pixels, but it over-expanded and didn't capture the specific directional and alternating patterns evident in the examples. The code correctly identifies azure pixels as seeds for expansion but needs a more refined algorithm to control the expansion's direction, extent, and conditions.  The key is to recognize that the expansion isn't simply "neighboring," but has a precise geometric relationship governed by rows and columns, often skipping cells.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** Carefully examine the input/output pairs, especially where the previous code failed. The goal is to find a precise geometric rule, not just a general "expansion." Look for patterns in rows and columns, symmetries, and distances.

2.  **Controlled Expansion:** Instead of a simple flood fill (iterating over all neighbors), implement a rule that selectively expands based on the observed geometric pattern.  This might involve expanding only in specific directions, skipping certain cells, or having a maximum expansion distance that depends on the row/column.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Test the updated rule after each change. Don't try to solve everything at once. Start with the simplest example and progressively generalize.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use manual observation here.  The code execution environment is not conducive to visual grid manipulation, and the core issue is pattern recognition, not computation.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has a small cluster of azure pixels.
    *   Output shows an intricate pattern of azure and white, extending beyond the immediate neighbors.  It has diagonal elements and seems to "skip" over some white cells.
    *   The previous code greatly over-expanded, filling almost the entire grid with azure.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has a single vertical line of azure pixels, interrupted by a horizontal line of azure and other colored pixels.
    *   Output shows a complex pattern. Note how expansion appears to "wrap" around the grid in some cases.
    *   The previous code again over-expanded, not respecting the complex, wrapping pattern.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has a central "cross" of azure pixels.
    *   Output exhibits a similar alternating pattern, with expansions following diagonal lines.
    *   The over-expansion is evident.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: pixels
      colors: [0 (white), 8 (azure)]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: int (0-9)
      row: int
      col: int
  - type: seed_pixel
    properties:
       color: 8
       locations: list of (row, col)

actions:
  - name: expand_azure
    input: grid
    output: grid
    rule: >
        Identify "seed" pixels (value 8 in input).
        Expand these seeds outwards based on a geometric pattern,
        replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8).
        The pattern is not a simple flood fill.  It appears to have
        diagonal components and may involve skipping some white cells. The expansion appears to respect and possibly wrap around the grid edges.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Seeds:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.

2.  **Geometric Expansion:** The output grid's azure pixels are formed by applying the following rule and expanding it from the seed points and recursively.
    * If a pixel location `(r,c)` contains azure, it's output is azure.
    * Consider `(r, c)` containing white.  If any of these 8 pixels have the value azure in the input grid, then the output value for `(r,c)` is azure:
    
```
        (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c+1)
        (r-2, c), (r+2, c)
        (r, c-2), (r, c+2)
        (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c+1)
    ```


3.  **Output:** The final output grid is the result of applying the geometric expansion.

The core idea is to translate the observed geometric relationship. The code needs to check a set of relative offsets from each empty cell.
