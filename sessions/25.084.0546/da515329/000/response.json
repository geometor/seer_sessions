The 8s in the input seem to act as \"seeds\" that expand in a complex, somewhat irregular pattern. The expansion isn't a simple dilation or flood fill; it appears to be constrained by certain rules and possibly influenced by the relative positions of the initial 8s.  The final pattern seems to create interlocking regions of azure.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"

Identify all \"seed\" pixels, which are pixels with a value of 8 (azure).\n\n2. **Expansion:** For each seed pixel, expand outwards in all directions, in a diagonal pattern.\n\n3. **Create Boundary:** At each expansion, check for neighboring non-zero pixels.\n   - If another azure pixel is expanding, leave a white pixel as the boundary.\n   - If a boundary is already formed, fill in azure pixels to connect with a neighbor, but maintain at least 1 white between clusters.\n\n4. **Completion:** Repeat the expansion process until no further expansion is possible. Specifically, the azure creates clusters of irregular size and shape, separated by mostly single white lines. The azure does seem to cross boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the azure regions grow from initial seed points in a non-uniform, directionally unconstrained, fashion, filling the grid while respecting boundaries created by other expanding regions.\n"
