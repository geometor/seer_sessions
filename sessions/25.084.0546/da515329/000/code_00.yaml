      description: Azure pixels expand outwards, replacing white pixels.
      constraints:
       - The expansion pattern isn't simple uniform, but maintains some distance between the azure clusters.
       - horizontal and diagonal expansions are possible, not just orthogonal

  relationships:
    - initial_state: Input grid with sparse azure pixels.
    - final_state: Output grid with expanded azure regions.
    - transformation: Governed by a complex set of rules controlling the expansion of azure pixels.
