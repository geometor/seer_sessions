Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize on how to improve the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The code attempts to expand azure (8) pixels outwards from their initial positions, acting as "seeds". The expansion is limited by the presence of other nearby azure pixels, attempting to create some form of boundary or interlocking pattern. However, the current implementation doesn't accurately capture the intricate patterns observed in the expected outputs. The results show significant discrepancies in pixel placement, particularly in how the expansion fills the space and forms boundaries. The `nearby_8s <= 3` condition seems to be too permissive, allowing expansion in many cases that it should probably not. The strategy to iterate 5 times might not relate directly with the examples provided, also it is clear that the expansion logic doesn't correctly capture the complex interactions between expanding regions.

The core issues are:

1.  **Overly Aggressive Expansion:** The expansion logic is too aggressive, filling in areas that should remain white (0).
2.  **Incorrect Boundary Handling:** The `nearby_8s` check doesn't properly model the boundaries between the expanding regions. The boundaries don't seem to consistently form based on neighboring 8's as the code attempts.
3.  **Fixed Iterations:** The expansion is looped five times independent of the input.

To address these, we will:

1.  **Refine Expansion Criteria:** We need a more sophisticated rule for determining when a pixel should be filled. Proximity to existing 8s should be considered, potentially weighted by the number of, as well as the surrounding pattern of white and azure pixels.
2.  **Analyze Boundary Formation:** We must carefully study how the boundaries are formed in the expected outputs. They are not simply based on immediately adjacent pixels. Instead it looks more like a "wave" or an expansion with some complex rules to when it can go.
3.  **Dynamic Iteration:** Consider making the number of iterations dynamic, potentially stopping when no further changes occur.

**Metrics Gathering**

To better understand the expansion patterns, let's gather some information using code execution. Specifically, I want to quantify:

*   The initial number of azure pixels.
*   The number of azure pixels in the expected output.
*   The size of the grid (rows and cols).
*   Examine pixel neighborhoods in the output grid.

    description:  Expands an azure pixel (seed) to neighboring white pixels based on a rule. This expansion creates complex shapes and patterns. It propagates outwards, but the specific rules governing the propagation and termination of the expansion need further refinement.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Seeds:** Locate all azure pixels (value 8) in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.
2.  **Iterative Expansion:** Iterate a number of times, possibly until there is no change. In each iteration:
    *   For each white (0) pixel in the grid, check the 8 neighbors around that cell.
    *   If any direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right) is an 8, then fill with an eight.
    *    This rule creates diagonal and horizontal/vertical connections, as in, it does not "jump over gaps".

The key here is that the iteration is a key concept. And only direct neighbors trigger a change.
