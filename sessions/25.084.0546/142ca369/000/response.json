The transformation seems to involve a combination of:\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identifying contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as distinct objects.\n2.  **Object Movement/Duplication:** It appears objects might be moving or being duplicated, potentially based on their initial positions or the presence of other objects.\n3. **Color Changes:** Some objects change color.\n4. **Object Combination**: It appears that objects are combining.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
