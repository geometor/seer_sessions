"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels. Each block is an object.
2.  **Object Pairing and Connection:** Objects of different colors will attempt to connect diagonally based on these rules:
    *   Objects are considered for connection if they are within reasonable proximity. Objects far apart will not connect.
    *   Objects that *can* connect diagonally *will* connect diagonally. If a direct diagonal connection would pass through another object, the connection is not made.
    *   Objects that have multiple potential connections will connect to all valid partners.
    * Connections use a fill width that expands to the narrowest dimension of the two connecting objects, centered.

3. **Drawing Connections**
   * From the center of the first object, move diagonally towards the center of its connecting partner.
   * Connect to the center of the other object.
   * Expand the connection line to match the width of the *narrowest* of the two connecting objects. If one of the objects has a width of 1, the connection remains 1 pixel wide.
   * If more than one object shares the narrowest width, and they are both connecting to a larger object, use the combined width.

Okay, let's analyze the provided results and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The code's current strategy is to identify contiguous objects, find potential diagonal connections, and draw lines between them. However, the results show significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs across all three examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Connection Logic:** The code doesn't accurately determine *which* objects should connect. It appears to connect objects too eagerly or not correctly, based on proximity and a flawed diagonal path check.
2.  **Inaccurate Drawing:** Even when objects are (sometimes coincidentally) correctly identified for connection, the drawing logic is imperfect. It doesn't consistently follow the diagonal path, and the fill width is not being applied according to the described rules. The drawing also seems to use the wrong starting points.
3.  **Missing diagonal filling:** The code draws thin diagonal lines, in some cases, while it should fill in all cells along the diagonal.

To resolve these errors, we need a multi-pronged approach:

1.  **Refine Object Connection Rules:** We must establish more precise rules for object connections. Proximity alone isn't sufficient. We need to analyze the relative positions, colors, and possibly shapes of objects to determine valid connections.
2.  **Improve Drawing Algorithm:** The diagonal drawing needs to be corrected to properly trace the diagonal path between object centers, with accurate fill-width implementation.
3. **Verify Object Identification** Verify object identification works.

**Metrics Gathering (using `tool_code`)**

We will gather data to determine information such as:

*   Number of objects in input and output
*   Bounding box of objects
*   Dimensions of objects
*   Colors of Objects
*   Relative positions of objects (center-to-center deltas)
