Within these grids, there are objects of other colors: blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), and red (2). The most prominent change seems to be related to the red (2) pixels.  The other colors appear to serve as some sort of input signal or trigger for the transformation related to the red pixels. The azure pixels can be thought of as background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
