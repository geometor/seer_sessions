facts:
  - observation: "Input grids have varied colors and shapes."
  - observation: "Output grids have fewer colors and simpler rectangular shapes."
  - object: "colored_blocks"
    properties:
      - color: "varies (0-9)"
      - shape: "irregular in input, rectangular in output"
    actions:
      - "consolidated"
      - "color_transformed"
  - relationship: "Input colors map to output colors, but not directly."
  - rule: "Green (3) seems to be the dominant color. It overwrites any other colors."
  - rule: "If there is no green present, then combine other colors with the following priority: blue(1), magenta (6), yellow (4), gray (5), azure (8), red(2)."
  - rule: "Colors combine until each maximal block of one color is combined, and then that is the combined color and the algorithm stops."
  - rule: "colors surround the dominant color"
