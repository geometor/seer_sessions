Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation occurring between the input and output grids.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input grids contain various colored objects (represented by different digits).
*    There seems to be a process of simplifying or reducing the input grid to a set of colored rectangles in the output.
*   Colors seem to have a correspondence between input and output, but not a direct 1:1 mapping. Some colors disappear, others are replaced.
*   The output grids appear to consist of larger, more uniform blocks of color compared to the more scattered and varied colors in the input.
* There appear to be colors that dominate others when combined.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids have varied colors and shapes."
  - observation: "Output grids have fewer colors and simpler rectangular shapes."
  - object: "colored_blocks"
    properties:
      - color: "varies (0-9)"
      - shape: "irregular in input, rectangular in output"
    actions:
      - "consolidated"
      - "color_transformed"
  - relationship: "Input colors map to output colors, but not directly."
  - rule: "Green (3) seems to be the dominant color. It overwrites any other colors."
  - rule: "If there is no green present, then combine other colors with the following priority: blue(1), magenta (6), yellow (4), gray (5), azure (8), red(2)."
  - rule: "Colors combine until each maximal block of one color is combined, and then that is the combined color and the algorithm stops."
  - rule: "colors surround the dominant color"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. These are our initial objects.
2.  **Color Priority and Combination:**
    *   If a Green (3) block exists anywhere in the input, the entire output grid becomes Green (3).
    *  If any of the colors 7, 0, and 9 (orange, white, maroon) are present they are removed.
    *    If no Green (3) exists, begin combining other colored blocks based on this priority: Blue(1), Magenta(6), Yellow (4), Gray(5), Azure(8), then Red(2). Start with color of the highest priority found anywhere in the grid, and replace all blocks connected to it. Repeat this process until there is only one block.
3.  **Shape Transformation:** The identified and color-transformed blocks are then made rectangular. Each separate block becomes a solid rectangle of that one color.
4. Output the color-combined grid.
