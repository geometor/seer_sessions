            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the assumption that green (3) dominates all other colors, and if green is present, the entire output grid becomes green. This is clearly demonstrated in both Example 1 and Example 2, where the presence of even a small amount of green results in a fully green output grid. The code also attempts to handle cases without green by combining other colors based on a priority, simplifying shapes to rectangles, and removing colors 0, 7, and 9. However, since the green dominates rule is not true, there is no need for all of this other logic.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to:\n1. Remove the \"green dominates all\" logic.\n2. Determine actual relationships between the input and output\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains colors 2 (red), 7 (orange), 8 (azure), 1 (blue), and 3 (green).\n*   **Output:** Contains a combined version of the input.\n*   **Initial Code Result:** Incorrect. The entire grid is green due to the dominance rule.\n* **Key Observation:** We see shapes of color 2, 8, 1, and 3 combined, with a\n    bounding box\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Contains colors 8 (azure), 3 (green), 1 (blue), 5 (gray), 4 (yellow), and 6 (magenta).\n*   **Output:** Contains colors 3 (green), 1(blue), 4(yellow), 5(grey) and 6 (magenta).\n*   **Initial Code Result:** Incorrect. The entire grid is green.\n* **Key observation:** We see shapes of each color\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
