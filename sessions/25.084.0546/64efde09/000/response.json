Some areas are changed, others are preserved, some seem to have color changes, others have entire rows replaced. Some random rows of the background seem to be randomly replaced.\n*    It appears the transformation is inserting copies of the top rows and inserting it randomly in other rows.\n* It also looks like, any colors on the right most side of an inserted segment will be duplicated down.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
