The transformation involves identifying contiguous objects of the same color in the input grid. The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of the input, but it's not a direct sampling of rows. Instead, the output appears to be constructed by identifying certain key features or objects from the input, potentially those that are most prominent or have specific spatial relationships, and representing only those features in a condensed format. The selection process for which features to include isn't based on a fixed size or simple downsampling. It's more likely based on a combination of factors such as object size, color frequency, or relative positions.

The current hypothesis, based on the dream and failed execution, focuses
on finding prominent rows of objects and extracting these into a condensed form.
