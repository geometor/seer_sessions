```python
"""
This program extracts a subgrid from the input grid located at the top-left
corner. The dimensions of this subgrid are determined based on the color of the
top-left pixel: 5x5 if the color is 1 (blue), and 4x4 if the color is 4
(yellow).  The program then filters the colors within this subgrid.  If the
subgrid is 5x5, all colors except 2 (red) are changed to 0 (black), and if the
first row is all black, it is changed to 6 (magenta). If the subgrid is 4x4,
all colors except 2 (red) are changed to 0 (black).
