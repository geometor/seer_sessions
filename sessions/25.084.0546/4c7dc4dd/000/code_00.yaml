facts:
  - observation: Input grids are large and seemingly random.
  - observation: Output grids are much smaller than input grids.
  - observation: Output grid colors are present in input grid, but not all input colors necessarily make it to output.
  - observation: Output consists mostly of black (0) with some other color. In example 1, white(0) is dominant with some magenta(6) and in example 2, black(0) is dominant with azure (8)
