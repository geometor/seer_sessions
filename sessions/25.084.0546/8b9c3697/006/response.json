            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code focused solely on replacing all red (2) pixels with white (0) pixels. While this works for some instances, it fails to capture the complete context and transformation rule, as evidenced by the mismatches in the test cases. The code correctly identifies contiguous red objects and replaces them, but there's clearly more nuance present in the examples that isn't reflected in our current approach. The errors seem related to how the code is handling multiple objects, different background colors, and it's getting confused by extraneous details.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We need to improve our object identification. The current implementation uses a simple depth-first search (DFS) to find contiguous regions of the *same* color. This is generally good but it doesn't always explain all the cases.\n\n2.  **Contextual Rules:** It's essential to determine if the transformation depends on something other than just color. We need to examine the *relative positions* of objects, their *shapes*, and any other spatial relationships.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Analyze each example, identify discrepancies, and iteratively refine the natural language program and code. We will focus on the *simplest* explanation that covers all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's examine each example in more detail using numpy.\n\n"
