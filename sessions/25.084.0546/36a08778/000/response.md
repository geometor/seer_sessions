Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 2D grids of varying sizes.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of different colors, represented by integers (0-9). In these examples, we mostly see colors 7 (orange), 6 (magenta), 2 (red), and potentially others.
*   **Objects:** There are contiguous blocks of the same color which we can consider as objects.
* **Change:** Comparing each input with the output, it looks like the output has added a vertical border of color 6 (magenta), and there's selective insertion/change/addition of magenta within the body.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: 7  # Orange
    type: background
    description: Appears to be the dominant background color.
  - color: 2  # Red
    type: shape
    description: Forms distinct shapes within the orange background.
  - color: 6  # Magenta
    type: border/filler
    description: Added around and in existing layout, seems to form a border and selectively replace or overlay existing elements.

actions:
  - name: AddMagentaBorder
    description: A vertical line of magenta (color 6) is added or overlayed to the left of the entire pattern.
  - name: OverlayMagenta
    description: Some orange (7) pixels are selectively changed to magenta (6), often surrounding, or filling in gaps around the red regions.

relationships:
    - object1: 2 # Red
      object2: 6 # Magenta
      relation: EnclosedBy/AdjacentTo
      description: Magenta often appears adjacent to or surrounding red shapes.
    - object1: 7 # Orange
      object2: 6
      relation: ReplacedBy
      description: Magenta replaces Orange in many locations.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Add Left Magenta Border**: Add a vertical magenta (color 6) border on the left side of the grid, overlaying any existing color. If there is already magenta at a particular position, it should remain unchanged.

2.  **Overlay/Fill**: Starting from the leftmost column, replace orange (color 7) pixels with magenta (color 6) in a way that creates proximity or fills in 'gaps', 'holes', or 'empty' areas next to and around the red shapes. Stop expanding the magenta when no more red shapes or 'gaps' can be immediately filled. Consider the concept of erosion and expansion.

The transformation seems to expand the magenta color on the left, then fills regions next to the red color blocks.
