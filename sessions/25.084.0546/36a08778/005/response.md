"""
The transformation propagates magenta (6) from left to right, replacing orange (7) pixels under specific conditions. 
Magenta replaces orange if the orange pixel is adjacent to a magenta pixel AND the replacement maintains 
adjacency to a red (2) pixel *after* the change. The propagation seems to follow "paths" or "channels" created by
the red pixels. The initial seed for magenta is any orange on the left edge.
