  - name: 3x3_input_block
     type: subgrid
     properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3

actions:
  - name: compress_block
    description: Condenses a 3x3 block from the input grid into a single pixel in the output grid.
    parameters:
      - input: 3x3 block
      - output: single pixel

  - name: recolor
      description: certain colors change

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is derived from a central region of the input grid, with a reduction in size.
  - type: correspondence
    description: 3x3 blocks in the input correspond to single pixels in the output.
  - type: color_transformation
    description: during the transformation from the 3x3 to a pixel, values are mapped to different values.
