            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program and code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a misinterpretation of the transformation. The code incorrectly assumed a 3x3 block processing where each 3x3 block would be reduced to 1x1. It also had errors with indexing that cause it to write outside the boundaries. Instead, the transformation appears to be a 1x1 pixel mapping with specific color substitutions. The size reduction comes from the edge handling.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Indexing:** Fix array indexing so its operating on 1x1 at a time.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Color Transformations:** Re-examine the input and expected output pairs to determine the precise color mapping rules.\n3.  **Edge Handling:** Account for the gray (5) border in the output, but in a way that makes the correct dimensions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example by Example):**\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of first two examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 24x24\n    *   Expected Output Size: 19x19\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 21x22\n    *   The sizes were wrong and the location of the 5's are completely off.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 22x23\n    *   Expected Output Size: 18x13\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 20 x 21\n    *  The sizes were wrong and the location of the 5's are completely off.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
