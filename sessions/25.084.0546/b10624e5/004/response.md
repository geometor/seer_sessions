Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved mirroring objects across a horizontal blue line. It also included some specific recoloring rules. The tests on examples 1 and 2 reveal significant discrepancies, indicating that the initial program is not universally applicable. The primary issue is the incorrect mirroring and recoloring of objects, along with some object shifting. Example 2 has additional complexity, which might be a slight variation on mirroring. It seems that some form of 'partial' mirroring and relative shifting is involved based on relative object location.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Verify the `get_objects` function correctly identifies all contiguous objects in both input and output grids.
2.  **Blue Line Detection:** Ensure the `find_blue_line` function accurately detects the horizontal blue line in all cases.
3.  **Mirroring Logic:** Analyze the mirroring transformation more precisely. Determine if it's a true mirror or a more complex transformation (e.g., partial mirroring, shifting).
4. **Recoloring Logic:** Investigate the colors. Identify the color transformations taking place across the horizontal line. The current recoloring seems ad-hoc and needs a more general rule.
5. **Positional Changes**: Observe the changes in objects' locations, especially when the green object is moved.

**Metrics and Observations (Example 1 & 2):**

First, Let's use the color map to display the grids in color so it will be easier to visualize
