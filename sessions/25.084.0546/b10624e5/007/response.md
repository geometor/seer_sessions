"""
Transforms an input grid by mirroring objects across a central blue line and
recoloring/shifting some of them. Objects are mirrored based on their
corresponding positions relative to the blue line. Green objects are shifted
down one row after mirroring if they were originally above the line, and up one
row if they were originally below.  Maroon (9) objects are converted to red (2)
objects and expanded to occupy the same column on each side.
