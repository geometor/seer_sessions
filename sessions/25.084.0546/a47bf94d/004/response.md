Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the corresponding code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of object identification, azure object reflection, and insertion of colored pixels. However, the execution results reveal several critical errors:

1.  **Incorrect Reflection and Insertion Logic:** The reflection and insertion logic is flawed, especially in how it handles the position and number of inserted pixels relative to the azure objects. Example 1 highlights problems placing pixels near reflected objects and determining color, and Example 2 has significant placement issues.
2.  **Asymmetric Insertion:** The code doesn't correctly handle the symmetric insertion of colored pixels around the *centerline* relative to azure objects. It appears to count azure objects but miscalculates insertion points. The correct rule seems to be to insert a colored pixel for *each* azure object *on each side* of the center.
3. **Object Interaction:** The implementation could be more general when defining object properties.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_objects` function works correctly and can handle various object shapes and arrangements. We can leave this as it is because it seems to be working.
2.  **Correct Reflection:** Make the reflection logic place an object of the same size and shape on the opposite side of the grid.
3.  **Precise Insertion Rule:** Implement the insertion rule based on a clear understanding of symmetry and counting.
4. **Centerline determination**: The code needs to accurately determine the center line of the image, especially for the insert operations.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

I'll use code execution to extract some grid properties.


``` python
import numpy as np

def grid_properties(grid_string):
    grid = np.array([list(map(int, row.split())) for row in grid_string.strip().split('\n')])
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    center_col = cols // 2
    has_odd_cols = cols % 2 != 0

    #count azure
    azure_objects = []
    visited = set()
    for r in range(rows):
      for c in range(cols):
        if grid[r,c] == 8 and (r,c) not in visited:
          obj = []
          stack = [(r,c)]
          while stack:
            cur_r, cur_c = stack.pop()
            if (cur_r,cur_c) not in visited and 0<=cur_r<rows and 0<=cur_c<cols and grid[cur_r,cur_c] == 8:
              visited.add((cur_r, cur_c))
              obj.append((cur_r, cur_c))
              for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                stack.append((cur_r + dr, cur_c + dc))
          azure_objects.append(obj)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous set of pixels of the same non-zero color. Record the color and shape (coordinates) of each object.

2.  **Azure Object Reflection:** For each object with color azure (8):
    *   Create a reflected copy of the object. The reflected object's position is determined by mirroring its coordinates across the grid's vertical center line.  The reflected copy has same color as original.
    *   Keep the original azure colored object.

3.  **Non-Azure Object Transformation and Insertion:**
    * For each row in the grid and for each non-azure, non-white object in that row:
        *  Find the number of distinct azure objects to the left of the center column.  Insert one pixel of this non-azure object's color to the left of the center by the number of azure objects on that side. The inserted pixel's row is the same as the row of object being processed. The column is calculated to maintain the appropriate distance from the center.
        *  Find the number of distinct azure objects to the right of the center column (inclusive of center if width is odd). Insert one pixel of this object's color, mirrored horizontally, to the right of the center by the number of azure objects to that side.  The inserted pixel's row is the same as the row of the object being processed.

4.  **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by placing all original azure objects, reflected azure objects, and inserted pixels onto a blank grid of the same dimensions as the input. All other cells become white.
