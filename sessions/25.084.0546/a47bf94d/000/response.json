The transformation appears to involve a combination of:\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identifying contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as distinct objects.\n2.  **Color-Specific Transformations:** Applying different transformations based on the color of the object.\n3.  **Mirroring/Reflection:** Some objects of a specific color might be a reflection.\n4. **Insertion** of new objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
