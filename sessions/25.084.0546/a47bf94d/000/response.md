Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and formulating a natural language program:

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored pixels within a grid. The transformation appears to involve a combination of:

1.  **Object Identification:** Identifying contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as distinct objects.
2.  **Color-Specific Transformations:** Applying different transformations based on the color of the object.
3.  **Mirroring/Reflection:** Some objects of a specific color might be a reflection.
4. **Insertion** of new objects.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - objects: |
      - Rectangular blocks of uniform color.
      - Single pixels of a specific color.
  - object_properties:
      - Color (using the provided color map: white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
      - Position (row, column)
      - Dimensions (width, height)
  - actions:
      - color_change: |
          Specific colors are replaced by white (0).
      - object_movement: object of one color are repeated as an object of another color.
      - object_insertion: Some single-color pixels are inserted, maintaining symmetry.
  - relationships:
      - spatial: |
          Objects are adjacent or separated by background (white).
      - symmetric: Some objects are mirrored/reflected across a central vertical axis.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous rectangular blocks of the same color in the input grid.

2.  **Color-Specific Transformations:**
    *   All objects that do not have color azure (8) are changed to white.
    *   Each object of color azure (8) is duplicated using color of the object and reflected
        horizontally.
    *   Insert single pixels of the color of the reflected object, respecting
        horizontal symmetry across the middle columns. For each row, insert one
        pixel for each object present.

3. **Create output** Using the transformed objects and background, reconstruct the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
