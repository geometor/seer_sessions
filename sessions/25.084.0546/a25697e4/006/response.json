            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code's core logic revolves around two main scenarios: 1) the presence of a 2x2 red block, and 2) the absence of such a block. The mirroring logic differs significantly between these scenarios. The provided results show consistent mismatches, indicating issues in both scenarios, but especially the detailed placement of the mirrored objects and a possible color confusion. The code appears to be mixing up the red condition location.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Red Block Condition:** The current code focuses on the *lowest* 2x2 red block. The examples suggest a more complex trigger. Verify if it's indeed the lowest, or perhaps the *top-most*, or another criterion entirely. We need to determine the *exact* role of the 2x2 red square.\n\n2.  **Refine Mirroring Logic:**\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Red Block Present):** The current mirroring seems to be relative to the row *above* the red block. The exact mirroring position needs precise re-evaluation. It's highly likely the distance calculation or the reference point is off.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (No Red Block):** The code currently calculates a \"center row\" based on all non-blue pixels. This needs to be refined. It seems that a vertical reflection through a computed middle is correct, but the examples may indicate an even or odd number of rows causing a off by one error.\n\n3.  **Object Identification:** The object identification logic (`find_objects`) seems sound, excluding blue pixels (color 1) as intended. However, the sorting of the objects based on the maximum row (lowest first) may need to change.\n\n4.  **Color Palette:** The color palette seems correctly implemented, but the applied colors are wrong, we can reconfirm this if it remains an issue.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n"

Each object is defined by its color, a bounding box (min\\_row, min\\_col, max\\_row, max\\_col), and a list of pixel coordinates.\n\n2.  **Red Block Condition:** Check for the presence of a 2x2 red (color 2) block. Find the *top-most* 2x2 red block.\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **If a 2x2 red block is present:**\n        1.

Mirror *only* the objects that are *below* the red block.\n        4.  Mirroring is performed by calculating the distance of each pixel in the object to the reference row. The mirrored pixel's row is the reference row minus this distance. The column remains the same.\n        5. Lower objects have drawing priority in case of mirrored pixel overlap.\n        6. Any objects above the red block should not be mirrored, and should be drawn in the output without transformation.\n\n    *   **If no 2x2 red block is present:**\n        1.  Calculate the vertical center row of all non-blue pixels.  This is `(min_row + max_row) / 2` where `min_row` and `max_row` are the minimum and maximum row indices of any non-blue pixel.\n        2.  Mirror *all* objects across this center row.\n        3.  Mirroring is done by calculating the distance of each object pixel to the center row. The mirrored pixel's row is the center row minus this distance (rounded to the nearest integer). The column remains the same.\n        4. Lower objects have drawing priority in case of mirrored pixel overlap.\n"
