The transformation seems to involve a combination of object identification, color changes, and potentially some spatial reasoning or mirroring. There are distinct regions of color changes, often appearing as rectangular blocks or single lines. The unchanged parts of the input grids are always filled with the digit 1 (blue).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
