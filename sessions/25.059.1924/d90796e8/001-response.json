Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation seems to selectively change some of these digits/colors while leaving others untouched. The key seems to be identifying *which* digits are changed and *what* they are changed to. The color gray (5) appears in all inputs.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
