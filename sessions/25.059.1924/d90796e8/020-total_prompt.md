Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified and replaced *some* adjacent red and green pixels with azure. However, it appears the original implementation has a flaw: it processes *pairs* of red/green, not *all instances* where red and green are touching. The current algorithm finds red/green or green/red and turns the pair to azure. If three in a row exist, such as red, green, green, then it changes red, green to azure, azure and leaves the final green as it is. We need a method to ensure that *all* adjacent reds and greens are transformed, regardless of how many are touching.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results in Detail:** Carefully examine the provided input/output/predicted grids to understand precisely where the code's logic fails. Focus on cases with more than two adjacent red/green pixels.
2.  **Iterative Approach**: Instead of processing 'pairs' and stopping, we should find all pixels of one of the colors and inspect neighbors. The neighbors should be updated, then the process should repeat until no more neighbors of the chosen colors are identified.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To get precise metrics, I'll describe what I would expect from code execution. I'll simulate this since I can't directly execute code.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Simple, one red and one green adjacent.
    *   Expected Output: Both pixels should be azure.
    *   Predicted Output: Matches Expected.
    *   *Assessment:* The initial code works correctly for simple pairs.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: One red and one green adjacent.
    *   Expected Output: Both pixels should be azure.
    *   Predicted Output: Matches Expected.
    *   *Assessment:* The initial code works correctly for simple pairs.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Contains a horizontal line of three green pixels, with a single red pixel adjacent to the middle green one.
    *   Expected Output: All four of these pixels (three green, one red) should become azure.
    *   Predicted Output (from previous code): Only the red and the adjacent green pixel become azure, not other adjacent green pixels.
    *   *Assessment:* The code fails in cases where a red or green has more than one direct color neighbor.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: [red, green, azure, black]
      adjacency: [horizontal, vertical, diagonal]
    actions:
      - change_color:
          condition: adjacent to a pixel of a specific color
          new_color: azure

  - object: grid
    properties:
      rows: number of rows
      cols: number of columns
    actions: []
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through all pixels of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is red, check all its eight neighboring pixels (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
3.  If any neighbor is green, change both the original red pixel and the green neighbor to azure.
4. If a pixel is green, check all its eight neighboring pixels (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
5. If any neighbor is red, change both the original green pixel and the red neighbor to azure.
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5. Keep repeating until no more changes are made. (i.e., a pass through the grid results in zero color changes from red/green to azure).

The last step, the iterative approach, is essential to ensure that groups of red/green adjacent pixels all get converted to azure. The original version does not have this capability.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
