Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), green (3), red (2), and azure (8), with white (0) representing empty spaces. The transformation seems to focus on specific color changes within the grid, specifically how colors green and red are converted or replaced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x6 (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain color values (0-9)
  - type: color_pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - 0: white
          - 2: red
          - 3: green
          - 5: gray
          - 8: azure
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: color_change
    details:
     - original_color: 3 (green)
     - new_color: 8 (azure)
  - type: color_change
    details:
        - original_color: 2 (red)
        - new_color: 0 (white)

relationships:
- type: spatial
  details: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, with row and column indices.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color green (3).
2.  **Change** the color of these identified green pixels to azure (8).
3. **Identify** all pixels that are the color red (2).
4. **Change** the color of the identified red pixels to white(0).
5.  **Preserve** all other pixels (gray (5) and white (0)) in their original state and positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
