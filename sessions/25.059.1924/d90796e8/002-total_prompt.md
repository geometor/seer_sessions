**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation seems to selectively change some of these digits/colors while leaving others untouched. The key seems to be identifying *which* digits are changed and *what* they are changed to. The color gray (5) appears in all inputs.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: derived from value (using COLOR_MAP)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: change_value
    description: Changes the value of a cell from one integer to another.
  - name: keep
    description: keep some cells as they are.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - type: transformational
    description: Input grid cells map to output grid cells, with some values changing and other values unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Digits:** Examine the input grid. Identify all cells with the values that match green (3) and red(2).
2.  **Change to Azure:** If a cell is determined to be a target (green or red), change the number to 8 (azure).
3. **Keep the rest:** All other non-target digits remain unchanged.
4. **Preserve Grid Structure**: keep the dimensions of the output the same as the input.

In essence, the transformation replaces all instances of green(3) and red(2) with azure (8), keeping the grid dimensions and any other value in the grids the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
