Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct colored objects in the input grid. A colored object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Filter Objects:**  Keep the largest azure-colored object unchanged.
3.  **Select Pixels:** Select all the remaining single-pixel colored objects (points).
4.  **Sort Pixels:** Sort the selected single pixels by their color values in ascending order.
5.  **Position Pixels:** The selected pixels remain in same position.
6.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.  Copy the unchanged azure object to the output grid. Copy the selected and sorted pixels.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
