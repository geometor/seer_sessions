Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Single Pixels:** Examine the input grid to find all pixels that are not adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another pixel of the same color. These are "single pixels".

2.  **Record Colors:** Note the colors of these single pixels. We are interested in magenta (6), orange (7), yellow (4), and maroon (9).

3.  **Create Output Block:** Create a 2x2 block of pixels in the center of the output grid.
    -   Calculate the center row index: `output_grid.shape[0] // 2 - 1`
    -   Calculate the center column index: `output_grid.shape[1] // 2 - 1`

4.  **Populate Output Block (Conditional):**
    -   Fill the 2x2 block with the colors recorded from the single pixels in a predefined order:
        -   Top-left: magenta (6)
        -   Top-right: orange (7)
        -   Bottom-left: yellow (4)
        -   Bottom-right: maroon (9)
    -   If any of these colors are *not* found among the single pixels, use black (0) as the default value for the corresponding position in the 2x2 block.

5. **Clear Remaining Pixels:**  Set all pixels in the output grid *outside* the 2x2 block to black (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
