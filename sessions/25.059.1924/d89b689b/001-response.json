The input grids contain scattered single-colored pixels and, notably, 2x2 blocks of azure (8). The output grids appear to be a compressed representation, eliminating the azure blocks and repositioning the single colored pixels. The single pixels maintain their relative positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
