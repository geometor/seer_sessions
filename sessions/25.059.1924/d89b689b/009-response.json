The input grid contains several isolated single-pixel objects of different colors (grey (5), maroon (9), blue (1), red (2)) and a 2x2 block of azure(8) pixels. The output grid seems to retain some of these objects, but their positions are changed, and the 2x2 azure block is completely removed. The non-white pixels from the input are placed into a 2x2 block in the center of the output, although in a different arrangement/order.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
