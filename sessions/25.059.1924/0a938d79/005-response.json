            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the assumption that the transformation involved finding the first non-zero pixel and then creating an alternating pattern of two colors across each row, using the color of and starting from the column of the first non-zero pixel. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal that this assumption isn't universally valid. The actual rule is more complex. It maintains a two color repeating row and a two color repeating column pattern independently, then combines them.\n\nThe strategy to resolve errors involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze More Deeply**: Examine each input-output pair, and the program's output, paying close attention to the positions of non-zero pixels and the structure of the output grids. The code execution will expose the program's mistakes\n2.  **Refine Hypothesis**: Based on the observations, revise the natural language program to accurately capture the transformation logic. It appears the transformation is independent of where the non-zero pixel appear in the input.\n3.  **Regenerate Code**: With the improved natural language program, generate a new Python function.\n4.  **Iterate**: Repeat the process of testing, analysis, and refinement.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Code Execution**\n\nI'll use the `code_execution` tool (simulated here for demonstration) to generate a report comparing the expected output with the program output for each training example. Because the prompt includes the results of running the provided code on the inputs, I can just analyze that.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[2, 8, 2], [8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2]]`\n    *   Program Output: `[[2, 8, 2], [8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2]]`\n    *   Result: Correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 2, 8, 2], [2, 8, 2, 8], [8, 2, 8, 2]]`\n    *   Program Output: `[[2, 8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2, 8]]`\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The starting color appears incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[2, 8, 2, 8], [8, 2, 8, 2], [2, 8, 2, 8], [8, 2, 8, 2]]`\n    *   Program output: `[[2, 8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2, 8], [2, 8, 2, 8]]`\n    *   Result: Incorrect. All rows are the same.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - shape: variable (rows x columns)\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - shape: same as input_grid\n      - pattern: repeating 2x2 checkerboard\n\ncolors:\n  - value: 2\n    name: red\n  - value: 8\n    name: azure\n\nactions:\n  - name: create_checkerboard\n    description: Generates a 2x2 repeating pattern of red and azure.\n    input: output_grid dimensions\n    output: filled output_grid\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule creates a 2x2 checkerboard pattern using red (2) and azure (8) in the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The checkerboard pattern consists of repeating blocks of:\n\n```\n2 8\n8 2\n```\n\nThe position of the non-zero pixels in the input grid is irrelevant to the output.\n"
