Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single red (2) and green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Expand Red:** Replace all pixels in the row containing the red pixel with the value 2 (red).
3.  **Expand Green:** Replace all pixels in the row containing the green pixel with the value 3 (green).
4.  **Alternate and Repeat:** Starting from the row of the Red Pixel, alternate filling subsequent rows with red (2) and green (3) downwards and upwards, creating repeating two row chunks of one red, and one green, row.
5. **Maintain Grid Size:** The output grid retains the same dimensions (width and height) as the input grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
