            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept of extracting patterns from rows with non-zero values and replicating them. However, it made a simplifying assumption that all non-zero colored pixels in a row should be expanded to fill the *entire* row with the *first* non-zero color encountered. The error analysis clearly shows this isn't universally true. Some examples involve replicating *partial* row patterns or applying different logic based on color and position.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Row Analysis:** Instead of simply finding rows with non-zero values, we need to analyze the *specific pattern* of non-zero values within each row. This includes considering the color and position of each pixel.\n2.  **Conditional Replication:** The replication logic needs to be more flexible. It shouldn't always expand to the full row. We may need to replicate only segments of a row, or even individual pixels.\n3.  **Pattern Identification:** The \"copy pattern\" step is too simplistic. We need a more robust way to identify the repeating unit. It may not always be the entire set of processed rows. Consider smaller repeating units.\n4. **Objectness**: Consider if the row/column is a single object or if the colored segments are to be considered as separate objects.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-wise):**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` where needed to extract precise details, but I'll start with a manual assessment.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n*   **Expected Output:** `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]`\n*   **Actual Output:** `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]`\n*   **Observation:** The initial code worked *correctly* here. The single blue pixel in the middle row gets expanded to fill the entire grid.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n*   **Expected Output:** `[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]`\n*   **Actual Output:** `[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]`\n*   **Observation:** Also correct. The contiguous block of red pixels is expanded.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3]]`\n*   **Expected Output:** `[[3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3]]`\n*   **Actual Output:** `[[3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3]]`\n* **Observation:** This example succeeds.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n* **Input:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n* **Expected Output:**\n```\n[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n```\n* **Actual Output:**\n```\n[[8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],\n [8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0]]\n```\n*   **Observation:** Correct. The repeating pattern of a single azure pixel is identified.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: non-zero_pixels\n    properties:\n      - color: varies (blue, red, green, azure)\n      - position: varies\n      - arrangement: can be single, contiguous blocks, or sparse\n    actions:\n      - expand: |\n          Expand the color of the non-zero pixel(s) to fill the entire output grid. The expansion might be triggered by a single pixel or a group. The arrangement within the row (single, contiguous block, or sparse) does not seem to alter the rule. The rule is consistently applied across all examples: find non-zero pixels and propagate their color across the entire grid.\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: same for input and output\n    actions:\n      - fill: |\n        The entire grid is filled with the color(s) derived from the non-zero pixels in the input.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color value.\n2.  **Propagate Color:** For each non-zero pixel (or group of adjacent non-zero pixels of the same color), take the color value.\n3. **Fill Output:** Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid and fill every cell of the output grid with the color from step 2. If there are multiple non-zero colors, they do not interact/mix - the last processed non-zero group determines the grid color.\n\nThe core change from the previous program is the simplification. Instead of trying to find patterns and replicate them, we simply take the identified non-zero color and completely overwrite the output grid. It's a full overwrite, not a row-by-row expansion/replication.\n"
