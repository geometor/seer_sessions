Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

The tasks involve 2D grids of varying dimensions. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The transformation seems to involve replicating and/or alternating colors based on the initial positions of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. The zero-value, representing white appears to be a background.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids.
    properties:
      - cells: Contain single-digit integers (0-9).
      - values: Represent colors (0 = white, 1 = blue, 2 = red, 3 = green, 4 = yellow, 8 = azure).
  - type: transformation
    description: Non-zero pixels in the input trigger replication patterns in the output.
    patterns:
      - example_1:
        input_colors: [2, 8]  # Red, Azure
        output_pattern:  Columns with the input colors alternate, and colors are extended to the full height.
      - example_2:
        input_colors: [1, 3]  # Blue, Green
        output_pattern: Columns with the input colors alternate and colors are extended to the full height of the grid.
      - example_3:
        input_colors: [2,3]
        output_pattern: Each color creates a full row of that color, and the pattern of input color rows are extended to the height of the grid, replicating
      - example_4:
        input_colors: [4,1]
        output_pattern: Each color creates a full row of that color, and the pattern of input color rows are extended to the height of the grid, replicating
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid and note the colors (non-zero values) and their initial positions.

2.  **Determine Replication Pattern**:

    *   If the non-zero pixels are in a single row and span different columns, the transformation extends those color values vertically down the grid. The colors alternate based on the columns of the non-zero input.
    *    If the non-zero pixels are in a different row, the output expands by replicating that color across the entire row, and repeating the pattern to the entire height of the grid.

3. **Construct Output:** Create an output grid of a determined or pre-set size (larger than the input grid in examples 1 and 2, but output grid height is determined by input in examples 3 and 4)
4. Fill the output grid.

    *   If the output extends the color columns, do so in the alternating order.
    *   If the output extends rows, repeat the rows vertically, with each non-zero color filling a full horizontal line.

In summary the pattern is based on whether or not the colors detected are on the same row or not. If the detected non-zero input colors are on the same row, the transformation extends colors down each column. If the colors are on separate rows, the colors are replicated horizontally.
