Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears mostly empty (white, color 0) with a few isolated colored pixels (blue (1) and green (3)). The output grid has a more complex pattern, seemingly repeating sequences of the blue and green pixels. The output grid's height matches the input, but the width seems to be a multiple of a smaller pattern.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: 7
      width_input: 23
      width_output: 23
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        blue: 1
        green: 3
        white: 0
  - type: pattern
    properties:
      base_unit: [1, 0, 0, 3]
      repetitions: unknown

actions:
    - name: repeat
      description: repeat a unit of colors to construct output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the positions of the non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. In this example, these are blue (1) at (0,5), and green (3) at (6,8).

2.  **Establish Base Pattern**: Observe that there seem to be repetitions of 1,0,0,3 patterns.

3. **Construct Output Rows:** For each row in the input grid, create a corresponding row in the output grid.
    The row should be constructed by arranging and repeating the base unit '1 0 0 3' pattern across the entire width of the output grid.

In essence, the transformation replicates a sequence containing single instances of all non-zero colors present on the input, separated by two zeros. This sequence is then tiled horizontally across each row of the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
