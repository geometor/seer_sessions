The input grid appears mostly empty (white, color 0) with a few isolated colored pixels (blue (1) and green (3)). The output grid has a more complex pattern, seemingly repeating sequences of the blue and green pixels. The output grid's height matches the input, but the width seems to be a multiple of a smaller pattern.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this example, these are blue (1) at (0,5), and green (3) at (6,8).\n\n2.  **Establish Base Pattern**: Observe that there seem to be repetitions of 1,0,0,3 patterns.\n\n3. **Construct Output Rows:** For each row in the input grid, create a corresponding row in the output grid.\n    The row should be constructed by arranging and repeating the base unit '1 0 0 3' pattern across the entire width of the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replicates a sequence containing single instances of all non-zero colors present on the input, separated by two zeros. This sequence is then tiled horizontally across each row of the output grid.\n"
