Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and the task examples to refine the natural language program and identify the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, which led to a partially correct transformation. The subsequent tests against all training examples reveal discrepancies. The strategy for resolving the errors is to:

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine the `discrepancies` in the results to understand where the `transform` function deviates from the expected output.
2.  **Identify Missed Patterns:** Based on the discrepancies, re-evaluate the input-output pairs of *all* training examples to find consistent patterns and rules that were not captured in the initial code. There are likely rules related to existing colors.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program with a more precise description of the transformation, accounting for the missed patterns.
4.  **Iteratively Improve Code:** Modify code based on the updated and re-test to improve accuracy, repeating until all examples are perfect, then test on the test set.

**Metrics and Results:**
Here is a summary of the result from running the code.

```
[
    {
        "rows": 9,
        "cols": 10,
        "accuracy": 100.0,
        "discrepancies": ([], []),
        "input_colors": [0, 1],
        "output_colors": [1, 2, 3],
    },
    {
        "rows": 7,
        "cols": 15,
        "accuracy": 100.0,
        "discrepancies": ([], []),
        "input_colors": [0],
        "output_colors": [2, 3],
    },
    {
        "rows": 7,
        "cols": 13,
        "accuracy": 89.01098901098901,
        "discrepancies": (
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
            [0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12]
        ),
        "input_colors": [0, 5],
        "output_colors": [2, 3, 5],
    },
]
```

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grids consistently contain colors 2 (red) and 3 (green), and
      sometimes other colors present in the input.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - contains: pixels of various colors (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - contains: pixels of color 2 (red) and 3 (green) filling areas that are
        white (0) in the input grid.
      - maintains: other colors that existed in the input_grid
  - action: fill_area
    description: |
        Specific areas of white (0) pixels in the input grid are replaced with
        color 2 and 3 in the output grid.  The shape is consistent. The
        existing colored pixels appear to serve as "walls".
  - rule: color_preservation
    description: Colors other than 0 in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Existing Colors:** Copy all pixels from the input grid to the output grid, except for pixels with color 0 (white).
2.  **Fill with Pattern:** For all the white (0) pixels, replace with a repeating horizontal pattern of six 2's followed by three 3's, starting from the top-left corner. The pattern continues across the entire grid, row by row, overwriting only white pixels. The other colors are unaffected.

This revised natural language program addresses a key insight: The transformation fills a consistent pattern of color 2 and color 3 and also preserves the existing non-zero colors in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
