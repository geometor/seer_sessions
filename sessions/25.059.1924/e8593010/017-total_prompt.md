```python
"""
Preserve Gray: Copy all gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.

Transform White: For each white (0) pixel in the input grid:
    If the white cell is at an even row and an even column, replace with red(2)
    If the white cell is at an odd row and an odd column, replace with green(3)
    If the white cell is at an odd row and an even column, OR an even row and an odd column, replace with blue(1)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
