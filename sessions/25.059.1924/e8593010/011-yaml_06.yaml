example_1:
  rows: 9
  cols: 10
  input_colors: [white, blue]
  output_colors: [blue, red, green]
  transformations:
    - white pixels in the top-left become red.
    - white pixels in the top-right become green.
    - white pixels in the bottom-left become blue.
    - one blue pixel in input remains blue in output at [8,9]
    - white pixels in the bottom three rows, between columns 3 and 7, become blue
    - white pixels above the bottom 3 rows, between columns 3 and 7 become red
    - white pixels in the last three columns, above the bottom 3 rows, become green

example_2:
  rows: 7
  cols: 15
  input_colors: [white]
  output_colors: [red, green]
  transformations:
    - white pixels in the first three columns become red
    - white pixels in the last three columns become green
    - white pixels between columns 3 and 12 inclusive become red.

example_3:
  rows: 7
  cols: 13
  input_colors: [white, gray]
  output_colors: [red, green, gray]
  transformations:
    - Gray pixels remain gray.
    - white pixels to the left of col 4 become red.
    - white pixels, where row < (rows -3) and col > (cols - 4), become green
    - white pixels between column 4 and (cols - 4) become red.
