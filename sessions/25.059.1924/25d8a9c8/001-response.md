Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The colors in the input grid are diverse (red, green, yellow, orange, magenta, maroon, blue), while the output grid consistently uses only two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The key seems to be a relationship between *rows* in the input and output. It appears rows are being mapped to either all white or all gray.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid_dimensions: 3x3
output_grid_dimensions: 3x3
input_colors: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 1]
output_colors: [0, 5]
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cells: pixels with color values
  - type: row
    properties:
       - index: [0, 1, 2] # Row indices
       - colors: set of colors in the row
actions:
  - type: map_row
    description: Maps an input row to an output row based on color content.
relationships:
  - type: row_to_row
    description: Each input row corresponds to an output row.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if all pixels in the current row have the *same* color.
3.  **If** all pixels in the row are the same color, map the corresponding output row to all gray (5).
4.  **Else** (if the row contains multiple colors), map the corresponding output row to all white (0).

Essentially the rule checks if each row consists of single colour or of multiple colours. If row has one single colour then corresponding output row is gray. If it has multiple colours, corresponding row is white.
