            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code does a decent job of identifying rectangles and attempting to bridge them. However, the provided test results reveal several shortcomings:\n\n1.  **Multiple Bridges:** The current logic only creates a single bridge between the first two rectangles (sorted by starting column). It needs to handle cases with more than two rectangles, potentially creating multiple bridges.\n2.  **Bridge Placement:** The bridge placement logic is too simplistic. It assumes a direct, centered bridge is always possible and uses a fixed 3x3 size. The examples show bridges can be of variable size and may need to be placed asymmetrically to avoid overlapping existing objects or going out of bounds.\n3.  **Incorrect shape built:** Test case 3 shows that a single row bridge should be build, not a 3x3 square.\n4.  **Incorrect color in bridge:** Test case 4 has an existing azure bridge, and the algorithm draws another one.\n\nTo address these issues, the strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Iterate through all rectangle pairs:** Modify the code to find and bridge *all* adjacent pairs of rectangles, not just the first two.\n2.  **Adaptive Bridge Sizing:** Develop a more sophisticated algorithm for bridge placement. It should consider:\n    *   The space available between rectangles.\n    *   Avoiding overlap with existing non-background pixels.\n    *   Staying within grid boundaries.\n    *    Bridge is a single row.\n3.  **Bridge color:** Only draw if no bridge exists\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**\n\nI need to understand the specifics of each failure. I don't yet have code execution ability. Assuming I did, I would:\n\n1.  **Print `find_rectangles` output:** For each example, I'd print the `rectangles` list returned by `find_rectangles`. This would show exactly which rectangles were detected, their colors, and their coordinates.\n2.  **Print Intermediate `output_grid`:** Before returning the `output_grid`, I'd print its state. This would show the grid *after* the initial rectangle detection and *before* any bridging attempts.\n3.  **Print Bridging Details:** Inside the bridging logic, I'd print the calculated `bridge_start_row`, `bridge_start_col`, `height`, and `width` for each bridge attempt.\n4. **Compare input and output,** identify exact coordinates that differ to make observations and understand.\n\nSince I can't execute code yet, I'll make educated guesses based on the visual output, and assume the needed information will be available during the Coder phase:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Correct.\n*   **Example 2:** Correct.\n*   **Example 3:** Incorrect. Builds 3x3 block, should be 1 x width.\n*   **Example 4:** Incorrect. Builds another bridge on top of existing bridge.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Connect colored rectangles with azure bridges.\"\n  - objects:\n    - type: rectangle\n      properties:\n        - color: variable (non-white)\n        - start_row: integer\n        - start_col: integer\n        - end_row: integer\n        - end_col: integer\n    - type: bridge\n      properties:\n        - color: azure (8)\n        - start_row: integer\n        - start_col: integer\n        - height: integer\n        - width: integer\n  - actions:\n    - name: find_rectangles\n      description: \"Identifies all distinct, non-white rectangles in the input grid.\"\n    - name: create_bridge\n      description: \"Creates an azure bridge between adjacent rectangles, avoiding overlap and staying within bounds.  Bridge should be a single row.\"\n      preconditions:\n        - \"Two or more rectangles exist.\"\n        - \"No existing bridge exists.\"\n      postconditions:\n        - \"A new azure rectangle (a 'bridge') connects two previously unconnected rectangles.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Rectangles:** Identify all distinct, non-white rectangular regions in the input grid. Record the color, top-left corner coordinates, bottom-right corner coordinates, height, and width of each rectangle.\n2.  **Sort Rectangles:** Sort the found rectangles based on their starting column (`start_col`). This establishes a left-to-right processing order.\n3.  **Iterate and Bridge:** For each adjacent pair of rectangles in the sorted list:\n    * Check existing bridge of color azure (8). If bridge exists, skip.\n    *   **Calculate Bridge Position:** Determine the row and column indices for the starting point of the bridge. The bridge connects at the closest point from left to right rectangle. Calculate height and width of the bridge. The bridge must be contained with the grid boundaries, must not overlap existing colors and should be a single row connecting.\n    *   **Create Bridge:** Fill the cells of the output grid corresponding to the bridge with the color azure (8), changing the output grid accordingly.\n\nThis revised natural language program addresses the observed shortcomings by handling multiple rectangles, introducing the concept of adaptive bridge sizing (although the specifics need further refinement in the coding phase), and providing a more precise description of the bridging process, including the need for a single-row.\n"
