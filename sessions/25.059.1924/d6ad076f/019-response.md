Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the need to insert an azure region within a white region. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal some crucial limitations:

1.  **Incorrect White Space Identification**: The original code identifies contiguous white rows based on a simple `find_region` function applied to the value 0. This fails when the white region isn't a perfect rectangle. The updated code uses `np.all(input_grid[r,:] == 0)` which will handle identifying all of the white rows, even when they are not rectangular, but this can be sensitive to changes in later examples, if the white area isn't contiguous across rows.
2.  **Inconsistent Azure Region Placement**: The assumption that the azure region always has a width of 4 and is centered within the *entire* white region is incorrect. The width, and the placement appear to be calculated based on the other color regions, specifically with regards to the right-most edge of the colored area of each row.
3.  **Ignoring Other Colors**: The provided program only looks for white, green and maroon. If other colors are present they will be ignored and could disrupt the algorithm, for example, finding a non-rectangular white space.

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Refine White Space Detection:** Instead of just looking for rectangular areas of white, examine each row individually to determine how many contiguous white cells there are.
2.  **Dynamic Azure Region Sizing:** Calculate the width and position of the azure region based on the geometry of each input row, specifically by measuring the width of the white are, the position of the other colored blocks, and the right most edge of the array.
3. **Handle Non-Contiguous White Regions** If there is no white space on a row, the algorithm should skip that row and move on.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformations, let's collect some metrics about each example:

*   **Input Shape:** Dimensions of the input grid.
*   **White Region:** Dimensions and coordinates of white regions on a row by row basis.
*   **Other Color Regions:** Identify other colors present and their regions.
*   **Azure Region:** Dimensions and coordinates of the azure region in the output.
* **Success/Failure**: Indicate whether the current code correctly transforms the input to the output, and show difference.

Here's the information for each of the train set examples:
