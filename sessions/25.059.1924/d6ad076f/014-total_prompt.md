Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples. The initial code was designed to identify rectangles and connect them with an azure (color 8) line. We need to evaluate how well it performs on all examples and adjust the natural language program and, subsequently, the code, to account for discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code seems to correctly identify rectangles and, in some cases, connect them. However, the provided results show inconsistencies, particularly when existing azure lines or multiple object types are present. We need to refine how bridges are placed and, crucially, under what conditions they are created. The core strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the presence of existing azure lines, the colors and positions of rectangles, and the overall transformation logic.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_rectangles` function correctly identifies all relevant objects (not just colored rectangles, it appears).
3.  **Conditional Bridge Creation:** Determine the precise rules governing when a bridge is created and its characteristics (position, length, color).
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code iteratively, testing against all training examples after each change.
5. **Existing bridge check:** modify to only check specific rows/columns

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

Let's analyze the examples. Note, I will skip the visualization, but in an interactive environment I would be examining the grids.

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output, error, example_index):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    predicted_output = np.array(predicted_output)

    print(f"Example {example_index + 1}:")
    print(f"  Error: {error}")

    # Find differences between the expected and predicted outputs.
    diff = np.where(output_grid != predicted_output)
    num_diffs = diff[0].size
    print(f"  Differences between expected and predicted: {num_diffs} pixels")
    if(num_diffs > 0):
        print(f"     first diff at {diff[0][0]},{diff[1][0]} output {output_grid[diff[0][0],diff[1][0]]} predicted {predicted_output[diff[0][0],diff[1][0]]}")

    rectangles = find_rectangles(input_grid)
    print(f"  Rectangles found in input: {len(rectangles)}")
    for i, rect in enumerate(rectangles):
        print(f"    Rectangle {i + 1}:")
        print(f"      Color: {rect['color']}")
        print(f"      Start: ({rect['start_row']}, {rect['start_col']})")
        print(f"      End: ({rect['end_row']}, {rect['end_col']})")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct contiguous regions (rectangles) of the same non-zero color in the input grid.
2.  **Sort Objects:** Sort the identified objects by their starting column (leftmost pixel).
3.  **Connect Objects (Conditional):** If there are at least two objects, connect them with a horizontal azure (color 8) line.
    *   **Placement:** position the line directly between the objects.
    *   **Row:** The azure line is placed on the *same row* as the top of the *first* object's bounding box
    *   **Extents:** the connecting azure line should extend from the end of the first object to the beginning of the second object.
    *   **Overlap Prevention:** The azure line should only overwrite cells with a value of 0. Do not overwrite existing objects or other azure lines.

This revised program addresses the observed behaviors, including the placement of the connecting line based on the row of the first object, and ensures that only 0-value cells are overwritten, preventing unintended modification of existing objects. It also generalizes to handle more than two objects, connecting them sequentially.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
