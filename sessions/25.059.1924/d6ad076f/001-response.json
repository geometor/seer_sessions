The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9).  The background is consistently color 0 (white). There are distinct rectangular blocks of non-zero colors.  The key observation is the insertion of an azure (color 8) block between existing colored blocks. The shape and size of this inserted block seems related to surrounding objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The azure insertion happens only for one \"gap\".\n\n5. **Output:** The output is a new grid that maintains size of the original, and includes the color 8 insertions.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule detects existing colored blocks (non-white), and inserts an azure block of determined dimension, effectively separating groups of colored blocks, if they exist in same row or column.\n"
