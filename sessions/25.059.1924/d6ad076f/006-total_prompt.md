Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a limited understanding from the first training example. It seems to make strong assumptions about the placement and role of red (2) and orange (7) blocks, specifically about inserting an azure (8) block vertically between them. When applied to the other training examples, these assumptions fail.
The examples show the insertion is horizontal, not vertical.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to:

1.  **Re-evaluate the relationship**: The relationship between the red, orange, and azure blocks needs to be redefined. It's not a simple vertical insertion. Look for horizontal relationships, relative positions, and sizes.
2.  **Generalize Block Selection:** The initial code fixated on the *first* red and orange blocks. The logic should be able to consider *any* red and orange blocks, perhaps searching for a specific spatial relationship between them.
3. **Consider alternative layouts:** the solution may require looking at negative space, in this case white (0), to place a new object.

**Metrics and Observations (from code execution and manual inspection):**

Here's a summary of analyzing each example. Since I don't have code execution capabilities in this environment, I'll rely on manual observation, describing what *would* be measured and observed.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Red block (2x2), Orange block (2x2), separated by 2 columns of white.
    *   Expected Output: Azure block (2x2) inserted between red and orange, filling white columns.
    *   Actual Output: Azure placed incorrectly vertically.
    *   Observation: Horizontal insertion between blocks. Width of inserted block = combined width.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Red block (1x3), Orange block (2x3), separated by 3 columns of white.
    *   Expected Output: Azure block (3x3) inserted between.
    *   Actual Output: Azure placed incorrectly vertically.
    *   Observation: Horizontal insertion. Combined width is 1+2 = 3.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Red block (1x1), Orange block (3x1), separated by 4 columns of white.
    *   Expected output: Azure block (4x1) inserted.
    *   Actual Output: Azure placed incorrectly vertically.
    *   Observation: Horizontal Insertion, Combined width.

        shape: 4x1
        position: between red and orange, horizontally
        relation: fill the horizontal space
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find one red (2) block and one orange (7) block.
2.  **Determine Orientation:** Consider a *horizontal* arrangement where the red and orange blocks are conceptually side-by-side (though not necessarily adjacent).
3. **Measure intervening columns:** note number of white columns between the blocks, and the height.
4.  **Create Azure Block:** Insert an azure (8) block into the space between the red and orange blocks.
5.  **Size Azure Block:** The inserted azure block's width is based on number of white columns. The azure block matches the height of the space available.

This updated natural language program shifts the focus from a vertical insertion between blocks to a horizontal filling of space, which is much more consistent with all three training examples. It also eliminates the incorrect assumption about using only the "first" found blocks, allowing for more general applicability.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
