Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored blocks. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9).  The background is consistently color 0 (white). There are distinct rectangular blocks of non-zero colors.  The key observation is the insertion of an azure (color 8) block between existing colored blocks. The shape and size of this inserted block seems related to surrounding objects.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: [red, orange, yellow, green, magenta, maroon, azure]
      shape: rectangle
      size: variable
      position: variable
  - type: background
    properties:
      color: white

actions:
  - name: insert
    object: block
    properties:
      color: azure
      size: determined_by_surrounding_blocks
      position: between_existing_blocks

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Colored blocks are adjacent to the background and sometimes to other colored blocks.
  - type: spatial
    description:  An azure block is inserted, creating a spatial separation between pre-existing colored blocks. The size/shape of the insertion appears related to existing nearby blocks.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Locate all rectangular blocks of color other than 0 (white) in the input grid.

2.  **Determine Insertion Points and Shape/Size:**
    *   Examine the horizontal and vertical space between identified non-white colored blocks.
    *    If other color blocks exists on a row or a column, between color blocks, insert color 8, maintaining the width of existing colors for that row, and using the height of color blocks for the column.

3. **Create Azure Block:** Create a new rectangular block of color 8 (azure).

4.  **Insert Azure Block:** Place the newly created azure block in the determined location. The azure insertion happens only for one "gap".

5. **Output:** The output is a new grid that maintains size of the original, and includes the color 8 insertions.

In essence, the transformation rule detects existing colored blocks (non-white), and inserts an azure block of determined dimension, effectively separating groups of colored blocks, if they exist in same row or column.
