Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made a significant assumption: that the red and orange blocks would always be horizontally aligned and that the azure block should fill the entire vertical space between the top and bottom of the grid. The additional training examples reveal that this assumption is incorrect. The azure block's height and vertical position needs to be constrained by the heights of the red and orange blocks, not the entire grid. The width of the inserted azure block will be determined by the gap.

The strategy to resolve the errors is as follows:

1.  **Refine Height and Vertical Position**: Instead of using the entire grid's height, determine the shared vertical extent of the red and orange blocks. The azure block should only occupy rows that are within this shared extent. This involves finding the maximum of the minimum row indices and the minimum of the maximum row indices of the red and orange blocks.
2.  **Maintain Horizontal Logic**: The code for determining the horizontal extent (start and end columns) of the azure block is correct. It calculates the gap between red and orange.
3.  **Handle Multiple Blocks**: The core logic assumes one block, extend to handle multiple blocks.

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis)**

To understand the results better I am going to re-express the provided input and output as numpy arrays.

**Example 0:**

*   Input:
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```

**YAML Facts**

  - color: red (2)
    type: block
    role: anchor_left
  - color: orange (7)
    type: block
    role: anchor_right

    description: Calculate the start and end columns for the azure block based on the positions of the red and orange blocks.

    description:  Find the shared vertical extent (rows) of the red and orange blocks.
  - name: insert_block
    description:  Place the azure block in the determined region.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blocks:** Find all contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels and orange (7) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Select Blocks**: If multiple blocks, take the first red and first orange.
3.  **Horizontal Bounds:** Determine the horizontal boundaries for the azure (8) block. The starting column is one position to the right of the rightmost edge of the red block. The ending column is one position to the left of the leftmost edge of the orange block.
4.  **Vertical Bounds:** Determine the vertical boundaries for the azure block. Find the maximum of the top row indices of the red and orange blocks, and use as top. Find the minimum of the bottom row indices of the red and orange blocks, and use as bottom.
5.  **Insert Azure Block:** Within the calculated horizontal and vertical bounds, replace the existing pixel values with azure (8) to create the new block.
6.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
