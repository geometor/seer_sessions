The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The input seems to have a large central block of red (2) surrounded by a border of azure (8), which is itself bordered by white (0). The output maintains the outer white border and the azure border. The inner red block is modified. The modifications inside the central area alternate by column.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
