There's a clear geometric and topological aspect, with shapes (rectangles) and their interior/exterior relationships being important. The transformation seems to involve inverting, adding and potentially rotating certain colored regions within the grid. Color changes and additions of background elements are also significant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
