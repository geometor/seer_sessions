Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Preserve the Blue Region:** The blue (1) pixels in the input grid mostly remain unchanged in the output grid.

2.  **Inner Yellow Modification:** The yellow (4) pixels inside of the continuous block defined by the blue pixels is changed, but only some of them. Yellow pixels are changed at coordinates with x value that is odd, to its horizontal neighbors value.

3.  **Outer Yellow border:** An outer yellow border is created, mirroring a single yellow pixel to each side of the blue shape, and replicating it on the top and bottom, vertically.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
