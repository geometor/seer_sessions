Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (19x13). The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The input seems to have a large central block of red (2) surrounded by a border of azure (8), which is itself bordered by white (0). The output maintains the outer white border and the azure border. The inner red block is modified. The modifications inside the central area alternate by column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: outer_border
    color: white (0)
    type: border
    description: Surrounds the entire grid.

  - id: azure_border
    color: azure (8)
    type: border
    description: Surrounds the inner red block.

  - id: red_block
    color: red (2)
    type: block
    description: The central block, which undergoes transformation.

  - id: red_block_modified
    color: red(2)
    type: block_mod
    description: new red squares alternating by column with the azure

transformations:
  - name: alternating_columns
    description: Within the original red block, red pixels are maintained or added, based on a column.
    details: >
      Odd-numbered columns inside the red block retain the red pixels, and azure pixels are added. Even-numbered columns keep red and azure as they where originally.
      An additional row with the pattern is added on top and at the bottom.

relationships:
  - type: surrounds
    from: outer_border
    to: azure_border

  - type: surrounds
    from: azure_border
    to: red_block
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Boundaries:** Locate the outer white (0) border and the inner azure (8) border. The area enclosed by the azure border is the region of interest (the original "red block").

2.  **Column-Based Transformation:** Within the red block, process each column individually.
    *   **Odd Columns:** Maintain the original red (2), and azure(8) pixels.
    *   **Even Columns:** Maintain the original red (2), and azure(8) pixels.

3.  **Add Top and Bottom Row**: Add the generated pattern from the red block transformation to the row just above and just below the original azure border.

4. **Add Red Pixels on borders**: Add additional red pixels on the four corners of the azure border.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
