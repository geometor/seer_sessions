The gray objects appear to be replaced by either blue or red objects, maintaining the original shape and position. The background remains white (0). The core challenge is to determine the rule that dictates whether a gray object becomes blue or red. It appears to follow some kind of alternating pattern, which is not strictly checkerboard by row/column but based on connectivity of shapes.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

Diagonal is not considered to be adjacent.\n3. **Color the graph**:\n   * start at an arbitary gray object and color it blue.\n   * traverse the connectivty graph assigning all direct adjancent shapes red.\n   * continue traversing the graph to all shapes adjancent to the red shapes and assign them to blue, etc. until all shapes in the graph have been assigned a color.\n4.  **Replace with Colored Shapes:** In the output grid, replace each gray shape with a shape of the same dimensions and position, but with the assigned color (blue/1 or red/2).\n5.  **Retain Background:** Keep all white (0) pixels in the input grid as white (0) pixels in the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replaces gray shapes with either blue or red shapes, maintaining their original form and location. The choice between blue and red depends on the connectivity of the original gray shapes. This can be efficiently determined by a graph traversal coloring.\n"
