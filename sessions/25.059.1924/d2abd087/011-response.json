The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input, replacing gray (5) with either blue (1) or red (2), while keeping white (0) unchanged. The decision of whether a gray pixel becomes blue or red seems to depend on its position and neighbors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n3. **Alternating Color Change:** The shapes are recolored alternately. For example, the object at top right is changed to blue, and the object in the middle-top-right is recolored to red. The next object, lower center is recolored to blue, and finally, the lower object is recolored to red.\n\nEssentially, the transformation replaces gray pixels with either blue or red based on the connected group.\n"
