The transformation changes the gray pixels to red (value 2) and some of the white pixels adjacent to gray pixels to blue (value 1). The final grid has the same dimensions as the original. There appears to be some concept of object identification and adjacency in play.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

It is critical that only the orginal position matters.\n4.  **Recolor Adjacent Whites to Blue:** Change the color of these adjacent white pixels to blue (1).\n5. All other white pixels are unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the program recolors gray objects to red and creates a one-pixel blue border around them using only directly adjacent pixels.\n"
