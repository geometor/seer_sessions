observations:
  - task: "Identify and transform 2x2 squares based on color diversity."
  - input_type: "2D grid of integers (colors)"
  - output_type: "2D grid of integers (colors)"
  - rule_1:
    condition: "A 2x2 square contains four distinct colors."
    action: "Replace the entire 2x2 square with green (color value 3)."
  - rule_2:
      condition: "A 2x2 square does not contains four distinct colors."
      action: "Retain original colors"
  - overall_transformation: "The output grid is the result of selective green replacement of complete 2x2 squares in input based on the distinct color condition"
