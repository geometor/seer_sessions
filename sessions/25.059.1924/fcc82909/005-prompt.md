"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all distinct colored regions in the input grid. Note their colors and positions.
2.  **Conditional Expansion:** For every pixel that compose the lower edge of a *maroon* or a *magenta* object: add a new object below of the green color that fills the width of the original object, and has height=3. For every pixel that compose the upper edge of an *orange* object: add a new object above with color green, and height=3, and the same width as the initial object.
3. **Other Objects:** Any other objects in the input remain in the same place and retain color and shape.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
