The input grids are transformed into output grids.  The transformation appears to involve both a change in color and potentially the addition of new colored regions. The key seems to be identifying clusters of non-zero pixels and applying a consistent color change, possibly alongside growing a new region with color 3.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
