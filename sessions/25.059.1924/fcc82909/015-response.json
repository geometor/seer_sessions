There are distinct colored regions (objects) in the input. The output seems to be a modified version of the input, with some areas filled with a new color (green - 3) while preserving others. The transformation appears to involve a flood-fill operation, replacing certain areas with green based on the original layout of colored objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
