Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. There are distinct colored regions (objects) in the input. The output seems to be a modified version of the input, with some areas filled with a new color (green - 3) while preserving others. The transformation appears to involve a flood-fill operation, replacing certain areas with green based on the original layout of colored objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains multiple colored 2x2 squares, with colors including red (2), yellow(4), magenta(6), orange(7), maroon(9), and azure(8).
  - object_identification: |
      The 2x2 colored squares can be identified as discrete objects.
  - transformation_property_change:  |
      Some of the white space (0) is replaced with the color green(3), a solid 2x2 block, around and between the colored areas.
  - transformation_preservation: |
      The original 2x2 objects are not directly modified but are incorporated as boundaries, with green taking the place of white around them.
  - spatial_relationship: |
       the green areas connect original objects in the input.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output retains relative location of the colored objects to each other.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all 2x2 colored squares in the input grid.
2.  **Connect Objects:** Select the value of '0', corresponding to the white background
3.  **Flood Fill:** Select an unused color, in this case '3' corresponding to Green.
4. **Result** Replace any connecting 0 values with '3' until the 2x2 colored squares block any further expansion.

Essentially, the transformation "grows" green areas from an unused value, and the original colored objects remain the same.
