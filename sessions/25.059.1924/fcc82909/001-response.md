Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors.  The input grids are transformed into output grids.  The transformation appears to involve both a change in color and potentially the addition of new colored regions. The key seems to be identifying clusters of non-zero pixels and applying a consistent color change, possibly alongside growing a new region with color 3.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
  - type: color_coding
    description: Integers 0-9 represent different colors. 0 is consistently background (white).
  - type: object
    description: Non-zero pixels form contiguous objects/clusters.
  - type: transformation_type
    description: Color replacement and addition of a fixed new color.
  - type: color_addition
    property: green (3)
    description: The new cluster is extended downward.
  - type: action:
    description: The transformation rule seems to expand and fill a fixed size rectangular with green color (3).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Color Replacement Area:** Locate all 2x2 clusters.
3.  **Green Expansion:** Create the target area. Add green (value 3) pixels:
    *   Below each original 2x2 cluster of non-zero pixels, fill up empty space.
    *   Below each original non-zero pixels that don't contain in 2x2 cluster, fill with two rows of green pixels.
    *   If any 2x2 cluster adjacent at row, fill with one row of green color, and put this row in between these objects.
