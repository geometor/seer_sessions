Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Examine the input grid to locate all 2x2 squares.
2.  **Check for Distinct Colors:** For each identified 2x2 square, determine the number of distinct colors present.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a 2x2 square contains exactly four distinct colors, replace the entire 2x2 square in the output grid with green (color value 3).
4.  **Preserve Otherwise:** If a 2x2 square does not have four distinct colors, or if a location is not part of such, the output is a copy of the input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
