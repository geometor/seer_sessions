Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary elements are colored squares (objects) of different sizes and colors within the grids. There seem to be two distinct groups of colored squares in the input that merge to form a larger rectangle using green (3).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: square
    properties:
      colors: [4, 8, 9, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2]
      sizes: [1x1] #initial state
      positions: [[2,2], [2,3], [3,2], [3,3], [6,6], [6,7], [7,6], [7,7]]

  - type: rectangle
    properties:
        color: [3]
        sizes: [2x2, 2x2, 2x2] # resulting state
        positions: [[3,2], [6,6], [7,7]]

actions:
  - type: combine
    description: "Two groups of 2x2 colored squares become filled with green"
    result: "Two 2x2 area filled with green color"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The colored squares are initially separated. Two green filled 2x2 rectangles appeared. one is in place of the originally upper left 4 colored squares, and two are in place of the bottom right 4 colored squares"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all colored squares (1x1 squares) in the input grid.
2.  **Group Objects by Proximity**: Notice how some squares of various colors form separated two by two square clusters.
3.  **Fill Grouped Squares with Green:** The program identifies where the original 2x2 squares were. If a 2 by 2 square of four distinct colored squares is identified, replace each identified square with a 2x2 area filled in with color green (value 3).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
