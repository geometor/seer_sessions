            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying 2x2 squares with four distinct colors and replacing them with green. The results on the other training examples show that this rule is partially correct but needs refinement. The core concept of identifying 2x2 squares is relevant, but the condition for replacement and the replacement color itself need adjustment. The strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Verify Observations**: Examine all training input/output pairs to identify consistent transformation rules.\n2.  **Analyze Mismatches**: For any discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output, identify why and update the observations and natural language program.\n3.  **Refine the Rule**: Adapt the rules for the different types of 2x2 squares that appear in the input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get a complete view of the transformation, it's important to inspect all available input/output pairs of the training data and compare them with the result of executing the given code.\n\nHere's an analysis of each example pair, the expected output, and the result of the code execution:\n\n*Example Pair 1:*\n- **Input**:\n```\n[[0 1]\n [2 3]]\n```\n- **Expected Output**:\n```\n[[3 3]\n [3 3]]\n```\n- **Code Output**: Correct\n\n*Example Pair 2:*\n-   **Input**:\n```\n[[5 1 5]\n [1 5 1]\n [5 1 5]]\n```\n-   **Expected Output**:\n```\n[[5 1 5]\n [1 5 1]\n [5 1 5]]\n```\n- **Code Output**: Correct.\n\n*Example Pair 3:*\n\n-   **Input**:\n```\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 0 1]\n [8 2 3]]\n```\n-   **Expected Output**:\n```\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 3 3]\n [8 3 3]]\n```\n\n- **Code Output**:\n\n```\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 3 3]\n [8 3 3]]\n```\nCorrect\n\nBased on these results, the initial hypothesis is correct, and no code changes are necessary. The transform correctly processes the training input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: \"Identify and transform 2x2 squares based on color diversity.\"\n  - input_type: \"2D grid of integers (colors)\"\n  - output_type: \"2D grid of integers (colors)\"\n  - rule_1:\n    condition: \"A 2x2 square contains four distinct colors.\"\n    action: \"Replace the entire 2x2 square with green (color value 3).\"\n  - rule_2:\n      condition: \"A 2x2 square does not contains four distinct colors.\"\n      action: \"Retain original colors\"\n  - overall_transformation: \"The output grid is the result of selective green replacement of complete 2x2 squares in input based on the distinct color condition\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Examine the input grid to locate all possible 2x2 squares.\n2.  **Check for Distinct Colors:** For each identified 2x2 square, determine the number of distinct colors present within that square.\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   If a 2x2 square contains exactly four distinct colors, replace all pixels of the entire 2x2 square in the output grid with green (color value 3).\n    *   If not, the section of the output is a copy of input.\n\n"
