Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying 2x2 colored squares and filling the surrounding white (0) areas with green (3). While this worked for the first example, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The code's assumption that the fill should only happen around 2x2 squares of color is incorrect. It must be enhanced by the new information. The presence of non-square shapes and single-color images requires to adapt to a more general flood-fill based context, than the initial more restrictive 2x2 context.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate the Core Concept:** The core concept is not about identifying 2x2 squares, but the initial code is doing a good job with flood fill.

2.  **Simplify:** Remove the constraint of looking for 2x2, and perform flood-fill with '3' (green) on every '0' (white).

3. **Update program**

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**

To better understand what went wrong, I will check some assumptions in the example input and output grids.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid, name):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")
    print(f"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}")
    if rows<12 and cols<12:
      print(grid)

def analyze_task(task):
    for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        print(f"Example {i+1}:")
        describe_grid(input_grid, "Input")
        describe_grid(output_grid, "Output")

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:  "Four 2x2 colored squares (blue, red, yellow, azure) surrounded by white background"
      output_objects: "The same four 2x2 colored squares, with all background changed to green"
      action: "Change all white (0) to green (3)"
  - example_2:
      input_objects: "A gray (5) shape with internal white spaces"
      output_objects: "The same gray shape, with the internal spaces and background now filled with green (3)"
      action: "Change all white (0) to green (3)"
  - example_3:
      input_objects: "A solid block of blue"
      output_objects: "Same solid block of blue."
      action: "No Change"
  - example_4:
      input_objects: "Completely white background"
      output_objects: "Completely green background"
      action: "Change all white (0) to green (3)"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through all pixels of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is white (0), change it to green (3).
3.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.
