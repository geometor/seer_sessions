Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code identifies contiguous regions of the same color (excluding white) and stacks them vertically based on color value in descending order. This approach works for the first example but fails on subsequent examples because it doesn't consider the spatial arrangement or content of the colored regions. The main issue is that the code reduces regions down to a single pixel representation of that color, discarding information, where the expected output is a *vertical stack of the regions, not a single value*.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Maintain Region Shape:** Instead of just storing the color value, we need to store the entire shape and content of each colored region.
2.  **Vertical Stacking:** The output should stack these regions vertically, preserving their original form, not just single values.
3.  **Order by color:** Verify that the regions are ordered in descending order by color value.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the code's output and an assessment:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:**
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
        ```
    *   **Expected Output:**
        ```
        [[2],
         [2],
         [1]]
        ```
    *   **Code Output:** `[[2], [1]]`
    *   **Assessment:** The code produces `[[2], [1]]`. The shape is lost.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:**
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
         [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
         [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]
        ```
    *   **Expected Output:**

        ```
        [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
         [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
         [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]
        ```
    *   **Code Output:** `[[7], [1]]`
    *   **Assessment:** Incorrect. The code collapses the regions to their color values and stacks them. It should preserve the entire horizontal lines.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:**
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
         [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
         [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
         [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        ```
    *   **Expected Output:**

        ```
        [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
         [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
         [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
         [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        ```
    *   **Code Output:** `[[3], [2], [1]]`
    *   **Assessment:** Incorrect. Same issue as the previous example.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      shape: 2D array
      contiguous: true
actions:
  - name: stack_vertically
    parameters:
      order: descending by color value
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid, excluding the background color (0). A region is a set of connected pixels (up, down, left, right) that share the same color.
2.  **Preserve Shape:** Store each region's shape and pixel values. Do not reduce the regions.
3. **Sort Regions:** Sort the identified regions in descending order based on their color value.
4.  **Stack Vertically:** Create the output grid by stacking the preserved regions vertically. Place the region with the highest color value at the top, followed by the next highest, and so on. Maintain the original shape and size of each region within the stack.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
