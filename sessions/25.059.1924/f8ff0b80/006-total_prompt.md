Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 12x12 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The output is a 3x1 grid. The input grid contains three distinct colored regions (blue=1, orange=7, red=2) against a background of white (0). The output grid seems to represent single values for those color. It also seems the colors in the output grid are in different order compared to their order in the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 12x12
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: region
    color: blue (1)
    shape: irregular
    location: top-right
  - type: region
    color: orange (7)
    shape: irregular
    location: bottom-right
  - type: region
    color: red (2)
    shape: irregular
    location: bottom-left
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x1
    elements: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: identify_regions
    input: input_grid
    description: Find distinct colored regions.
  - type: extract_color
    input: region
    description: Get the color value of a region.
  - type: order
    input: colors
    description: arrange color values into new order
  - type: construct
    input: order colors
    description: create the output array

relationships:
   - input_grid contains regions
   - output_grid represents colors of regions in a certain order.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct Regions:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of non-zero pixels. Each region is defined by pixels of the same color that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).

2.  **Extract Representative Colors:** For each identified region, extract its color value. Since all pixels within a region have the same color, any pixel from the region can provide this value.

3. **Order Colors:** Arrange the color values as follows: Blue (1) first, Orange(7) second and Red(2) third.

4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x1 output grid where each cell corresponds to the extracted color values in that order.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
