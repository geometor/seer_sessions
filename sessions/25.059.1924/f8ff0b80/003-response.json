The input is a 12x12 grid, and the output is a column of three numbers. The colors in the input grid seem to be clustered into distinct shapes. The output numbers correspond to colors present in the input grid, specifically green (3), red (2), and azure (8). The order seems arbitrary.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
