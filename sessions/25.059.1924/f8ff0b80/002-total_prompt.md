**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves identifying distinct colored objects within a 2D grid (input) and outputting a 1D list of those colors in a specific order (output). The background is consistently color 0 (white).  The objects are contiguous regions of non-zero color. The order in the output seems significant, and likely related to some property of the objects in the input. It's not alphabetical, not by size, and not simply left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: input_grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - objects: Contiguous regions of non-zero color.

  - type: output_list
    description: 1D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - colors:  Correspond to colors of objects found in the input grid.
      - order: Determined by an identifiable, consistent rule (to be determined).

  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous groups of non white pixels
    properties:
      - color_value: integer that maps to object color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero (non-white) pixels. Each region represents a single object.

2. **Extract Object Colors:** For each identified object, record its color value.

3. **Sort by a consistent rule:** The critical observation is that each input grid contains *different colored* objects. There must be an order. Looking at the order in the examples, and keeping in mind the color map, I see that it is not by object size, or position, but the colors themselves may have an inherent order - the integer value.  If we consider the order to be from lowest integer value to highest, it does not work, but if we consider the order to be *highest to lowest*, it *does* match the example transformation data. The natural language program would thus be:

Sort the colors in descending order *of their integer representation*.

4.  **Output:** Create a 1D list containing the color of each object, ordered by the rule discovered in the previous step.

In summary, the transformation rule is to identify the distinct colored objects in the input grid, extract their colors, sort the color values in descending order, and output the sorted list.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
