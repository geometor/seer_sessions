The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. There's a replication or expansion of the input, and a new color (8, azure) is introduced in a seemingly structured pattern. The original color (5, gray) is maintained in the output, but its position is duplicated.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each element at an odd index is `8`.\n3.  **Replicate Original Cells:** The original cells from the input grid are replicated in the output grid.\n    *   Each original cell is copied into the output grid multiple times.\n    *   The original cell located at (r, c) in the input appears at positions (2r, 2c) and (2r, 2c + 4) in the output.\n4.  **Maintain Other cells:** Any empty cell `0` is maintained in the output at position (2r, 2c)\n.\n\nEssentially the output is structured as such:\n- original input copied to maintain relative positions\n- original input copied and x position + 4 added\n- odd rows are filled with an alternating pattern\n\nExample\n"
