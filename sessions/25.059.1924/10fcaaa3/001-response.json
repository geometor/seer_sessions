The input grids appear to be transformed into output grids of larger dimensions. The primary change seems to be a replication of non-zero colored pixels and insertion of lines/rows/columns of the color blue (8).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There's a consistent pattern related to added 8s\n      - input-output: Output dimensions are larger than input dimensions.\n```"

The position will appear at every other location.\n3. **Insert Blue Rows/Columns:**\n    -If a row is only zeros in the input, it gets duplicated in the output, and an all blue (8) line is inserted below the duplicated row.\n    - If a column is all zeros, it gets duplicated in the output, and a blue (8) column is inserted after it.\n    - if a pixel at `input[r,c]` exists and it is not `0`. Put this pixel at `output[2r, 2c]`.\n    - if a pixel does not exist at `input[r,c]` because the row index is out of bound, then add rows of zeros at the end and insert the all `8` rows after the just appended rows\n    - if a pixel does not exist at `input[r,c]` because the col index is out of bound, then add cols of zeros at the end and insert the all `8` cols after the just appended cols\n\nIn summary, the transformation replicates non-zero pixels and expands the grid by adding rows and columns of 8s (blue) between and around the replicated pixels. All zero rows and columns are duplicated with a blue line added.\n"
