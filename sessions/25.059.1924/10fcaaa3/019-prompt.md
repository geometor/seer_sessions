Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1. Double the grid size: The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both height and width (4x4 becomes 8x8).
2. Copy and Translate Red: The red pixel from the input grid is copied to the output grid at the multiplied coordinates of input (1,1) becoming output(1,1)
3. Horizontal Translation: Add 4 to the column. If result is within boundary, copy the red pixel.
4. Fill with Azure: Fill every other cell in output with azure (8). All odd columns in odd rows contain azure.
5. Retain Background: All white pixels(0) remains 0 at where they are without azure(8) or red(2).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
