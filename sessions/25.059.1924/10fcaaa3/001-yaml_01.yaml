facts:
  - objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable
          - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer value (0-9)
          - location: (row, column) within grid
  - actions:
      - replication: Non-zero pixels are replicated in the output grid.
      - insertion:  Pixels of color 8 (blue) are inserted, creating rows and columns.
  - relationships:
      - spatial:  The relative positions of the original non-zero pixels appear to be maintained, though expanded. There's a consistent pattern related to added 8s
      - input-output: Output dimensions are larger than input dimensions.
