The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be an expansion and modification of the input grid, with a repeating pattern and the introduction of azure (8).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded to create a larger output grid. The height and width of the output depends where the yellow pixels are in the input.\n2.  **Replication:** a 2x2 pattern is made: if the input grid pixel is 4 (yellow) it is the same in the 2x2 block, but if the input is 0 (white), the 2x2 is: 8, 0, 0, 8 (azure, white, white, azure) placed at the correct location in the output grid.\n3. **Alternating rows of the 2x2 blocks:**\n     The input grid is conceptually tiled with 2x2 blocks.\n    -   **Yellow (4) Preservation:** If a cell in the input grid is yellow (4), the corresponding cell in the output grid remains yellow (4). The relative layout/positioning of the yellow colored areas are maintained.\n    -   **White areas (0) Modification:** If a cell in the input grid is white (0) and in a even row (starting to count at zero), the corresponding cells in the output grid becomes an alternating pattern of azure (8) and white (0): 8, 0, 8 for this row. If a cell in the input grid is white (0) and is in a odd row, the output is a pattern of: 0, 8, 0.\n4. The final row seems to repeat a row with yellow (4).\n\n"
