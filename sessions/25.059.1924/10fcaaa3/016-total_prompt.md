Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Examine the input grid. Determine its dimensions (height, width).
    *   Identify the row index (`i`) of the yellow pixel (value 4). If no yellow pixel exists, skip the yellow-related steps.
    *   The output will have the a height of 6, and a width equal to the input width times 2.

2.  **Yellow Pixel Handling (if present):**
    *   A single yellow pixel at `input[i,j]` in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of yellow pixels in the output grid.
    *   The yellow 2x2 block will always appear at a specific row, determined by the original yellow pixel position in the input grid:
        *  If the yellow pixel is at row i of the input grid, the 2x2 yellow block's top-left corner is at row (2 + row), and the original column x 2.

3.  **White Pixel Handling:**
    *   Each white pixel (value 0) in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    *   The 2x2 block has the following pattern:
        ```
        8 0
        0 8
        ```
        where 8 represents azure and 0 represents white.
    *   The white pixels are expanded to the 2x2 blocks, and inserted into the correct locations, skipping rows when needed to accomodate the position of the yellow block.

4. **No Yellow Pixel:**
    * If there is no yellow pixel in the input grid, white pixels are expanded in place.

5.  **Output:** The resulting output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, with expanded dimensions and the 2x2 block substitutions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The results of running this on the other examples reveal some errors, indicating that the initial program doesn't capture the full transformation rule. The core issues seem to stem from an incorrect assumption about how the output grid size is handled, how the presence/position of the yellow pixel influences placement of blocks, and the row expansion for the white blocks. The strategy to resolve these issues will involve:

1.  **Re-examining Output Dimensions:** The output dimensions are not simply a fixed height of 6. We need to carefully observe how the output height relates to the input height *and* the presence/absence of the yellow pixel.

2.  **Refining Yellow Pixel Logic:**  The logic for placing the 2x2 yellow block seems correct in its expansion, but its vertical placement needs to be clarified with respect to white blocks around.

3.  **Correcting White Pixel Expansion:** The white pixel expansion logic works when there are not yellow pixels, or when the yellow pixels are not in the same row, and needs to handle skipping correctly when they are present.

4.  **Comprehensive Rule Integration:** Ensure the natural language program and resulting code handle all cases, including the presence or absence of the yellow pixel, different input sizes, and correct interaction between yellow and white pixel transformations.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the specifics, let's execute some code to derive properties about the examples provided.

    rule: >
        If a yellow pixel exists in the input grid, a yellow 2x2 block will be placed in the output.
        The yellow block's row in the output depends upon the presence of white pixels in the same row as the yellow pixel:
          - if there are no other white pixels in the same row:
              yellow_block_row = 0
          - regardless of the row position of the yellow pixel, the output will always have at least 2 rows
        The yellow block's top-left corner column is always 2 * input_column.
  - name: generate_output
    input: input_grid, white_blocks, yellow_block (optional)
    output: output_grid
    rule: >
      Create an output grid where:
        - Width is twice the input grid's width.
        - Height is determined by the input grid and presence of yellow.
        - White pixels are expanded into white_blocks.
        - If yellow exists, the yellow_block takes precedence, overwriting any overlapping part of expanded white blocks.
        - The row position of yellow blocks and expanded white block placement are interwoven, as described by position_yellow_block

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Analysis:** Examine the input grid to determine its dimensions (height, width) and the presence and location of any yellow pixels (value 4) and white pixels (value 0).

2.  **Output Grid Initialization:**
    *   The output grid's width is always twice the input grid's width.
    *   The output grid height is determined as follows:
        *   If there are no yellow pixels, the output grid's height equals the number of white pixel rows x 2.
        *   If there are yellow pixels:
            *    If yellow is the only color in the row, the output height is 2.
            *    If the input grid contains both yellow and white, expand white pixels to 2x2 white blocks.
               When a yellow pixel is present, expand the yellow pixel to a 2x2 yellow block.
               Place the yellow 2x2 block at output row 0, and column at 2x the input yellow pixel column
               White blocks are placed by expanding white pixels, starting at row 0, skipping rows when there are yellow pixels.

3.  **Pixel Expansion:**
    *   **White Pixels:** Every white pixel (0) in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block in the output grid with the pattern: `[[8, 0], [0, 8]]` (azure and white).
    *   **Yellow Pixels:** If a yellow pixel (4) is present in the input grid, it is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid with the pattern: `[[4, 4], [4, 4]]` (all yellow).

4.  **Yellow Block Placement (if Yellow exists):**

   * The output grid has at least two rows
   * The expanded yellow 2x2 block in placed with it's top-left corner at output row 0 if the only pixel in that row is yellow.
   * The 2x2 yellow block is placed starting at the column = 2 * the original yellow pixel's column.

5. **White Block Placement**

   * White blocks are placed by expanding in place each of the white pixels to the 2x2 white block.
   * If there are no yellow pixels, they expand in place, doubling the output height, as well as doubling the output width.
   * When there are yellow pixels, the white blocks are placed beginning at row 0, but skipping rows when there is a yellow pixel block.

6.  **Output:** The final output grid is formed by applying these expansions and placements. The yellow block, if present, takes priority over any overlapping white blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
