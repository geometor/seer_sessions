The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid by a specific rule. I see numbers/colors, and contiguous areas of the same color could signify objects. The positioning and arrangement of these colored areas are also key. The solid gray line of 5's is interesting. I perceive it might be a type of inert object or separator.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
