Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Copy Red Pixels:** Copy locations of all red pixels (value 2) from the input grid to become the first row of the output grid.
2.  **Copy Blue Pixels:** Copy all blue pixels (value 1) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.
3.  **Remove Gray Row:** Remove the entire horizontal row of gray pixels (value 5) from the input grid.
4.  **Transform Last Red:** Find the red pixel (2) located at the extreme bottom right of the *input* grid. Change this pixel to a blue pixel (1) in the last position in the *output* grid.
5. The last row on the input becomes the last row of the output with the exception of the transformation defined in step 4.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
