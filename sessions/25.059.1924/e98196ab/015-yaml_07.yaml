objects:
  - name: blue_pixels
    type: pixels
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - scattered throughout the upper part of the input grid

  - name: gray_row
    type: row
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - a complete horizontal row of gray pixels
      - separates the upper and lower part of the grid

  - name: red_pixels
    type: pixels
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - located in the lower part of the grid,
      - arranged with same x coordinates as copies of itself.

  - name: output
    type: grid
    color: mixed
    properties:
      - row of only red pixels with 2's in them.
      - copies of the upper blue pixels
      - the last red pixel on the bottom right corner become 1.

actions:
  - name: filter
    description: Selectively retain certain pixels based on their color and position.
  - name: remove_gray_row
    description: delete the entire gray row

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains all initial objects (blue pixels, gray row, red pixels).
  - output_grid: Derived from the input grid, containing a subset of the original pixels and a transformed row.
  - spatial_relationship: the first row of the output corresponds to the red pixels y coordinates
  - spatial_relationship: the last row of the output include the red pixels in the y coordinates from the input grid.
