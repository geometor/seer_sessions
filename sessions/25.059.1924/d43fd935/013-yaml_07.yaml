facts:
  - object: green_block
    description: A 2x2 block of green (3) pixels.
    action: Copied from input to output without change in relative position.
  - object: orange_shape
    description: Shape composed of orange (7) pixels.
    action: Mirrored across the diagonal (y=x). The position and size of the
      shape is dynamic.
  - object: azure_shape
    description: Shape consisting of connected azure (8) pixels
    action: Mirrored about the vertical axis. The axis is positioned in the
      center of the object, not necessarily the center of the grid. One element
      of the mirrored shape is removed, specifically where the element is
      'inside' the original shape - the location is where the reflection would
      duplicate the shape.
