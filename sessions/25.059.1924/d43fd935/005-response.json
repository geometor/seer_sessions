The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), green (3), magenta (6), and white (0). There's a spatial aspect, as the positions of the colors change between input and output. There appear to be some interactions. The green 2x2 square seems particularly important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The blue pixel on the bottom row ([9,4]) also create a horizontal line of blue pixels. The length of both lines appears to be related to the size of the green square. In the specific example, the blue pixels extend 4 times to the right for the top-left blue pixel and zero times to the right for the bottom blue pixel. The extension rule appears to relate to a distance between a blue pixel and the green square.\n\n3. **Magenta Pixel Movement:** The magenta pixels that are above the green square are moved one square down, except the one to the bottom left, that disappears.\n\nThis program captures the core transformations: the horizontal extension of blue pixels influenced by the green square, and a downward shift of some magenta squares.\n"
