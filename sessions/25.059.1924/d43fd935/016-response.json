This means the pixel at (r, c) in the input becomes the pixel at (c, r) in the output.\n\n3.  **Mirror Azure:** The object formed by azure (8) pixels is mirrored vertically. The vertical line of reflection is the center of the azure object. The reflection *only* fills cells that are *not* occupied by an azure (8) pixel in the *input* grid. If the reflected azure pixel would overlap with any other existing object, the other object takes priority, including the mirrored orange object.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds objects of a specific color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not (0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols) or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Copy green blocks (color 3)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r,c] == 3:\n                output_grid[r,c] = 3\n\n    # Mirror orange (color 7)\n    orange_objects = get_objects(input_grid, 7)\n    for obj in orange_objects:\n        for r, c in obj:\n            output_grid[c, r] = 7\n\n    # Mirror azure (color 8)\n    azure_objects = get_objects(input_grid, 8)\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        # Find the center of the object for mirroring\n        coords = np.array(obj)\n        min_c = np.min(coords[:, 1])\n        max_c = np.max(coords[:, 1])\n        center_c = (min_c + max_c) / 2\n\n        for r, c in obj:\n            # reflect across the center axis\n            mirrored_c = int(2 * center_c - c)\n            if 0 <= mirrored_c < cols:\n                # Crucial change: Check the *input* grid for existing azure\n                if input_grid[r, mirrored_c] != 8:\n                    # if the cell is not 8 in input, fill, but orange takes precedence if there\n                    if output_grid[r, mirrored_c] == 0:\n                        output_grid[r, mirrored_c] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
