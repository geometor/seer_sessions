Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the 2x2 green square and all blue and magenta pixels.

2.  **Blue Pixel Extension:** The blue pixel on the top left ([0,0]) creates a horizontal line of blue pixels to its right. The blue pixel on the bottom row ([9,4]) also create a horizontal line of blue pixels. The length of both lines appears to be related to the size of the green square. In the specific example, the blue pixels extend 4 times to the right for the top-left blue pixel and zero times to the right for the bottom blue pixel. The extension rule appears to relate to a distance between a blue pixel and the green square.

3. **Magenta Pixel Movement:** The magenta pixels that are above the green square are moved one square down, except the one to the bottom left, that disappears.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
