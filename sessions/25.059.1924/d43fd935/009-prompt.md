Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the 2x2 Green Square:** Find the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 2x2 green square. This square serves as a reference point.

2.  **Extend Blue Pixels:**
    *   For each blue pixel in the input grid:
        * If blue pixel is on a row *above* the green square, transform the pixel on its right into blue, repeat this transformation on the next pixel to its right, repeat a total of 4 steps to the right, turning pixels blue.
        * If a blue pixel is in the row *below* the green square's top edge, transform the pixel on its right into blue.

3.  **Move Magenta Pixels:**
    *   For each magenta pixel:
        *   If the magenta pixel is *above* the green square's top edge, *and* its column is to the *right* of the green square's *left* edge, move it down one row.
        *   If the magenta pixel is in the same column and *left* of the green square, it disappears.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
