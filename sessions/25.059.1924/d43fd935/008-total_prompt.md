Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the 2x2 green square and all blue and magenta pixels.

2.  **Blue Pixel Extension:** The blue pixel on the top left ([0,0]) creates a horizontal line of blue pixels to its right. The blue pixel on the bottom row ([9,4]) also create a horizontal line of blue pixels. The length of both lines appears to be related to the size of the green square. In the specific example, the blue pixels extend 4 times to the right for the top-left blue pixel and zero times to the right for the bottom blue pixel. The extension rule appears to relate to a distance between a blue pixel and the green square.

3. **Magenta Pixel Movement:** The magenta pixels that are above the green square are moved one square down, except the one to the bottom left, that disappears.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program captured some key aspects of the transformation, specifically:

*   Identifying the 2x2 green square.
*   Recognizing the role of blue and magenta pixels.
*   Attempting to extend blue pixels and move magenta pixels.

However, the execution on the training examples revealed inaccuracies:

*   **Example 1:** Mostly correct, showing the intended transformation.
*   **Example 2:** Several errors. The blue line extension logic is incorrect, and there are problems in magenta movement, and the location of magenta pixels.
*   **Example 3:** Major errors. It seems like the location of the green square is calculated properly, but the blue pixel extension is completely wrong, and also one magenta pixel disappears.

The main issues seem to stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Blue Pixel Extension:** The logic for extending blue pixels is flawed, especially regarding their position relative to the green square and green square's position.
2.  **Inconsistent Magenta Pixel Movement:** The rule for moving magenta pixels needs to be more precise, particularly handling edge cases and their locations.
3. **Missing logic:** No logic in place to address examples 2 and 3.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Re-examine Blue Pixel Extension:** Carefully analyze the relationship between the green square, blue pixels, and the resulting blue lines in *all* examples. Focus on the starting and ending points of the lines, and the count.
2.  **Refine Magenta Pixel Movement:** Develop a clearer rule based on relative position to the green square and perhaps other objects. Use consistent terminology (e.g., "above," "below," "left," "right").
3.  **Consider Relative Positioning:** The core of the problem lies in understanding how objects' positions *relative to each other* dictate the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary)**

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_square
    type: square
    color: green
    size: 2x2
    behavior: stationary_reference

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: blue
    behavior: extend_horizontally
    extension_rule: >
      Extends to the right, starting from its initial position. The number of
      extension steps is determined by its position relative to green_square.

  - name: magenta_pixel
    type: pixel
    color: magenta
    behavior: move_conditionally
    movement_rule: >
      Moves down one row if above the green square, but not in the same column as the
      green square. Magenta pixels in the same column, and left of the green square are removed.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate the 2x2 Green Square:** Find the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 2x2 green square. This square serves as a reference point.

2.  **Extend Blue Pixels:**
    *   For each blue pixel in the input grid:
        * If blue pixel is on a row *above* the green square, transform the pixel on its right into blue, repeat this transformation on the next pixel to its right, repeat a total of 4 steps to the right, turning pixels blue.
        * If a blue pixel is in the row *below* the green square's top edge, transform the pixel on its right into blue.

3.  **Move Magenta Pixels:**
    *   For each magenta pixel:
        *   If the magenta pixel is *above* the green square's top edge, *and* its column is to the *right* of the green square's *left* edge, move it down one row.
        *   If the magenta pixel is in the same column and *left* of the green square, it disappears.

The key improvements in this natural language program are:

*   **Clearer Relative Positioning:** Uses terms like "above," "below," "right of," and "left of" to explicitly define relationships.
*   **Precise Blue Extension:** Defines a clear start to the extension (from the blue pixel's original position) and end (4 steps to the right).
*    **Precise Magenta Movement:** Defines when the pixel should disappear.
*   **Simplified Logic:** Avoids unnecessary iterations by extending directly from the original blue pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
