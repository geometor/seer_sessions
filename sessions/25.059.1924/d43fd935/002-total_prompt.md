<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2048x1360 at 0x71663D5B3550>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer representing a color. The input grids are transformed into output grids. The transformation appears to involve copying some elements, modifying others based on their spatial relationships, and potentially propagating values. The core concept seems to be identifying colored objects and extending them according to certain conditions, possibly involving the concept of "agents" moving.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: colored_cells
    description: Cells with a non-zero value. Represent colored pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9) representing a specific color.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates in the grid.

  - name: background
    description: Cells with the value 0. Represents white/empty space.
    properties:
       - color: 0
       - position: (row, column)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  Non-zero colored cells that are next to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
    involved_objects: [colored_cells, colored_cells]

actions:
  - name: extend
    description: Certain colored objects, based on their initial position and color, can be extended.
    properties:

    conditions:
       - description: If one blue (1) pixel exits and there is also a 2x2 green(3), extend the blue to cover all green and adjacent white pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-zero (colored) pixels in the input grid. Note their color and position.
2.  **Locate Target Pattern:** Find all blue pixels (color 1) and green blocks(color 3, with size 2 x 2).
3. **Extend by propagation:** Check If a 2x2 green block and blue pixel exists. If found, extend blue(1) pixel, converting adjacent white pixels into blue pixels. Adjacent colored object which is not 2x2 will be kept.
4.  **Copy other objects**. All the other colored object which are not blue(1) or green (3, with shape 2x2), will not be changed.

In essence, the transformation extends a blue object to adjacent white, by consuming the 2 x 2 green, and keeps other object unchanged..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
