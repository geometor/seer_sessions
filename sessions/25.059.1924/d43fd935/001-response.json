The input grids are transformed into output grids. The transformation appears to involve copying some elements, modifying others based on their spatial relationships, and potentially propagating values. The core concept seems to be identifying colored objects and extending them according to certain conditions, possibly involving the concept of \"agents\" moving.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note their color and position.\n2.  **Locate Target Pattern:** Find all blue pixels (color 1) and green blocks(color 3, with size 2 x 2).\n3. **Extend by propagation:** Check If a 2x2 green block and blue pixel exists. If found, extend blue(1) pixel, converting adjacent white pixels into blue pixels. Adjacent colored object which is not 2x2 will be kept.\n4.  **Copy other objects**. All the other colored object which are not blue(1) or green (3, with shape 2x2), will not be changed.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extends a blue object to adjacent white, by consuming the 2 x 2 green, and keeps other object unchanged..\n"
