The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). There are distinct objects formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10). The green object remains unchanged. The blue objects seem to be influencing a change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If a blue pixel is already present in the vertical, skip and continue. Stop adding, if a green object is present.\n4.  **Preserve Other Objects**: The green object remains in the same position and shape from input to output.
