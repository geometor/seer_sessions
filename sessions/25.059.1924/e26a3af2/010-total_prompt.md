Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The most obvious change is the removal of all colors except for blue (1), azure (8), and red (2). The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid only contains a subset of these colors. The layout and position of the remaining colors (blue, azure, and red) seem to be preserved. The transformation appears to be a filter, removing colors other than blue, azure, and red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: 14
      - height: 13
      - cells: pixels with integer values (0-9) representing colors

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
       - color: integer value (0-9)

actions:
  - name: filter_colors
    description: Remove pixels of certain colors.
    parameters:
      - keep_colors: [1, 2, 8] #blue, red, azure

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid. Position (row, column) is maintained during filtering.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The colors to be retained are blue (1), red (2), and azure (8).
2.  **Iterate through Grid:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Filter Pixels:**
    *   If a pixel's color is blue (1), red (2), or azure (8), keep it in the output grid at the same position.
    *   If a pixel's color is *not* blue, red, or azure, replace the pixel with azure(8) in the output grid at the same position. Actually, it does not matter, the other pixels are removed. Since there are no other azure(8) pixels, let's say we remove the colors that are not blue, red or azure.

This can be simplified as follow:

1.  **Iterate through Input:** For each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Preservation:** Keep the pixel in the output grid at the same position *only* if its color is blue (1), red (2) or azure (8). Other colors are discarded.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
