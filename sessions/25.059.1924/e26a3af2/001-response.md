Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The most striking observation is that the output grids retain certain colors/values from the input grids while seemingly "erasing" or "overwriting" others. The consistent colors across all examples appear to be blue (1), azure (8), green (3), red(2) and orange (7). The overwritten colors appear to be all the other colors not previously mentioned. It seems the locations/positions of the consistent colors are irrelevant. The transformation appears to be a selective filtering or masking operation, preserving only specific colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9] # All possible colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]  # All possible colors after transformation
  - name: retained_colors
    type: list
    properties:
        - colors: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]

actions:
  - name: filter_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    parameters: retained_colors
    description:  Keeps only pixels of the specified colors, replacing other pixels with background.
  - name: determine_background_color
    input: output_grid, retained_colors
    output: background_color
    description: Looks across each output grid in the training set and checks to see if any color appears that is NOT a retained color. This color will match the "background_color" if present in the input, otherwise it is not present in the input.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    via: filter_colors
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Retained Colors:** The colors to be retained are blue (1), red (2), green (3), orange (7), and azure (8).

2.  **Identify Background Colors:** Examine the input grids and determine a set of background colors that could be overwriting the non-retained colors. The background color across each training example is the color that fills the output grid and IS NOT in the retained color set. The color is overwritten if any color in the "background color" set appears in the output.

3.  **Filter the Input Grid:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's color is in the set of retained colors, keep it in the output grid at the same position.
    *   Otherwise, replace it by the corresponding background color based on which training example we are using.

4. The output grid dimensions should remain the same.
