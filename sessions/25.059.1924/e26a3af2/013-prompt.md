Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: Copy all non-black pixels from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original positions and colors. Black pixels remain black. In effect, the transformation preserves all connected components formed by colored pixels, leaving empty (black) regions unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros (black).
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    for row_index, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        for col_index, pixel_color in enumerate(row):
            # Check if the pixel is non-black.
            if pixel_color != 0:
                # Copy the pixel's color to the corresponding position in the output grid.
                output_grid[row_index, col_index] = pixel_color

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
