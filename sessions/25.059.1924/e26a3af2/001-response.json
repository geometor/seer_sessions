The most striking observation is that the output grids retain certain colors/values from the input grids while seemingly \"erasing\" or \"overwriting\" others. The consistent colors across all examples appear to be blue (1), azure (8), green (3), red(2) and orange (7). The overwritten colors appear to be all the other colors not previously mentioned. It seems the locations/positions of the consistent colors are irrelevant. The transformation appears to be a selective filtering or masking operation, preserving only specific colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The background color across each training example is the color that fills the output grid and IS NOT in the retained color set. The color is overwritten if any color in the \"background color\" set appears in the output.\n\n3.  **Filter the Input Grid:** For each pixel in the input grid:\n    *   If the pixel's color is in the set of retained colors, keep it in the output grid at the same position.\n    *   Otherwise, replace it by the corresponding background color based on which training example we are using.\n\n4.
