Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of colored pixels. The input grid contains two distinct objects: a single green (3) pixel and a 2x2 square of magenta (6) pixels. The output grid expands the magenta square and adds green pixels in a specific pattern relative to the original green and magenta objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_pixel
    color: green (3)
    type: single pixel
    initial_position: (3, 1) # row, col - zero indexed
    shape: point
  - id: magenta_square
    color: magenta (6)
    type: square
    initial_position: (4, 2)
    shape: 2x2 square
    initial_dimensions: (2, 2)

actions:
  - type: expansion
    object: magenta_square
    description: Expand the magenta square by one pixel in all directions.
  - type: replication
    object: green_pixel
    description: Replicate green pixels around the new boundary of expanded meganta shape.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: green_pixel
    object2: magenta_square
    description:  The green pixel is initially located above and to the left of the magenta square. In the output, replicated green pixels appear at positions diagonally adjacent from the corner of expanded meganta square.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find the single green pixel and the 2x2 magenta square in the input grid.
2. **Expand Magenta Square:** Expand the magenta square by one pixel in all directions, resulting in a 4x4 magenta square.
3. **Replicate and Position Green Pixels:** Replicate the green pixel. Place one green pixel in the cell to the left and right of the top left and bottom right corner of the expanded magenta square.

The core concept seems to be expanding the magenta square and then placing green pixels relative to both the original green position and the corners of the expanded magenta area.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
