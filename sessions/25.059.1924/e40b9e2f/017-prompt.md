"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the single maroon (9) pixel and the azure (8) rectangular block within the input grid.

2.  **Mirror the maroon pixel:** Locate the positions obtained by mirroring the maroon pixel across the top and the bottom border of the azure rectangle.

3. **Place Additional Maroon Pixels:** If it is not there already, add a maroon pixel to the locations determined in step 2.

4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the initial input, plus the extra maroon pixels.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
