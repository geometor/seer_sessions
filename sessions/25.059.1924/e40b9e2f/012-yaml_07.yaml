objects:
  - name: magenta_square
    color: 6
    shape: 2x2 square
    action: expand
    expansion: 1 # expands by one pixel in all directions

  - name: green_pixel
    color: 3
    shape: point
    action: replicate
    positions:
      - relative_to: magenta_square
        location: varies
        # offsets are relative to expanded top-left
        possible_offsets:
          - [0, 1] # top, 1 right of expanded top-left
          - [1, -1] # 1 down, 1 left of expanded top-left
          - [1, 1]  # 1 down, 1 right of expanded top-left
          - [1, 3] # 1 down, 3 right of expanded top-left
          - [2, 3] # 2 down, 3 right of expanded top-left
          - [4, -1] # 4 down, 1 left of expanded top-left
          - [4, 3]  # 4 down, 3 right of expanded top-left
          - [5, 1] # 5 down, 1 right of expanded top left

rules:
  - If a green pixel is present in input, replicate it in specific locations relative to the EXPANDED magenta square in the output
  - If a magenta 2x2 square is present, expand it by one pixel in all directions (making it a 4x4 square).
  - position of replicated green pixel depends on initial placement, but is always described as an offset relative to the expanded magenta square.
