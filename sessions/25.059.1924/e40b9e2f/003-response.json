There's a distinct shape formed by orange (7) and yellow (4) pixels in the input. The output shows a modified version of this shape. The most noticeable change is a rotation and some expansion of certain parts of the shape. Specifically, the yellow pixels appear to have \"moved\" outwards, and the orange pixels have shifted. It seems like a combination of a reflection over x and y axis, and a swap of \"layers\".\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
