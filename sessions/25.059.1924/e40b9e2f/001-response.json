The primary elements appear to be colored \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. The transformation seems to involve modifying these objects, potentially based on their shape, color, and surrounding pixels. There's a concept of mirroring or extending object boundaries. The background is always white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

These form the initial objects.\n2.  **Symmetric Expansion:** For the existing colored object in the input array, perform an operation of extending the shape outwards, one unit in cardinal directions.\n3. For each pixel of the existing object, examine the neighbors on direct opposite sides, above/below or left/right.\n4.  If the object's pixel borders two 0-value pixels, copy that object's pixel to those 0-valued pixels.\n5. If the object's pixel *does not* border two 0-valued pixels in opposite directions, there is no change.\n6. No other transformation.\n\nIn summary the existing object in the input array is \"mirrored\" across its boundary wherever there are \"empty\" (0 valued) pixels directly across from each other.\n"
