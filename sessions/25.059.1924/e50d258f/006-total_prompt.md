Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a cropping operation. It removes the outer layers of the input grid,
which are primarily white (0) and azure (8) pixels, to isolate the internal data region. 
The output grid is a 5x4 subgrid extracted from the input grid.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by cropping it to the relevant 5x4 data region.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Determine the cropping region's top-left corner.
    # We start at row 1 to skip the first all-zero row.
    top_left_row = 1
    top_left_col = 6

    # Define the dimensions of the cropped region.
    cropped_height = 5
    cropped_width = 4

    # Crop the array
    output_array = input_array[top_left_row:top_left_row + cropped_height,

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and implemented a simple cropping operation. While it worked for the first example, the subsequent test results indicate that a more sophisticated approach is needed. The core issue is that the cropping logic is static (fixed coordinates and dimensions) and doesn't adapt to the varying positions and sizes of the relevant "data region" within each input grid. The strategy for improvement will involve:

1.  **Dynamic Cropping:** Instead of hardcoded coordinates, we need to dynamically determine the boundaries of the region to be cropped. This likely involves identifying the bounding box of non-background colors.
2.  **Background Identification:**  We need to robustly identify what constitutes the "background." In the examples, white (0) seems like a primary background color, and sometimes azure(8).
3. **Object Recognition:** The shape we're trying to capture may not be captured by a simple bounding box - more specific shapes, lines, etc may be present.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the patterns, let's analyze each example using code execution to gather some key metrics. I'll focus on:

*   Dimensions of the input grid.
*   Dimensions of the output grid.
*   Colors present in the input and output grids.
*   Bounding box of non-background colors in the input.

actions:
  - name: crop
    description: Extract a rectangular region of interest.
    parameters:
      - top_left_corner: Dynamically determined based on content.
      - bottom_right_corner: Dynamically determined based on content.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Background:** The background consists primarily of pixels with a value of 0 (white). In some cases, 8 (azure) may also be part of the background, *adjacent* to the 0 values.
2.  **Locate Content:** Find the bounding box of the non-background pixels. This defines the region of interest.
3.  **Extract Content Block:** If a solid color rectangle is present (all non-zero pixels are the same), extract.
4. **Extract Column:** If non zero pixels form a single vertical line extract a 4x4 area around it where the last column in the area contains the line.

This improved natural language program captures the dynamic nature of the cropping and focuses on identifying the content based on its color and spatial relationship to the background. It accounts for the variation observed across the training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
