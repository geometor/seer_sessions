A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right \u2013 not diagonally).\n\n2. Select shape(s):\n   - if one shape is contained within another, select the inner shape\n   - if no shapes are contained, select shape(s) by color. If only one shape of that color exists, it is the selection.\n\n3.  Extract Selected Shape: Create the output grid by copying *only* the pixels of the selected shape(s).
