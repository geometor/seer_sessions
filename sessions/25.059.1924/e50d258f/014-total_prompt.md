Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid consistently contains a smaller, colored rectangle found within a larger rectangle in the input grid. The color and size vary, but it's always a rectangle within a rectangle.
1.  Identify Rectangles: Find all rectangles within the input grid. A rectangle is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color with four sides and four right angles.
2.  Find Inner Rectangle: Within the identified rectangles, locate a rectangle that is completely contained *inside* another, larger rectangle.
3.  Extract Inner Rectangle: Create the output grid by copying *only* the pixels of the inner rectangle.  The output grid should be sized to perfectly fit the inner rectangle, with no extra rows or columns.
4. If there are multiple inner rectangles contained in different larger rectangle, choose the largest inner rectangle.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying and extracting inner rectangles. However, the test results reveal that this approach is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformations in all cases. The code correctly handles cases where a single, clear inner rectangle exists, but it fails when:

1.  **No Inner Rectangle:** There isn't always a rectangle *within* another rectangle.
2.  **Multiple or overlapping candidate shapes**: the current logic doesn't handle these properly.
3. **Other shapes.** The objects aren't always rectangles.

The strategy for improvement will involve:

1.  **More Flexible Shape Detection:** Instead of strictly looking for rectangles, we need to detect *any* contiguous region of the same color.
2.  **Contextual Analysis:** We must consider relationships *beyond* simple containment. This might include looking for the *smallest* shape, shapes of a *specific* color, or shapes adjacent to other specific features, or comparing areas of shapes
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll examine each example, identify the specific failure or success, and adjust the natural language program and code iteratively to accommodate the new information.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution and Manual Inspection)**

To make this concrete, let's examine each example set and its result. I will use manual inspection first to give high level feedback, then use code execution of the transform to verify

**Example Set 1:**

*   **Input:** A large white (0) grid with a smaller blue (1) rectangle inside.
*   **Expected Output:** The blue (1) rectangle.
*   **Actual Output:** The blue (1) rectangle.
*   **Analysis:** The code works as expected in this simple case.

**Example Set 2:**

*   **Input:** Two separate rectangles: a large green (3) one and a small blue (1) one, not nested.
*   **Expected Output:**  The blue (1) rectangle.
*   **Actual Output:** \[]. The code found no *inner* rectangle, so it returned an empty grid.
*   **Analysis:** This reveals a major flaw. The rule isn't *always* about inner rectangles. It seems to select the *smaller* distinct shape.

**Example Set 3:**

*    **Input:** a grid with complex shapes, one a combination of green and
    blue, another shape is solid blue
*   **Expected Output:** the blue (1) shape.
*    **Actual Output:** \[]. The code found no *inner* rectangle, so it
    returned an empty grid.
*   **Analysis:** This reveals a major flaw. The rule isn't *always* about
    inner rectangles. It seems to select a shape by color.

**YAML Facts**
```yaml
example_set_1:
  input_objects:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: white
      role: background
    - shape: rectangle
      color: blue
      role: foreground
  output_objects:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: blue
      role: extracted
  transformation: extract_inner_rectangle

example_set_2:
  input_objects:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: green
      role: other
    - shape: rectangle
      color: blue
      role: foreground
  output_objects:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: blue
      role: extracted
  transformation: extract_smallest_shape # Hypothesis

example_set_3:
    input_objects:
      - shape: irregular #shape that is a combination of blue and green pixels
        color: mixed
        role: other
      - shape: rectangle
        color: blue
        role: foreground
    output_objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        color: blue
        role: extracted
    transformation: extract_blue_shape

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

Based on the analysis of all three example sets, here's a revised natural language program:

1.  **Identify Contiguous Shapes:** Find all distinct, contiguous regions (shapes) of the same color within the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right – not diagonally).

2. **Select shape(s):**
   - if one shape is contained within another, select the inner shape
   - if no shapes are contained, select shape(s) by color. If only one shape of that color exists, it is the selection.

3.  **Extract Selected Shape:** Create the output grid by copying *only* the pixels of the selected shape(s). The output grid should be sized to perfectly fit the selected shape(s), with no extra rows or columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
