The subgrid appears to be defined by the non-zero, non-azure (8) colored pixels within the input.  The output grid contains only the colors and shapes formed by the non-zero and non-8 colored pixels, maintaining their relative positions within the original subgrid, removing white and azure pixels.. It also looks like empty rows and columns which are on the borders of azure colored subgrid are removed.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

This defines a rectangular bounding box within the input grid.\n\n2. **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, smaller grid (the output grid) with dimensions equal to the bounding box identified.\n\n3. **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through the cells within the bounding box of the input grid. Copy the color value of input_grid to the same related position of the output grid, only copying those pixels within the bounding box that have non-zero and non-8 colors(non-white and non-azure).\n\n4.
