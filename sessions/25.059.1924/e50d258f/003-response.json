The input grid contains multiple colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a cropped and filtered version of a section of the input grid. The dominant color in both input and output is azure (8). There are also elements of red (2) and blue (1). White (0) seems to act like a background or padding.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this case, it's a 5x4 subgrid, excluding the empty border columns and rows.\n2.  **Determine start of the region** locate the first row with data in input, ignoring the top row of `0` padding.\n3. **Crop:** Extract the identified region, discarding the rest. The region is starting at row index `1` (the second line) and has the original dimensions of 5 by 4.\n\nEssentially, the transformation is a simple cropping operation, removing the outer layers of the input grid, mainly composed of white (0) and some azure (8) pixels, to focus on the internal relevant data region.\n"
