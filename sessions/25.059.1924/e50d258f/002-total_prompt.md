**Perception:**

The core concept seems to be extracting a subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid appears to be defined by the non-zero, non-azure (8) colored pixels within the input.  The output grid contains only the colors and shapes formed by the non-zero and non-8 colored pixels, maintaining their relative positions within the original subgrid, removing white and azure pixels.. It also looks like empty rows and columns which are on the borders of azure colored subgrid are removed.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - colors: [0, 1, 2, 8]  # white, blue, red, azure
        - dimensions: variable
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - colors: [1, 2, 8] # blue, red, azure
        - dimensions: variable, smaller than or equal to input_grid

actions:
  - extract_subgrid:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid
      parameters:
        - bounding_box: Defined by non-white, non-8 pixels.
        - preserve_colors: only of non-zero, non-8 pixels.

relationships:
  - output_grid_content: Subset of input_grid_content based on color.
  - output_grid_dimensions: Determined by the bounding box of the non-white and non-8 pixels in the input_grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the Bounding Box:** Scan the input grid to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing non-zero and non-8 (non-white and non-azure) colored pixels. This defines a rectangular bounding box within the input grid.

2. **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, smaller grid (the output grid) with dimensions equal to the bounding box identified.

3. **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through the cells within the bounding box of the input grid. Copy the color value of input_grid to the same related position of the output grid, only copying those pixels within the bounding box that have non-zero and non-8 colors(non-white and non-azure).

4. Return the new grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
