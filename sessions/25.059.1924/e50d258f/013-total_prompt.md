Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid consistently contains a smaller, colored rectangle found within a larger rectangle in the input grid. The color and size vary, but it's always a rectangle within a rectangle.
1.  Identify Rectangles: Find all rectangles within the input grid. A rectangle is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color with four sides and four right angles.
2.  Find Inner Rectangle: Within the identified rectangles, locate a rectangle that is completely contained *inside* another, larger rectangle.
3.  Extract Inner Rectangle: Create the output grid by copying *only* the pixels of the inner rectangle.  The output grid should be sized to perfectly fit the inner rectangle, with no extra rows or columns.
4. If there are multiple inner rectangles contained in different larger rectangle, choose the largest inner rectangle.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
