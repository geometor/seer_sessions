Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a significantly smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain multiple colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid contains a subset of colors from a specific location. The most obvious feature of the output is that is 3x3 and pulled from the lower left corner, the colors are also present in the input grid at other locations.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - contains multiple colors
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - contains a subset of colors from the input_grid
relationships:
  - spatial:
      - output_grid elements correspond to a sub-region of the input_grid
      - location: bottom-left corner of input grid.
actions:
    - extraction: output grid is created from a section of the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the bottom-left 3x3 sub-grid within the 10x10 input grid.
2.  **Extract** the pixel values (colors) from this 3x3 sub-grid.
3.  **Construct** the output grid using the extracted pixel values, preserving their original relative positions.

In essence, the transformation is a simple extraction of a specific region from the input grid to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
