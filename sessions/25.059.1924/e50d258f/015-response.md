Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger than the output grid. The colors present in the example are red (2), azure (8), blue (1), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a cropped portion of the input grid, specifically the top-left corner, but only includes the colored pixels, excluding the white ones.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 10x10
        colors: [red, azure, blue, white]
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 6x4
        colors: [red, azure, blue]
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid appears to be a cropped section of the input grid.
  - type: color_filtering
    description: White pixels in input are not in output
actions:
  - type: cropping
    description: A section of the input grid is selected.
  - type: filtering
    description: White pixels are removed.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Sub-grid:** Locate the smallest rectangular sub-grid within the input grid that contains all non-white pixels. In this instance it would seem that starting search in upper left corner of input.
2.  **Crop:** Extract this sub-grid.
3. **Filter**: Remove all white pixels
