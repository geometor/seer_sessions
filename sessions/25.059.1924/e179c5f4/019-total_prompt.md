Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Seed:** Find the (x, y) coordinates of the single blue pixel ('1') within the input grid.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with azure ('8')
3.  **cross pattern:** fill a cross, or plus shape, around the located seed with blue pixels
    - the length of the cross is determined by the grid size
    - for a 10 x 4 grid, there are 5 cells above and below for the vertical line, and 2 to the left, and one to the right forming the cross bar.
4. leave the seed cell as an azure pixel.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
