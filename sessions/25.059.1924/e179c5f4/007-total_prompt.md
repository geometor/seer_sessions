Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Observe the input grid's dimensions.
2. Create a new grid with the same dimensions.
3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
4. If a cell has value 0, fill it in the output with alternating values of 8 and 1, starting with 8.
5. If the input cell value is 1, it also get the alternating 8, 1 sequence, but where the position fits into the pattern that was started at 0,0 determines where it starts.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
