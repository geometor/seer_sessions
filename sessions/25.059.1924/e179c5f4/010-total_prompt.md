Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify Input Pixels: Examine each pixel in the input grid.
2.  Preserve Non-Zero/One Values: If a pixel's value is *not* 0 or 1, its value in the output grid remains the *same* as in the input grid.
3.  Transform 0 and 1 Values: If a pixel's value *is* 0 or 1:
    *   Calculate the sum of its row and column indices (`row + col`).
    *   If the sum is even:
        *   If the input value is 0, the output value is 8.
        *   If the input value is 1, the output value is 1.
    *   If the sum is odd:
        *   If the input value is 0, the output value is 1.
        *   If the input value is 1, the output value is 8.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program and supporting observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were based on the first training example. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on subsequent examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too specific and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformations.

The strategy now is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs in the training set, including the successful and failed cases.
2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for consistent relationships between input and output grids that hold true across *all* examples. Pay close attention to the values that change, and the values that do not.
3.  **Refine the rule:** Adjust the natural language program to incorporate the observed patterns, and make the rule more general. This likely means moving away from a rule based solely on row/column index sums.
4.  **Re-evaluate:** Continuously compare observations across examples and refine program.

**Metrics and Observations**

To aid my analysis, I will generate information and reports on my assumptions, using code to count and test assertions.

    results = []
    for example in task["train"]:

        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output, output_grid)
        
        diff = predicted_output - output_grid # what was the diff between expected and actual
        
        diff_input = output_grid - input_grid # what changed from input to output

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
