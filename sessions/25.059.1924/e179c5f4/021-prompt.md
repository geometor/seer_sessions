Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Seed:** Find the (x, y) coordinates of the single blue pixel (color 1) within the input grid. This is the "seed" of the cross.
2.  **Initialize the Output:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. Fill the entire output grid with azure (color 8).
3.  **Draw Vertical Line:** Starting from the seed's y-coordinate, draw a vertical line of blue (color 1) pixels upwards and downwards. The lines stop at the boundaries of the input grid.
4.  **Draw Horizontal Line:** Starting from the seed's x-coordinate, draw a horizontal line of blue (color 1) pixels to the left and to the right. The lines stop at the boundaries of the input grid.
5. **Replace Seed:** change the value of the seed pixel in the output grid to azure.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
