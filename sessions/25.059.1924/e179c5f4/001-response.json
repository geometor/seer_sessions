            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe core element is a transformation of a grid of pixels.  The input grids consist almost entirely of `0` (white) pixels, with a single `1` (blue) pixel at the bottom. The output grids seem to replace the `0`s with an alternating pattern of `8` (azure) and `1` (blue) pixels. The position of the original blue pixel in the input appears to dictate the starting point of the alternating pattern in the rows of the output. The key seems to be the location of the single blue pixel and how it influences the alternating pattern. The dimensions of the output grid appear to match the dimensions of the input grid in height and width.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The column of the input blue pixel determines the starting value (8 or 1) in each corresponding row in the output grid. Each row alternates 8s and 1s starting based on whether the sum of the input blue pixel's column and the current row is even or odd.\n"
