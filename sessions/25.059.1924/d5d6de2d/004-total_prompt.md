Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input grid contains two distinct shapes formed by '2' (red) pixels against a background of '0' (white) pixels.
*   The output grid seems to represent a simplified or abstracted version of the input. The red shapes are replaced with green ('3') shapes.
*   The upper red shape becomes a single green pixel.
*   The lower red shape becomes a 2x2 block of green pixels.
*   The relative positions of the shapes are maintained (one in the upper section, one in the lower section).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape1
    color: red (2)
    type: irregular
    position: top-left
    transformed_color: green (3)
    transformed_type: single pixel

  - id: shape2
    color: red (2)
    type: irregular, 2x2-like structure.
    position: bottom-center
    transformed_color: green (3)
    transformed_type: 2x2 block
background:
    color: white (0)

actions:
    - type: color_change
      from: red
      to: green

    - type: shape_abstraction
      details:  |
         Top shape becomes a point,
         Bottom shape maintains 2 x 2 structure.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of '2' (red) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Color Transformation**: Change the identified pixel's value '2' to '3', thus switching color red into green.
3.  **Shape Abstraction:**
    *   For the top-most red shape, replace it with a single '3' (green) pixel at any coordinate within the original shape bound.
    *   For the bottom-most red shape, replace it with a 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels. The position of the top-left corner of this 2x2 block can be anywhere along the top edge of the boundary of original red shape.
4.  **Background Preservation:** All '0' (white) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation converts red shapes to green, simplifying the top shape to a single point and maintaining the bottom shape with a 2x2 block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
