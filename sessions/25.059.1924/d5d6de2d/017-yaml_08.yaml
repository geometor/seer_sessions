facts:
  - task_objective: |
      Transform the input grid to an output grid where a 3x3 green square replaces a portion of the largest red object, and all other pixels are white.
  - object_identification:
      - type: object
        description: Contiguous regions of the same color.
        attributes:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - size: integer (number of pixels)
          - shape: irregular
      - type: target_object
        description: The largest red object.
        attributes:
            - color: 2 (red)
  - transformation_rules:
      - find_red_objects: |
          Identify all contiguous regions of red pixels.
      - find_largest_red_object: |
          Determine the red object with the maximum number of pixels.
      - determine_bounding_box: |
          Find the smallest rectangle enclosing the largest red object.
      - place_green_square: |
          Create a 3x3 green square at the top-left corner of the bounding box.
      - set_other_pixels_white: Set all other pixels to white.
  - validation_notes: Verified against all training examples; code needs adjustment to select by color.
