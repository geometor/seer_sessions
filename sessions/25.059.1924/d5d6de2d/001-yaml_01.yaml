facts:
  - object_types:
    - background:
      color: white (0)
      mutable: false
    - input_object:
      color: red (2)
      mutable: true
      shape: variable (connected region)
    - output_object:
      color: green (3)
      mutable: false
      shape: rectangle (or subset of the input object's shape)
      relation_to_input: "contained within input object's bounding box"

  - actions:
    - identify_objects: "Locate contiguous regions of red (2) pixels."
    - reduce_object: "Replace the red object with a smaller green object."
      - size_reduction_rule: "Object's area decreases; often looks like inner edges of the input or rectangular part of the input"
      - color_change: "red (2) becomes green (3)"
    - preserve_background: "Pixels with value 0 remain unchanged."

  - relationships:
    - spatial: "Output object is always spatially contained within the area (or bounding box) previously occupied by the input object."
