The input grid contains two distinct objects composed of red (value 2) pixels. One is a larger, irregular shape resembling a hollow rectangle, and the other is a small 2x2 square located some distance away. The output grid is mostly empty (value 0) except for a 3x3 green (value 3) square. The location of this green square seems to correspond to the bounding box of the hollow red shape, but the location of the original 2x2 red square does not affect the resulting output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Smaller object's do not affect the output. Everything else becomes white.\n"
