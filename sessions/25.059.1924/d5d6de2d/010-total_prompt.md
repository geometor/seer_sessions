Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid containing a hollow square made of red pixels (value 2). The output is a 10x10 grid containing two vertically stacked green pixels (value 3). The green pixels appear to be positioned in a column near the center of where the red square was located in the input, and they are vertically adjacent. The red square "disappears", and the green connected component is created. It seems the original object is replaced with another object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_1:
      type: hollow_square
      color: red
      value: 2
      initial_position:
        top_left: [1, 4]
        bottom_right: [4, 7]
  - object_2:
      type: vertical_line
      color: green
      value: 3
      final_position: [2,5]
      length: 2

  - grid_size:
    rows: 10
    cols: 10

  - action:
      description: replace the red square with a green vertical line.
      details: "A green vertical line of length 2 appears roughly centered vertically and horizontally within the initial red square's bounding area"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the hollow red square (pixels with value 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** horizontal center of hollow red square by averaging top most and bottom most row of the square, and locate near central column occupied by the red square.
3. **Remove** the identified square by changing red pixels to background color pixels (color black/value 0).
4.  **Create** a vertical line of two green pixels (value 3) with the top most pixel at the located row and column position of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
