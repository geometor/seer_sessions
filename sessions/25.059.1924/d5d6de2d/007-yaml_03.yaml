examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      red_count: 1
      red_shapes: [[2,2]]  # Assuming a 2x2 square
    output_objects:
      green_count: 1
      green_shapes: [[2, 2]]
    transformation: Red object replaced by green object of the same shape and size.
    discrepancy: None

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      red_count: 2
      red_shapes: [[1,1], [1,1]]
    output_objects:
      green_count: 2
      green_shapes: [[1,1],[2,2]]
    transformation: Top red object becomes a single green pixel, bottom red object becomes a 2x2 green square.
    discrepancy: None
    
  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      red_count: 3
      red_shapes: [[1,1], [1,1], [1,1]]
    output_objects:
      green_count: 3
      green_shapes: [[1,1],[1,1], [2,2]]
    transformation: >
        Top-most red object becomes green pixel.
        Second top-most red object becomes green pixel.
        Third top-most red object becomes a 2x2 green square.
    discrepancy: The current program will not transform correctly because it only considers one or two objects.
