actions:
  - type: bounding_box_detection
    input: obj1
    description:  Find the smallest rectangle enclosing obj1.
  - type: replacement
    input: bounding_box
    color: green
    size: 3x3
    description: Draw a filled green square with size 3x3 inside top-left corner of the detected bounding box in the input grid. The rest of the output grid should be white.
