Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation removes the gray areas and expands the single blue to fill those gray spaces, without otherwise altering the Red and Green.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_pixels_by_color(grid, color):
    """Finds the coordinates of all pixels of a specified color."""
    return np.argwhere(grid == color)

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules."""

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Find and Remove gray (5) pixels.
    gray_pixels = find_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 5)
    for x, y in gray_pixels:
        output_grid[x, y] = 0
        
    # Find the blue (1) pixel.
    blue_pixels = find_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 1)

    if len(blue_pixels) > 0:
        blue_x, blue_y = blue_pixels[0] #assuming a single blue

        #find the empty spots on the row
        row = output_grid[blue_x]
        empty_indices = np.where(row == 0)[0]

        #fill the empty spaces, adjacent to blue
        for x in empty_indices:
          if abs(x - blue_y) <= 2 : #fill to adjacent 0s on this row
            output_grid[blue_x,x] = 1


    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the removal of gray pixels and the expansion of the blue pixel. However, it only expanded the blue horizontally and only to directly adjacent 0 value pixels. It failed to account for vertical expansion and expansion beyond the directly adjacent pixels. The code's assumption of a single blue pixel is also incorrect, as multiple blue pixels can exist (example 3). The core concept is correct, but the implementation of the blue expansion is too limited.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Address Multiple Blue Pixels:** Modify the code to handle multiple blue pixels, expanding each of them.
2.  **Full Expansion:** Instead of only filling adjacent `0` cells, the blue should fill *all* available `0` cells that are connected (horizontally and vertically) to the initial blue pixel(s).
3.    **No Hardcoded offsets:**  use a more flexible approach than checking adjacent pixels that can apply to any size or position, not just length of 3 and single blue pixel

**Example and Results Analysis (using code execution where necessary):**

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    """Analyzes the input, expected output, and predicted output grids."""

    input_pixels = {}
    output_pixels = {}
    predicted_pixels = {}

    for color in range(10):  # Check all colors
        input_pixels[color] = np.argwhere(input_grid == color).tolist()
        output_pixels[color] = np.argwhere(output_grid == color).tolist()
        predicted_pixels[color] = np.argwhere(predicted_grid == color).tolist()

    return {
        'input_pixels': input_pixels,
        'output_pixels': output_pixels,
        'predicted_pixels': predicted_pixels,
        'grid_dims': input_grid.shape,
    }

#Dummy data for example analysis, replaced with real data in actual execution
example_data = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[5, 1, 5], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]),
        "output": np.array([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]),
        "predicted": np.array([[0, 1, 0], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 1, 5, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]),
        "output": np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]),
        "predicted": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[5, 5, 5, 2], [1, 5, 1, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5]]),
        "output": np.array([[1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]),
        "predicted": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]),
    }

]

results = []

for ex in example_data:
  results.append(code_execution(ex['input'], ex['output'], ex['predicted']))

for i,result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Grid Dimensions: {result['grid_dims']}")
    print(f"  Input Pixels: {result['input_pixels']}")
    print(f"  Output Pixels: {result['output_pixels']}")
    print(f"  Predicted Pixels: {result['predicted_pixels']}")
    print("-" * 20)
```

**Example 1:**

*   Grid Dimensions: (3, 3)
*   Analysis: The code removed the gray (5) and replaced adjacent 0 with the blue(1).
* The error is that only the adjacent 0 value was replaced

**Example 2:**

*   Grid Dimensions: (3, 5)
*   Analysis: The code removed the gray (5), and correctly replaced a single adjacent 0 on the row with the blue (1).
* The error is that the blue should replace *all* the 0's.

**Example 3:**

*   Grid Dimensions: (3, 4)
*   The gray was replaced with 0, and each blue only filled adjacent 0's on its row.
* The error is that there are two blues, and the fill should extend across all connected 0's.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: gray_region
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      action: removed
  - object: blue_region
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      action: expands to fill connected empty space
    constraints:
      - expansion is horizontal and vertical
  - object: other_colors
    properties:
      colors: red (2), green (3)
      action: remain unchanged
  - object: empty_space
    properties:
      color: white(0)

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Remove Gray:** Locate all gray (value 5) pixels in the input grid and remove them, setting those pixels to 0 (white).
2.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Find all blue pixels (value 1).
3.  **Expand Blue:** For *each* blue pixel, expand it to fill all connected (horizontally and vertically) white pixels (value 0) that replace the gray. The expansion continues until it encounters a pixel that is not 0 (white).
4. **Preserve Other Colors:** All other colored pixels (e.g., red, green) remain in their original positions and retain their original values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
