Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Initialization:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Grey Pixel Transformation:** Iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is grey (5):
    *   Examine its immediate neighbors (including diagonals).
    *   If *any* neighbors are blue (1), change the grey pixel to blue (1).
    *   If all neighbors are grey (5) or white (0), change the grey to white (0)
    *   Otherwise, leave the grey pixel unchanged.
3.  **Other Colors:** Pixels that are not grey (5) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
