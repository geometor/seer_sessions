**input:**
```

1 1 0 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 0

**output:**
```

1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by integers. The input grid appears to have a different size and shape compared to the output grid. Certain colors seem to disappear (e.g., gray '5'), while others are retained or change position (blue '1', red '2'). The output grid is smaller in both dimensions compared to the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable
          - cells: colored pixels (integers 0-9)
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - position: (row, column)

  - actions:
    - name: remove_color
      description: Certain colors are completely removed from the grid.
    - name: resize
      description: The dimensions of the grid are changed.
    - name: retain_color
      description: Some colours are left as they are.

  - relationships:
      - input_grid_to_output_grid: The transformation relates the input grid to the output grid.
      - pixel_to_pixel: Individual pixel colors and positions in the input may or may not be present in the output.
      - color_to_color: Certain color changes are possible.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Remove:** Identify all pixels with the color gray (5) and remove them entirely from the grid.
2.  **Retain:** Keep all the occurrences of color blue(1) and red(2)
3. **Resize:** The output grid will be of dimensions 3x8
4. **Result:** Construct the output grid, which is a 3x8 section of the top-left part of the input grid, after removing the gray pixels, ensuring all blues are on the left of all reds.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
