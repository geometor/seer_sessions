Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify and Remove:** Identify all pixels with the color gray (5) and remove them entirely from the grid.
2.  **Retain:** Keep all the occurrences of color blue(1) and red(2)
3. **Resize:** The output grid will be of dimensions 3x8
4. **Result:** Construct the output grid, which is a 3x8 section of the top-left part of the input grid, after removing the gray pixels, ensuring all blues are on the left of all reds.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
