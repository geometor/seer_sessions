The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11 in this example). There appears to be some kind of color substitution and shifting occurring, with certain colors seeming to \"influence\" or \"overwrite\" others based on their position or color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
