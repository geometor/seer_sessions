**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x9 and 3x7 in this specific example pair). Certain colors in the input grid seem to be replaced or removed based on their spatial relationship with other colors. Specifically, the grey (5) pixels seem to play a crucial role in the transformation. The core colors to look for are gray(5), blue(1), and red(2).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Grey (5) pixels in the input are removed or replaced in the output.
  - observation: |
      Red (2) pixels persist in the output.
  - observation: |
      Blue (1) pixels persist.
  - observation: |
      White (0) pixels persist.
  - subject: Grey (5) pixels
    action: Are replaced based on adjacency
    details: |
       Replaced by white (0) if adjacent to white (0).
       Replaced by blue(1) if adjacent to blue (1).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  **Grey Pixel Replacement:** Iterate through each cell in the output grid.
    *   If the value is grey (5)
    *   if the grey is next to only white pixels, change it to white.
    *   if it is next to only blue pixels change it to blue.

3.  **Other colors.** No change, copy them as they are.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
