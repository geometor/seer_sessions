The input grid contains two distinct colors: white (0) and red (2). The output grid introduces a new color: maroon (9). The maroon pixels appear to fill in the spaces *between* distinct regions of red pixels, while the red and white areas otherwise remain unchanged. It appears that the transformation identifies separate red \"objects\" and inserts maroon pixels in the spaces between them, specifically in a way that creates horizontal lines.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Treat regions separated by any other color (including white (0)) as distinct.\n2.  **Fill Between Red Regions Horizontally:** For each row:\n    *   If there are one or more pixels that are not red (2), check if they are between two red pixel, horizontally\n    *   If they are, change the color of those pixels to maroon (9).\n3.  **Preserve Existing Pixels:** All other pixels (red and white) retain their original colors in their original positions.\n4. The operation only takes place within the existing borders of the image, not expanding it\n\nEssentially, the transformation finds gaps between red areas on each row and fills those gaps with maroon.\n"
