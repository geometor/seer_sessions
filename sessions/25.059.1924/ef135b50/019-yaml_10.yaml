task: 079010a9
observations:
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      change_condition: adjacent_to_red
      new_color: maroon (9)
  - object: red_pixel
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      role: trigger_color_change
  - adjacency:
      type: horizontal_or_vertical
      importance: determines_color_change
  - pattern:
      description: White pixels turn maroon, not just when adjacent to red but when they are on the edge where a red is located.
examples:
  - train_0:
    outcome: success
  - train_1:
    outcome: failure
    details: "Mismatches in multiple locations where white pixels are at the edge."
  - train_2:
    outcome: failure
    details: "Mismatch in locations where white pixels are at the edge."
  - train_3:
      outcome: failure
      details: "Mismatches in location where a white pixel is at the edge."
