Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). The input grid contains two distinct colors: white (0) and red (2). The output grid introduces a new color: maroon (9). The maroon pixels appear to fill in the spaces *between* distinct regions of red pixels, while the red and white areas otherwise remain unchanged. It appears that the transformation identifies separate red "objects" and inserts maroon pixels in the spaces between them, specifically in a way that creates horizontal lines.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_regions
    type: contiguous_blocks
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - adjacency: separated
  - id: filler
    type: single_pixels
    color: maroon (9)
    properties:
      - location: between red_regions
      - pattern: horizontal lines

actions:
  - name: identify_red_regions
    description: Locate distinct, non-adjacent areas of red pixels.
  - name: fill_between
    description: Insert maroon pixels between the identified red regions, forming horizontal lines.
    constraints:
      - Only fill horizontally.
      - Do not extend beyond existing grid boundaries

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: red_regions are separated by white and/or maroon areas.
  - type: transformation
    relation: maroon fills spaces between red_regions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Scan the input grid and locate all distinct regions of contiguous red (2) pixels.  Treat regions separated by any other color (including white (0)) as distinct.
2.  **Fill Between Red Regions Horizontally:** For each row:
    *   If there are one or more pixels that are not red (2), check if they are between two red pixel, horizontally
    *   If they are, change the color of those pixels to maroon (9).
3.  **Preserve Existing Pixels:** All other pixels (red and white) retain their original colors in their original positions.
4. The operation only takes place within the existing borders of the image, not expanding it

Essentially, the transformation finds gaps between red areas on each row and fills those gaps with maroon.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
