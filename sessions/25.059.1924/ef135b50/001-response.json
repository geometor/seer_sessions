The colors used are consistently white (0), red (2), and maroon (9). The transformation seems to involve selectively replacing some red pixels with maroon pixels. The positions of the replacements seem related to the shapes formed by the red pixels. Specifically, it appears to be filling areas within enclosed red regions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If an internal area is filled with red (2) pixels and there is no 0 (white) pixel in it, then, change color to 9 (maroon).\n4.  Copy all other pixels, white and red, to output.\n\nIn simple words.
