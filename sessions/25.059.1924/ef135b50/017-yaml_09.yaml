  The program identifies white pixels in a grid and changes their color to maroon if they are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a red pixel.

objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # 0: white, 2: red, 9: maroon
      position:
        type: tuple (row, column)

actions:
  - name: identify_white_pixels
    description: Locate all pixels with a color value of 0.
  - name: check_adjacency
    description: >
      For a given white pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right)
      to see if any of them are red (color value 2).
  - name: change_color
    description: >
      If a white pixel is adjacent to a red pixel, change the white pixel's color
      to maroon (color value 9).

transformation_rule: >
  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is white, check its
  immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors. If any neighbor is red, change
  the pixel's color to maroon. Otherwise, leave the pixel's color unchanged.
  The output grid reflects these color changes.
