Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain digits, specifically 0, 2, and 9.
*   Digit 0 represents white, 2 represents red, and 9 represents maroon, based on the color map provided.
*   The input grid has several disconnected regions of red (2) pixels.
*   The output grid is identical to the input, except some red (2) pixels have been changed to maroon (9).
*   The changed pixels seem to fill in gaps within the red regions, making some of the shapes more "solid."

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    element_types: [0, 2, 9]
  - type: pixel
    values:
      0: white
      2: red
      9: maroon
  - type: region
    description: contiguous block of pixels of the same color

actions:
  - type: fill
    description: Change the color of pixels within a region.
    parameters:
      from_color: 2
      to_color: 9
      condition: "fills gaps or enclosed spaces within red regions"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal).
  - type: containment
    description:  A region can contain other regions (e.g., a white region surrounded by a red region).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all regions of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** any white (0) pixels that are completely surrounded by red (2) pixels, either directly or diagonally.
3.   Within any of these surrounded areas from Step 2., find where the color red(2) forms an enclosed "empty shape."
4.  **Change** the color of red(2) pixels to maroon (9) if they fill in gaps to give the maroon(9) regions simple shapes. It looks like the shapes become rectangles.

In simpler terms, the transformation identifies enclosed "gaps" within or adjacent to connected red regions and changes the color of some of the red pixel to maroon to make the regions in the image into more rectangular, solid shapes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
