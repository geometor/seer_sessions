objects:
  - name: boundary
    color: blue (1)
    description: Defines the outer limits within which movable pixels operate.  Pixels move *within* the boundary created by the blue.
    behavior: Static, defines the operational area.

  - name: movable
    color: non-blue (not 1)
    description: Pixels that are subject to movement.
    behavior: Moves downwards within the boundary, filling empty spaces until blocked.

  - name: empty_space
    color: white (0)
    description: Represents cells available for movable pixels to occupy.
    behavior: Becomes occupied by the color of movable pixels above it.

actions:
  - name: drop_fill
    description: Movable pixels move downwards within the boundary defined by blue pixels, filling empty spaces.
    trigger: Iterating through columns within the boundary, from top to bottom.
    constraints: Movement stops when a movable pixel encounters a blue pixel, another non-blue, non-white, pixel, or the edge of the boundary.
