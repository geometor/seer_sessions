The colors appear to have significance in the transformation.\n*   **Borders:** The top and bottom rows of the input grids often contain a single, distinct color, forming a kind of \"border.\" The border colors can vary between examples.\n*   **Inner Pixels:** Inside the borders, there are scattered pixels of various colors, including white (0).\n* **Sparsity**: the inner pixels are sparse, there aren't many non-white pixels\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The concept of background pixels is important.\n"
