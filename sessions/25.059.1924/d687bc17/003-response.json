Copy it to the same location in the output.\n    *   Locate the single green(3) pixel in the input grid at 3, 14. Copy the pixel and its neighbor at row 6, column 14 of output grid.\n    *   Locate the single red(2) pixel in the input grid at 4, 1. Copy the pixel and its neighbor at row 8, column 1 of output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation seems to preserve a frame while duplicating select unique interior color pixels based on specific criteria that are not fully evident from this single example. The specific logic behind where or which duplicated unique colors are based, needs more examples.\n"
