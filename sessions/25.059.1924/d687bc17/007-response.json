            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code focuses on identifying a \"frame\" of blue pixels and duplicating the non-blue pixels within that frame to the row directly below. This approach works for the first example, but fails on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the concept of a \"frame\" is too restrictive and doesn't generalize to the broader pattern. The new examples indicate that the blue pixels define a boundary, and interior non-blue pixels get duplicated *downwards* until they hit a blue pixel or another non-blue pixel (or edge of the grid). The duplication occurs for empty cells (white).\n\nThe strategy should involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Object Identification:** Instead of a \"frame,\" we should identify \"boundary\" pixels (blue) and \"movable\" pixels (non-blue).\n2.  **Re-define Action:** The action is not simple duplication, but a downward \"drop\" or \"fill\" of movable pixels within the boundary.\n3. **Iteratively check for empty spots:** look down each column within the blue boundary.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo better understand the transformations, let's represent them using numpy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef show_grid(grid, label):\n    print(f'-- {label} --')\n    print(grid)\n\n# Example 1:\ninput_grid1 = np.array([\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n])\noutput_grid1 = np.array([\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n])\nshow_grid(input_grid1, 'input 1')\nshow_grid(output_grid1, 'output 1')\n\n# Example 2:\ninput_grid2 = np.array([\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\noutput_grid2 = np.array([\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\nshow_grid(input_grid2, 'input 2')\nshow_grid(output_grid2, 'output 2')\n\n# Example 3\ninput_grid3 = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1],\n    [1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1],\n    [1, 5, 1, 5, 5, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\noutput_grid3 = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1],\n    [1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1],\n    [1, 5, 1, 5, 5, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nshow_grid(input_grid3, \"input 3\")\nshow_grid(output_grid3, \"output 3\")\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: boundary\n    color: blue (1)\n    description: Defines the outer limits within which movable pixels operate.  Pixels move *within* the boundary created by the blue.\n    behavior: Static, defines the operational area.\n\n  - name: movable\n    color: non-blue (not 1)\n    description: Pixels that are subject to movement.\n    behavior: Moves downwards within the boundary, filling empty spaces until blocked.\n\n  - name: empty_space\n    color: white (0)\n    description: Represents cells available for movable pixels to occupy.\n    behavior: Becomes occupied by the color of movable pixels above it.\n\nactions:\n  - name: drop_fill\n    description: Movable pixels move downwards within the boundary defined by blue pixels, filling empty spaces.\n    trigger: Iterating through columns within the boundary, from top to bottom.\n    constraints: Movement stops when a movable pixel encounters a blue pixel, another non-blue, non-white, pixel, or the edge of the boundary.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Boundary:** Find all blue (1) pixels. These pixels form a closed boundary, but the boundary doesn't have to be rectangular.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Columns:** For each column within the horizontal bounds of the blue pixels:\n\n3.  **Drop Fill:** Starting from the top row and moving downwards within the boundary:\n    *   If a non-blue, non-white pixel is found, \"drop\" or copy that pixel's color value downwards, filling empty(white) pixels below, one at a time.\n\n4.  **Stopping Condition:** Stop dropping a pixel's color when:\n    *   A blue (1) pixel is encountered.\n    *   Another non-blue, non-white, pixel is encountered.\n    *   The bottom edge of the boundary (or grid) is reached.\n\n5. If the input does not contain any blue pixels - return the input unchanged.\n"
