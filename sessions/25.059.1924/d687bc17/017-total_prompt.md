Previous Code:
```python
"""
Preserve the top (magenta) and bottom (green) horizontal bands, and the left (yellow) and right (azure) vertical bands.
Within the inner region:
1. Change the yellow(4) pixel in the 4th row and 9th column to magenta (6).
2. Remove the red (2) pixel.
3. Remove the single magenta(6) pixel that was originally in the 4th row and 9th column.
4. Keep all other isolated azure(8) and yellow(4) pixels within the center.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
