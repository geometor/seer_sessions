There are distinct horizontal bands of color at the top (magenta, 6) and bottom (green, 3). The left side has a vertical band of yellow (4) and the right a band of azure(8). Within the central area, there are isolated pixels of various colors, including red (2), azure (8), and magenta (6), on a background of white (0).\n*   **Output Grid:** A 14x11 grid with the same dimensions and overall structure as the input. The top and bottom color bands, and left and right bands, are the same. The main change is within the central area: some, but not all, of the isolated colored pixels have disappeared, and it appears the yellow (4) in the 4th row and 9th column is now a six (magenta).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Iterate over inner region of input grid (exclude top, bottom, left, right bands).\n    b.  Locate the yellow pixel that is in the 4th row and 9th column and change it to magenta.\n    c. Remove the red pixel, and single magenta pixel at row 4 column 9. Leave the other azure and yellow pixels.\n\nEssentially, the transformation maintains the outer frame and selectively removes or changes specific isolated pixels within the central area based on their position and color, and a pixel is changed from yellow to magenta.\n"
