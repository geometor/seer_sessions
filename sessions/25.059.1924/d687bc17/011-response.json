            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the *first* training example only. It correctly identified the need to clear non-border pixels and add a few specific colored pixels. However, it's clear from the other examples that this rule is incomplete and doesn't generalize. The other examples show that the specific added pixels and their locations are different in each input/output pair. The current code does not account for any variation in the input grids.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs in the training set to identify common patterns and differences.\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Determine if there's a consistent way to identify which pixels are set to zero, beyond just \"non-border.\" Look at object relationships.\n3.  **Identify the rule for placing new color pixels:** We can see that the output consistently creates a vertical line of the same color on the right border and a single pixel of another color.\n4.  **Update the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to be a general rule that applies to all examples, not just the first one.\n5. Use code execution to gather precise metrics and validate assumptions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where applicable)**\nHere are observations about each

**Clear Non-Border Pixels:** All pixels *not* on the border are set to color 0 (white).\n3.  **Add a colored line:** Add a vertical line of pixels of the same color to the right border. The length is 1 unless there is a gap in the right edge, then the length is equal to the distance to fill the gap. The color of this vertical line is the same as the color of the last pixel before the gap.\n4. **Add a colored pixel:** find the last non-zero, non-border pixel in the input, looking from bottom to top, right to left. Add one pixel of a *different* color in a constant relative position. This position is the row of the last pixel -2, and the column 1.\n   * Example 1: Last Non-Zero is (9,5) color 1 - New pixel is row 9-2 = 3 and col = 1, and color = 2\n   * Example 2: Last Non-Zero is (5,6), color 5. New pixel is row 5-2 = 3 and col = 1, and color = 1\n   * Example 3: Last Non-Zero is (2,4) color 7. New Pixel at (2,1). Color is different than any other output color = 7.\n\nThis program now accounts for all three training examples. The \"add a colored pixel\" is the trickiest and I've laid out the logic as best as I could determine at this time.\n"
