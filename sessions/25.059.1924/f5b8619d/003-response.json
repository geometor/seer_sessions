The colors present in the input are red (2) and white (0). The output grid introduces a new color, azure (8). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern involving the original colors and the new color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The original positions from the input will now be (0,0), (0, 3), (3,0) and (3,3).\n4.  **Color Mapping (New Color):** Fill every location that did not receive a color in step three with azure.\n\nEssentially, each original pixel is generating a new color pixel, with all zeros receiving the new color.\n\n"
