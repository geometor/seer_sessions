Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is doubled in both dimensions. 
A new color (azure) is introduced. 
The output grid follows a pattern: original pixel, white pixel, azure pixel, original pixel, white pixel, azure pixel.
Original input pixels are mapped to their corresponding positions in the expanded grid.
Remaining positions are filled with azure, maintaining the specified pattern.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The test results reveal inconsistencies across all examples, indicating that the initial hypothesis is incomplete and needs adjustment. The code is imposing a regular pattern not supported by all the data and doubling of dimensions are incorrect assumptions. The introduction of azure (8) is also not universally applicable. We need a more general approach that looks at the input-output pairs without strong preconceived notions about the structure. The strategy will be to:

1.  Carefully re-examine *all* input-output pairs.
2.  Identify common elements, differences, and potential relationships.
3.  Focus on object properties (color, size, position) and transformations.
4.  Develop a revised natural language program, and update associated code.

**Metrics and Observations using Code Execution:**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded. The output grid's width is three times the input grid's width. The output grid's height is two times the input grid's height plus one.
2.  **Color Insertion:** Two new colors, white (0) and azure (8), are introduced in the output grid.
3. **Pattern:** The first row of the output is created by taking each value of the input row, placing it and then a 0 and an 8, repeating for all values of the input row. The second output row consists only of white (0) pixels. The third row has an 8 in the first, third, forth, sixth, seventh and ninth place, with 0 in the remaining places.  The pattern repeats with rows shifted down.
4.  **Repetition:** The pattern established in the first three rows is repeated for subsequent rows based on input row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
