Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Double the Grid:** The original 2x2 input grid is doubled in both dimensions to create a 4x4 output grid.

2. **Replicate and Transform:**
   - White (0) pixels from the input grid are copied to their corresponding doubled positions in the output grid. A white pixel at (0,0) in the input becomes white pixels at (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2) in the output.
   - For each yellow (4) pixel in the input grid:
     - A yellow pixel (4) is placed in the corresponding location in the output grid.
     - A new color, azure (8), is placed in the horizontally and vertically adjacent pixels in the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
