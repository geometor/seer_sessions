Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2x2 grid into a 4x4 grid. The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and yellow (4).  The output grid introduces a new color, azure (8), and expands the original grid. The arrangement of the original colors seems to be preserved and replicated within the larger output grid, suggesting a pattern of duplication and possibly some form of arithmetic operation or color substitution.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
      - color: azure
        value: 8
  - action: grid_expansion
    description: The input grid is doubled in both dimensions.
  - action: value_transformation
    description: The yellow pixels in the input become alternating yellow and new azure pixels in output.
  - relationship:
      - input_grid
      - output_grid
      - grid_expansion duplicates and transforms certain input elements to create the output_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Double the Grid:** Take the original 2x2 input grid and double its dimensions to create a 4x4 output grid.

2. **Replicate and Transform:**
    *   Copy the white (0) pixels from the input grid to their corresponding doubled positions in the output grid. For example, a white pixel at (0,0) in input becomes white pixels at (0,0), (0,2),(2,0), and(2,2) in output.
    *    For each yellow (4) pixel in the input grid:
         * Place a yellow pixel (4) in same location in output grid.
         * Place a new color, azure (8) in the horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent pixel in output.

In essence, the transformation expands the grid and replicates the original pattern, with the yellow pixels spawning, in their new location, a horizontally and vertically adjacent azure pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
