actions:
  - name: expand_grid
    description: The input grid is expanded to a larger output grid.
  - name: replicate_pattern
    description: A three-row pattern is replicated for each row of the input grid.
  - name: fill_first_row
    description:  The first row of each three-row pattern copies input pixel, alternating with 0 and 8.
  - name: fill_second_row
    description: The second row of each three-row pattern is filled with 0s.
  - name: fill_third_row
    description: The third row of each three-row pattern is filled with 8, 0, and 8, repeated.
