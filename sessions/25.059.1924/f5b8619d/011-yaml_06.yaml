observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      shape: variable, ranging from 1x1 to 3x3 in the examples
      colors: contains only color 5 (gray) in the examples
      type: 2D array

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: derived from input_grid shape; output_shape = (2 * input_shape) + 3
      colors: contains colors 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 8 (light blue)
      type: 2D array
    relations:
      - to: input_grid
        type: expansion
        details: Each dimension expands to 2 * original_dimension + 3

  - object: transformation_rule
    properties:
       color_mapping:  input color 5 (gray) is preserved; other cells use background of color 8, white border
       border: white border
       expansion: see output grid shape
    actions:
      - type: expand
        details: Grid expands by rule output_shape = (2*input_shape) + 3
      - type: color_fill
        details: Original input pixels are placed in the expanded grid, surrounded by light blue (8), and with white (0) border.
