Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input consists of grids of varying dimensions, containing numerical digits (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are larger than the input grids, also containing numerical digits.
*   **Color Substitution:** Non-zero values in input are sometimes be replaced by 8 in output
*    **Expansion:** The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with a repeating pattern.
* **Background**: 0s in the original grid seems not to be replaced in expanded grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - dimensions: larger than input_grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Increase the dimensions of the grid.
    parameters:
      - factor_row: number of times to duplicate vertically
      - factor_col: number of times to duplicate horizontally

  - name: substitute
    description: Replace specific values with others.
    parameters:
      - original_value: value to be replaced
      - new_value: value to replace with
      - condition: where to replace

relationships:
    - type: spatial_expansion
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid
      details: Output grid dimensions are multiples of input_grid
    - type: value_substitution
      details: non zero values can be substituted with 8

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each non-zero cell (pixel) in the input grid.
2.  **Expansion with possible Substitution:**
    *   For each non-zero pixel, create a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    *   The top-left cell of the 2x2 block is the original non-zero value.
    *   The top right, bottom-left, bottom right, value is 8.
3.  **Zeros:** Leave 0 cells from the input to be 0s in the output.
4. **Combine:** combine all the blocks to make one expanded grid.

In other words:

The input grid is expanded. Each non-zero pixel in the original image becomes a 2x2 block. In these blocks, original value is at top-left and 8 fills the remaining positions. Zero-value pixels remain zeros and also expand, maintaining their original value of 0.
