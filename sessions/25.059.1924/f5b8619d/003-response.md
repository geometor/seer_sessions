Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. The colors present in the input are red (2) and white (0). The output grid introduces a new color, azure (8). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern involving the original colors and the new color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3, output grid is 6x6.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors red (2) and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors red (2), white (0), and azure (8).
  - observation: The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.
  - object: Input_Grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [2, 0]
  - object: Output_Grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: [2, 0, 8]
  - relationship: Output_Grid is a transformation of Input_Grid.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is doubled in both dimensions to create a 6x6 grid.
2. **Pattern Creation**: The pattern will be the original cell, a zero cell, a new cell, the original cell again, another zero, then new cell.

3.  **Color Mapping (Original Colors):** Each original cell in the input grid is directly copied to the corresponding cell in the output following that rule from step two. The original positions from the input will now be (0,0), (0, 3), (3,0) and (3,3).
4.  **Color Mapping (New Color):** Fill every location that did not receive a color in step three with azure.

Essentially, each original pixel is generating a new color pixel, with all zeros receiving the new color.
