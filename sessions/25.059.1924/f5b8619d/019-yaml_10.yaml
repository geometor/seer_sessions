  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state of the grid.
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - cols: variable
      - cell_values: [0-9] # representing colors

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state of the grid.
    properties:
      - rows: 2 * input_grid.rows
      - cols: 2 * input_grid.cols
      - cell_values: [0-9]

  - action: double_grid_size
    description: The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.

  - action: transform_yellow_pixel
    input: yellow pixel (4) at (r, c) in input_grid
    output:
      - yellow pixel (4) at (2r, 2c) in output_grid
      - azure pixel (8) at (2r+1, 2c) in output_grid
      - azure pixel (8) at (2r, 2c+1) in output_grid
      - azure pixel (8) at (2r+1, 2c+1) in output_grid
    description: A yellow pixel in the input creates a 2x2 block with a yellow pixel at top-left and azure pixels elsewhere.

  - action: transform_white_pixel
    input: white pixel (0) at (r, c) in input_grid
    output:
      - white pixel (0) at (2r, 2c) in output_grid
      - white pixel (0) at (2r+1, 2c) in output_grid
      - white pixel (0) at (2r, 2c+1) in output_grid
      - white pixel (0) at (2r+1, 2c+1) in output_grid
    description: Replicates the white to a 2x2 block.
