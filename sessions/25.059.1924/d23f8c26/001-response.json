The most obvious changes are:\n\n1.  **Color Reduction:** The output grids seem to retain only a subset of the colors present in the input grids.\n2.  **Column Focus:** It appears the transformation extracts a specific column from the input grid and uses it to form the output grid. Non-selected colors become white (0).\n3.  **Consistent Column:** The same column index appears to be selected in all examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Based on visual inspection, it looks like the third column (index 2) is consistently selected.\n2.  **Copy Column:** Copy the values from the target column of the input grid to the corresponding column in the output grid.\n3.  **Clear Other Columns:** Set all other pixel values in the output grid to 0 (white).\n\nIn essence, the transformation is a column extraction and filtering operation. The rule appears to be: \"Extract the third column (index 2) from the input grid and set all other values in the output grid to 0.\"\n"
