facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids retain only a subset of colors from the input grids.
  - observation: All non-zero pixels in the output are in a single column.
  - observation: The position of the non-zero pixels within the selected output column corresponds to their row in the input.
  - hypothesis: A specific column is selected from the input to create the output.
  - hypothesis: The values in the selected column are preserved, while all other values are set to 0 (white).
  - hypothesis: The selected column's index is consistent across all examples.
  - property: input_grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - property: output_grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - action: select_column: Selects a single column from the input grid.
  - action: filter_colors: Replaces non-selected colors with 0.
  - relationship: column_index: The index of the column to select (constant).
