The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some gray (5) pixels with yellow (4) pixels. The shape formed by the gray pixels appears to be significant. The white pixels seem to act like a background and don't directly participate into the core transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The positions that are replace appear to be the pixels that form, more or less, a 3x2 block.
