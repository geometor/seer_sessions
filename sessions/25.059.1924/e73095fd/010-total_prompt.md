Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x16).
*   The grids contain digits, primarily 0 and 5, with the output introducing the digit 4.
*   The '5's in the input seem to form a connected shape, almost like a stylized 'S' or a winding path.
*   The '4's in the output appear to "fill in" a bounded region within the '5' shape.
*   Areas outside the boundary of 5s remain unchanged.
*  There is no rotation or mirroring.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: 0 (white)
    description: The default state of all cells.

  - id: boundary
    color: 5 (gray)
    description: Forms a closed shape, possibly defining an interior and exterior.

  - id: fill
    color: 4 (yellow)
    description: Appears inside the 'boundary' shape.

actions:
  - name: fill_interior
    description: Changes the color of cells within the 'boundary' from 0 to 4.
    precondition:  A closed 'boundary' of color 5 exists.
    postcondition: All cells inside the boundary have color 4, other cells are
      unchanged

relationships:
  - type: inside
    subject: fill
    object: boundary
    description: The 'fill' object is contained within the 'boundary' object.
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels of the same value are adjacent, forming connected
      components.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Boundary:** Locate all pixels with the value '5' (gray). These pixels form the boundary of a shape.
2.  **Determine the Interior:** Identify all pixels with the value '0' (white) that are enclosed *completely* by the boundary pixels. This requires determining which '0' pixels are "inside" the shape formed by the '5' pixels.
3. **Fill the Interior:** change the color of all the pixels found inside the boundary at step two, set the cell value to '4' (yellow).
4.  **Preserve the Exterior:** All the pixels that are not a '5' and not the interiror are unchaged.

In essence, the transformation identifies a closed shape formed by gray (5) pixels and fills its interior with yellow (4) pixels, leaving the rest of the grid unchanged. The core concept is identifying the enclosed region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
