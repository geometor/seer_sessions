The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the gray (5) pixels to yellow (4). The overall shape formed by the gray pixels appears to be maintained. It looks like an interior section of the gray \"blob\" is being colored yellow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

An interior pixel is a gray pixel that is completely surrounded by other gray pixels (up, down, left, and right). Consider edge pixels.\n3.  **Recolor interior pixels:** Change the color of the identified *interior* gray pixels to yellow (4).\n4. **Preserve Exterior Pixels:** The gray pixels on the border/edge of gray shape remain unchanged.\n5. **Background remains**: background pixels (0 - white) remain unchanged\n\nEssentially, the transformation \"fills\" the inside of the gray shape with yellow, leaving a gray border.\n"
