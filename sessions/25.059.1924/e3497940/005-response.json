            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying and removing a central gray column and retaining adjacent colored shapes. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal that this approach is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformation. The primary issue is that the transformation rule isn't solely about removing the gray column, but the gray column *and adjacent non-black colors*, and preserving *specific colored shapes*.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the strategy to address the issues:\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine *all* training examples, not just the first one, to identify the *consistent* rule governing the transformation. The provided results are very helpful.\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current code focuses on \"colored shapes\" adjacent to the gray column. We need to be more precise about *which* colored shapes are preserved and why.\n3.  **Revisit Column Removal Logic:** The assumption that *all* empty columns are removed after removing the gray column is incorrect, as shown. We need to define the column removal (or rather, column *retention*) logic based on the preserved colored shapes.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll use the insights from the analysis to update the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo gather precise metrics, I need to make some small code calls to check sizes.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Provided examples (assuming they are stored in a dictionary called 'examples')\nexamples = {\n    \"train_0\": {\n        \"input\": np.array([[4, 0, 4, 5, 4, 4, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[4, 0, 4, 4],\n                            [0, 0, 0, 0],\n                            [0, 0, 0, 3],\n                            [0, 0, 0, 0]])\n    },\n        \"train_1\": {\n        \"input\": np.array([[0, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [8, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[0, 8, 0, 0],\n                            [8, 8, 0, 6],\n                            [0, 0, 6, 6]])\n    },\n    \"train_2\": {\n       \"input\" : np.array([[0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n                 [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n                            [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]])\n    },\n    \"train_3\":{\n        \"input\":\n        np.array([[7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [7, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 0, 7, 7],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                            [7, 7, 0, 0, 7],\n                            [0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n    }\n\n}\n\nfor task_name, task_data in examples.items():\n    input_grid = task_data['input']\n    output_grid = task_data['output']\n    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)\n    print(f\"{task_name}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input shape: {input_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Output shape: {output_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Predicted output shape: {predicted_output.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Correct Prediction: {np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_output)}\")\n```"
