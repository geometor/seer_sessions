Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are gray (5), yellow (4), and green (3), with a background of white (0). The input grid appears to have a central vertical column of gray pixels, with colored shapes (yellow and green) adjacent to it. The output grid retains only the yellow and green shapes, removing the gray column and reducing the width of the grid significantly. The height remains consistent.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: gray_column
    color: gray (5)
    shape: vertical column
    position: central
  - id: yellow_shape
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: irregular, adjacent to gray_column
    position: above green_shape
  - id: green_shape
    color: green (3)
    shape: irregular, adjacent to gray_column
    position: below yellow_shape
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: grid
    position: fills entire grid

actions:
  - remove: gray_column
  - retain: yellow_shape, green_shape
  - adjust_width: remove empty columns caused by removing gray column

relationships:
  - yellow_shape: adjacent to gray_column, above green_shape.
  - green_shape: adjacent to gray_column, below yellow_shape.
  - gray_column: separates yellow and green shapes

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the central, vertical column of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Identify** the colored shapes (yellow/4 and green/3) that are directly adjacent to the gray column.
3.  **Remove** the entire gray column.
4.  **Remove** any empty columns that are created by removing the gray column.
5.  **Retain** the identified colored shapes (yellow and green) in their original rows.
6. The output is new grid with colored shapes.
