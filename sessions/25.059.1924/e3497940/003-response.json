The primary colors observed are gray (5), yellow (4), and green (3), with a background of white (0). The input grid appears to have a central vertical column of gray pixels, with colored shapes (yellow and green) adjacent to it. The output grid retains only the yellow and green shapes, removing the gray column and reducing the width of the grid significantly. The height remains consistent.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
