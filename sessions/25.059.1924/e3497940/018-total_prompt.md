Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the observation that gray pixels are removed and columns containing 7 or 8 are kept. This holds true for the first example, but fails on subsequent examples. The primary issue is that the code *only* considers columns with 7s or 8s, and the rule should consider *any* column with a value other than 0 or 5. The code makes an assumption that doesn't generalize across all training examples. By removing pixels with value 5 and any column with other non-zero values should improve results.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to confirm consistent application of non-zero and non-five values.
2.  **Broaden Column Selection:** Modify observation to any column with values that are not 0 or 5.
3.  **YAML and NL Program Update:** Reflect the corrected logic in the YAML facts and the natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations (using imagined code execution results):**

I'll structure this as if I had code execution capabilities to generate precise reports. Since I don't, I'll describe the expected output of such analysis.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 11)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   `transform` Result Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Correct Pixels: 9/9 (100%)
    *   Note: Initial program succeeds on this example.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 2)
    *   `transform` Result Shape: (3,0)
    *   Correct Pixels: 0/6 (0%)
    *   Note: Initial program fails here. Output should include columns that are not zero or gray.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (5, 2)
    *    `transform` Result Shape: (5,0)
    *   Correct Pixels: 0/10 (0%)
    *   Note: Initial program fails. Output should include the column with the azure pixel.

*    **Example 4:**
    *    Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *    Output Shape: (7, 1)
    *    `transform` Result Shape: (7,0)
    *    Correct Pixels: 0/7 (0%)
    *    Note: Initial program fails.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - pixels: 2D array of color values (0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - pixels: 2D array of color values (0-9)
      - derived_from: input_grid

actions:
  - description: Remove all gray (5) pixels conceptually by selecting only relevant columns.
  - description: Filter columns.
  - condition: Keep columns that have at least one pixel with a color value other than white (0) or gray (5).
  - result: Create a new grid containing only the selected columns.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Column Selection:** Examine each column in the input grid.
2.  **Filtering Criterion:** If a column contains *any* pixel that is not white (0) or gray (5), it is selected.
3.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is formed by including the selected columns from the input, in their original order, and all the rows.

In essence, the transformation removes any column that consists *only* of white and gray pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
