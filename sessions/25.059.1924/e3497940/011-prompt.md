Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the grey (5) column:** Find the single vertical column in the input grid that is entirely filled with the color grey (5).

2.  **Define extraction boundaries:**
    *   Start column for extraction: the very next column to the right, where grey ends.
    *   End column: Include all contiguous columns of red(2) and magenta(6).

3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create the output grid by extracting all rows, and the columns from the calculated start to the calculated end.

4.  **Remove Grey (5) Pixels:** Remove/Exclude any pixels that have a color of grey, leaving only red and magenta and white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
