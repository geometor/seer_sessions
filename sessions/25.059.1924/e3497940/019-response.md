Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were based on the first training example, focusing on removing gray pixels and selecting columns not containing only 0s and 5s. While this worked for the first example, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this approach. The transformation isn't solely about removing gray pixels and filtering columns. It's about extracting columns that have colors other than white and gray. The initial code incorrectly removed all gray pixels regardless of column content, leading to inconsistencies.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Re-evaluate the Core Transformation:** Shift the focus from "removing gray" to "extracting columns with significant colors". The significant colors are all colors other than white (0) and gray(5).
2.  **Refine Column Selection:** The column selection logic needs to select columns containing values other than 0 or 5.
3.  **Simplify:** By focusing on keeping only columns with non 0 or 5, the program becomes simpler, and the removal of gray is implicit.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
Here's a breakdown of each example, including the results of executing the provided `transform` function:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Success: `True`

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 3)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (5,3)
    *   Success: `True`

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (7, 5)
    *    Actual Output Shape: (7, 5)
    *   Success: `True`

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_set: Training
    example_details:
      - example_id: 1
        input_object: A grid of pixels. Some columns contain only white and gray pixels.
        output_object: A grid containing only columns from the input that included color other than white or gray.
        transformation: Select columns that contain values other than white(0) or gray(5).
      - example_id: 2
        input_object: A grid with a mix of colored, white, and gray pixels arranged in columns.
        output_object: Columns with any colors other than white and gray.
        transformation: Select columns based on the presence of non-white and non-gray pixels.
      - example_id: 3
        input_object: Grid includes blue and yellow colored pixels in vertical strips.
        output_object:  Only the colored pixel columns are present.
        transformation:  Identify and extract columns with blue and yellow pixels (any value that isn't 0 or 5).
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Relevant Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2.  **Check for Significant Colors:** For each column, check if it contains any pixel values other than 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
3.  **Extract Columns:** If a column contains any value other than 0 or 5, include that entire column in the output grid.
4. **Construct output:** The output grid will be formed from selected columns, preserving original height.
