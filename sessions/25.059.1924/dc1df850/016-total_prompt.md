Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair and provide my observations in a structured format.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (2D array) where each cell contains a single digit integer representing a color. The input grid contains a single red (2) pixel surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid retains the red pixel in the same location, but some of the surrounding white pixels are changed to blue (1). The blue pixels appear to form a 3x3 square around the red pixel, with the red pixel at its center. However, the blue square extends only to rows and columns that exist in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input: 4x5, output: 4x5)
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    type: cell within grid
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

  - observation: input_red_pixel
    details: single red (2) pixel in the input grid
    position: (1, 1)

  - observation: output_red_pixel
    details: red (2) pixel remains in the same location in the output grid
    position: (1, 1)

  - observation: blue_pixels
    details: white (0) pixels surrounding the red pixel are changed to blue (1)
    shape: 3x3 square centered on red pixel
    constraint:  blue pixels only appear on rows and cols available in the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Find the single red (2) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Create a Bounding Box:** Create a 3x3 square region centered on the location of the red pixel.
3. **Apply color and constraint:** For all original white pixels within input grid that are located in the 3x3 square, change to blue(1), other pixels will stay as before.
4.  **Preserve Red Pixel:** The original red (2) pixel remains unchanged.
5. **Other Pixels are not affect:** Pixels not withing the 3x3 block remain at original value.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
