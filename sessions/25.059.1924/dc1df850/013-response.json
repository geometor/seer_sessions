            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on the first training example. The code identifies a shape of connected red and green pixels, creates a bounding box, translates it, and recolors the translated box. While this works for the first example, it fails on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule is more specific, involving identifying L shapes, mirroring, and inverting colors. We need to revise the natural language program to be more general. The strategy is to observe common patterns across all examples, and the core objects and actions, and then express these in a modified natural language program, along with structured observations.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nLet's analyze each example and its result:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code works as expected. The red/green shape is identified, bounded, translated, and recolored.\n*   **Example 2:** Input has a green \"L\" and output has a mirrored/flipped \"L\" in blue.\n*   **Example 3:** Input has a red \"L\" and output has mirrored/flipped \"L\" in blue.\n*   **Example 4:** input has a red \"L\", output has mirrored/flipped \"L\" in green. The color transformation depends on the color.\n\nHere are python data structure representations of the input and output grids for the training examples:\n\n```python\nexample_1_in = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_1_out = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_2_in = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_2_out = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_3_in = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_3_out = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_4_in = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nexample_4_out = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**YAML Observations**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: L_shape\n    properties:\n      color: [red, green]\n      shape: L\n      orientation: [up-right, up-left, down-right, down-left]\n    actions:\n      - name: mirror_flip\n        description: Mirrors the L shape along the diagonal axis (top-left to bottom-right).\n      - name: change_color\n        description: if input is green or red, output is blue, unless input is specifically an L of color red where the long side is length 2, in which case output color is green.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"L\" shape:** Find the largest contiguous \"L\" shape composed of either red, or green pixels. The \"L\" shape consists of a corner pixel with exactly two adjacent pixels of the same color, and each of those must have exactly one other neighbor of the same color (not each other).\n2.  **Mirror/Flip:** Mirror the \"L\" shape along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). This effectively swaps the \"L\"'s orientation.\n3. **Change Color:**\n    If the original L shape is green, change all pixels in the mirrored shape to blue.\n    If the original L shape is red, change all pixels in the mirrored shape to blue, *unless* the \"long\" side of the L shape has length 2, in which case change all pixels in the mirrored shape to green.\n4. All other pixels remain white (0).\n\n"
