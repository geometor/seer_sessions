facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and magenta (6).
  - observation: |
      The output grid retains the red (2) and magenta (6) pixels in their original locations.
  - observation: |
     The output introduces blue pixels (1).
  - relationship: |
      The blue pixels replace some of the white pixels.
  - constraint: |
      The magenta pixel seems unchanged in its color.
  - constraint: |
      The blue fills above the row of the magenta pixel
  - boundary: |
      The blue region's right boundary appears to be defined by a vertical line extending upwards from the right-most red pixel or even the edge of the image
  - boundary: |
      The blue region's bottom boundary appears to be defined by a horizontal line just above the magenta pixel, and just below the lowest red pixel.
