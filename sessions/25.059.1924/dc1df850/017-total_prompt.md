Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Find the single red (2) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Create a Bounding Box:** Create a 3x3 square region centered on the location of the red pixel.
3. **Apply color and constraint:** For all original white pixels within input grid that are located in the 3x3 square, change to blue(1), other pixels will stay as before.
4.  **Preserve Red Pixel:** The original red (2) pixel remains unchanged.
5. **Other Pixels are not affect:** Pixels not withing the 3x3 block remain at original value.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
