The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and magenta (6). The output grid introduces a new color, blue (1), while retaining the red (2) and magenta (6) pixels in their original positions. The key change seems to be the selective replacement of white (0) pixels with blue (1) pixels in the top-left region of the grid. The boundaries of this blue region appear to be related to the positions of the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
