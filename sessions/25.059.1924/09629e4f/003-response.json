The most prominent feature is the horizontal lines of grey (5) that divide the input and output grids into three equal sections. Within each section, there's a distinct pattern. In the output, it seems like blocks of identical color are formed, replacing the varied colors of the input, while preserving the position relative to the grey dividing lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
