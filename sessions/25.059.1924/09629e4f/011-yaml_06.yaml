observations:
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color: "varies (white, gray)"
      - shape: "same as input grid"
    behavior: "determined by initial non-gray colors; areas not covered by expanded non-gray colors become/remain gray"

  - object: non_gray_pixel
    properties:
      - color: "not gray (1-4, 6-9)"
      - shape: "single pixel"
    behavior: "expands to a 3x3 block of same color IF there is a connected component (orthogonally contiguous pixels) of the same color containing more than one pixel. If not, then it becomes grey."
    
  - object: gray_pixel
    properties:
       - color: grey
    behavior: "acts as a placeholder/filler; overridden by expansion, otherwise persists"
    
  - object: connectedness
    properties:
       - type: "orthogonal"
       - requirement: "at least two pixels to be expanded"
