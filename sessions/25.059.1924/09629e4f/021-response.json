The input and output grids have the same dimensions (11x11). There's a distinct horizontal line of grey (5) pixels dividing the input grid into two regions (rows 4 and 8, counting from 1). This line seems to remain unchanged in the output. The output grid contains 3x3 blocks of same color pixels with gray outline, where the colors change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
