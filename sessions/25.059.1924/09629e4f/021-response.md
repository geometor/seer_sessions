Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (11x11). There's a distinct horizontal line of grey (5) pixels dividing the input grid into two regions (rows 4 and 8, counting from 1). This line seems to remain unchanged in the output. The output grid contains 3x3 blocks of same color pixels with gray outline, where the colors change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid: 11x11 grid of digits 0-9
  - output_grid: 11x11 grid of digits 0-9
  - constant_lines:
      - row_indices: [4, 8] # 1 indexed
        color: 5
  - transformation_regions:
      - region1: rows 1-3
      - region2: rows 5-7
      - region3: rows 9-11
  - output_blocks:
      - size: 3x3
      - colors_source: average_color in the original shape
      - background_color: 0
  - color_map:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
      9: maroon
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Constant Lines:** Recognize the horizontal lines of '5' (grey) pixels at rows 4 and 8 (using 1-based indexing). These lines remain unchanged in the output.

2.  **Divide into Regions:** Divide the input grid into three regions based on the constant lines:
    *   Region 1: Rows 1-3
    *   Region 2: Rows 5-7
    *   Region 3: Rows 9-11

3.  **Process Each Region:** For each of the three regions:
    *   Identify the columns with non-zero values, ignoring the gray '5' columns. Let's call this 'active\_columns'
    *   Create 3x3 blocks with all colors set to 0 and the input columns marked by color '5' are the same in the ouput.
    *   Find the non-zero colors within active columns.
    *   Create a block that combines these colors using a 3x3 block, keeping the relative position.
    *   Fill output for the region with these blocks and zero background.

4.  **Combine Regions:** Combine the processed regions and the constant lines to form the final output grid.
