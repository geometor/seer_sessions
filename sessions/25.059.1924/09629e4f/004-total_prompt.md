Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is the horizontal lines of grey (5) that divide the input and output grids into three equal sections. Within each section, there's a distinct pattern. In the output, it seems like blocks of identical color are formed, replacing the varied colors of the input, while preserving the position relative to the grey dividing lines.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - horizontal_lines:
        color: grey (5)
        positions: [4,8] #row indices
        function: divide the grid into 3 regions
  - name: color_blocks
    type: contiguous regions of identical color
    properties:
      - original_colors: varied
      - transformed_colors:
          top_section: [2,0]
          middle_section: [0,4,3]
          bottom_section: [6,0]
  - name: transformation_rule: "regional color homogenization, keep some color, position inside region"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Dividers:** Locate the two horizontal lines of grey (5) pixels that divide the grid into three equal-height regions (top, middle, and bottom).

2.  **Region-Specific Transformation:**
    *   **Top Region:** Replace the left side of the top region with a 3x3 block of red (2) and keep 5,0 on the right side.
    *   **Middle Region:** Keep the 3x3 block of 5 in the center. Keep a 3x3 block of yellow (4) that is on the left of the 5 block. Keep a 3x3 block of green(3) that is to the right of the five block. Replace all the colors in the first three columns of the region with black(0).
    *   **Bottom Region:** Replace the left side of the top region with a 3x3 block of magenta (6). Keep 5, 0 at the right side.

3.  **Preserve Dividers:** The grey (5) horizontal divider lines remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
