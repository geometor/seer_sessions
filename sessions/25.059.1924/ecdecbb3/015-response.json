The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The input grid seems to have isolated red pixels and horizontal lines of azure pixels. The output grid modifies the arrangement and, in some cases, the color of these pixels. There's a suggestion of both movement and potential interaction between the red and azure elements.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The final output is composed of a the white background, plus the modified pattern of red pixels and blue lines.\n\n"
