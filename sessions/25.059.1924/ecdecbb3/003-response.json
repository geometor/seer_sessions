The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve some interaction between the red and azure pixels, possibly extending or replicating the red pixels and changing the color of certain azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Do this until the top and bottom edges of the grid are reached by the red shape.\n\n3. **Azure Pixel Modification:**\n    * Examine all azure (8) pixels.\n    * If an azure pixel is directly adjacent to a vertically extended red pixel created in step 2 (above, below, to the left, or the right, but not diagonal), change its color to red (2).\n    * Create white pixels (0) between areas of red and azure, if necessary.\n\nIn the ouput, the single horizontal azure line is divided into sections separated by red, and sections of it have been removed/replaced by white (0) pixels.\n"
