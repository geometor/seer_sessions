<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2880x2256 at 0x716635CD8C50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two primary colors: azure (8) and red (2). The input grids contain seemingly isolated instances of these colors, primarily red (2) pixels, and lines of azure (8) pixels. The output grids show a transformation where the red pixels seem to "extend" or "connect" to the nearest azure line, forming a continuous path of red pixels between original red pixels and azure line. The azure pixels seem to act like "anchors" or "targets" for the red pixel extensions. The transformation maintains existing red pixels in place, adds new ones in direct lines toward nearby azure lines. The grids consist mostly of white background pixels (0)

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    shape: single cell
    behavior: extends towards nearest azure line
  - name: azure_line
    color: azure (8)
    shape: horizontal or vertical line of adjacent pixels
    behavior: acts as target for red pixel extension
  - name: background
    color: white(0)
    behavior: passive - remains unchanged unless replaced by extensions

actions:
  - name: extend
    agent: red_pixel
    target: azure_line
    description: create a straight line path of red pixels from an existing red pixel to the nearest azure line

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: red pixels and azure lines are positioned within a 2D grid.
  - type: directional
    description: extension of red pixels happens in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) towards azure.
  - type: proximity
    description:  The path taken by the red pixel extension is the shortest possible to an azure line.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all red (2) pixels and azure (8) lines within the input grid.
2.  **For each red pixel:**
    *   Find the nearest azure line. The nearest line is determined by the shortest number of steps in cardinal directions that are required to reach a pixel that is part of the line
    *   Extend the red pixel towards that line. Do so by replacing the pixels along the shortest path to the azure line by red pixels.
3. **Preserve the existing:** Keep existing azure lines.

This program explains that the existing red pixels create the shortest path of red pixels to the nearest azure lines.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
