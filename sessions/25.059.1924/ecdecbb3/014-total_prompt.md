Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate the two vertical azure (8) lines in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Red:** Find the red (2) region (contiguous horizontal block of red pixels).
3.  **Expand:** Extend the red region horizontally to the left and right until it touches the azure lines.
4.  **Fill Azure:** In the row immediately below the expanded red region, place an azure (8) pixel directly below where the red region *begins* and *ends* its expansion (if those positions are adjacent to the azure columns). Azure pixels are placed only if there's an azure line adjacent to the expansion point. The original azure lines stay.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided training examples and results, along with updated observations and a refined natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core elements: azure lines and a red region. However, the expansion and azure placement logic needs refinement. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Left Expansion:** The red region shouldn't expand *past* the left azure line. The expansion should stop *at* the line.
2.  **Incorrect Right Expansion:** Similar to the left side, expansion to the right needs to stop *at* the right azure line.
3.  **Azure Placement Condition:** The condition for placing azure pixels below the expanded region is too strict and potentially misinterprets adjacency. It should place azure pixels directly below where the original red region *started* and *ended*, but *only* if those positions are inside the azure columns. The original specification has been updated.
4. Missing Handling of Multiple Red Regions.

The strategy to address these is:

1.  **Constrain Expansion:** Modify the expansion loops to ensure they stop at the azure lines, not before or after.
2.  **Revised Azure Placement:** Re-evaluate the conditions of placing azure pixels on the row below. Focus on the original start and end columns of the red region, not the expanded positions.
3. Test all examples and review carefully to revise the specification as
   necessary.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To understand the errors better, let's examine each example:

```python
def report(grid, label):
    print(f"  {label}:")
    print(f"    shape: {grid.shape}")
    # find unique values in grid and count them
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    print(f"    values: { {color: count for color, count in zip(unique, counts)} }")    

def find_vertical_lines(grid, color):
    lines = []
    for col in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if all(grid[:, col] == color):
            lines.append(col)
    return lines

def find_red_region(grid):
    red_region = []
    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[row, col] == 2:
                red_region.append((row, col))
    
    if not red_region:
        return None, None, None

    red_row = red_region[0][0]
    min_col = min(c for r, c in red_region)
    max_col = max(c for r, c in red_region)

    return red_row, min_col, max_col

def summarize_example(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_grid):
    print("Input:")
    report(input_grid, "Input")

    print("\nExpected Output:")
    report(output_grid, "Output")

    print("\nTransformed Output:")
    report(transformed_grid, "Transformed")
    
    azure_lines = find_vertical_lines(input_grid, 8)
    print(f"\nAzure Lines: {azure_lines}")
    red_region = find_red_region(input_grid)
    print(f"Red Region: row={red_region[0]}, start_col={red_region[1]}, end_col={red_region[2]}" if red_region else "Red Region: None")

    print("\nDifferences (Transformed vs Expected):")
    if not np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid):
        diff = (output_grid != transformed_grid)
        print(np.where(diff))
    else:
        print("No differences")

# Load the data and transform
import json
with open('data/training/6855a6e8.json', 'r') as f:
    task = json.load(f)

for i, example in enumerate(task["train"]):
    print(f"\nExample {i+1}:")
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)
    summarize_example(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_grid)
    input("Press Enter to continue...")

```

**Example 1 Analysis:**

-   **Input:** Two azure lines, one red horizontal line.
-   **Expected Output:** Red line expanded to touch azure lines, azure pixels below the original red region's start and end, within the azure columns.
-   **Transformed Output:** Same as Expected
- **Differences:** none.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

-   **Input:** Two azure lines, one red horizontal line.
-   **Expected Output:** Red line expanded, azure pixels placed *only* at the original red start/end columns, but *within* azure columns.
-   **Transformed Output:**
    - The red expansion is too much to the left and right (past the azure line)
    - It looks like the azure fill logic may be correct
-   **Differences:** Many differences in red area and potentially in azure

**Example 3 Analysis:**

-   **Input:** Two azure lines, one red horizontal line.
-   **Expected Output:** Red line expanded, azure pixels below original bounds
-   **Transformed Output:**
    - left expansion is correct
    - right expansion is too much
    - no azure fill was done

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_lines
    type: vertical_line
    color: azure (8)
    count: 2
    properties:
      - constant: true # The azure lines themselves don't change.

  - name: red_region
    type: horizontal_line
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - expandable: true
      - start_col: int
      - end_col: int
      - row: int

actions:
  - name: expand_red_region
    object: red_region
    preconditions:
      - "azure_lines exist"
    action: "Extend red_region horizontally left and right until it touches the corresponding azure_line"

  - name: place_azure_pixels
    object: azure_lines
    preconditions:
      - "red_region exists and has been expanded"
    action: "Place azure (8) pixels on the row immediately below the red_region's original starting and ending columns, but only if within azure lines."
```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Lines:** Locate the two vertical azure (8) lines in the input grid. These lines act as boundaries.
2.  **Locate Red Region:** Find the horizontal red (2) region (a contiguous block of red pixels in a single row). Note its starting column, ending column, and row number.
3.  **Expand Red Region:** Extend the red region horizontally:
    *   **Left:** Extend to the left until the column *of* the left azure line.
    *   **Right:** Extend to the right until the column *of* the right azure line.
4. **Place Azure Markers** On the row immediately below the red region, if the row exists:
    * Place a single azure pixel in the column where the *original* red region began, but only if that column position falls *within* the azure columns.
    * Place a single azure pixel in the column where the *original* red region ended, but only if that column position falls *within* the azure columns.
5.  If there are other, disjoint red regions on other rows, repeat steps 2-4.

Key changes and clarifications in the natural language program:

*   **Expansion Limits:** Explicitly states to expand *to* the azure line (inclusive).
*   **Original Bounds for Azure:** Emphasizes that the azure fill uses the *original* red region's bounds, not the expanded bounds.
* Added step 5 to accommodate possibility of disjoint red regions.
*   **"Within" Azure Columns** Clarifies that azure fills will happen *only* if they occur on the columns which contain the azure lines

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
