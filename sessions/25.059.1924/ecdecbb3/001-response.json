The input grids contain seemingly isolated instances of these colors, primarily red (2) pixels, and lines of azure (8) pixels. The output grids show a transformation where the red pixels seem to \"extend\" or \"connect\" to the nearest azure line, forming a continuous path of red pixels between original red pixels and azure line. The azure pixels seem to act like \"anchors\" or \"targets\" for the red pixel extensions. The transformation maintains existing red pixels in place, adds new ones in direct lines toward nearby azure lines. The grids consist mostly of white background pixels (0)\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
