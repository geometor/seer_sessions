Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves two 10x10 grids. The primary colors present are gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The input grid has a distinct "L" shape of red pixels in the top-right corner. The output grid seems to expand or "smear" this red shape, while also introducing more red pixels in other gray areas of the grid seemingly guided by gray areas adjacent to existing red. It appears the transformation involves some kind of interaction between the red and gray pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - gray (5)
        - red (2)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: expand_red
    description: Red pixels seem to influence neighboring gray pixels.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
    relevance:  The transformation appears to be based on adjacent pixel colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seeds:** Locate all existing red (2) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Expansion:** For each red pixel:
    *   Examine its eight neighboring pixels (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
    *   If a neighboring pixel is gray (5), change it to red (2).

3.  **Iteration**: Repeat Step 2 until it no longer changes anything. One thing I am unsure is the amount of iterations this expansion happens, but in the second iteration it includes gray that was converted to red, so at the least it is until no more changes can be made.

This program describes how red pixels "propagate" to adjacent gray pixels. It's a form of region growing or a cellular automaton-like behavior. The key is the interaction between red and gray, with white acting as a barrier or neutral element.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
