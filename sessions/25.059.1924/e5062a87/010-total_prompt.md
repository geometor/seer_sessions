Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The input and output grids are identical except for a horizontal line of red pixels. In the input, this red line is adjacent to a region of gray pixels. In the output, this same red line has been extended to fill all available space, stopping to the borders.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [0, 2, 5]  # white, red, gray
  - type: line
    properties:
      color: 2 (red)
      orientation: horizontal
      initial_position: row 6, columns 2-5
      final_position: row 6, columns 2-9
      adjacent_color: 5 (gray)

actions:
    - type: extension
      object: line (red pixels in row 6)
      description: The existing red line segment extends to the edge

relationships:
  - adjacency: The red line is adjacent to white spaces on the borders.
  - containment: Pixels are contained within the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target:** Find the horizontal line segment of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Extend:** Extend this segment to the edge.

In essence, the transformation rule is to copy the input into output, taking care to extend every horizontal line segment to the edge, stopping to the borders.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
