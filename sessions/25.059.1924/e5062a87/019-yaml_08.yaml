observations:
  - context: |
      The task involves analyzing pairs of input and output grids.  Each grid consists of pixels with integer values representing colors. The initial hypothesis is that the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid. The analysis confirms this hypothesis.
  - objects:
    - description: Input and Output Grids
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: Integers (0-9) representing colors
        - dimensions: Varying height and width
      count: 2 per example (1 input, 1 output)
    - description: Pixels
      properties:
        - type: Integer values within the grid
        - values: 0-9, representing colors (see COLOR_MAP)
      count: Varies depending on grid dimensions
  - actions:
      - description: Copy
        details: The input grid is copied directly to the output grid. No transformations or modifications are applied.
  - rules:
      - condition: Always
        action: Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
  - verification:
      method: Element-wise comparison of input and output grids.
      result: All training examples showed zero differences, confirming the "no-change" rule.
