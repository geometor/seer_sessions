The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The transformation appears to involve the red (2) pixels, with their positions and/or extent changing based on their initial configuration. It's not a simple mirroring, rotation, or translation. It seems like some kind of replication or propagation of the red pixels is occurring, potentially influenced by their neighboring pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
