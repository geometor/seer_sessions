These are the \"reference colors.\"\n2.  **Locate Target Blocks:** Identify the contiguous blocks of color in the rest of the grid.\n3. **Map Input to Output** For the given input, gray (5) is mapped to blue(1), yellow(4) maps to yellow (4), and orange (7) maps to orange (7). The colors, blue (1), yellow (4), and orange (7) correspond to the reference color on the top row of the input.\n4.  **Replace Colors:** For each block below the top row, replace all the pixels with the value, matching the reference colors on the top row of the input grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation uses the colors in the top row as a key to recolor blocks in the lower part of the grid. The program replaces portions of the lower grid based on the colors present in the first row.\n"
