    - name: map_color
      description: Map colors from the reference row to blocks in other rows.
      input: block, reference_row
      logic: |
        For each block, find the corresponding color in the reference row.
        The correspondence is determined by the horizontal position of the block.
        If the reference color is not black (0), replace the block's color with the reference color.
