Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Gray Region:** Find the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This defines the area to be replaced.
2.  **Identify Top Row Colors:** Determine the unique colors present in the top row of the input grid, excluding white (0). These colors will be used for replacement.
3.  **Determine Replacement Dimensions:**
    *   The height of each replacement region is equal to the height of the gray region.
    *   The width of each replacement region is determined by two factors:
        a.  The total contiguous horizontal span (width) of the color in the input *including colors below the top row*.
        b. the width of the entire gray area. Each colored area is stretched to fit its proportion of the gray area.
4.  **Replace the Gray Region:** Starting from the left, replace vertical sections of the gray region with the identified colors. The order of colors is maintained from left to right as they appear in the top row. The widths are determined as described in step 3.
5. **Remainder of the image** The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
