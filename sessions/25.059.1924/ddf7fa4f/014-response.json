A contiguous block consists of one or more pixels of the same color that are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Black (0) pixels are ignored.\n3.  **Map to Reference:** Each block identified in step 2 is now considered.\n4.  **Horizontal Overlap for Correspondence**: For any given block located below the reference row, compare the column range the block occupies with the reference row values at those columns. The color of the block will be changed to match the non-zero values in the reference row, if and only if, there is overlap. If there are multiple overlapping non-zero values in the reference row, any of the values can be chosen.\n5.  **Replace:** Every pixel within the identified block is replaced with the determined reference color (only if a non-zero color could be identified).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks of the same color in the grid, excluding the top row.\n    \"\"\"\n    blocks = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, block):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        block.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, block)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, block)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, block)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, block)\n\n    for r in range(1, rows):  # Start from the second row\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                color = grid[r, c]\n                if color != 0:\n                    block = []\n                    dfs(r, c, color, block)\n                    if block: # Avoid empty blocks\n                      blocks.append((color, block))\n    return blocks\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
