There are distinct colored regions. A notable gray (5) region exists in the center-left and extends to the middle. There are some single pixels of other colors at the top.\n*   **Output Grid:**  Also a 10x10 grid with the same dimensions as the input. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid. The gray (5) region in the input has been replaced, and other regions take those colors.\n* **Colors**: It is important to convert numerical values to colors, to help discern.\n    *   0: white\n    *   2: red\n    *   5: gray\n    *   6: magenta\n    *   8: azure\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

In this case, these are red (2), magenta (6), and azure (8).\n\n2.  **Locate the Gray Region:** Identify the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.\n\n3.  **Replace Gray with Top Row Colors:**\n    *   Replace the leftmost part of the gray region with a rectangular-like region of red (2). The vertical extent of red region aligns with the full height extent of the original grey region.\n    *   Replace the central part of the gray region with magenta (6) of same dimensions, to the right of the red region.\n    *    Replace the bottom-right part of the grey region with azure (8) of same vertical extent.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of the central gray region remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the transformation involves selectively replacing the gray region based on the colors found in the top row, using a defined spatial pattern (left-to-right and maintaining a block-like structure) with the colors on the top row.\n"
