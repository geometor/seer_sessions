Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to replace the single central white pixel with a cross-shaped arrangement of white pixels, keeping all other pixels red.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by creating a cross of white pixels centered at the original white pixel's location.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find the dimensions of the grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Find the center coordinates.  We assume a single white pixel in input.
    center_row, center_col = np.where(input_grid == 0)
    if len(center_row) > 0:  # Check if a white pixel was found
       center_row, center_col = center_row[0], center_col[0]
    else:
      return output_grid # if no white cell, return original grid
    

    # Create the cross by setting the appropriate pixels to white (0).
    output_grid[center_row, :] = 0  # Set entire row to white
    output_grid[:, center_col] = 0  # Set entire column to white

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
