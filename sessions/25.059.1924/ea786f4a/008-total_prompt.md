Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Center:** Locate the central pixel of the input grid (rows // 2, cols // 2).
2.  **Preserve Center Color:** The color of the central pixel in the output grid is the same as its color in the input grid.
3.  **Surrounding Pixels:** For every other pixel:
    *   If the surrounding pixel is in the same row or column as the central pixel, and immediately adjacent, it should be 1 if its row + col is odd or 0 if its row + col is even.
    * If the surrounding pixel is not adjacent to the center, then it should alternate 0, 1 based on if row+col is even.
    * If the surrounding pixel is the same color as a neighboring pixel that is not the center, change it.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focuses on a "center pixel" concept and an alternating pattern (0, 1) based on row and column indices. While this works for the first example, it fails to generalize to other examples. The core issue is that the logic is too specific to the structure of the first training example and doesn't capture the underlying, more general rule governing the transformations. The "surrounding pixels" logic, especially the adjacency and neighbor checks, is not relevant to all cases, and an overcomplication. We need to step back and re-evaluate the fundamental relationship between the input and output grids without making assumptions based on a single example. The updated approach needs to consider a simpler set of conditions to determine color.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Simplify the Logic:** Remove the complex adjacency and neighbor checks.
2.  **Focus on Row/Col Parity:** The (row + col) % 2 parity seems to be a key, consistent element. However, it needs to be used in the correct context, and the current code *overuses* it.
3.  **Consider the Center Pixel Differently**: While center pixel is preserved in the first example, it is not so in the rest.
4. **Re-evaluate the Conditions**: Rather than a single rule, we probably have 2, based on odd/even parity.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To get accurate reports, I will execute a series of checks for the example inputs/outputs, and report on the results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
