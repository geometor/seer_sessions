**input:**
```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x716635C5DD50>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x716635BE8450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. Most cells are blue (1), with a single white (0) cell in the center.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid. The central cell remains white (0). The surrounding blue cells (1) have been replaced with alternating white (0) and blue (1) cells, forming a checkerboard pattern. The top-left cell changes to white(0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0 # white
        role: center_pixel
        initial_state: [1,1] #row, col index (0 based)
        final_state: [1,1] # remained in the same place

      - value: 1 # blue
        role: surrounding_pixel
        initial_state: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]
        final_state: [[0,1], [1,0], [1,2], [2,1]]

      - value: 0 # white
        role: surrounding_pixel_alternating
        initial_state: [] #Did not exist in input
        final_state:  [[0,0], [0,2], [2,0], [2,2]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve the Center:** The central pixel (at coordinate [1,1]) of the input grid retains its original color (0, white) in the output grid.
2.  **Checkerboard the Surroundings:** All pixels adjacent to the center pixel, including diagonals, are considered. Starting from the top-left corner (\[0,0]) of the input, alternate the color with white (0) and blue(1).

    *   If the sum of row and column is even, change blue(1) in input to white(0) in output.
    *   If the sum of row and column is odd, retain blue(1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
