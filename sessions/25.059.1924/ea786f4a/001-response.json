These digits correspond to colors.\n*   **Output Grids:** Square grids of the same size as their corresponding input grids. The output grids retain the original digit in the center, while some of the other digits are replaced by 0.\n*    **Center Pixel:** The central pixel (where the '0' is initially located in the input) is always preserved.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** A consistent pattern of replacing the input color with '0' (white), while the center pixel keeps it's input value.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
