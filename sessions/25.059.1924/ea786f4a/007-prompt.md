Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Center:** Locate the central pixel of the input grid (rows // 2, cols // 2).
2.  **Preserve Center Color:** The color of the central pixel in the output grid is the same as its color in the input grid.
3.  **Surrounding Pixels:** For every other pixel:
    *   If the surrounding pixel is in the same row or column as the central pixel, and immediately adjacent, it should be 1 if its row + col is odd or 0 if its row + col is even.
    * If the surrounding pixel is not adjacent to the center, then it should alternate 0, 1 based on if row+col is even.
    * If the surrounding pixel is the same color as a neighboring pixel that is not the center, change it.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
