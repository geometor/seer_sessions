This establishes the center point.\n2.  **Create a cross:** In the output grid, change the color of the pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the center pixel to white (value 0).\n3. **Maintain the exterior**: All cells that do not become part of this cross, and were red before, stay the same color, which is red.\n4.  **Center cell**: Change the color of the center pixel to white (value 0).\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to replace the single central white pixel with a cross-shaped arrangement of white pixels, keeping all other pixels red.\n"
