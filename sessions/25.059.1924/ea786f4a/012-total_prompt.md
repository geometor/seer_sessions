Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to replace the single central white pixel with a cross-shaped arrangement of white pixels, keeping all other pixels red.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by creating a cross of white pixels centered at the original white pixel's location.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find the dimensions of the grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Find the center coordinates.  We assume a single white pixel in input.
    center_row, center_col = np.where(input_grid == 0)
    if len(center_row) > 0:  # Check if a white pixel was found
       center_row, center_col = center_row[0], center_col[0]
    else:
      return output_grid # if no white cell, return original grid
    

    # Create the cross by setting the appropriate pixels to white (0).
    output_grid[center_row, :] = 0  # Set entire row to white
    output_grid[:, center_col] = 0  # Set entire column to white

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of replacing a single white pixel with a white cross. However, it made an oversimplification by assuming the cross would *always* span the entire row and column of the white pixel. The test results clearly show this isn't always the case. The size of the cross seems to be related to the overall grid size, but more importantly, the cross is *always* 3x3, centered on the white cell.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:

1.  **Correct the cross creation:** Instead of extending the cross to the edges of the grid, create a fixed-size 3x3 cross centered on the original white pixel.
2.  **Handle edge cases:** Ensure the code doesn't try to access indices outside the grid boundaries when the white pixel is near the edge. The cross should be "truncated" if it would extend beyond the grid.
3. **Verify all red:** Make sure that all non-cross pixels retain original color (red)

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

I will use `print()` statements within a `code_execution` block to analyze each input/output pair and derive some observations, to confirm my hypothesis.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, example_number):
    print(f"--- Example {example_number} ---")
    print(f"Input Grid Shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Output Grid Shape: {output_grid.shape}")

    # Find the white pixel in the input grid
    input_white_pixels = np.where(input_grid == 0)
    print(f"Input White Pixel Coordinates: {list(zip(input_white_pixels[0], input_white_pixels[1]))}")

    # Find the white pixels in the output grid
    output_white_pixels = np.where(output_grid == 0)
    print(f"Output White Pixel Coordinates: {list(zip(output_white_pixels[0], output_white_pixels[1]))}")

    # Check if shapes are the same
    print(f"Input and Output Shapes Match: {input_grid.shape == output_grid.shape}")
    
    # compare that all non-white pixels are red in both input and output
    input_red_pixels = np.where(input_grid == 2)
    output_red_pixels = np.where(output_grid == 2)
    print(f"Input and Output Red Pixels are identical except center: {np.array_equal(input_grid[input_red_pixels], output_grid[output_red_pixels])}")
    


# Provided examples (replace with actual data)
examples = [
    (np.array([[2, 2, 2], [2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]]), np.array([[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2]])),
    (np.array([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]), np.array([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]])),
    (np.array([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]), np.array([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]])),
]

for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):
    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, i + 1)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
