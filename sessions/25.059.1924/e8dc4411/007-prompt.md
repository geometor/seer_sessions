Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find Last Red:** Locate the last position (row, column) of the color '2' (red) within the input grid. If it doesn't exist, the output is the same as the input.
2.  **Extend Diagonally (if Red exists):** Starting from the cell immediately below and to the right of the last red cell's position, change the color of cells to '2' (red) diagonally downwards and to the right.
3.  **Terminate at Edge:** Continue the diagonal extension until either the bottom or right edge of the grid is reached.
4. **Preservation:** All other cells that do not fall under this rule remain the same.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
