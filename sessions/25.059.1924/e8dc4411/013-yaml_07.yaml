observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        green_region: "A contiguous block of green pixels starting at the third row."
        shape: "Roughly triangular, but not perfectly symmetrical."
      output:
        green_expansion: "The green region expands downwards, filling the space below it to the bottom of the grid, maintaining the initial width."
        shape: "Rectangular expansion of the initial green region."
  - example_2:
      input:
        green_region: "A contiguous block of green pixels in the third row."
        shape: "Horizontal line segment."
      output:
        green_expansion: "The green region expands downwards, filling the space below it to the bottom of the grid."
        shape: "Rectangle, maintaining width of initial green region."
  - example_3:
      input:
        green_region: "A contiguous block of green pixels in the third row."
        shape: "Horizontal line segment."
      output:
        green_expansion: "The green region expands downwards, filling the space below it."
        shape: "Rectangle, maintaining width of initial green region."
  - example_4:
      input:
      	green_region: "a single green pixel in the second row"
      output:
        green_expansion: "The green region expands downwards by one row"
