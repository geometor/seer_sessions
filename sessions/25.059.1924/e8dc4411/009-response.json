The dominant color is blue (1). There's a small \"cross\" shape formed by white (0) pixels, with a green (3) pixel at its center. The transformation seems to involve replicating the green pixel and expanding it downwards and possibly sideways, replacing blue pixels. The shape and extent of expansion is not immediately obvious, but it does not appear to simply flood-fill, there's some constraint or structure.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Expand the green pixel downwards. For each row below the original green pixel, extend the green color outwards by one pixel on each side (left and right). This creates a widening, inverted triangle or pyramid shape.\n4.  Replace the blue(1) with the new green(3).\n\nIn summary: Locate a centered shape, identify its central color pixel, expand the central pixel downwards, and potentially, sideways, replacing the background. The expansion rule appears to follow an inverted triangle. More examples are needed to confirm expansion rule.\n"
