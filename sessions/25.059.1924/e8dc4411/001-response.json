The primary change seems to revolve around a \"cross\" shape formed by white (0) pixels. The background color, which can vary (blue, azure, or yellow), changes around this cross, creating a diagonal pattern of the background color that extends outwards from cross.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n"
