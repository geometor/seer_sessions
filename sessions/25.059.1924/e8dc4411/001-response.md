Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Task Elements**

The task involves transforming grids of colored pixels. The primary change seems to revolve around a "cross" shape formed by white (0) pixels. The background color, which can vary (blue, azure, or yellow), changes around this cross, creating a diagonal pattern of the background color that extends outwards from cross.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: cross
    properties:
      shape: "+"
      color: white (0)
      description: A contiguous block of white pixels forming a plus shape.
    actions:
      - identified: The center and arms of the cross are located.
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: varies (blue=1, azure=8, yellow=4)
      description: The initial color of the majority of the grid.
    actions:
      - changed: Modified around the cross.
  - object: diagonal_lines
    properties:
      color: same as background
      direction: Emanating outwards from red cross pixels
      description: lines of the same color of the background
    actions:
      - created: the new color and where it exists
  - relationships:
    - The diagonal lines originate at, and expand outwards from, the non-white pixels inside the cross.
    - The background color is maintained, except in cells.
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the "cross" shape:** Locate the contiguous block of white (0) pixels that form a "+" shape within the input grid.

2.  **Identify cross neighbors:** Find the colors that appear in the cross shape.

3.  **Identify the background color:** Determine the color that occupies the majority of the grid, excluding the cross.

4.  **Propagate color changes:** Iterate over cross colored pixels. Extend the color diagonally outwards.

5. **Return Grid**
