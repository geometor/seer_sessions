            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extending a red diagonal line from the last red pixel. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. It appears that the presence of an *existing* diagonal line of red pixels dictates where the new diagonal line is drawn. The new diagonal always starts one row and one column to the right of the last pixel of *any* existing red diagonal and extends downwards and to the right. The core concept of extending diagonally is correct, but the trigger condition (starting point) needs adjustment. My strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Verify Existing Diagonals:** Modify the logic to correctly identify *existing* red diagonal lines, not just the last red pixel.\n2.  **Precise Starting Point:** Accurately determine the correct starting position for the new diagonal based on the *end* of the identified diagonal.\n3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Ensure the code behaves correctly when no red diagonal is present, or at grid boundaries.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**\n\nI'll analyze each example to verify assumptions. Due to the interface I'll explain what would have been done if there was code execution.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input has a single red pixel.\n    *   Output extends a red diagonal from that pixel.\n    *   **Observation:** The initial logic works for a single red pixel as a base case.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: last red `(1,1)` output: diagonal at `(2,2)`\n    *   Output extends a red diagonal down and to the right.\n    * Observation: all seems fine.\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: last red `(0,4)` output: diagonal at `(1,5)`\n    *   Output extends a red diagonal down and to the right.\n    * Observation: all seems fine.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The transformation extends a red diagonal line downwards and to the right.\n  - condition: |\n      The starting point for the new diagonal is determined by existing red diagonals.\n  - starting_point_rule: |\n      If a red diagonal exists, the new diagonal starts one row down and one column to the right of the last pixel of that red diagonal.\n  - extension_rule: |\n       The red diagonal extends downwards and to the right until the edge of the grid is reached.\n  - color_preservation: |\n       Pixels not part of the extended diagonal retain their original color.\n  - no_diagonal_case: |\n       If there is no diagonal the input grid equals output grid.\n  - diagonal_definition: |\n      A diagonal is defined as contiguous red pixels extending downwards and to the right.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Existing Red Diagonals:** Examine the input grid to find any existing diagonal lines of red (color 2) pixels. A diagonal is a sequence of contiguous red pixels extending downwards and to the right.\n2.  **Determine Starting Point:**\n    *   If no red diagonal is found, the input grid is returned as is.\n    *   If a red diagonal *is* found, locate the last pixel (bottom-rightmost) of that diagonal. The new diagonal will start one row below and one column to the right of this pixel.\n3.  **Extend New Diagonal:** Starting from the determined starting point, change the color of cells to red (color 2) diagonally downwards and to the right.\n4.  **Terminate at Edge:** Continue this diagonal extension until either the bottom edge or the right edge of the grid is reached.\n5. **Preservation:** All other cells that do not fall under this rule remain the same from the input.\n"
