facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation extends a red diagonal line downwards and to the right.
  - condition: |
      The starting point for the new diagonal is determined by existing red diagonals.
  - starting_point_rule: |
      If a red diagonal exists, the new diagonal starts one row down and one column to the right of the last pixel of that red diagonal.
  - extension_rule: |
       The red diagonal extends downwards and to the right until the edge of the grid is reached.
  - color_preservation: |
       Pixels not part of the extended diagonal retain their original color.
  - no_diagonal_case: |
       If there is no diagonal the input grid equals output grid.
  - diagonal_definition: |
      A diagonal is defined as contiguous red pixels extending downwards and to the right.
