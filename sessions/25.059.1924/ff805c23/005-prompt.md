Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extract a 5x5 subgrid from the upper-left corner of the input grid and keep only pixels of color 0 and 3.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a 5x5 array filled with 0s (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the 5x5 region in the upper-left corner of the input
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            # Check if the pixel's color in the input grid is 0 or 3
            if input_grid[i][j] == 0 or input_grid[i][j] == 3:
                # If so, copy the pixel to the output grid
                output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]
            else:
                # if not, pixel becomes 0
                output_grid[i][j] = 0

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
