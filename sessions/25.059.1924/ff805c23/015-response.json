Here's my analysis of the transformation:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input grid appears to contain multiple colors, primarily green (3), grey (5), and blue (1), with some white (0). The output grid is significantly smaller and only contains grey (5) and white (0). The output seems to be a drastically simplified and reduced version of a section of the input. The output retains a shape and pattern of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
