The output is a much smaller, simpler grid primarily composed of the color 6 (magenta), with a few strategically placed 0s (white). The output seems to be a highly abstracted representation of the input, focusing on a specific region and color. The input grid appears to have regions of colors, and perhaps there is a region of 6 that is used to define the extents of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This region's boundary may not be a perfect rectangle of color 6, but color 6 defines a boundary. It appears this region also contains colors 1, and 8.\n\n2. **Extract Dimensions:**  Determine the width and height of a rectangular box that would completely enclose this region. The example shows a 5x5 region.\n\n3. **Create the Output Grid:** Create a new grid of output color (6, magenta). The size is related to a bounding box around a region of interest in the input.\n\n4. **Populate the Output:** Fill every cell of the new grid with the default output color, which is 6.\n\n5.  **Exceptions**: Check if any pixels within the extracted region in the *input* grid are color 0 (white).\n\n6. **Apply Exceptions:** Copy the value of 0 from the corresponding position in the region from the *input* grid to the *output* grid.\n\n7.  **Complete:** If all exceptions are applied, stop. The output grid is complete.\n"
