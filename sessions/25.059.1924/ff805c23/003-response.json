The output is a much smaller grid (5x5). The colors in the output seem to be a subset of those in the input, specifically colors 0 (white) and 3 (green) appear prominently, with color 2 being removed. The most prominent change is the significant reduction in size and simplification of the shapes. The output grid captures the upper left corner area, and the shapes of color '3' in the input appear to translate to the smaller output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, all colors other than white and green are eliminated, effectively isolating only the upper left green shape and surrounding white pixels.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates a specific region (top-left) and filters based on color, keeping only white and green.
