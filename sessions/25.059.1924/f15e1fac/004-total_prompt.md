Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are:

*   **0 (white):**  The background color, and appears to be the most frequent.
*   **8 (azure):**  Forms a pattern, seemingly a vertical line repeated across the grid.
* **2 (red):** Appears only as single pixels in seemingly fixed positions on the y-axis

The transformation appears to involve adding azure (8) in a specific pattern relative to existing azure and red pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 17
      columns: 12
      cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - red (2)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: add_color
    properties:
        color: azure(8)
        position: relative to existing azure and red
        pattern: repeating

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Azure pixels are added adjacent to existing azure pixels.
  - type: constant positioning
    description: Red maintains at a constant y-axis positioning.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Existing Elements:** Locate all existing azure (8) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Red row selection:** For all rows that have a red(2) pixel, perform step 3, else perform step 4.
3.  **Red Row Azure Addition:** In the rows that contain a Red(2) pixel. For every azure(8) pixel, add an azure(8) in every cell below it, extending the 'line' of azure color down to the bottom of the grid.
4.  **Azure Addition:** For every column that contains azure, extend the lowest azure pixel down to the end of the column
.
5. **Result:** Maintain the Red pixels in their original Y position, regardless of other changes.

In simpler terms: It appears that the vertical lines of azure are maintained. In rows without red, the line stops at the lowest original azure. In the rows with red, the vertical line stops at the end of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
