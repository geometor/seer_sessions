Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Azure Columns:** Find all columns in the input grid that contain at least one azure (8) pixel.
2. **Diagonal Check:** If all azure pixels are on a diagonal line (where row index + column index = constant), move each azure pixel to the main diagonal (where row index = column index). The position of the red pixels is disregarded.
3. **Column Extension (if not diagonal):** If the azure pixels are *not* on a diagonal, and are all in the same column:
    *   Find the lowest row index containing an azure pixel in the identified column.
    *   Add one additional azure pixel immediately below.
    * If adding below will exceed the bounds, do nothing.
    * Ignore the red pixels.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
