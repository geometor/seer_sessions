<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2304x2256 at 0x71663D5B2DD0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on object perception, relationships, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors. The primary colors observed are:

*   **0 (White):** Background or empty space.
*   **8 (Azure):** Appears to be a significant object or part of a pattern.
* **2 (Red):** Appears to act like a marker, always at the bottom.
* **Background changes:** The position of the azure (8) pixels and red(2) pixels are different in the input and the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    color: 8 (azure)
    properties:
      - initial_positions: variable
      - final_positions: patterned

  - object: red_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    color: 2 (red)
    properties:
      - initial_positions: bottom_row
      - final_positions: bottom_row
      - count_input: two, always
      - count_output: two, always

  - object: grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, changes between examples
      - background: 0 (white)

  - actions:
      - copy: Every input pixel seems to have a place in the output
      - shift: azure pixels are moved
      - maintain: red pixels stay in the bottom row

  - relationships:
      - azure_red_rows : Input azure rows are added on top of the red rows.
      - azure_red_cols: Input azure cols are added next to red cols.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Observe the input grid and identify the azure (8) pixels and the red (2) pixels. Note the dimensions of the input grid.

2.  **Azure Pixel Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each column of the input grid. If a column contains azure pixels copy them to a column of the output.
    *   Iterate through each row of the input grid. If a row contains azure pixels copy them to a row of the output.
    *   The number of azure pixels in a row or column is maintained.

3.  **Red Pixel Preservation:**
    *   Locate any Red Pixels.
    *   Maintain those pixels in the output, but do not change the structure of the grid - the last row of the output will contain the same red pixels as the last row of the input.

4.  **Output:** The final output grid combines the azure pixels and any red pixels from the bottom row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
