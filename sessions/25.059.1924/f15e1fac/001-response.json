The primary colors observed are:\n\n*   **0 (White):** Background or empty space.\n*   **8 (Azure):** Appears to be a significant object or part of a pattern.\n* **2 (Red):** Appears to act like a marker, always at the bottom.\n* **Background changes:** The position of the azure (8) pixels and red(2) pixels are different in the input and the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note the dimensions of the input grid.\n\n2.  **Azure Pixel Transformation:**\n    *   Iterate through each column of the input grid. If a column contains azure pixels copy them to a column of the output.\n    *   Iterate through each row of the input grid. If a row contains azure pixels copy them to a row of the output.\n    *   The number of azure pixels in a row or column is maintained.\n\n3.  **Red Pixel Preservation:**\n    *   Locate any Red Pixels.\n    *   Maintain those pixels in the output, but do not change the structure of the grid - the last row of the output will contain the same red pixels as the last row of the input.\n\n4.  **Output:** The final output grid combines the azure pixels and any red pixels from the bottom row.\n"
