*   **`azure_columns`:** `[2, 3]`
*   **`is_diagonal`:** `False`
*   **Actual Output:**  The input grid, unchanged.
* **Analysis**: The current logic does *not* handle this. The `is_diagonal` check fails (correctly), and it's not a single column, so nothing happens, and the input is returned unchanged.
