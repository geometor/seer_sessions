Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (22x21) filled primarily with the color green (3). Inside, there's a nested structure: a large square of azure (8), within which is a smaller square of red (2), and finally, a single blue (1) pixel in the very center of the red square. The output is a much smaller grid (7x7) that seems to be a zoomed-in and cropped version of the central part of the input, retaining the nested structure of azure, red, and blue, but significantly reduced in size, and with the green border also reduced. The core structure appears to center around the blue (1) pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    color: green (3)
    shape: grid
    size: large
  - name: outer_square
    color: azure (8)
    shape: square
    size: large
    relation: surrounds inner_square
  - name: inner_square
    color: red (2)
    shape: square
    size: medium
    relation: surrounded by outer_square, surrounds center_pixel
  - name: center_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    shape: single pixel
    size: small
    relation: surrounded by inner_square
  - name: output_grid
    shape: grid
    size: small
    relation: cropped and zoomed representation of input grid's center
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center:** Locate the single blue (1) pixel within the input grid. This serves as the anchor point.
2.  **Define Inner Square:** Identify the red (2) square immediately surrounding the blue pixel.
3. **Define Outer square:** Identify the larger azure (8) square.
4.  **Crop and Zoom:** Create a new 7x7 grid.
5.  **Reconstruct:**
    *   Place the blue (1) pixel in the center of the new grid (4,4).
    * The red square will take a 3x3 area around the central blue pixel.
    * The azure square will be a 5x5 area, surrounding the red square.
    *   Place azure (8) pixels adjacent to the central red square in all directions (above, below, left, and right) so the final shape is a 5 x 5 square
    *   Fill the remaining outer border of the 7x7 grid with green (3) pixels.
6. The final grid will be centered on the original single blue pixel position, resized to a 7x7 grid with a single blue pixel surrounded by nested red squares.

In short it is cropping the area based on a single pixel and resizing it to be a 7x7 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
