The output is a small 3x3 grid, representing a simplified version of the input. The output grid contains a single magenta pixel (6) in the center, surrounded by gray pixels (5). It appears the output is a highly reduced representation of the central feature of the input. The main object in the input is a centrally-placed rectangle made of magenta color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
