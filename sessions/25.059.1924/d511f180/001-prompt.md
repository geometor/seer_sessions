**INSTRUCTIONS**

above is an example pair for a task

this is your opportunity to perceive the underlying logic that transforms the
input into the output

respond with the following deliverables:

- your perception of the elements of the task
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, actions performed on them, and the relationships between them
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.


your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a conversation
