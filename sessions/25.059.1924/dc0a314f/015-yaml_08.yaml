facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    size: 16x16
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    size: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: significant size reduction from input to output
  - observation: output colors are a subset of input colors
  - observation: Spatial relationships in the input are somewhat preserved, but greatly simplified, in the output.
  - action: selection
    description: Specific pixels or regions from the input are chosen.
  - action: compression
    description: input is transformed into a much small output
  - relationship: output_grid is a compressed_representation of input_grid
