The output is a significantly smaller grid, also composed of colored pixels. The colors in the output grid seem to be a subset of the colors present in the input grid. There's no obvious geometric transformation (like rotation, scaling, or reflection). It appears the output might be a \"distilled\" or \"summarized\" version of a specific region within the input. The shape and precise position of this extracted area aren't immediately clear, it is likely a sub-grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The exact rule for choosing the region needs to be defined based on other examples, but it looks like there is a 3x3 green square surrounded by azure in the original image and that region is used to extract surrounding pixels of the 5x5 area.\n2.  **Extract Sub-Grid:** Extract the pixel values within this 5x5 target region.\n3.  **Output:** The extracted 5x5 sub-grid becomes the output. The key, it seems, is that the 5x5 grid appears at the center, and colors in the extracted subgrid correspond to same positions from the target region within the original input.\n\nThe core concept is the extraction of a specific sub-grid. The challenge lies in defining the rule that determines *which* 5x5 sub-grid is chosen. This might involve looking for specific color patterns, shapes, or a combination of criteria.\n"
