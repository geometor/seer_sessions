observations:
  - task: "0d3d703e"
  - objects:
      - color: magenta (6)
        role: primary
        behavior: "remains unchanged"
      - color: gray (5)
        role: secondary
        behavior: "becomes magenta if diagonally adjacent to magenta; otherwise, becomes white"
      - color: other
        role: other
        behavior: becomes white
  - transformation_rules:
      - rule_1: "Magenta pixels in the input remain magenta in the output."
      - rule_2: "Gray pixels diagonally adjacent to magenta pixels become magenta in the output."
      - rule_3: "All other pixels (including gray pixels not diagonally adjacent to magenta, and all non-magenta, non-gray pixels) become white in the output."
  - overall_logic: "The transformation preserves magenta and conditionally propagates it to diagonally adjacent gray pixels, turning everything else white."
