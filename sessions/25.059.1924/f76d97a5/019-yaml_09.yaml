examples:
  - example_id: 1
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels are replaced by white (0) pixels, except when diagonally adjacent to maroon (9) pixels.
      - The code's output matches the expected output.

  - example_id: 2
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels are sometimes replaced by White (0).
      - Maroon (9) does not appear.
      - Azure (8) pixels are present. One Gray (5) is diagonally adjacent to an Azure (8) and is *not* transformed.
      - Code output and example output are different.

  - example_id: 3
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels are sometimes replaced by White (0).
      - Maroon (9) does not appear.
      - Azure (8) pixels are present. Three Gray (5) are diagonally adjacent to an Azure (8) and is *not* transformed.
      - Code output and example output are different.
