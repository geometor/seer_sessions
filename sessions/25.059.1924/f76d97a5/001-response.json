The core challenge lies in discerning which pixels change color and which remain the same, based on their original color and possibly their spatial relationship with other pixels.\n\nVisually, it appears that one color is being replaced by black (0), while another remains. The selection of which one to eliminate seems to be based on its frequency or proximity to other similar colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Replace all instances of color `5` in the input grid with color `0`.\n3.  **Preserve Other Color** The other color in input grid will persist to output grid.\n\nIn summary - The transformation rule is to replace all pixels of color 5 with color 0, and keep all other pixels.\n"
