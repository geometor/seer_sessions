**input:**
```

9 9 5 5 9
9 5 9 9 9

**output:**
```

0 9 0 0 0

0 0 0 9 9

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains the digits '9' (maroon) and '5' (gray). The output grid contains '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The transformation seems to involve replacing some, but not all, instances of '5' with '0'. The positions of '9' appear to be important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: cell
    properties:
      value: integer
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: replace
    properties:
      original_value: 5
      new_value: 0
    conditions:
      - "if the cell's value is 5, and a cell with value 9 is in the direct diagonal positions to it, keep the value as 9, otherwise change value to 0"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Cells share a border (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)."
  - type: diagonal
    description: "Whether two cells are diagonally placed"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the cell's value is 5.
3.  **If** the cells value is 5, then check it's diagonal positions, if the diagonal cells have value 9, do not transform it.
4.  **Else,** If the cell's value is 5 (and the condition above is not met), change its value to 0.
5.  **If** the cell's value is not 5, leave it unchanged.
6.  **Output** the modified grid.

In short terms, the 5s are replaced by 0s, unless they're diagonally adjacent to 9.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
