**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The core challenge lies in discerning which pixels change color and which remain the same, based on their original color and possibly their spatial relationship with other pixels.

Visually, it appears that one color is being replaced by black (0), while another remains. The selection of which one to eliminate seems to be based on its frequency or proximity to other similar colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - domain: 2D grid
  - objects: pixels
  - attributes:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - actions:
      - change_color: (pixel, new_color)
  - relations:
      - adjacent: (pixel1, pixel2)
  - transformations:
      - color_replacement:
          - from_color: variable
          - to_color: 0
      - color_preservation:
          - preserved_color: variable
  - observations:
      - example_1:
            input_colors: [4, 5]
            output_color_replaced: 5
            output_color_preserved: 4
      - example_2:
            input_colors: [5, 6]
            output_color_replaced: 5
            output_color_preserved: 6
      - example_3:
            input_colors: [9, 5]
            output_color_replaced: 5
            output_color_preserved: 9
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct Colors:** Determine the unique colors present in the input grid. There will be two colors.
2.  **Color Replacement Rule:**
    In all three input/output examples one color is consistently turning into 0. This is the color `5`. Replace all instances of color `5` in the input grid with color `0`.
3.  **Preserve Other Color** The other color in input grid will persist to output grid.

In summary - The transformation rule is to replace all pixels of color 5 with color 0, and keep all other pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
