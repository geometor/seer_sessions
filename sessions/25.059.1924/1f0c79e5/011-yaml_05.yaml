example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: green
        shape: cluster
        position: top-left
  output:
    objects:
      - color: green
        shape: L-shape
        position: extends to bottom-right
example_2:
  input:
    objects: []
  output:
    objects: []
example_3:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: green
        shape: cluster
        position: top-left, not extending to edge
  output:
    objects:
      - color: green
        shape: cluster, with extra pixels
        position: original cluster, plus line below and two pixels to the right

  transformation:
    - description: Add green pixels based on initial green cluster.
    - details: |
        If a green cluster exists, extend it by adding green
        pixels.  Add pixels directly below each original green pixel.
        Also, add two pixels to the right.  The original green
        pixels should be unchanged.
