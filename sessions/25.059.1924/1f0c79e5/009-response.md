Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 9x9 grid with a small cluster of non-zero pixels. Specifically, there's a green (3) 2x1 vertical object and an adjacent red (2) pixel to its right. The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid. The original green object seems to have "grown" or expanded diagonally downwards and to the right, creating a 3x3 green square at the bottom. The single red pixel in the input disappears, and instead replaced by a sequence of green pixels which create the diagonal shape. The original object has moved to a different corner.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: green_cluster
    type: contiguous_block
    color: green (3)
    initial_shape: 2x1 rectangle
    initial_position: (row=1, col=2)
    final_shape: 3x3 square rotated
    final_position: bottom_right_corner

  - object: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: (row=2, col=3)
    final_state: disappears

  - grid:
    size: 9x9
    background: white (0)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of non-zero pixels in the input grid (excluding single pixels).
2.  **Locate** bottom-right corner of the grid.
3. The green cluster will transform to the L shape rotated.
4. The red pixel is to be ignored, its replaced by another green pixel in the transformation.
5. The object will move to the bottom-right corner, filling its final shape to form an L.

In essence, the transformation involves changing the green cluster into an "L" shape that fills from its starting position to the bottom right of the grid. Other single pixels are removed.
