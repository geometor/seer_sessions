Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9), which represent colors. The input grid contains a small cluster of non-zero pixels (yellow and red) surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to have a larger, connected shape of only yellow pixels. The red pixel in the input is gone in the output. The position of the yellow shape has shifted.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: cluster
    type: contiguous block of non-zero pixels
    properties:
      - color: initially, yellow (4) and red (2)
      - shape: irregular
  - name: background
    type: contiguous block of zero pixels
    properties:
     - color: white (0)

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: original grid
    output: modified grid
    operations:
      - change_color:  red(2) becomes yellow(4)
      - expand: the yellow cluster grows to form a 3x3 square
      - shift: the yellow square appears centered horizontally and starts near the top

relationships:
  - cluster is_within grid
  - background is_within grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.
2.  **Change Red to Yellow:**  If there's a red (2) pixel, change its color to yellow (4).
3. **Center:** Imagine the smallest bounding square that can contain a 3x3 object within the 9x9 grid.
4.  **Create a 3x3 Yellow Square:** Create a filled 3x3 square of yellow (4) pixels.
5.  **Fill the Background:** Fill the rest of the grid, all remaining pixels, with 0 (white).

Essentially, the transformation identifies a colored region, converts all non-zero pixel to yellow, and replaces that region with a 3x3 yellow square near the top of the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
