The cluster is a 2x2 block with one orange pixel.\n*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid with a more complex pattern of orange (7) and white (0) pixels. The orange pixels seem to form some kind of inverted L shapes, and the overall arrangement has changed substantially.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation is not a simple geometric manipulation (like rotation or reflection). The core object (2x2 block) seems to be a source of a pattern generation, but the orange pixel in the input plays a vital role to determine the final layout in the output.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
