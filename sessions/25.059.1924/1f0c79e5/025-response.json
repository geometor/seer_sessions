            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed to draw an orange \"E\" in the top-left corner of the output grid, regardless of the input. This approach worked for the first example because the output happened to be just that. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the output size can vary and doesn't always match the input size, and that the \"E\" shape is the defining characteristic. The strategy, therefore, needs to shift from *drawing* an \"E\" at a fixed location to *constructing* an \"E\" of a predefined size, irrespective of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid will be determined by the size of the 'E' shape (7x3), if shape is always 'E'.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the code execution results:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input (5x5), Expected Output (7x3), Actual Output (5x5) - Correct \"E\" shape, but incorrect output dimensions.\n*   **Example 2:** Input (11x11), Expected Output (7x3), Actual Output (11x11) - Correct \"E\" shape, but incorrect output dimensions.\n*   **Example 3:** Input (14x14), Expected Output (7x3), Actual Output (14x14) - Correct \"E\" shape, but incorrect output dimensions.\n\nKey observation is all Expected outputs have (7x3) orange \"E\" shape, independent of input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_type: shape_construction\n  - shape: \"E\"\n  - color: orange\n  - output_size: fixed (7x3)\n  - input_size: variable, irrelevant to output\n  - background_color: white\n  - shape_elements:\n    - vertical_line:\n        length: 7\n        start: (0, 0)\n    - top_horizontal_line:\n        length: 3\n        start: (0, 0)\n    - middle_horizontal_line:\n        length: 3\n        start: (3, 0)\n    - bottom_horizontal_line:\n        length: 3\n        start: (6, 0)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Ignore Input:** The input grid's content and size are irrelevant.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 7x3 grid filled with white pixels (value 0). This will be the output grid.\n3.  **Construct 'E' Shape:** Construct an orange (value 7) \"E\" shape within the output grid as follows:\n    *   **Vertical Line:** Draw a vertical line of 7 pixels in the first column (column 0).\n    *   **Top Line:**  Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the top of the vertical line (row 0).\n    *   **Middle Line:** Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the 4th pixel down the vertical line (row 3).\n    *   **Bottom Line:** Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the bottom of the vertical line (row 6).\n4.  **Return Output:** The 7x3 grid with the orange \"E\" is the final output.\n"
