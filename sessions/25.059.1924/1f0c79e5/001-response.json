The input grids consistently show a small cluster of 2-4 non-zero pixels, often including the value '2', and surrounded by zeros. The crucial observation is that one of the non-zero colors in the input becomes the \"fill\" color in the output. The '2' pixels, when present, seem to disappear, suggesting a potential role as a marker or boundary. The output grids exhibit a larger, diagonally-oriented, connected region of a single non-zero color, expanding from approximately the original non-zero pixel cluster's location. The shape is not a simple geometric form like a square or circle.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"

This cluster typically contains 2-4 pixels.\n2. **Select Fill Color:** From the colors within the identified pixel cluster, choose one color as the \"fill color\". Exclude '2' if present. If '2' is one of the colors other than one repeating color, then the other color adjacent to '2' will be the fill color.\n3. **Expand Region:** Starting from the approximate location of the original pixel cluster, create a diagonally-oriented connected region of the fill color. This region expands outwards, replacing '0' pixels.\u00a0The region expands to fill almost half the image, but always in the same diagonally-oriented connected pattern. Pixels with value '2' in the input are treated the same way as '0' value pixels in this region growth.\n4. **Produce Output:** Create the output grid with the expanded fill region and the remaining pixels set to '0'.\n\nEssentially the repeated color is the fill color.\n"
