Previous Code:
```python
"""
Locate any 2x2 square within the input grid, regardless of the colors.  The output grid will have a diagonal of magenta color, positioned along the line y=-x of the grid. All other cells will be blank (white, value=0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a zero-filled array of the same size as the input.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through all possible positions in the output grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the current position is on the main diagonal (y = -x <=> i + j = rows -1)
            if i + j == rows - 1:
                output_grid[i, j] = 6  # Set the diagonal pixels to magenta (6)

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
