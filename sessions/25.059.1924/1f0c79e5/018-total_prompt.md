Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies a 2x2 colored square in the input grid, reflects and inverts it across the line y = -x, 
changes all non-white pixels in the reflected region to magenta (6), and then places that shape along the y = -x line.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_colored_square(grid):
    # Find the 2x2 square of non-white pixels
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for i in range(rows - 1):
        for j in range(cols - 1):
            if grid[i, j] != 0 and grid[i+1, j] != 0 and grid[i, j+1] != 0 and grid[i+1, j+1] != 0:
                return (i, j)
    return None

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid, but filled with 0s
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Find the top-left coordinates of the 2x2 colored square
    start_row, start_col = find_colored_square(input_grid)

    # Reflect, invert and recolor the 2x2 square and fill along y = -x
    if start_row is not None:  # Ensure we found a square
       for i in range(rows):
           for j in range(cols):
               if i + j == rows -1 :
                    output_grid[i,j] = 6

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example, focusing on a 2x2 colored square, reflection, inversion, and magenta recoloring along the line y = -x. However, the execution results on the other training examples reveal that this hypothesis is incorrect and incomplete. The code fails to capture the actual transformation rule, producing mostly empty grids or lines.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to identify the actual transformation occurring, paying close attention to all objects and colors.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns or rules that apply across all examples, even if the initial hypothesis was wrong.
3. **Discard and Rebuild:** Be ready to completley discard the initial hypothesis in light of the example data.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately describe the observed transformation.
5.  **Test and Iterate:** Run more experiments to check assumptions.

**Example Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the transformations, I'll use a conceptual approach to analyze each example. Let's denote input grids as `IN` and output grids as `OUT`.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   `IN`: Contains a 2x2 square of colors (blue, green, yellow, red).
    *   `OUT`: Shows a diagonal line of magenta pixels.
    *   `Result`: Partially correct in creating the magenta diagonal, but missed the core transformation logic.
*   **Example 2:**

    *   `IN`: Contains a 2x2 cyan (8) square
    *    `OUT`: Shows a diagonal line of magenta
    *   `Result`: Partially correct in creating the magenta diagonal, but missed the core transformation logic.
*    **Example 3**
    *    `IN`: Contains a 2x2 grid of blue
    *    `OUT`: Shows a diangonal line of magenta
    *    `Result`: Partially correct in creating the magenta diagonal, but missed the core transformation logic.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - shape: 2x2 square
          colors: [blue, green, yellow, red]
          position: varies
      output_objects:
        - shape: diagonal line
          color: magenta
          position: y = -x
      transformation: "Input 2x2 square is reduced to a magenta diagonal line at y = -x."
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - shape: 2x2 square
          colors: [cyan]
          position: varies
      output_objects:
        - shape: diagonal line
          color: magenta
          position: y = -x
      transformation: "Input 2x2 square is reduced to a magenta diagonal line at y = -x."
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
         - shape: 2x2 square
           colors: [blue]
           position: varies
      output_objects:
        - shape: diagonal line
          color: magenta
          position: y = -x
      transformation: "Input 2x2 square is reduced to a magenta diagonal line at y = -x"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate any 2x2 square within the input grid, regardless of the colors.
2.  The output grid will have a diagonal of magenta color, positioned along with the line y=-x of the grid.
3. All other cells will be blank (white, value=0).

**Revised assessment**:

The examples show the presence of 2x2 squares.
The program identifies that and correctly transforms a line in the output at the y=-x line.

The program needs to be improved to better reflect the fact that the input grid
may have different shapes, while the output shape is always a diagonal line.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
