      - variable dimensions
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:

actions:
  - name: find_non_zero_pixels
    description: Locate all pixels in the input_grid that are not 0.
  - name: create_yellow_square
    description: Create a 3x3 square of yellow pixels.
  - name: center_square
    description: Position the yellow_square so its center aligns with the non_zero_pixel's location.
  - name: bounds_check
    description: make sure the yellow square doesn't leave the grid, if it does, "push" the square to the edge.
