The input grid contains a small cluster of non-zero pixels (yellow and red) surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to have a larger, connected shape of only yellow pixels. The red pixel in the input is gone in the output. The position of the yellow shape has shifted.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
