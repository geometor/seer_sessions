1.  **Identify Green Pixels**: Locate all pixels with a value of 3 (green) within the input grid.
2.  **Determine the Overall Center**: Calculate the center of the input grid using its dimensions (height and width).
3.  **Transform Based on Quadrant**: For each green pixel:
    *   If the pixel is in the top-left or on the top or left edge, relative to the calculated center, change its color to magenta (6).
    *    If the pixel is in the top-right or bottom-left, change its color to blue (1).
    *   If the pixel is the bottom-right, or on the bottom or right edge, relative to the center, change its color to red (2).
4.  **Output**: The output grid is the input grid with the green pixels transformed according to the quadrant rule.
