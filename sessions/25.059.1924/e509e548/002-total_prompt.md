<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2944x2512 at 0x716635BE8250>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, a YAML block for facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be the consistent transformation of green (3) shapes in the input to different colored shapes in the output. The shapes maintain their general form but change color and possibly orientation.  The background (0, white) remains unchanged. Different shapes seem to consistently map to different colors. It is also worth noting that the overall structure of the connected shapes are preserved during transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: Shape_1
    type: Connected Component
    input_color: 3 (green)
    output_color: Varies (1-blue, 2-red, 6-magenta)
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - changes_color
      - maintains_shape

  - name: Background
    type: Background
    input_color: 0 (white)
    output_color: 0 (white)
    properties:
      - static

actions:
    - name: Recolor
      agent: System
      target: Shape_1
      result: output shape with color from mapping based on shape ID

relationships:
  - type: Input-Output
    subject: Shape_1 (Input)
    object: Shape_1 (Output)
    relation: color_transformed

  - type: Spatial
    subject: Shape_1
    object: Background
    relation: surrounded_by
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate all connected components (shapes) of green (value 3) pixels in the input grid. Each distinct connected component will be treated as a separate object.

2.  **Determine Output Color based on shape id**:
    *   If the shape looks similar to a reversed "L", change the color to red (2).
    *   If the shape is a horizontal or vertical line, change to blue (1).
    *   If the shape looks like "U", change the color to magenta (6).

3.  **Recolor Shapes:** For each identified shape:
    *   Replace all pixels of color green (3) with respective new colors.

4.  **Preserve Background:** Leave all pixels with a value of 0 (white) unchanged.

5.  **Output:** Create an output grid identical in dimensions to the input grid, with recolored shapes and the unchanged background.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
