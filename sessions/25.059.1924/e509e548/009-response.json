The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The primary colors involved appear to be green (3) in the input, and blue (1), magenta (6), and red (2) in the output. It seems like the transformation involves recoloring connected regions of green pixels in the input to distinct colors in the output. The background color white (0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Contiguous means connected orthogonally (up, down, left, or right).\n\n2.  **Recolor Regions:** For each identified green region:\n    *   If the region is at the top left of the image (the leftmost pixel in the region has x and y coordinates that are lesser or equal to all pixels), change all its pixels to blue (1).\n    *   If the region is at the bottom left of the image, change all its pixels to red (2).\n    *   If the region is at the top right of the image, change its pixels to magenta(6).\n    *    All white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the program detects separate green areas and recolors each one based on its position within the grid.\n"
