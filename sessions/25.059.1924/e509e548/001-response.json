The shapes maintain their general form but change color and possibly orientation.  The background (0, white) remains unchanged. Different shapes seem to consistently map to different colors. It is also worth noting that the overall structure of the connected shapes are preserved during transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
