Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The primary color observed is white (0) and yellow (4). The input grid appears to have a sparsely populated "L" shaped object made of yellow pixels. The output grid has a denser, more compact structure of yellow pixels and seems to be combining and rotating a mirrored version of the input structure

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape1
    type: connected_component
    color: 4 (yellow)
    initial_position:
      row_min: 1
      row_max: 3
      col_min: 3
      col_max: 5
    shape_description: "L-shaped"

actions:
  - type: copy_and_rotate
    object_id: shape1
    rotation: 90 degrees counter clockwise
  - type: combine
    object_id: original and rotated shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Object:** Locate the connected component of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This forms an "L" shape.
2. **Copy, Flip and Rotate:** Create a copy of L shape. Rotate the copy by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3. **Combine:** arrange the original shape such that the single pixel extends to the left, if the original shape does not have an extension to the left, then extend a single pixel up, and flip the rotated image and align it below and to the left, removing all empty rows and columns.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
