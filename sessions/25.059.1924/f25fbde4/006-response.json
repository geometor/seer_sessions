A cross is defined as a central pixel with four \"arms\" extending outwards in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The arms can be of any length (including zero, meaning just the center pixel is present). There will only be one cross.\n2.  Extend the Arms:**  For each arm of the cross, extend it outwards in its respective direction until it reaches the edge of the input grid. This extension should maintain a straight line and be composed of yellow pixels.\n3. **Create the Filled Rectangle:** Create a filled rectangle using yellow (value 4) from the extents of each arm.\n4.  **Crop:** Remove any rows or columns on the edges of the grid that are entirely composed of white pixels (value 0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_cross_center(grid):\n    # Find the center pixel of the cross.\n    yellow_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 4)\n    if len(yellow_pixels) == 0:\n        return None\n\n    # Calculate the centroid of yellow pixels\n    center_y = int(np.round(np.mean(yellow_pixels[:, 0])))\n    center_x = int(np.round(np.mean(yellow_pixels[:, 1])))\n\n    # Verify it's a valid cross center (check for neighbors in four directions)\n    # A very loose definition of a cross, but good enough for this challenge\n    if (center_y > 0 and grid[center_y - 1, center_x] == 4) or \\\n       (center_y < grid.shape[0] - 1 and grid[center_y + 1, center_x] == 4) or\\\n       (center_x > 0 and grid[center_y, center_x - 1] == 4) or \\\n       (center_x < grid.shape[1] - 1 and grid[center_y, center_x + 1] == 4):\n        return (center_y, center_x)\n    return None\n\ndef extend_arms(grid, center):\n    # Extend the arms of the cross to the edges of the grid.\n    if center is None:\n        return None\n    \n    center_y, center_x = center\n    grid_height, grid_width = grid.shape\n    \n    # Create a new grid filled with yellow within the bounds, copy existing pixels\n    extended_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n\n    # Find the extents of the cross arms\n    min_y, max_y = center_y, center_y\n    min_x, max_x = center_x, center_x\n\n    # Extend up\n    for y in range(center_y, -1, -1):\n        if grid[y, center_x] == 4:\n           min_y = y\n        else:\n            break\n\n    # Extend down\n    for y in range(center_y, grid_height):\n        if grid[y, center_x] == 4:\n           max_y = y\n        else:\n            break\n\n    # Extend left\n    for x in range(center_x, -1, -1):\n        if grid[center_y, x] == 4:\n            min_x = x\n        else:\n            break\n\n    # Extend right\n    for x in range(center_x, grid_width):\n        if grid[center_y, x] == 4:\n            max_x = x\n        else:\n            break\n\n    #fill extents with yellow\n    extended_grid[min_y:max_y+1, min_x:max_x+1] = 4\n\n    return extended_grid\n\ndef crop_grid(grid):\n    # Crop empty (all zero) rows and cols\n    rows_to_keep = np.any(grid != 0, axis=1)\n    cols_to_keep = np.any(grid != 0, axis=0)\n    cropped_grid = grid[rows_to_keep][:, cols_to_keep]\n    return cropped_grid\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array.\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the center of the cross.\n    cross_center = find_cross_center(input_grid)\n\n    # Extend the arms of the cross.\n    extended_grid = extend_arms(input_grid, cross_center)\n    \n    if extended_grid is None:\n        return np.array([])\n\n    # Crop the grid.\n    output_grid = crop_grid(extended_grid)\n    \n    return output_grid\n```"
