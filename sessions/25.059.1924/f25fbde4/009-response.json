The primary color observed is white (0) and yellow (4). The input grid appears to have a sparsely populated \"L\" shaped object made of yellow pixels. The output grid has a denser, more compact structure of yellow pixels and seems to be combining and rotating a mirrored version of the input structure\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Rotate the copy by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n3. **Combine:** arrange the original shape such that the single pixel extends to the left, if the original shape does not have an extension to the left, then extend a single pixel up, and flip the rotated image and align it below and to the left, removing all empty rows and columns.\n\n"
