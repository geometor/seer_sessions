The primary object appears to be a contiguous shape formed by yellow pixels. The transformation seems to involve manipulating this yellow shape. The size of the output grid is smaller (fewer rows/columns) than the input grid in all of the examples given so far. The transformation expands the input yellow object down and to the right (or up and to the left depending on one's interpretation) and alters the shape to more resemble a filled rectangle.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
