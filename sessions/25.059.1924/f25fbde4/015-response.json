The primary color involved in the transformation is yellow (represented by the number 4). The input grid contains a seemingly irregular shape composed of yellow pixels, while the output grid contains a larger, more structured shape, still composed of yellow pixels.  The white background (0) seems to be passive in the transformation. It looks like the yellow shape expands in some manner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This defines the initial shape.\n\n2.  **Determine the bounding rectangle:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the yellow pixels. This effectively creates a bounding box around the initial shape.\n\n3.  **Create the base of the new shape:**\n    - create new shape based on height and width of original.\n    - new shape row count = original shape height + 1.\n    - new shape column count = original shape width +1.\n\n4. **Fill and Expand:**\n    -   copy original shape into top left of new shape\n    -   replicate the new shape's top row, one column to the left, and append to the left of the shape\n    - replicate the new shapes's first two rows and append below\n    -   result is an output grid with this larger rectangle of '4's.\n"
