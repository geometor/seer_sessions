The input grids are generally larger and more complex than the output grids. The colors used vary across examples but seem to be consistent within each input/output pair. There's a clear reduction in size and complexity from input to output, suggesting some form of simplification or extraction. A key observation is that a large portion of the input grid, consisting of a single repeating color is being removed. The remaining parts are reshaped, repositioned, or cropped.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This color represents the background.\n2. **Remove the Background:** Eliminate all pixels of the background color from the input grid.\n3. **Crop/Extract remaining parts:** Isolate remaining parts of the grid that have other colors, removing empty rows and columns.\n4. Keep relative position of the foreground objects.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the non-background regions, creating a much smaller, condensed output grid containing only the \"interesting\" or non-uniform parts of the input. The relative positions/shapes of foreground objects seems to be preserved.\n"
