    general_rule: "Copy the last non-background pixel from each row of the right half to the last column of the left half."
    objects:
      - description: "Pixels in the right half of the grid, excluding those with the background color (8/azure)."
        properties:
          color: "Varies (1/blue, 2/red, 3/green, etc.)"
          shape: "Single pixel"
          position: "Relative to the right half of the grid"
    actions:
      - description: "Identify the rightmost non-background pixel in each row of the right half."
        details: "If a row contains multiple non-background pixels, only the rightmost one is considered.  If a row has no non-background pixels, no action is taken for that row."
      - description: "Copy the identified pixel's color to the corresponding row in the last column of the left half."
        details: "The left half's dimensions determine the output grid's size. The copied pixel's row position is maintained."
