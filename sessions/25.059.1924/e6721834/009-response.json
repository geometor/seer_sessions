The input grid appears to be divided into two main regions: a magenta (6) region on the left and a blue (1) region on the right. Within these regions, there are smaller, irregular shapes of different colors (green (3), azure (8), red (2)). The output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version of the input, focusing primarily on the right-hand side (blue region) of the input grid. The left side appears to become all 1s.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The left will be considered the magenta region, although other colors may be inside, and the right region will be the blue region.\n2. **Focus on Blue Region:** Disregard/remove the section of the input left of the boundary.\n3.  **Condense:** Project the remaining right side blue region of the input into a smaller grid.\n4. Recolor left to 1s. The left region looks like it becomes solid 1s in all rows.\n5. Preserve Colors: condense the input, but maintain all colors besides 6 to the right of the boundary, and setting all values left of the boundary to 1.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the right-hand side of the input, maintaining colors other than the background 6, condenses, and recolors the other side to the same color as the background on the right.\n"
