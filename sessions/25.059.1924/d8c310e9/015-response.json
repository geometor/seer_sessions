The colors present are white (0), yellow (4), green (3), and red (2). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x15). The primary change appears to be a horizontal mirroring or reflection of a subset of the non-white pixels, specifically within the colored area. The white pixels seem to act as a background and aren't involved in the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the colored region:** Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the grid. In this specific example, it is bounded from row index 2 (inclusive) to 4 (inclusive). The column indices differ from row to row.\n2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Within each row of the colored region, reflect or mirror the colored pixels horizontally. This reflection needs to be performed taking into consideration, the rightmost extent of the object. Let's analyze row-wise:\n    *   **Row 3**:\n        *   Input has yellow at index 0, and two yellows starting at index 5.\n        *   Output has two yellows starting at index 5 and two yellows starting at index 10. It appears that there is an insertion on the right, mirroring, the two yellows at index 5\n    *   **Row 4**:\n        *   Input is `4 3 0 0 3 4 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n        *   Output is `4 3 0 0 3 4 4 3 0 0 3 4 4 3 0`. The part `3 4 4 3` starting at index 5 has been mirrored and inserted starting at index 10\n    *   **Row 5**:\n        *  Input: 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n        *  Output: 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2. Similar to row 4, the segment `3 4 4 3 2` has been mirrored, and inserted on the right.\n3.  **Preserve Background:** The white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies segments of colored pixels within the colored area and mirrors and appends them at the right edge of each row.\n\n"
