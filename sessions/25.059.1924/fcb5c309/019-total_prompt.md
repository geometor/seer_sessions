Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Target:** Find all pixels of the target color (red, denoted as 2) within the input grid.
2. **Check for Target Presence:** If no pixels of the target color are found, return an output grid that matches the input grid size and is entirely filled with the background color (white, denoted as 0).
3. **Bounding Box:** If target color pixels are present, determine the bounding box around the target pixels.
4. **Extract Target Object**: Create new grid using the bounding box.
5. **Reduce:** Create an output grid where the dimensions are equal to the dimensions of the extracted grid from the previous step.
6. **Transfer and set color**: Copy the extracted grid to the output grid.
7. **Replace non target:** Replace all non-target color pixels in the output grid with the background color (white, 0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
