objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9] (representing different colors)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: variable, but generally forms a bounding box
  - name: target_color
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: varies per example (4, 3, then 2)

actions:
  - name: identify_target_color
    description: Determine the color that defines the bounding box.
  - name: find_bounding_box
    description: Locate the outermost positions of the target color in the input grid.
  - name: create_output
    description: Generate an output grid where all pixels within the bounding box are filled with the target color, except for the inner '0' pixels.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains target_color
  - output_grid is a bounding_box representation of target_color in input_grid
