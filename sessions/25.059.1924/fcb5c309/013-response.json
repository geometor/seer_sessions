However, the flood fill logic has a critical flaw: it doesn't correctly identify enclosed regions. It appears to be treating *any* non-green pixel as a candidate for filling, rather than only those enclosed *within* the green boundary. The core issue is that the flood fill isn't constrained by the initial green shape and is bleeding out. The temporary grid approach was an attempt to address this, but the implementation has not done so correctly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Constrain Flood Fill:** The key is to correctly identify the \"exterior\" versus the \"interior\" of the green shape.  We can accomplish this most reliably by performing a flood fill from outside of the bounding box first, this will identify all pixels outside the boundary.\n2.  **Correct Interior Identification:** After filling the exterior, any remaining non-green pixels within the bounding box must be *inside* the shape.\n3.  **Refine Flood Fill Logic**: ensure it only fills the region it starts within.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo generate precise reports, I'll use a simplified version of the provided code (because I can't actually execute the full code here), focusing on extracting key information: bounding box dimensions, enclosed region detection, and comparing the output with the expected result. Since I can't execute the *full* original code, I can't calculate pixel-by-pixel differences. Instead, I will focus on high level conceptual differences based on provided example data.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_green_pixel_coords(grid):\n    return np.argwhere(grid == 3)\n\ndef get_bounding_box(coords):\n    if len(coords) == 0:\n        return 0, -1, 0, -1\n    min_row = np.min(coords[:, 0])\n    max_row = np.max(coords[:, 0])\n    min_col = np.min(coords[:, 1])\n    max_col = np.max(coords[:, 1])\n    return min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col\n\ndef simplified_transform(input_grid):\n    green_coords = get_green_pixel_coords(np.array(input_grid))\n    min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = get_bounding_box(green_coords)\n    output_height = max_row - min_row + 1\n    output_width = max_col - min_col + 1\n    \n    #Simplified concept: Does the input have any non-green pixels inside the bounding box?\n    has_interior = False\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    if output_height > 2 and output_width > 2:  #Bounding box must have an interior\n       for r in range(min_row + 1, max_row):\n           for c in range(min_col+1,max_col):\n               if input_np[r,c] != 3:\n                   has_interior = True\n    \n    return {\n        \"bounding_box\": (output_height, output_width),\n        \"has_interior\": has_interior\n    }\n\nexamples = [\n    ([[3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3]], [[3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3]]),\n    ([[3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3]], [[3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3]]),\n    ([[3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]], [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]),\n    ([[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]], [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]),\n    ([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])]\n]\n\nresults = [simplified_transform(input) for input, _ in examples]\n\nfor i, (input, expected) in enumerate(examples):\n    result = results[i]\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input:\\n {np.array(input)}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected Output:\\n {np.array(expected)}\")\n    print(f\"  Bounding Box (Height, Width): {result['bounding_box']}\")\n    print(f\"  Has Interior (Correct Detection): {result['has_interior'] == (np.array(input) != np.array(expected)).any()}\") #
