  The task involves creating a border around a grid and preserving  interior, non-white pixel values.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    description: The original grid of pixel values.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Variable, based on the input.
      - values: Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors.

  - name: output_grid
    description: The transformed grid of pixel values.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Identical to the input_grid.
      - values: Modified based on the transformation rules.

  - name: border_pixels
    description: Pixels on the outermost edge of the grid.
    properties:
        - original_value: any
        - new_value: 4 (yellow)

  - name: inner_pixels
    description: all the pixels that are not on the border
    properties:
      - original_value:
          - if 0 (white): The value remains 0 (white)
          - if not 0: value is unchanged

actions:
  - name: create_border
    description: Fill the outermost pixels of the output_grid with yellow (4).
    input: input_grid dimensions
    output: output_grid with modified border

  - name: transform_inner_pixels
    description: >
      Iterate through inner pixels. If input value is 0 (white) leave it as 0 (white).
      If input value is non-zero, keep that value in output.
