task: fill_enclosed_regions
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: green_shape
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - shape: irregular, contiguous
      - role: boundary for enclosed regions
  - name: enclosed_region
    properties:
      - color: initially varies, changes to white (0)
      - location: within the green_shape boundary
      - definition:  pixels not part of the green_shape, but completely surrounded by it
actions:
  - name: identify_green_shape
    input: grid
    output: coordinates of green pixels
  - name: determine_bounding_box
    input: coordinates of green pixels
    output: minimum and maximum row and column indices
  - name: identify_exterior
    input: bounding box, grid
    process: flood fill from outside the box with a temporary color (-1)
  - name: identify_enclosed
    input: result of exterior fill
    process:  Pixels within bounding box, that are not green and not exterior are interior.
  - name: fill_enclosed_regions
    input: grid, enclosed regions
    output: modified grid with enclosed regions filled with white (0)
