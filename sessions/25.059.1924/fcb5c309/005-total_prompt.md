Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Outermost Yellows:** In the input grid, locate all yellow (4) pixels. Among these, identify the ones that form the extreme top, bottom, left, and right boundaries.

2.  **Construct Bounding Box:** From those outermost yellow pixels create a rectangle that is defined by those extremes. In the case of this specific example the box's corners appear to be defined by the outermost yellow pixel.

3.  **Fill and Render:** Create a new grid. Make the border (exterior pixels) of the grid yellow. If the corresponding pixel in the input grid is yellow, or is inside the bounding box, make it yellow. Otherwise make the pixel in the output grid white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
