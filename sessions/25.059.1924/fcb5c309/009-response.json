The output is a significantly smaller grid, also of colored pixels. The dominant colors in the input are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). The output grid consists primarily of green (3) with some white (0). It appears that the output grid is derived from a compressed or summarized version of the input grid, focusing on the green (3) pixels. The shape of the output grid seems to be determined by an outline, possibly the convex hull, of the green pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The green pixels don't need to be contiguous, but they define the external shape.\n3. **Create Output:** Create output grid from identified boundary.\n4. **Fill Outline:** Set all pixels within and on the outline to the color green (3).\n5. **Fill Inside** Set all pixels within the outline, to the color white (0)\n\nIn simple terms, the transformation identifies all green pixels in the input, creates an outline that contains them, and then creates a new grid filled with green, with the inside area of the outline as white.\n"
