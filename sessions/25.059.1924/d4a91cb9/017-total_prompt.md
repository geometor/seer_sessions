Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation draws an L-shaped yellow line (4) connecting an azure pixel (8) to a position adjacent to a red pixel (2).
The azure and red pixels remain in their original positions. The L shape is formed by first drawing a vertical line upwards from the
azure pixel and stopping one row above the red pixel. Then a horizontal line to the right from the end of the vertical line,
stopping at the column where the red pixel is.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
