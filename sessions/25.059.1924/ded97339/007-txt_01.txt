Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is azure (8), draw a vertical strip of azure pixels in the output grid. The strip starts at the row of the found azure pixel and extends to the last row of the output grid. The column remains the same. The pixels which are not part of any azure strips, initiated by the rule above, should all be white (color 0).
