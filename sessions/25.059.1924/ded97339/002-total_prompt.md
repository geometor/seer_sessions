<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2048x1360 at 0x716635BEA450>Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where cells have one of two values: 0 (white) or 8 (azure). The transformation seems to involve connecting the azure pixels (8) in the input grid to form a continuous, connected shape in the output grid. The shape appears to be formed by extending lines horizontally and vertically from the existing azure pixels. The lines extend until all azure colored are "connected", where connected means they can be reached by tracing along azure pixels using only horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal, movement. It also seems that they extend towards the left/right before they extend up/down.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: 10
      - height: 10
      - cells:
          values: [0, 8]
          colors:
            0: white
            8: azure

  - name: azure_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - value: 8

actions:
  - name: connect_pixels
    description: Extend azure lines horizontally and vertically to connect all azure pixels.
    constraints:
      - extension_directions: [horizontal, vertical]
      - connection_type: orthogonal (not diagonal)

relationships:
    - type: connectivity
      description: Azure pixels are connected in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure pixels (value 8) in the input grid.
2.  **Extend** lines of azure pixels horizontally from each identified azure pixel. Extend to the left first until a boundary is reached (another azure or edge of grid), then to right.
3. **Extend** a single vertical azure down for any unconnected azure until it connects.
4.  **Repeat** steps 2-3 until all azure pixels are connected by a single contiguous shape of azure pixels. The shape is formed only by horizontal and vertical lines; diagonal connections are not allowed.
5. **Ensure** the output has the shape that connects the disconnected azure.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
