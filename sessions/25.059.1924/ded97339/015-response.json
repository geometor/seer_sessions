The primary color involved is azure (8), with the background being white (0). The azure pixels appear to be isolated in the input, while in the output, some azure pixels connect to form horizontal lines. The positions of the initial azure pixels seem to be preserved. The transformation involves extending the azure pixels horizontally, but not necessarily filling all gaps, and only connecting pixels in rows where there are isolated azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
