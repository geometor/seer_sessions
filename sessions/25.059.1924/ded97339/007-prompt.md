Previous Code:
```python
"""
Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0) pixels. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is azure (8), draw a vertical strip of azure pixels in the output grid. The strip starts at the row of the found azure pixel and extends to the last row of the output grid. The column remains the same. The pixels which are not part of any azure strips, initiated by the rule above, should all be white (color 0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as all white with the same dimensions as input_grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
    for row_index, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        for col_index, pixel_value in enumerate(row):
            # Check if the pixel is azure (8).
            if pixel_value == 8:
                # Create a vertical strip downwards.
                for r in range(row_index, len(input_grid)):
                    output_grid[r][col_index] = 8

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
