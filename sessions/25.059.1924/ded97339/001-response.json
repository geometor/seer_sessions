The transformation seems to involve connecting the azure pixels (8) in the input grid to form a continuous, connected shape in the output grid. The shape appears to be formed by extending lines horizontally and vertically from the existing azure pixels. The lines extend until all azure colored are \"connected\", where connected means they can be reached by tracing along azure pixels using only horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal, movement. It also seems that they extend towards the left/right before they extend up/down.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
