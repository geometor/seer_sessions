Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 10x10 grids. The primary color involved is azure (8), with the background being white (0). The azure pixels appear to be isolated in the input, while in the output, some azure pixels connect to form horizontal lines. The positions of the initial azure pixels seem to be preserved. The transformation involves extending the azure pixels horizontally, but not necessarily filling all gaps, and only connecting pixels in rows where there are isolated azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    color_values:
      - 0 (white)
      - 8 (azure)
    properties:
      - position (row, column)

actions:
  - name: extend_horizontally
    object: azure pixel
    condition: presence of other azure pixels in the same row
    constraints:
      - extend to the left and/or right
      - maintain original azure pixel positions
      - connects azure pixels inside rows

relationships:
  - input: grid of pixels with isolated azure pixels
  - output: grid of pixels where original isolated azure pixels from same rows extend horizontally, to combine to one object per row, if row has isolated azure pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Process Each Row:** For each row in the grid:
    *   Check for Azure Pixels: Determine if the current row contains any azure pixels.
    *   If single azure pixel is found, go to next row.
    *   If any azure pixels are detected in the row: extend each group of isolated azure pixels horizontally to combine isolated pixels in the same row, forming a continuous horizontal line of azure pixels between the original pixels.
3. **Maintain all original object positions**, including original azure pixel positions.
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

In essence, the program identifies rows with multiple disconnected, isolated azure pixels, and connects the azure pixels in that row by filling in the spaces between them with more azure pixels. Rows that do not have at least two azure pixels at the start are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
