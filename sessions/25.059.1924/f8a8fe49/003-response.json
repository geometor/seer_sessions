The input grid appears to contain two distinct objects: a larger \"ring\" shape made of red (2) pixels, and a smaller, somewhat irregular shape inside the ring made of gray (5) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement or swapping of these objects/shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
