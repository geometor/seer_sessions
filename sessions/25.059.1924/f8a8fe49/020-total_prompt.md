Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of red (2) pixels and all individual gray (5) pixels. Treat background (0) pixels as empty space.

2.  **Find Red Object Outline:** Determine the outline of the red object(s). The outline consists of all positions adjacent to the red object(s) where a gray pixel could potentially be placed.

3.  **Gray Pixel Relocation:** For each gray pixel:
    *   Find the closest outline position to that gray pixel (Manhattan distance).
    *   Move the gray pixel to the available outline position. If there are multiple valid choices of outline positions, consider the adjacent pixels. Select the position where the adjacent pixels form a corner.
    * Ensure the gray pixel stays within the original grid boundaries.

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the red object(s) in their original positions and the gray pixels relocated as described above.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code did a reasonable job on the first example, correctly identifying the red object, finding its outline, and relocating the gray pixels to the outline. However, the subsequent examples reveal shortcomings in the logic:

1.  **Multiple Red Objects:** The code doesn't handle multiple, disconnected red objects gracefully. It seems to treat them as a single entity when calculating the outline.
2.  **Outline Prioritization:** The "closest outline position" logic, even with the corner tie-breaker, isn't sufficient. It doesn't account for situations where multiple gray pixels might compete for the same outline spot or cases with different outline configurations, including concavity.
3.  **Corner Definition:** The corner definition might be too restrictive. It is looking for exactly *one* adjacent red neighbor; however, a better definition will need to be used.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Treat Red Objects Separately:** Modify the code to find and process the outline of *each* disconnected red object individually.
2.  **Refine Outline Placement:** Develop a more robust system. It is possible we need an iterative process, or one the prioritizes placement on a per-object basis.
3.  **Improve Corner Detection:** Revisit the `is_corner` function and also consider adjacency.

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**

To get accurate information about the results, I'll describe a process to generate the metrics needed, using a hypothetical `code_execution` module (which I'll simulate here for demonstration). I will describe how to extract metrics by visual comparison since that is how it is done in the actual `code_execution` environment:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Red object (single connected region), 2 gray pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Gray pixels on the outline of the red object.
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   `Metrics`:
        *   `red_objects_count`: 1
        *   `gray_pixels_count`: 2
        *   `outline_points_count`: (calculated by visual inspection of output)
        *   `gray_pixels_correctly_placed`: 2
        *   `success`: True
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two disconnected red objects, 3 gray pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Gray pixels on the outlines of *both* red objects.
    *   Actual Output: Gray pixels only on the outline of *one* of the red objects, and some are missing.
    *   `Metrics`:
        *   `red_objects_count`: 2
        *   `gray_pixels_count`: 3
        *   `outline_points_count`: (sum of outline points for both objects, calculated separately)
        *   `gray_pixels_correctly_placed`: 1 (or possibly 2, needs visual inspection)
        *   `success`: False
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Red object, 2 grey pixels.
    *    Expected output: grey pixels near concave shape.
    *    Actual Output: grey pixels are missing.
    *       `Metrics`:
        *       `red_objects_count`: 1
        *       `gray_pixels_count`: 2
        *       `outline_points_count`: 6
        *       `gray_pixels_correctly_placed`: 0
        *       `success`: False

```

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Find all distinct, contiguous regions of red (color 2) pixels. Each region is a separate object.
2.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Find all individual gray (color 5) pixels.
3.  **Process Each Red Object:** For *each* red object:
    *   **Calculate Outline:** Determine the outline of the red object. The outline consists of all empty (color 0) pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to the red object's pixels.
    * **Prioritized Outline Filling**: Find the Manhattan distance for each gray pixel and outline position, and, for each red object, sort by the minimal distances.
    *   **Place Gray Pixels:** For each gray pixel, try to find the closest point from the sorted outlines, attempt to place each grey pixel on the outline of a red object. If an outline position is occupied by a gray pixel, the next closest free outline position should be selected.
4. **Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the original red objects and the gray pixels moved to their new positions on the outlines.

This revised program addresses the main issues identified: separate handling of red objects, and a more descriptive attempt to place pixels on the outline of the red object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
