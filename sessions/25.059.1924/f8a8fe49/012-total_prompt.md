The gray pixels are mirrored across the vertical axis of the 'H' and then moved to form single vertical lines of four pixels on the immediate outer sides of the red structure's vertical lines.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved moving gray pixels (5) located *inside* a red 'H' structure to the *outside* of the 'H', mirrored across the vertical axis. The code does a reasonable job of identifying the 'H' structure and the gray pixels. However, testing the transformation on other examples reveals a significant limitation: it only considers gray pixels *inside* the "H" and has a hard coded placement for the moved pixels. The other examples may have different arrangements or might not involve an "H" at all. The hard-coded positioning of the moved gray pixels is also a clear issue, as it doesn't generalize.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden Scope:** The code needs to be generalized to consider *all* gray pixels, not just those inside a specific red structure (if any). We must consider the entire input grid and not restrict the logic to cases where a red 'H' is present.
2.  **Dynamic Placement:** The new position of gray pixels should be determined relative to their *original* position and potentially other features (like the red pixels), but it shouldn't be hardcoded to specific rows. The current conditional placement logic (if r == min\_row + 2, etc.) is incorrect.
3.  **Consider Other Colors:** While the initial example focused on red and gray, we should verify if other colors play a role in the transformation, or if the rule applies universally regardless of other colors present. The examples suggest that the rule is more complex.
4. **Identify Correct Transformation:** It appears the transformation is more about moving gray pixels based on adjacency to red pixel patterns that are similar but not exactly the same.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a description of the input/output grids, and whether the `transform` function produced the correct output. I will describe what *should* happen based on visual inspection, and compare it to what the code *did*.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A red 'H' shape with four gray pixels inside.
*   **Expected Output:** The gray pixels are moved to the outside of the 'H', forming vertical lines adjacent to the 'H's vertical bars.
*   **Actual Output:** Correct.
*   **Metrics**:
    *   Input shape: (10, 11)
    *   Output shape: (10, 11)
    *   Number of gray pixels (input): 4
    *   Number of gray pixels (output): 4
    *   Number of red pixels (input): 7
    *   Number of red pixels (output): 7

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** A red shape resembling two vertical bars connected at the bottom. Four gray pixels are between the bars.
*   **Expected Output:** The gray pixels move to the outside of the red structure.
*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect. The code only works for an 'H' shape. The gray pixels aren't moved correctly because their relative positions are different.
*   **Metrics**:
    *   Input shape: (9, 8)
    *   Output shape: (9, 8)
    *   Number of gray pixels (input): 4
    *   Number of gray pixels (output): 4
    *   Number of red pixels (input): 6
    *   Number of red pixels (output): 6

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Similar to example 2, a red shape with two almost vertical lines, connected near the middle. Four gray pixels are between the red lines.
*   **Expected Output:** The gray pixels move outside the red structure.
*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect. Same reason as example 2.
*   **Metrics**:
    *   Input shape: (9, 9)
    *   Output shape: (9, 9)
    *   Number of gray pixels (input): 4
    *   Number of gray pixels (output): 4
    *   Number of red pixels (input): 6
    *   Number of red pixels (output): 6
**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: H
      pixels: 7
    - color: gray
      shape: scattered
      pixels: 4
  output_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: H
      pixels: 7
    - color: gray
      shape: two vertical lines
      pixels: 4
  transformation: Gray pixels inside the red 'H' are moved to the outside, forming vertical lines adjacent to the 'H's vertical bars.
example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: two vertical bars connected at bottom
      pixels: 6
    - color: gray
      shape: scattered
      pixels: 4
  output_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: two vertical bars connected at bottom
      pixels: 6
    - color: gray
      shape: two vertical lines
      pixels: 4
  transformation: Gray pixels between the red bars are moved to the immediate outside, forming short vertical lines.
example_3:
  input_objects:
   - color: red
     shape: two vertical bars, connected near middle
     pixels: 6
   - color: gray
     shape: scattered
     pixels: 4
  output_objects:
   - color: red
     shape: two vertical bars, connected near middle
     pixels: 6
   - color: gray
     shape: two vertical lines
     pixels: 4
  transformation: Gray pixels between the red bars are moved to the immediate outside, forming short vertical lines.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Structures:** Locate contiguous areas of red pixels. These form the reference structures.
2.  **Identify Gray Pixels and their Relation to Red Structures:** Find all gray pixels. Determine if these gray pixels are located *between* two "mostly vertical" sections of the red structure.
3. **Reposition Gray Pixels:**
    *   Gray pixels that are found between nearly verticle red structure sections are moved.
    *   The gray pixels that are moved are repositioned one column to the left of the left red section and one column to the right of the right red section.
    * The moved gray pixels form vertical lines adjacent to and outside of the red structure's almost vertical bars. The height of these vertical lines is equal to the number of gray pixels that are between vertical bars in the original input.

This revised natural language program provides a more general and accurate description of the transformation, moving away from the overly specific "H" shape and hardcoded positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
