Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially mostly white (0). There are two primary colors present: red (2) and gray (5). The red pixels form two vertical lines, like pillars, and two horizontal lines connecting them at the top and bottom, resembling a closed rectangular shape or a stylized "H".  The gray pixels appear to be inside this "H" shape, arranged in two vertical groups. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or movement of the gray pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_structure
    type: shape
    color: red
    description: Two vertical lines connected at top and bottom, forming a closed, H-like structure.
    initial_position: Centered in the grid.
  - id: gray_pixels_group1
    type: group
    color: gray
    description: A vertical arrangement of gray pixels.
    initial_position:  Inside the red structure, slightly to the left of center.
  - id: gray_pixels_group2
    type: group
    color: gray
    description: A vertical arrangement of gray pixels.
    initial_position: Inside the red structure, slightly to the right of center.

actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description: Gray pixel groups move.
    object: gray_pixels_group1, gray_pixels_group2
    details: The gray pixels are mirrored along an assumed vertical center line within the red structure and moved to the edges

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: The gray pixels are initially contained within the red structure.
  - type: mirroring
    description: original location of gray pixels in mirrored inside of the red stucture
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the red structure:** Locate the two red vertical lines and the connecting horizontal lines. This forms the boundaries for the transformation.
2.  **Locate gray:** Identify the two groups of gray pixels inside.
3. **Mirror:** The gray pixels are mirrored over the vertical axis of symmetry within the red shape.
4.  **Move and combine Gray Pixels:** all gray pixels move to the outside of the red stucture. Pixels on left side move to the left, and pixels on right side move to the right. Gray pixels create a single vertical line of four pixels high on each outside of the red lines.

Essentially, the gray pixels inside the "H" are mirrored/reflected to new vertical line positions along outer edges of the left and right "pillars" of the red shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
