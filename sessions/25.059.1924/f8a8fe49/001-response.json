The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), grey (5), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement or mirroring of the grey (5) pixels, while the red (2) pixels remain largely unchanged in terms of their overall shape, though potentially shifted slightly. The white pixels (0) act as background. There appears to be a vertical axis of symmetry or mirroring in play.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
