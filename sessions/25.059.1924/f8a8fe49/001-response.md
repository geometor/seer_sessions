Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 15x15 grids with pixels of different colors (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), grey (5), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement or mirroring of the grey (5) pixels, while the red (2) pixels remain largely unchanged in terms of their overall shape, though potentially shifted slightly. The white pixels (0) act as background. There appears to be a vertical axis of symmetry or mirroring in play.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_shape
    type: connected_pixels
    color: 2
    description: A shape formed by connected red pixels.
    properties:
        - constant_shape #shape and color maintained
  - name: grey_pixels
    type: individual_pixels
    color: 5
    description: Individual grey pixels within the red shape.
    properties:
      - move: true #these pixels move
  - name: background
    type: fill
    color: 0
    description: The background, consisting of white pixels.

actions:
  - name: mirror_grey_pixels
    description:  The grey pixels are mirrored, or re-arranged, with respect to a local, potentially moving, vertical axis, potentially the center line of the bounding box of the surrounding red shape.
    objects: [grey_pixels]

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: red_shape
    object: grey_pixels
    description: The grey pixels are located within the bounds of the red shape.
  - type: symmetry
    subject: grey_pixels
    object: vertical_axis
    description: Grey pixels display symmetry around a vertical axis within the red shape.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the connected red (2) pixels forming a closed shape.  Also identify the individual grey (5) pixels.
2.  **Determine Axis:** Find the vertical center line of the red shape by finding bounding box.
3.  **Mirror Grey Pixels:** For each grey pixel inside the red shape consider a reflection across the local vertical center.
    *   If a grey pixel is *x* units to the *left* of the axis, move it to *x* units to the *right* of the axis.
    *   If a grey pixel is *x* units to the *right* of the axis, move it to *x* units to the *left* of the axis.
    *   If a grey pixel is *on* the axis, the grey pixel is moved to the other adjacent location.
4. **Preserve red shape:** Maintain the red pixels shape from the input.
5.  **Background:** Leave all other pixels as white (0).
