example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: H
      pixels: 7
    - color: gray
      shape: scattered
      pixels: 4
  output_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: H
      pixels: 7
    - color: gray
      shape: two vertical lines
      pixels: 4
  transformation: Gray pixels inside the red 'H' are moved to the outside, forming vertical lines adjacent to the 'H's vertical bars.
example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: two vertical bars connected at bottom
      pixels: 6
    - color: gray
      shape: scattered
      pixels: 4
  output_objects:
    - color: red
      shape: two vertical bars connected at bottom
      pixels: 6
    - color: gray
      shape: two vertical lines
      pixels: 4
  transformation: Gray pixels between the red bars are moved to the immediate outside, forming short vertical lines.
example_3:
  input_objects:
   - color: red
     shape: two vertical bars, connected near middle
     pixels: 6
   - color: gray
     shape: scattered
     pixels: 4
  output_objects:
   - color: red
     shape: two vertical bars, connected near middle
     pixels: 6
   - color: gray
     shape: two vertical lines
     pixels: 4
  transformation: Gray pixels between the red bars are moved to the immediate outside, forming short vertical lines.
