observations:
  - example_1:
      input_object: A vertical line of two blue pixels at the bottom right of input, adjacent to a single blue pixel.
      output_object:  A 2x2 subgrid containing a single blue pixel in the bottom right corner.  The rest of the subgrid is filled with white.
      relation: The bottom right corner of the output is the non-white color in the bottom right of input.
  - example_2:
      input_object: A vertical line of two green pixels at the bottom right of input, adjacent to a single green pixel.
      output_object: A 2x2 subgrid containing a single green pixel in the bottom right corner. The rest of the subgrid is filled with white.
      relation: The bottom right corner of the output is the non-white color in the bottom right of input.
  - example_3:
      input_object: A vertical line of two yellow pixels at the bottom right of input, adjacent to a single yellow pixel.
      output_object: A 2x2 subgrid containing a single yellow pixel in the bottom right corner. The rest of the subgrid is filled with white.
      relation: The bottom right corner of the output is the non-white color in the bottom right of input.
  - general:
      output_size: All output grids are 2x2.
      input_variability: Input grid size varies.
      color_consistency:  The color in the bottom right corner of output corresponds to color of the rightmost vertical object in input.
      output_background:  The rest of the output grid is always white.
