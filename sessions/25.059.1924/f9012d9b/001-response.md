Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids seem to have varying dimensions and color patterns, while the output grids are significantly smaller. The key seems to be identifying a recurring sub-grid or pattern within the larger input grid, possibly ignoring certain colors or areas. The consistent reduction in size suggests a down-sampling or summarizing operation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells:
          type: pixel
          properties:
            - color: integer (0-9)
            - position: (row, column)
  - type: subgrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: fixed or variable (derived from input)
      - cells:
        type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - position: relative (row, column)

actions:
  - name: identify_subgrid
    description: Locates a repeating or significant subgrid within the input grid.
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Copies the identified subgrid to the output.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains subgrid
  - output_grid equals subgrid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the repeating subgrid:** Examine the input grid to find the smallest rectangular section that repeats, either exactly or with a consistent color transformation.  This subgrid might be positioned based on the location of a specific color or by identifying borders or edges.  Ignore parts of the input that don't fit the repeating pattern.
2. **Extract and Output Subgrid:** Once the subgrid is identified the output is the top left instance of the sub-grid.

**Elaborated explanation of steps:**

The second and the third input grids contain some lines of pixels that should be removed.
In the first example the subgrid is at the top left.
In the second example, we can ignore column 3.
In the third example we must remove rows 3 and 6.

The upper-leftmost occurrence of the identified pattern becomes the output.
