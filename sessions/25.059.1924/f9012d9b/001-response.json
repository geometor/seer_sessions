The input grids seem to have varying dimensions and color patterns, while the output grids are significantly smaller. The key seems to be identifying a recurring sub-grid or pattern within the larger input grid, possibly ignoring certain colors or areas. The consistent reduction in size suggests a down-sampling or summarizing operation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This subgrid might be positioned based on the location of a specific color or by identifying borders or edges.  Ignore parts of the input that don't fit the repeating pattern.\n2. **Extract and Output Subgrid:** Once the subgrid is identified the output is the top left instance of the sub-grid.\n\n**Elaborated explanation of steps:**\n\nThe second and the third input grids contain some lines of pixels that should be removed.\nIn the first example the subgrid is at the top left.\nIn the second example, we can ignore column 3.\nIn the third example we must remove rows 3 and 6.\n\nThe upper-leftmost occurrence of the identified pattern becomes the output.\n"
