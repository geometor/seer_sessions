The output is a single value (which is a single pixel grid). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard pattern, with alternating colors azure (8) and magenta (6), except for a single white (0) pixel in the top row. The output grid contains only the value 8 (azure).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Here, 8 and 6 occurs equal number of times, and since the question asks for the color, it will also have to account for the pixel.\n4. Check the value of the corner pixels. 8 is present.\n5.  Create a 1x1 grid. Set output to this identified color, which is 8.\n"
