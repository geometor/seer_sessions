**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x71663D5340D0>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x716635B76050>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 4x4 grid. The output is a single value (which is a single pixel grid). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard pattern, with alternating colors azure (8) and magenta (6), except for a single white (0) pixel in the top row. The output grid contains only the value 8 (azure).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    properties:
      - checkerboard_pattern: true
      - colors: [azure, magenta, white]
      - values: [8, 6, 0]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
        - color: azure
        - value: 8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program identifies the most frequent color in the input grid and creates a 1x1 grid with a cell of that color as output.
In this example.
1.  Observe the input grid.
2.  Determine the color values present (8, 6, and 0).
3. Identify the most frequent value. Here, 8 and 6 occurs equal number of times, and since the question asks for the color, it will also have to account for the pixel.
4. Check the value of the corner pixels. 8 is present.
5.  Create a 1x1 grid. Set output to this identified color, which is 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
