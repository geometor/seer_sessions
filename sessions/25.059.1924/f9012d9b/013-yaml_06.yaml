- task: "Extract Inner Rectangle"
- objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: Contains an inner rectangular region surrounded by a frame of a single color.
  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: Contains the extracted inner rectangle from the input grid, with the surrounding frame replaced by black (0). Has same dimensions as the Input Grid.
  - name: Inner Rectangle
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - description: The contiguous region within the input grid, excluding the outer frame.
  - name: Frame
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: single Integer, uniform
      - description: The outer layer of uniform color surrounding the inner rectangle
- actions:
  - name: Identify Frame
    description: Determine the color and boundaries of the outermost layer of the input grid.
  - name: Extract Inner Rectangle
    description: Isolate the inner region of the grid, excluding the frame.
  - name: create output
    description: copy the input grid
  - name: replace frame
    description: set the frame area in the output to black
  - name: replace outside of inner rectangle
    description: fill the area between the inner rectangle and the outer edge of the output with black
