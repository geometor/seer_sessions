**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x716635BE8250>

**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x716635BEAED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The colors in the input grid are red (2), blue (1), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on a specific region of the input. The colors in the output are blue and red, meaning the output grid only represents non-white pixels. The shape of the input is 5x5 and the output is 2x2.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, blue, white]
      shape: 5x5
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, blue]
      shape: 2x2

actions:
  - name: condense
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Selects a specific sub-region of the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output_grid corresponds to the top-right 2x2 sub-grid of the input grid, ignoring any white space.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region:** Focus on the top-right 2x2 corner of the input grid.
2. **Extract Subgrid**: extract the colors of that corner.
3. **Create Output:** Construct a 2x2 output grid using the non-white color values, in the order as they appear in that region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
