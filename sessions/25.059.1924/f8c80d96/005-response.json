            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of an azure and gray checkerboard pattern originating from azure \"seed\" pixels. This approach worked for the first training example but failed on others. The primary issue is that the checkerboard fill isn't always relative to the _first_ seed, and it's not always using gray. It often depends on the specific context of each input grid. We need a more flexible, context-aware rule.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, focusing on the relationship between azure pixels in the input and the resulting pattern in the output.\n2.  **Identify Contextual Rules:** Determine if the checkerboard pattern's origin (top-left, relative to a specific azure pixel, etc.) and colors vary based on input characteristics.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Develop a more generalized description that accounts for the variations observed across all examples.\n4.  Test and verify any code generated from the natural language program\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo help with this, I will produce the following information: size of the grid, location of the first azure pixel.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes a single input-output pair and returns relevant metrics.\"\"\"\n\n    input_size = input_grid.shape\n    output_size = output_grid.shape\n    azure_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)\n    first_azure = tuple(azure_pixels[0]) if len(azure_pixels) > 0 else None\n\n    return {\n        \"input_size\": input_size,\n        \"output_size\": output_size,\n        \"first_azure\": first_azure,\n    }\n\n# Assuming 'train' is a list of dictionaries, each with 'input' and 'output'\ntrain = task[\"train\"]\n\n# Gather and print the metrics for each example\n\nanalysis_results = []\nfor example in train:\n  input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n  output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n  example_analysis = analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)\n  analysis_results.append(example_analysis)\nprint(analysis_results)\n```"
