The input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), and gray (5). The transformation doesn't involve adding or removing objects but, recoloring. The output grid seems to expand or \"fill in\" areas of existing colors, specifically around the edges, but also introduces a new color (gray) in locations where white pixels were before. The transformation rule is not a simple one-to-one color mapping, it is dependent on surrounding colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
