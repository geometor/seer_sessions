All locations with '8' in input becomes '8' in output. The remaining cells of the output are filled using a \"checkerboard\" or \"alternating\" pattern, starting with gray (5) to the immediate right of the top-left most \"8\". Horizontally and vertically adjacent cells will have different colors, with 5 (gray) and 8 (azure) alternating.\n4.  If any location in the output is visited again, replace its value.\n\nEssentially, the azure pixels in the input act as \"seed\" points for an azure and gray checkerboard pattern that propagates across the entire output grid, anchored at the top-left pixel in relation to the first azure seed pixel encountered.\n"
