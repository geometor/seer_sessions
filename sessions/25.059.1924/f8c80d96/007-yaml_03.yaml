facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 1 (blue).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 5 (gray) and 1 (blue).
  - observation: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid maintain their color and position in the output grid.
  - observation: Some white (0) pixels in the input grid are changed to gray (5) in the output grid.
  - observation: The change from white to gray is not random, implying a contextual rule.
  - relationship:  White pixels adjacent to existing blue pixels may be replaced with gray. Specifically White pixels to the left of blue pixels are converted to gray, with the exception of the bottom row. White pixels directly below blue pixels appear to be converted to blue in the bottom row.
