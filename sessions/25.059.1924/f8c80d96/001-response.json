The primary element is a contiguous \"object\" of a single, non-zero color in the input grid. This object seems to \"grow\" or be \"inflated\" outwards, filling surrounding zero-value (white) cells.\u00a0 A new color (represented by '5', or gray) appears to fill in spaces created by the \"inflation\", and borders the expanded object. The examples show a consistent pattern in the relationship of input and output and their relative dimensions.\n\n**YAML Fact Set:**\n\n"
