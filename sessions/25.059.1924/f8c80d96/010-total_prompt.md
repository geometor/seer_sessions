Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Preserve Blue:** Copy all blue (1) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.
2. **Conditional Gray Replacement (Left):** For every white (0) pixel in the input grid, if it is to the *left* of any blue (1) pixel within the same row, and if the row is *not* the last or the second to last row, replace it with gray (5) in the output grid.
3. **Conditional Blue Replacement (Below/Bottom two rows):** White Pixels directly below blue pixels in the bottom two rows are replaced with 1.
4. **Default Gray:** All remaining white(0) pixels in that were not colored blue in the previous step should be changed to gray (5).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly handling the preservation of blue pixels and some of the conditional replacements. However, the provided results reveal discrepancies, especially in how white pixels are handled. The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Carefully examine each example, comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `transform` function. Focus on identifying specific locations where the code fails to match the expected output.
2.  **Refine Conditional Logic:** Based on the error analysis, determine the precise conditions under which white pixels are changed to gray or blue. Pay close attention to the row and column relationships between blue and white pixels.
3.  **Prioritize bottom two rows**: Ensure proper conditional statements on filling blue in the bottom two rows of the output grid.
4. **Iterative Improvement**: The code generated does not perform correctly across all examples, need to make sure the conditions of the transform are accurately described.
5.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding of the transformation rules.
6.  **Regenerate Code:** Use the updated natural language program as a basis for creating new python code.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To gather metrics, I'll use a simple approach to visualize the differences. I will describe in words what I see, as the code execution environment cannot compute difference grids at this stage.

*   **Example 1:** The generated output perfectly matches the expected output.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Differences exist. The second row in the output should have a gray pixel in the first position.
    *   In the bottom two rows there are additional blue pixels that should be gray.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Differences exist.
    *   Bottom two rows have similar errors to Example 2.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixels
    color: blue
    value: 1
    behavior: preserved in original position
  - name: white_pixels
    color: white
    value: 0
    behavior: conditionally changed to gray or blue
  - name: gray_pixels
      color: gray
      value: 5
      behavior: default fill, conditionally replaces some white pixels
  - name: output_grid
    behavior: initialized as all gray

rules:
    - action: copy
      condition: all blue pixels
      details: copy from input_grid to output_grid at the same location
    - action: change_to_gray_left
      condition:  white pixels to the left of any blue pixel on same row, not in last two rows
      details: change value from 0 to 5
    - action: change_to_blue_below
      condition: white pixels directly below blue pixels in bottom two rows
      details: change value from 0 to 1
    - action: default_grey
      condition: all other white pixels
      details: change to 5

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with gray (5).
2.  **Preserve Blue:** Copy all blue (1) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.
3.  **Conditional Gray Replacement (Left):** For every white (0) pixel in the input grid, *except in the last two rows*, if it is to the *left* of any blue (1) pixel within the same row, replace it with gray (5) in the output grid.
4.  **Conditional Blue Replacement (Bottom Two Rows):** In the *last two rows* of the input grid, any white (0) pixel that is *directly below* a blue (1) pixel in the row immediately above should be changed to blue (1) in the output grid.
5.  **Fill the rest:** all remaining pixels are gray (value 5).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
