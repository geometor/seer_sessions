Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Preserve Blue:** Copy all blue (1) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.
2. **Conditional Gray Replacement (Left):** For every white (0) pixel in the input grid, if it is to the *left* of any blue (1) pixel within the same row, and if the row is *not* the last or the second to last row, replace it with gray (5) in the output grid.
3. **Conditional Blue Replacement (Below/Bottom two rows):** White Pixels directly below blue pixels in the bottom two rows are replaced with 1.
4. **Default Gray:** All remaining white(0) pixels in that were not colored blue in the previous step should be changed to gray (5).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
