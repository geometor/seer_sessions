Previous Code:
```python
"""
The azure (8) pixels in the input grid act as "seed" points for an azure and gray checkerboard pattern that propagates across the entire output grid, anchored at the top-left pixel in relation to the first azure seed pixel encountered.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, -1)  # -1 represents unvisited

    # Find seed points (azure pixels in input)
    seed_points = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)

    # Fill first seed point and mark as visited
    if len(seed_points)>0:
        first_seed = tuple(seed_points[0])
        output_grid[first_seed] = 8

    # Checkerboard fill.
    for r in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[r,c]==8:
                output_grid[r,c] = 8
            else:
                if (r + c) % 2 == (first_seed[0]+first_seed[1])%2: # use first_seed point
                    output_grid[r,c] = 8
                else:
                    output_grid[r, c] = 5

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of an azure and gray checkerboard pattern originating from azure "seed" pixels. This approach worked for the first training example but failed on others. The primary issue is that the checkerboard fill isn't always relative to the _first_ seed, and it's not always using gray. It often depends on the specific context of each input grid. We need a more flexible, context-aware rule.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, focusing on the relationship between azure pixels in the input and the resulting pattern in the output.
2.  **Identify Contextual Rules:** Determine if the checkerboard pattern's origin (top-left, relative to a specific azure pixel, etc.) and colors vary based on input characteristics.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Develop a more generalized description that accounts for the variations observed across all examples.
4.  Test and verify any code generated from the natural language program

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To help with this, I will produce the following information: size of the grid, location of the first azure pixel.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Analyzes a single input-output pair and returns relevant metrics."""

    input_size = input_grid.shape
    output_size = output_grid.shape
    azure_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)
    first_azure = tuple(azure_pixels[0]) if len(azure_pixels) > 0 else None

    return {
        "input_size": input_size,
        "output_size": output_size,
        "first_azure": first_azure,
    }

# Assuming 'train' is a list of dictionaries, each with 'input' and 'output'
train = task["train"]

# Gather and print the metrics for each example

analysis_results = []
for example in train:
  input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
  output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
  example_analysis = analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)
  analysis_results.append(example_analysis)
print(analysis_results)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
