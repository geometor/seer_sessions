<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2048x1360 at 0x71663D5B2AD0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML-structured fact set, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The primary element is a contiguous "object" of a single, non-zero color in the input grid. This object seems to "grow" or be "inflated" outwards, filling surrounding zero-value (white) cells.  A new color (represented by '5', or gray) appears to fill in spaces created by the "inflation", and borders the expanded object. The examples show a consistent pattern in the relationship of input and output and their relative dimensions.

**YAML Fact Set:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_type: shape
    properties:
      - color: non-zero value from input grid (e.g., 8-azure, 1-blue, 2-red)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored pixels
      - initial_location: coordinates in the input grid
    actions:
      - name: expand
        description: Fills adjacent zero-value cells with the object's original color.
        details: >
            Expansion occurs in all directions (up, down, left, right) until it would potentially overwrite a cell with a non-zero value,
            or until non-zero value cells border the expansion on all orthogonal sides.
    relationships:
      - relation: bordered_by
        target: background
        properties:
          - color: 5 (gray)
          - location: surrounds the expanded shape
      - relation: original_shape
        target: object_type
        properties:
          - location: original non-zero pixels from the input, within the final expanded shape

  - object_type: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white) in the input, partially becomes 5(gray) in the output, and may have remaining 0 value cells
      - location: surrounds the main shape
    actions: {}
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the primary object:** Find the contiguous region of non-zero pixels in the input grid. Note its color and initial location.

2.  **Expand the object:**
    *   Iterate through rows and columns.
    *   Wherever the object is found, attempt to expand to the orthogonal neighboring cells (above, below, left, and right).
    *   If the bordering cell contains zero (white), then fill it with the color of the primary object.
    *   Expansion is limited to the bounding box that fully surrounds the expanded object using only orthogonal neighbors.

3.  **Fill the remaining original zero-value cells within the bounding box:**
     * Fill remaining zero-value cells in the input, with the color `5`, that is bounded on all four sides using orthogonal directions.

4.  **Preserve Initial Object:** The original, contiguous object from the input should remain and maintain its relative location in the output.

In essence, the initial shape expands outwards, filling adjacent white space. Then a grey border fills the surrounding original white space.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
