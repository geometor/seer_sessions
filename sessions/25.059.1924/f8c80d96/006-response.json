A checkerboard pattern is generated in the output grid, but the color and starting point of the checkerboard is determined by the parity of the row and column indices of the *first* azure pixel encountered. If the sum of the row and column of the first azure pixel is even, the checkerboard starts with azure at that location. If the sum is odd, the checkerboard uses the second color, and begins at the seed location. The second color in each example is taken from the background color of the input, which can be determined by the top left corner.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input.\n    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, -1)\n\n    # Find seed points (azure pixels in input)\n    seed_points = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)\n    \n    # Determine background/second color\n    second_color = input_grid[0,0]\n\n    # Fill first seed point and mark as visited\n    if len(seed_points)>0:\n        first_seed = tuple(seed_points[0])\n        \n        # determine start color from first seed\n        if (first_seed[0] + first_seed[1]) % 2 == 0:\n            start_color = 8\n        else:\n            start_color = second_color\n        output_grid[first_seed] = start_color\n\n        # Checkerboard fill, based on parity of the first azure seed\n        for r in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n            for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n                if (r, c) == first_seed:\n                    continue  # Already filled\n                \n                if (r + c) % 2 == (first_seed[0] + first_seed[1]) % 2:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = start_color  # Same as first seed\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 8 if start_color == second_color else second_color # Opposite of first seed.\n    else: # added to handle no seed\n        output_grid[:] = input_grid[0,0]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
