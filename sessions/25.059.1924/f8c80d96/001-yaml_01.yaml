facts:
  - object_type: shape
    properties:
      - color: non-zero value from input grid (e.g., 8-azure, 1-blue, 2-red)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored pixels
      - initial_location: coordinates in the input grid
    actions:
      - name: expand
        description: Fills adjacent zero-value cells with the object's original color.
        details: >
            Expansion occurs in all directions (up, down, left, right) until it would potentially overwrite a cell with a non-zero value,
            or until non-zero value cells border the expansion on all orthogonal sides.

        properties:
          - color: 5 (gray)

        properties:
          - location: original non-zero pixels from the input, within the final expanded shape

  - object_type: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white) in the input, partially becomes 5(gray) in the output, and may have remaining 0 value cells
      - location: surrounds the main shape
