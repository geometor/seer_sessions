The difference is the addition of blue (1) single-cell objects.\n\n3.  **Analyze Emergence:**  The blue (1) pixels appear to be added based on a specific rule related to the azure (8) objects. Let's examine their positions:\n    *   A blue pixel is added at [1, 4], which is to the left of the topmost azure pixel of the object formed by [0,4] and [0,5].\n    *   Another blue pixel is added at [2, 3], to the left of the topmost azure pixel of the object formed by [2,2], [3,2] and [3,3].\n    *   A blue pixel appears at [5, 3], which is to the left of the topmost pixel of the object located at [5,4].\n\n4.  **Formulate the Rule:**  The rule appears to be: For each separate azure (8) object, add a blue (1) pixel immediately to the *left* of its topmost azure (8) pixel. Note the change with respect the previous task.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   Iterate through each separate azure (8) object in the input grid.\n*   For each azure object, find the cell with the smallest row number (the topmost azure pixel).\n*   Place a blue (1) pixel in the cell immediately to the *left* of this topmost azure pixel.\n*   All other cells keep their value.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is:\nIterate through each separate azure (8) object in the input grid.\nFor each azure object, find the cell with the smallest row number (the topmost azure pixel).\nPlace a blue (1) pixel in the cell immediately to the *left* of this topmost azure pixel.\nAll other cells keep their value.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    # Find contiguous regions of the specified color.\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_object):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule: For each azure (8)\n    object, add a blue (1) pixel to the left of its topmost pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        # Find the topmost pixel (smallest row number).\n        topmost_pixel = min(obj, key=lambda p: p[0])\n        # Add a blue pixel to the left.\n        row, col = topmost_pixel\n        if col - 1 >= 0:  # Check bounds\n          output_grid[row, col - 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
