One is in the top-left corner, and the other is in the center-right area.\n\n2.  **Detect Change:** Compare it with the output grid. We see that the azure (8) objects remain unchanged in their original size, shape and positions. We note the appearance of two new single-cell blue (1) objects.\n\n3.  **Analyze Emergence**: If we look closely where the blue objects appear, it seems to be directly to the right of the uppermost azure pixel of each object.\n    *   The top-left azure object has a blue pixel added to the right of its top azure cell.\n    *   The center-right azure object has a blue pixel added to the right of its top azure cell.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Rule**: The rule appears to be: For each separated azure (8) object, add a blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of its topmost azure (8) pixel.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   Iterate through each separate azure (8) object in the input grid.\n*   For each azure object, find the cell with the smallest row number (the topmost azure pixel).\n*   Place a blue (1) pixel in the cell immediately to the right of this topmost azure pixel.\n*   All other cells keep its value.\n"
