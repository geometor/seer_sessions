## Example 5

**input:**
```
7 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x64 at 0x786C546B5ED0>

**output:**
```
7 0 0 0 0 0
7 7 0 0 0 0
7 7 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x786C548164D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 1x6 grid (input) to a 3x6 grid (output). The input grid contains a single orange pixel (value 7) in the first cell, and the rest are white pixels (value 0). The output grid expands on this, replicating the orange pixel downwards and to the right to create a 3x3 block of orange pixels in the top-left corner. The rest of the input is unchanged and transferred to corresponding output pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x6
    elements:
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        position: [0,0]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        position: remaining cells

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements:
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        position: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [0,1], [1,1], [2,1], [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        position: remaining cells
  - action: replicate_orange_pixel
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description:  The orange pixel in the top-left corner of the input grid is replicated to form a 3x3 square block in the output grid.

  - relation: grid_expansion
    type: dimension_change
    input:  1x6
    output: 3x6
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the orange pixel (value 7) in the input grid. It will always exist at position [0,0].
2.  **Expand:** Create a new output grid with dimensions 3x6.
3.  **Replicate:** Copy the orange pixel from the input grid. Replicate the orange in the output grid to make square 3x3 at the same starting position.
4. **Transfer:** Copy every 0 cell into the corresponding horizontal position in the output.
5.  **Fill:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white pixels (value 0).

Essentially the transformation rule isolates the color and count and uses those for generating the output by performing a replication.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
