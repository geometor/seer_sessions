Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the initial contiguous sequence of gray (5) pixels at the beginning of the input row.
2. Determine the output grid dimensions: The width matches the input width, and the height is determined by the number of gray pixels.
3. Copy the input to the first row of the output grid.
4. Expand the gray region: For each subsequent row, increase the number of gray pixels by one, starting from the initial gray region length. This forms a growing triangle.
5. Fill the remaining space: Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0) pixels.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
