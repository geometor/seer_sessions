## Example 4

**input:**
```
8 8 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x64 at 0x786C546B5ED0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8 8 0 0
8 8 8 8 8 0
8 8 8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x786C546CBE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The input is a 1x6 grid, and the output is a 3x6 grid. The input grid consists of four azure (8) pixels followed by two white (0) pixels. The output grid expands on this pattern. The azure pixels seem to propagate downwards, while the white pixels seem to only propagate some of their instances, always in the bottom-most row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [1, 6]
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        count: 4
      - color: white (0)
        count: 2

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: [3, 6]
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        count: 12 # 4 * 3 ? Not quite
      - color: white (0)
        count: 2 # same
      - color: azure (8) # additional, row-wise
        count: 4

  - observation: input row 1, columns 1-4 are azure
  - observation: output rows 1-3, columns 1-4 are azure
  - observation: input row 1, columns 5-6 are white
  - observation: output row 1, columns 5-6 are white
  - observation: output row 2, column 5 is azure
  - observation: output row 2, column 6 is white
  - observation: output row 3, columns 5 and 6 are azure

  - action: replication
    description: The azure section of the input grid is replicated vertically to create the first four columns in each row of the output
  - action: selective replication:
    description: the white section of the original array is replicated in the top row
  - action: modification:
    description: the original white section is changed into a new sequence that contains both azure and white colors, and replicated/modified vertically

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate Azure:** The first four azure pixels (value 8) of the input row are replicated vertically three times to form the first four columns of the output grid.

2.  **Top Row White:** The last two white pixels (value 0) of the input are copied directly to the top row of the last two columns of the output grid.

3.  **Propagate/Modify the last two positions:** The 5th column in rows 2 & 3 is changed to azure, the 6th column remains 0 in row 2 and is changed to 8 in row 3.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
