Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule takes a 1xN input grid and generates an output grid where the red (2) pixels from the input are expanded into a square in the top-left corner, while the white (0) pixels remain white. The size of the red square grows based on the number of red pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same width as the input and determined height.
    rows = 0
    for x in range(len(input_grid[0])):
      if input_grid[0][x] == 2:
        rows +=1
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, len(input_grid[0])), dtype=int)

    # Find the red pixels in the input grid.
    
    # Create the square of red pixels.
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(min(i + 1,len(input_grid[0]))):
            output_grid[i, j] = 2

    # Fill the remaining cells with white (0).
    #output_grid[output_grid == 0] = 0  # This line is redundant as the grid is initialized with 0s.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
