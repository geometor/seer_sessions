facts:
  - object: gray_region
    description: A contiguous sequence of gray (5) pixels.
    properties:
      start_length: The number of gray pixels at the beginning of the first row of the input.
      expansion_rule:  Increases in length by one for each subsequent row in the output.
      location: Starts at the top-left corner of the grid.

  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      width:  Variable, between 1 and 30.
      height: Variable, between 1 and 30.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      width: Same as the input grid's width.
      height: Determined by the gray_region's start_length + (number of white pixels in the first row)
    composition:
      - The first row is identical to the first row of the input grid.
      - The gray_region expands downwards and rightwards, forming a triangular shape.
      - The remaining cells are filled with white (0) pixels.
