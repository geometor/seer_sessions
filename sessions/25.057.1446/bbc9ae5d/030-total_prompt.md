Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies the orange pixel (value 7) in the input grid's top-left corner and replicates it to form a 3x3 orange square in the output grid, while also copying 0 values at the corresponding positions and filling the rest with white.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_pixel_by_value(grid, value):
    """Finds the coordinates of the first pixel with a given value."""
    coords = np.where(grid == value)
    if len(coords[0]) > 0:
        return coords[0][0], coords[1][0]
    return None

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rule."""

    # Initialize output grid as 3x6 filled with white (0)
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 6), dtype=int)

    # Find the orange pixel (value 7)
    orange_pixel_coords = find_pixel_by_value(input_grid, 7)

    # replicate first pixel in output
    if orange_pixel_coords is not None:
       for i in range(3):
           for j in range(3):
              output_grid[i,j] = 7
    # Copy the white (0) values and place at proper locations

    for x in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        if input_grid[0,x] == 0:
          output_grid[0,x] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single training example and made a specific assumption: identify an orange pixel and replicate it as a 3x3 square. It also attempted to copy the 0 values from the first row. The additional training examples reveal that this assumption is too narrow. The core concept of replicating a pattern seems relevant, but the details (what to replicate, where to replicate, and additional filling rules) need significant adjustment. The size of output is also not fixed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to identify common patterns and variations.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Determine the key object or pattern that drives the transformation. It's not necessarily a single orange pixel.
3.  **Precise Location Mapping:** Understand how the location of the key object in the input relates to the output.
4.  **Generalized Replication:** Determine the replication rule. Is it a fixed size, or does it depend on the input?
5.  **Background Filling:** Clarify the rules for filling the rest of the output grid.
6. use code execution to gather metrics about the grid shapes and identify
   other patterns.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape
    input_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    output_colors = np.unique(output_grid)
    print(f"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"Input colors: {input_colors}, Output colors: {output_colors}")
    # Find the orange pixels in input
    input_orange = np.where(input_grid == 7)
    if len(input_orange[0]) >0:
      print(f"Input orange pixels count:{len(input_orange[0])} locations: {[(input_orange[0][i],input_orange[1][i]) for i in range(len(input_orange[0]))]}")
    else:
      print("No orange pixels in input")
    output_orange = np.where(output_grid == 7)
    if len(output_orange[0]) >0:
      print(f"Output orange pixels count:{len(output_orange[0])} locations: {[(output_orange[0][i],output_orange[1][i]) for i in range(len(output_orange[0]))]}")
    else:
      print("No orange pixels in output")

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      All input grids contain exactly one orange (7) pixel.
  - observation: |
      The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - observation: |
     The orange pixel in the input is expanded into a 3x3 square of orange pixels in the output.
  - observation: |
      The top-left corner of the 3x3 orange square in the output corresponds to the position of the single orange pixel. The orange square can extend beyond row and column 0.
  - observation: |
      All other pixels in the output grid are white (0), matching the original locations of the white pixels in the input grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Orange Pixel:** Locate the single orange (value 7) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** Create an output grid with the *exact same dimensions* as the input grid.
3.  **Replicate Orange Square:** Create a 3x3 square of orange pixels in the output grid. The top-left corner of this square should be at the same coordinates as the orange pixel found in the input grid.
4. **Copy 0 values:** Copy all 0 pixels from the input grid to the same position in the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
