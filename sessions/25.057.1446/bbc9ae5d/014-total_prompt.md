## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x64 at 0x786C548166D0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x320 at 0x786C54816650>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid. The input is a single row, while the output is a rectangular grid. The colors present are gray (5) and white (0). The gray region in the output expands downwards and rightwards from the gray region in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 1x10 grid.
    values: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  - type: grid
    description: Output is a 5x10 grid.
    values: |
      [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
  - object: gray_region
    input_position: indices 0-2
    input_color: 5
    output_description: Expands to fill a triangle.
  - object: white_region
    input_position: indices 3-9
    input_color: 0
    output_description: Remains unchanged, filling the rest of the grid.
  - transformation: expansion
    object: gray_region
    rule: The gray region extends downwards and to the right, forming a triangular shape. The number of gray pixels in each subsequent row increases by one, starting from the initial length of the continuous gray sequence in the input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the gray region:** Find the contiguous sequence of gray (5) pixels at the beginning of the input row.
2.  **Determine the dimensions:** the width of the output will match the input, the output will be square with rows equal to continuous regions in the output
3.  **Expand the gray region:** Create a new grid with a height equal to the number of the gray pixels in that continuous sequence
4. copy the input to the output
5.  For each subsequent row, increase the number of gray pixels by one, starting from the initial gray region length, effectively creating a growing triangle.
6.  **Fill the remaining space:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0) pixels, maintaining their original positions relative to the expanding gray region.

Essentially, a triangle is created and expands with the gray color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
