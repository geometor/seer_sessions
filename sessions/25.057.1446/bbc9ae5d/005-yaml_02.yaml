examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: white (0)
            count: 74
            bounding_box: [0, 0, 7, 9] # [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col]
          - color: blue (1)
            count: 6
            bounding_box: [4, 4, 6, 6]
      output:
        objects:
          - color: white (0)
            count: 77
            bounding_box: [0, 0, 7, 9]
          - color: blue (1)
            count: 3
            bounding_box: [0, 4, 2, 6]
      transformation:
        - The height of the blue object in the input determines the height of the output grid.
          The width is the same as the input.
  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: white (0)
            count: 73
            bounding_box: [0, 0, 7, 9]
          - color: blue (1)
            count: 7
            bounding_box: [4, 3, 6, 6]
      output:
        objects:
         - color: white (0)
           count: 77
           bounding_box: [0, 0, 7, 9]
         - color: blue (1)
           count: 3
           bounding_box: [0, 3, 2, 6]
      transformation:
        - The height of the blue object bounding box in the input becomes the height of the blue object in the output.
          The output width is the same as the input width.
  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: white(0)
            count: 42
            bounding_box: [0, 0, 5, 7]
          - color: blue (1)
            count: 6
            bounding_box: [2, 3, 4, 5]
      output:
        objects:
          - color: white (0)
            count: 39
            bounding_box: [0, 0, 3, 7]
          - color: blue (1)
            count: 9
            bounding_box: [0, 3, 2, 5]
      transformation:
        - The height of the blue object in the input determines the height of the blue object in the output.
          The output width is the same as the input width.
  - example_4:
    input:
      objects:
        - color: white(0)
          count: 73
          bounding_box: [0, 0, 7, 9]
        - color: blue(1)
          count: 6
          bounding_box: [4,4,6,6]
        - color: red(2)
          count: 1
          bounding_box: [5,5,5,5]
    output:
      objects:
        - color: white(0)
          count: 77
          bounding_box: [0,0,7,9]
        - color: blue(1)
          count: 3
          bounding_box: [0,4,2,6]
    transformation:
        - The height of the blue object in the input determines the height of the blue object in the output.
          The output width is the same as the input width.
          The presence of red in the input does not affect the output.
