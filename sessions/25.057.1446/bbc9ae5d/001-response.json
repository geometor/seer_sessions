The input grid contains two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid expands the blue region downwards, creating a rectangular block of blue pixels. The white pixels remain unchanged in their relative positions. The width of the output grid matches the input, while height of the output is determined by number blue pixels plus any \"intermediate\" pixels to form the rectangle.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
