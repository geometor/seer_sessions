Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Examine** the input grid, noting the positions of blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Count** the number of blue pixels.
3.  **Identify** the x-coordinates of the left-most and right-most blue pixels.
4.  **Determine** the height of the output grid. The height is equal to the number of blue pixels if there is more than one. Otherwise, it is 1.
5.  **Create** the output grid with the same width as the input grid and the calculated height.
6.  **Fill** a rectangular region in the output grid with blue pixels. The rectangle spans from the x-coordinate of the left-most blue pixel to the x-coordinate of the right-most blue pixel, with a height equal to the calculated output height.
7.  **Copy** all white pixels from the input grid to the output grid, preserving their original row and column positions.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
