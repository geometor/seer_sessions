The input grid is larger (5x7) than the output grid (3x3). It appears that a specific region of the input grid is being extracted to form the output. The dominant colors involved are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to focus on a specific, contiguous block of azure pixels within a larger field of white pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
