facts:
  - observation: "Input grid consists of two rectangular subgrids."
  - property: "Subgrids are of different colors; top is green and white, bottom is blue and white."
  - property: "The subgrids may be the same size as each other, 4 rows by 4 columns"
  - observation: "A single white(0) pixel row appears to separate the subgrids"
  - observation: "Output grid is smaller than the input grid."
  - property: "Output grid is mostly white pixels, with one red pixel."
  - relationship: "The red pixel's position in the output grid seems related to the structure/content of the input subgrids."
  - action: "the white(0) in row 1, col 2 of the first subgrid might somehow select the second row of the first subgrid"
  - action: "the white(0) in row 1, col 1 of the second subgrid might somehow select the first column of the second subgrid"
  - action: "these selections (row 2, col 1) might correspond to the red(2) location in the output"
