The input grid contains various colors (represented by integers 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or filtered version of the input, primarily containing white (0) and red (2) pixels. The input grid is 8x4 and the output grid is 4x4. It appears there are distinct regions or objects of uniform color in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider only the top half of the input grid (rows 1-4).\n\n2.  **Locate Green:** Within this top half, identify the locations (coordinates) of all green (3) pixels.\n\n3.  **Change to Red:** Replace each green pixel in the top half with a red (2) pixel.\n\n4. **Fill Rest:** Fill the remaining pixels from the top half with white (0).\n\n5.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 grid is the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation finds all the green pixels from the top half of the input and replaces them with red. Everything else in the top half of the grid becomes white to make up the output.\n"
