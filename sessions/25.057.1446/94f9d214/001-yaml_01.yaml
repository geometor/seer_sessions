facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x4, output grid is 4x4.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 8x4
          - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 4x4
          - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: Output grid corresponds to the upper half of the input grid.
      - type: conditional_color_change
        description:  Non-white pixels in the top half of the input are possibly represented as red (2) in the output, otherwise white(0)
  - actions:
      - type: reduction
        description: The input grid's height is halved to form the output grid.
      - type: color_transformation
        description: >
          Pixels in the input are potentially transformed to either red (2) or
          white (0) in the output, based on whether they are colored pixels.
