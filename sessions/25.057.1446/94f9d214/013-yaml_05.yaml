facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x4
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0, 2) representing white and red colors
  - observation: output_grid_height: one half input grid height.
  - observation: output_grid_width: same as input grid width.
  - observation: input grid contains regions/objects of uniform color, specifically blue (1), green (3), and white (0).
  - observation: output grid contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels.
  - relationship: output_grid seems to be a transformation of the input_grid.
  - action: transformation includes color filtering and potentially spatial reduction or object extraction
