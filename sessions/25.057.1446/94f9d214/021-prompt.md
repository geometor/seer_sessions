Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Subgrids:** Divide the input grid into two subgrids based on a single-pixel horizontal white(0) divider.
2.  **Locate First White Pixel in Top Subgrid:** Within the top subgrid, consider the top row of the first sub-grid, find the column index of the first occurrence of a white (0) pixel. Use this column index as a way of selecting that row number (minus one, to deal with index offset) from the top grid.
3.  **Locate First White Pixel in Bottom Subgrid:** Within the bottom subgrid, consider the top row of the second sub-grid, find the column index of the first occurrence of a white(0) pixel. Use this column index directly.
4.  **Combine Results:** consider the row and column determined above to be the location of the red pixel in the otherwise empty output grid.
5. **Output Creation:** copy the colour of selected row,col to the output.
6. fill everything else with white(0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
