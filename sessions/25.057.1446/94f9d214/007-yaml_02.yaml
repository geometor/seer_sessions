facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x4, output grid is 4x4.
  - observation: Input grid contains multiple colors (0, 1, 3).
  - observation: Output grid contains only colors 0 and 2.
  - object: Input_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 8x4
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
  - object: Output_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [0, 2]
  - relationship: Input grid transforms to output grid.
  - action: Group contiguous regions of the same non-white color.
  - action: Count size/area of colored regions.
  - action: output squares colored 2 appear to related to these count
  - rule: "If the count of a non-zero colored is > 0 represent color is the area in red."
