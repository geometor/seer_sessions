The input grid appears to have a mix of colors (white, green, blue), while the output grid is predominantly white with a few red pixels. The dimensions of the input grid (8x4) are different from the output grid (4x4). This suggests a reduction or summarization of information from the input. The specific positions of the red pixels in the output seem to correlate with the positions of non-white pixels in the upper half of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
