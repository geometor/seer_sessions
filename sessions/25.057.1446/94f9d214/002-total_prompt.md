## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0
0 0 0 0
3 0 0 3
0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x512 at 0x786C5492F750>

**output:**
```
2 2 2 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C5492F850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a mix of colors (white, green, blue), while the output grid is predominantly white with a few red pixels. The dimensions of the input grid (8x4) are different from the output grid (4x4). This suggests a reduction or summarization of information from the input. The specific positions of the red pixels in the output seem to correlate with the positions of non-white pixels in the upper half of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x4, output grid is 4x4.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 8x4
          - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 4x4
          - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: Output grid corresponds to the upper half of the input grid.
      - type: conditional_color_change
        description:  Non-white pixels in the top half of the input are possibly represented as red (2) in the output, otherwise white(0)
  - actions:
      - type: reduction
        description: The input grid's height is halved to form the output grid.
      - type: color_transformation
        description: >
          Pixels in the input are potentially transformed to either red (2) or
          white (0) in the output, based on whether they are colored pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on the upper half:** Consider only the top four rows of the input grid.
2.  **Maintain width:** the output has the same width, 4 columns.
3.  **Check for colored pixel:** For each cell in the focused region of the input grid.
4. **Transform colored pixels in the region:**
    *   If the input cell is not white (0), set output to red (2).
    *   If the input cell is white (0), output remains white(0).

In essence, the program takes the top half of the input grid and transforms any colored pixel within that region to red (2) in the output grid. All white pixels are copied as white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
