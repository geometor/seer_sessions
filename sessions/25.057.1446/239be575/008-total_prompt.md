## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 8 8 8 0
2 2 8 8 0 2 2
0 0 8 0 0 2 2
0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x786C5492F850>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x786C5492F8D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation from a larger grid (input) to a much smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various digits (0, 2, and 8), representing different colors (white, red, and azure). The output grid appears to consist of a single azure pixel with the value 8. The most prominent feature in the input seems to be the azure (8) pixels, and these appear most influential on the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 2D grid of integers ranging from 0 to 9, representing different colors.
  - observation: |
      The output is also a 2D grid, but significantly smaller than the input.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and azure (8).
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains only one pixel of color azure (8).
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: [0, 2, 8]
      size: 5x7
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: [8]
      size: 1x1
  - relationship: |
      The output value (8) is present in the input grid.
  - action: Count
    target: azure (8) pixels
    result: Multiple occurrences in the input.
  - action: Select
    target: azure color
    property: value, presence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid with the value 8 (azure color).
2.  **Create** a 1x1 output grid.
3.  **Set** the value of the single pixel in the output grid to 8.

In essence, the transformation selects the presence of azure (8) and reports it as a 1x1 grid. It is performing an existence check and reporting it as the color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
