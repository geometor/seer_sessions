## Example 4

**input:**
```
8 8 0 0 2 2 0
0 8 8 0 2 2 8
0 0 0 8 0 8 0
8 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 8 0 8
0 2 2 8 8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x384 at 0x786C5492C4D0>

**output:**
```
0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x786C547D3150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels, with colors represented by numbers (0-9). The output appears to be a single number, also within the 0-9 range, corresponding to a single color. The specific colors in the input grid are white (0), azure (8), and red (2).  The input has regions, contiguous blocks of color and shape. The output is just a single pixel of color white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 7]  # Height, Width
      colors: [0, 2, 8] #white, red, azure
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: int (0-9)
          position: [row, col]
  - type: output
    properties:
     value: 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a grid of pixels with different integer colors.
2. The entire input grid is reduced to a single pixel. The color or value of the pixel is based on some property of the input.
3. It appears that the most common color, the background, becomes the output. In this case, white (0)


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
