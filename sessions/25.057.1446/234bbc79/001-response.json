The input and output grids have different dimensions. The colors in the input grid seem to be replaced or removed based on certain rules, resulting in the output grid. There's a noticeable reduction in the number of columns and rows. Specific colors seem to trigger changes, and the spatial arrangement of colors appears crucial. Gray (5) and Blue (1) seem to play central roles in this process, while white pixels are ignored.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This reduces the width of the grid. Do not remove the entire column.\n3.  **Preserve Blues:** Preserve the values, in the same positions, of the blue pixel(s) where the value is 1.\n4. Preserve Reds: Preserve red pixels that were adjacent to the removed gray pixels.\n5. All other pixels are converted to white(0)\n\nEssentially, the transformation removes gray pixels and shifts to the left, preserving blue pixels, and reds that were next to gray.\n"
