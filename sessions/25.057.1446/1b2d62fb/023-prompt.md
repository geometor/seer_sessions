Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Find all pixels that are blue (1) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Height:** The output grid's height is determined by the rows containing blue pixels. If a row has a blue pixel, the corresponding row index in the output will be azure.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with dimensions (determined height) x 3, filled with white (0).
4.  **Place Azure Pixels:** For each row in the input containing a blue pixel, set the corresponding row's center pixel (index 1) in the output grid to azure (8).
5.  **Handle Empty Cases:** If there are no blue pixels in the input, return an empty 0x3 grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
