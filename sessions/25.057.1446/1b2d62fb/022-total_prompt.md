Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central blue column:** Find the vertical column of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create an output grid:** Initialize a 5x3 output grid filled with white (0).
3. **Determine the adjacent pixels in input** Find the direct left and right neighbors of each pixel in the central column from the input grid.
4.  **Translate Neighbors to Output:**. In the *output grid*, change the color of the pixels corresponding to those positions in the input grid to azure (8), except for the first row where all is white.
5. **Other Input Pixels**: All other color pixels in input are transformed to white pixels in output at same position.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focused on identifying a central blue column and placing azure pixels to its left and right in a new 3xN grid. This approach worked for the first example, but the subsequent examples reveal a more complex transformation. The core issue is that the size, position, and existence of a central blue column is not consistent. The code makes many assumption which limit success on examples other than example 1.

The strategy for resolving these issues is to:

1.  **Re-evaluate Core Assumptions:** The "central blue column" concept is too restrictive. We need to shift to a more general concept of identifying blue pixels, their positions, and their neighbors. The size output should derive from the position of the blue pixels.
2.  **Object-Oriented Approach:** Focus on *all* blue pixels as individual objects.
3. **Output Size:** recognize that the output grid is consistently 3 wide, but
   must derive the height from the position of the blue pixels
4.  **Conditional Logic:** Account for variations where adjacent positions of
    input do not exist.
5.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensure the updated natural language program and corresponding code correctly handle all training examples, not just the first one.

**Metrics and Observations**

To accurately assess the current state and guide improvements, let's use
`code_execution` to gather information about the inputs, expected outputs, and
actual outputs of the current `transform` function.

    # Find the column index where all elements are blue (1)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for j in range(cols):
        if all(grid[:, j] == 1):
            return j
    return -1  # Return -1 if no such column is found

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find the central blue column
    blue_column_index = find_blue_column(input_grid)

    if blue_column_index != -1:
        # Iterate through each row
        for i in range(rows):
            # Set pixels adjacent to the blue column to azure (8), handling edge cases.
            if i > 0:
              if blue_column_index > 0 :
                  output_grid[i, 1 - (3- (blue_column_index-0)) ] = 8
              if blue_column_index < cols - 1:
                  output_grid[i, 1 + (blue_column_index + 1 - blue_column_index) ] = 8

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
