Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts a subgrid centered on the central, solid-color column of the input grid. 
The subgrid's height matches the input's height. 
The central column's values are then mapped: 1 becomes 8, and all other values become 0. 
These mapped values are placed in a centered column of the output grid, 
with the mapped '1' (now 8) at the center row. The rest of the output is filled with 0s.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
