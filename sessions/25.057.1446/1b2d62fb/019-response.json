The input grid appears to have a central column of blue (1) pixels. The other pixels are maroon (9) or white (0). The output grid seems to extract and modify a portion of the input. The output consists of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The azure pixels in the output seem to correspond to locations adjacent to the central blue column in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In the *output grid*, change the color of the pixels corresponding to those positions in the input grid to azure (8), except for the first row where all is white.\n5. **Other Input Pixels**: All other color pixels in input are transformed to white pixels in output at same position.\n\nIn simpler terms, the program creates a 5x3 output. The central column of the input is essentially \"removed\", leaving its immediate neighbors to each side. The neighbor pixels become azure, the removed central blue pixels, along with the maroon pixels, become white. The white in the input stays white.\n"
