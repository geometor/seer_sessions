Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the central blue line and the concept of transforming columns to its left and right. However, the code only works for the first example and fails on subsequent examples. The primary reason for failure is that the blue line is not always in the same column (index 3) as assumed initially, nor does it exist in all examples. The size and colors of the columns targeted for transformation are also dependent on the location of the blue pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Blue Line Detection:** The `find_blue_line` function is a good start, but needs to be improved to reflect the actual location, as opposed to presuming column index 3. We should continue to refine the logic to make it more robust, considering the different cases.
2.  **Handle Missing Blue Line:** The code needs to handle cases where a continuous vertical blue line is *not* present.
3.  **Generalized Transformation:** The transformation logic needs to be less rigid. Instead of always replacing maroon with white and white with azure, the code should be flexible and accommodate different colors and contexts. The color changes and output grid dimensions seem directly related to objects adjacent to the vertical line.
4.  **Example-Driven Refinement:** We will meticulously analyze *each* training example, noting the input, expected output, *and* the actual output of the current code. This will reveal specific shortcomings and guide iterative improvements.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**

I'll use `numpy` to help analyze the grids and produce accurate reports.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(train_set, transform_func):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(train_set):
        input_np = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_np = np.array(expected_output)
        actual_output = transform_func(input_grid)
        actual_np = np.array(actual_output)
        
        blue_line_col = find_blue_line(input_np)
        
        results.append({
            "example_index": i,
            "input_shape": input_np.shape,
            "expected_output_shape": expected_np.shape,
            "actual_output_shape": actual_np.shape,
            "blue_line_col": blue_line_col,
            "matches_expected": np.array_equal(expected_np, actual_np)
        })
    return results

# Assuming 'train' variable holds the training examples
# Example usage (replace with actual 'train' data):
train = [
    (
        [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]],
        [[8, 0, 8], [8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8], [8, 0, 8]],
    ),
    (
        [[0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]],
        [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]],
    ),
    (
        [[9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 1, 9, 9]],
        [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
    ),
    (
      [[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]],
      [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ),
    (
        [[0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]],
        [[0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]],
    )
]

analysis = analyze_results(train, transform)
for result in analysis:
    print(result)

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify a Vertical Blue Line:** Examine the input grid to find a vertical line composed entirely of blue (1) pixels. If no such line exists, skip to step 4.
2.  **Create Output Grid.** If the vertical blue line exists, create a new grid with the same height as the input grid, and with width of 3.
3.  **Transformation (Blue Line Case):**
    *   **Left Column:** Select the column immediately to the left of the blue line. Transform it based on the colors present, replacing only the colors that also appear adjacent to the blue line with white.
    *   **Center Column:** Transform the blue line itself by replacing all blue pixels with white.
    *    **Right Column:** Select the column immediately to the right of the blue line. Transform this column based on colors adjacent to the blue line, replacing them with the white and other colors as indicated in the examples.
4.  **No Vertical Blue Line Case:** If no continuous vertical blue line is found, perform one of the following actions:
    * If any blue is present, change all pixels to white.
    * If there is no blue present, return the original grid.

This revised program accounts for the variations observed across all training examples, including the case where no blue line is present. The next step, in the coder phase, would be to update the python function to align with this revised description.
