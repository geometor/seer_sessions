The input grid contains a vertical line of blue (1) pixels, surrounded by maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid appears to extract and simplify information from the input grid, focusing on the presence and location of certain colors. Specifically, only white and Azure(8) are in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note its column index (starting from 0). in this case, 3.\n2.  **Extract and check first element**: Get the first row element from the input\\_grid, and see it's color.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** if the color of the checked element is not 0, take the row index, change the input\\_grid color 1 to 8, and fill that column with the new color. else, fill with 0.\n4. The height of the output grid is same to the input grid.\n\nEssentially, the program detects a specific feature (the blue vertical line) in the input, and map the feature with new value into output.\n"
