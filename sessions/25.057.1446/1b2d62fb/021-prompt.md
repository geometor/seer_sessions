Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central blue column:** Find the vertical column of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create an output grid:** Initialize a 5x3 output grid filled with white (0).
3. **Determine the adjacent pixels in input** Find the direct left and right neighbors of each pixel in the central column from the input grid.
4.  **Translate Neighbors to Output:**. In the *output grid*, change the color of the pixels corresponding to those positions in the input grid to azure (8), except for the first row where all is white.
5. **Other Input Pixels**: All other color pixels in input are transformed to white pixels in output at same position.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
