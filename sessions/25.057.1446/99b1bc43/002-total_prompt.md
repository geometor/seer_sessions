## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
4 4 4 4
0 2 0 2
0 0 0 2
2 0 0 2
2 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x786C54B102D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 3 3
3 3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C54B112D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a variety of colors and a larger size compared to the output grid, which seems to have fewer colors and is smaller in dimensions. There's a clear reduction in both size and color variety. The output grid appears to focus on consolidating and homogenizing areas of the input grid. It picks certain regions and transforms everything there to green and the rest to white.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is 9x4 (rows x columns) and contains pixels of colors:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - yellow (4)
  - observation: |
      The output grid is 4x4 and contains pixels of colors:
        - white (0)
        - green (3)
  - observation: |
        The size is reduced
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x4
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [0, 3]
  - relationship: |
      The bottom right 2x2 block in the input grid (all yellow) becomes a 2x2 green block at the lower right corner of the output grid.
  - relationship: |
      The upper part of the image is all converted to white
  - action: size_reduction
    description: The input grid's dimensions are reduced.
  - action: color_homogenization
    description: Regions of the input grid are converted to a single color (green or white) in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate the 2x2 block at the bottom right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Transform Target Region:** Change all pixels within this 2x2 block to green (color code 3). Copy the region to the output grid.
3.  **Fill Remaining Area:** Fill the upper area of the output grid with white (color code 0).

In essence, the rule seems to be: Check the color in the last two rows and last two columns of the input grid, change this block to color 3 in the output grid. Fill the upper region of the output grid with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
