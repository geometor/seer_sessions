objects:
  - description: Connected regions of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      - shape: Defined by the arrangement of contiguous pixels of the same color.
      - size: Number of pixels in the region.
      - position: Initial implementation uses the top-left pixel's coordinates.
actions:
  - find_regions: Identify all distinct connected regions in the input grid.
  - map_colors: Initially assumed mapping to green, but likely needs to preserve original color.
  - determine_output_size: Currently fixed at 4x4, needs to be dynamic.
  - reconstruct: Create an output grid based on the identified regions and potentially their relative positions, sizes and complete shape.
