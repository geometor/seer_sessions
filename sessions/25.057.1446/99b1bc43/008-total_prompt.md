## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0
4 4 4 4
0 2 2 2
2 0 2 0
2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x786C54B112D0>

**output:**
```
3 0 3 3
0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0
3 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C548833D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain distinct colored regions. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, possibly focusing on a specific color or pattern within the input. The colors in the input are blue (1), white (0), yellow (4), and red (2). The output grid contains only green (3) and white (0). It seems the transformation highlights a relationship between the top and bottom parts.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x4
      colors: [blue, white, yellow, red]
      regions:
        - color: blue
          coordinates: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,1], [3,2]]
        - color: white
          coordinates: [[0,2], [0,3], [1,1], [1,3], [2,2], [3,0], [3,3],[5,0],[6,1],[7,1],[8,1]]
        - color: yellow
          coordinates: [[4,0], [4,1], [4,2], [4,3]]
        - color: red
          coordinates: [[5,1],[5,2],[5,3],[6,0],[6,2],[6,3],[7,0],[7,1],[7,2],[7,3],[8,0],[8,1],[8,2],[8,3]]

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [green, white]
      regions:
          - color: green
            coordinates: [[0,0], [0,2], [0,3], [3,0], [3,3], [2,2]]
          - color: white
            coordinates: [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,1],[3,2]]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The input grid is larger than the output grid."
  - type: transformation
    description: "The input grid is transformed into the output grid."
  - type: correspondence
    description: "Regions or patterns in the input grid might correspond to colors in the output grid."
  - type: partition
    description: "The input grid is made from a top part, and a bottom part."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Partition:** Divide the input grid into two main horizontal sections: the top section (rows 0-3) and the bottom section (rows 4-8).

2. **Top part and Bottom Part comparison**: Check if color in top part is different to bottom part, vertically
   *  If yes, replace with green(3)
   * If no, replace with white(0)

3.  **Output:** The output grid represents, the comparison between the two parts.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
