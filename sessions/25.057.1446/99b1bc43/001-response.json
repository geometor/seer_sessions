The input grid appears to have a variety of colors and a larger size compared to the output grid, which seems to have fewer colors and is smaller in dimensions. There's a clear reduction in both size and color variety. The output grid appears to focus on consolidating and homogenizing areas of the input grid. It picks certain regions and transforms everything there to green and the rest to white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Copy the region to the output grid.\n3.  **Fill Remaining Area:** Fill the upper area of the output grid with white (color code 0).\n\nIn essence, the rule seems to be: Check the color in the last two rows and last two columns of the input grid, change this block to color 3 in the output grid.
