Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code attempts to identify colored regions in the top-left quarter of the input grid, map specific colors (blue, yellow, red) to green, and reconstruct a 4x4 output grid. The initial strategy was focused on the top-left, but the other training examples show this isn't universally true. The approach of using Depth First Search (DFS) to find connected regions is sound. The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Quadrant Restriction:** The code unnecessarily restricts the search to the top-left quadrant. This is incorrect for some examples.
2.  **Size and shape assumption:** it is only handling some of the shapes.
3.  **Output Size:** The output grid is fixed at 4x4, which isn't always correct, sometimes it is 3x3 and one is 2x2.
4.  **Color Mapping:** Although consistent across examples, the specific mapping (blue, red, yellow -> green) might be a coincidence of the first example and not a general rule. More likely we should keep the input color.
5.  **Relative Positioning:** While the code tries to preserve relative positions, it does not account for all objects, sizes and locations.

**Strategy for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Quadrant Restriction:** Allow the region finding (DFS) to operate on the entire input grid.
2.  **Determine Output Size Dynamically:** Infer output grid size from the regions in the input, perhaps looking for maximum distance between object starts.
3.  **Handle multiple objects:** All of the training set inputs have exactly three objects - look for three, otherwise look for a rule for the number.
4.  **Revisit Color Mapping:** Keep input colors, unless there are counter examples.
5.  **Improve relative positioning and shape reproduction:** Consider all cells, not just the first two

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using `code_execution`)**

I will use manual inspection to provide initial information. I will need the `code_execution` tool for any dynamic checks.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x11
    *   Output: 4x4
    *   Result: Correct. Identified blue, yellow, red regions; mapped to green; placed correctly.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 15x15
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Result: Incorrect. The output size should be 3x3, and the colors in the output should be the original colors, not all green. The shapes are not correctly produced.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 11x11
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Result: Incorrect. Similar issues to Example 2. Wrong output size, incorrect color mapping, and doesn't place it correctly.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Result: Incorrect. This test case includes orange, not mapped, so the output should have had some orange in it.
*   **Example 5:**
        *   Input: 6x6
        *   Output: 2x2
        *   Result: Incorrect.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: Connected regions of non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
      - shape: Defined by the arrangement of contiguous pixels of the same color.
      - size: Number of pixels in the region.
      - position: Initial implementation uses the top-left pixel's coordinates.
actions:
  - find_regions: Identify all distinct connected regions in the input grid.
  - map_colors: Initially assumed mapping to green, but likely needs to preserve original color.
  - determine_output_size: Currently fixed at 4x4, needs to be dynamic.
  - reconstruct: Create an output grid based on the identified regions and potentially their relative positions, sizes and complete shape.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Scan the entire input grid to find all distinct connected regions (objects) of non-white pixels. Each region is defined by its color and the set of coordinates of its constituent pixels.
2.  **Count Objects:** Determine the number of objects found (there are exactly three non-white colors in the training input).
3.  **Determine output size:** Determine output grid size based on relative positions of the region start coordinates. Max row and max col of those positions.
4.  **Preserve Colors:** Maintain original colors.
5.  **Reconstruct:** Create a new output grid. For each identified region in the input, replicate the full shape and color into the correct position in the output grid, using relative positions of the top-left corner of each region.

This revised natural language program addresses the identified shortcomings by removing the quadrant restriction, making the output size dynamic, revisiting the color mapping strategy, and focusing on object reconstruction.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
