## Example 4

**input:**
```
1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1
4 4 4 4
0 2 2 2
0 2 2 2
2 0 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x786C5492C4D0>

**output:**
```
3 3 0 0
0 3 3 0
0 3 3 3
3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x786C5492CA50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains multiple colors, while the output grid seems to consolidate or summarize regions of the input grid with a single color (green, represented by '3') and white (represented by '0'). There's a clear reduction in dimensions. The input seems to be divided into distinct blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9x4] # input grid
      elements: [0, 1, 2, 4] # white, blue, red, yellow
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [4x4] # output grid
      elements: [0, 3]    # white, green
  - type: block # inferred object
    properties:
        input_location:
         - top_left
         - top_right
         - center_left
         - center_right
         - bottom_left
         - bottom_right
relationships:
  - type: corresponds_to
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: block

actions:
    - type: compress_and_fill_non_zero
    parameters: none # will need to be refined
    agent: unknown_program

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide** the input grid into six blocks. Based upon the input, it will consist of four 3x1 and two 1x4, and the order:
    *   first block consists of rows 1-3 and column 1
    *   second block is rows 1-3 and column 2
    *   third block is rows 1-3 and column 3
    *   fourth block is rows 1-3 and column 4
    *   fifth block is rows 4 and columns 1-4
    *   sixth block is rows 5-9 and columns 1-4
2.  **Check** each element in the block.
3.  **Output generation**: Build a corresponding output grid.
    *   if one of the blocks contain number other than zero, make one corresponding element with `3`.
    *   otherwise make the element with `0`.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
