      transformation: "Compare corresponding cells in top and bottom sections.  If colors are the same, output 0. Since all input cells are color 5, and comparison is same vs. same, the output grid is all 0."

      transformation: "Compare corresponding cells. Different colors result in 3, same colors result in 0. The last column has a color change (5 vs 0) at row 8 (last row), which aligns with the last row in output (row 3), resulting in a 3 in the output grid. The prediction is wrong because it does not detect change in color."
