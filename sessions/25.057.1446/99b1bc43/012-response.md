"""
1.  **Partitioning:** The input grid is conceptually divided into two sections.  The output grid's dimensions seem to derive from a fixed value of 4x4, but this may require adjusting with more test.

2.  **Comparison:** The program compares cells from the top and the bottom section. It appears the row index should not be offset. The comparison is performed between `top_section[i,j]` and `bottom_section[i,j]`

3.  **Output:**
    *   If the colors of the compared cells are the same, the corresponding output cell is 0 (white).
    *   If the colors of the compared cells are different, the corresponding output cell is 3 (green).

4. **Output Size** The output grid size is always 4x4.

5. **Applicability:** The comparison only happens within the bounds of the output grid (4x4).  Input values outside these bounds do not directly affect the output, though they are used in the comparisons.
