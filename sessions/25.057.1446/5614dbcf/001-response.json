The input grid appears to be composed of colored blocks. The output grid seems to select specific colors from the input and arrange them in a specific layout and size and seems to remove the gray colored parts. It picks the corner colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Create 3x3 Output: Make empty 3 x 3 output\n4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Place these colors at equivalent positions in a new, smaller 3x3 grid. Maintain relative positioning. Add a white cell between the corner values.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the color of the corner blocks from the input grid and places those corner colors, with white in between, into output grid.\n"
