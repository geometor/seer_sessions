## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 0 0 0 8 8 8
3 3 3 0 0 0 8 5 8
3 3 3 0 0 0 8 8 8
0 0 0 7 5 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
6 6 6 0 0 5 9 9 9
6 6 6 0 0 0 9 9 9
6 5 6 0 5 0 9 9 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x786C54881950>

**output:**
```
3 0 8
0 7 0
6 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54B032D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to be composed of colored blocks. The output grid seems to select specific colors from the input and arrange them in a specific layout and size and seems to remove the gray colored parts. It picks the corner colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [large (input), small (output)]
      elements: colored_pixels
      arrangement: rectangular
      colors: [green, white, azure, orange, grey, magenta, maroon]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - select:
      criteria: color, top-left corner, top-right corner, bottom-left corner, bottom-right corner.
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid

  - arrange:
    criteria: specific layout (3x3)
    in: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains many colored_pixels
  - output_grid contains a subset of colored_pixels from input_grid
  - colored blocks are adjacent
  - the background appears to be white and gray

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corner Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify four distinct colored blocks located at the corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right).
2.  **Select Corner Colors:** From each identified corner block, select a representative color.
3.  Create 3x3 Output: Make empty 3 x 3 output
4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Place these colors at equivalent positions in a new, smaller 3x3 grid. Maintain relative positioning. Add a white cell between the corner values.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the color of the corner blocks from the input grid and places those corner colors, with white in between, into output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
