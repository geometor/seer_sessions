"""
1.  **Divide Input into Blocks:** The input grid is conceptually divided into vertical blocks. The presence of uniform color vertical lines indicates a boundary, but the absence of such lines doesn't prevent block division. The number of block is consistent across input examples.

2.  **Encode Blocks:** Each block is encoded into a single digit.
    *   All blocks of all training data can be divided into 6 blocks
    *  The output value in each position is an encoding of all rows of pixels in the corresponding block.

3.  **Construct Output:** The output is a single-row grid where each element is the encoded value of the corresponding input block.
