Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Divide Input into Vertical Blocks:** Divide the input grid into vertical blocks. The width of each block is not fixed and must be determined dynamically (e.g. by detecting vertical separators, such as continuous vertical black line).
2. **Determine Block Encoding and Output Row:**
    *   Iterate through the vertical blocks of the input.
    *   Encode each block into a single digit based on patterns with the following rules:
        *   If any row within the block consists entirely of gray pixels, encode the block as 8.
        *   If, in the absence of an all-gray row, any row within the block has white pixels at the second and third positions, encode the block as 2.
        * If a block does not match previous rule, encode as 4.
    * Collect result in an array.
3.  **Construct Output:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by the number of vertical blocks identified and other input properties, not fixed at 3x3. Each array built in previous step creates a row.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
