            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, and thus, do not generalize well to the other examples. The core idea of dividing the input into vertical blocks and analyzing rows within each block seems relevant, but the specific conditions for encoding numbers (8, 2, and 4) and the structure of the output grid need adjustments. The current logic focuses solely on the presence of specific row patterns and a fixed block width, which is too restrictive. We need a more flexible approach that considers variations in block structure and encoding rules.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Block Division:** The fixed block width of 4 is incorrect. We must dynamically determine block boundaries, potentially based on vertical lines or changes in color patterns.\n2.  **Refine Encoding Rules:** The current encoding rules (rows of gray, specific white pixel positions) are not consistent across all examples. We need to identify more generalizable patterns within blocks that dictate the encoded digit, potentially based on color distribution within each block.\n3.  **Adapt Output Structure:** The output is not always a 3x3 grid. The dimensions and structure of the output seem related to input size and detected blocks.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo better understand each example, the following is an overview of what the generated code is producing on each input versus the actual expected output.\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Input:** 30x15 grid. Contains vertical blocks that appear to be of width 4. The second and third cells contains white for the number 2, a full row of grey encodes for number 8, and other block encodes for number 4.\n*  **Expected Output:** 3 x 3 grid: [[4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8], [2, 2, 2]]\n*   **Actual Output:** [[4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8], [2, 2, 2]]\n*   **Result:** Pass\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Input:** 30x15 grid. Contains vertical blocks that appear to be of width 4. The second and third cells contains white for the number 2, a full row of grey encodes for number 8, and other block encodes for number 4.\n*   **Expected Output:** 3 x 3 grid: [[4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8]]\n*   **Actual Output:** [[4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8], [2, 2, 2]]\n*   **Result:** Fail\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   **Input:** 30x27 grid. Contains vertical blocks of various width.\n*   **Expected Output:** 2 x 5 grid: [[8, 8, 8, 2, 8], [8, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n*   **Actual Output:** [[4, 8, 8], [4, 8, 2], [4, 4, 4]]\n*   **Result:** Fail\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_shape: 30x15\n  output_shape: 3x3\n  block_width: 4\n  objects:\n    - type: vertical_block\n      properties:\n        - width: variable, often 4\n        - encoding: based on row patterns\n  actions:\n    - divide_input: vertical blocks\n    - analyze_rows: within each block\n    - encode_number: based on row analysis\n    - construct_output: grid based on encoded numbers\n  encoding_rules:\n    rule_1: all gray row -> 8\n    rule_2: second and third pixels white in a row -> 2\n    rule_3: otherwise -> 4\n  output_structure: 3x3 grid\n\nexample_2:\n  input_shape: 30x15\n  output_shape: 3x3\n  block_width: 4\n    objects:\n    - type: vertical_block\n      properties:\n        - width: variable, often 4\n        - encoding: based on row patterns\n  actions:\n    - divide_input: vertical blocks\n    - analyze_rows: within each block\n    - encode_number: based on row analysis\n    - construct_output: grid based on encoded numbers\n  encoding_rules:\n    rule_1: all gray row -> 8\n    rule_2: second and third pixels white in a row -> 2\n    rule_3: otherwise -> 4\n  output_structure: 3x3 grid\n\nexample_3:\n input_shape: 30x27\n output_shape: 2x5\n objects:\n    - type: vertical_block\n      properties:\n        - width: variable\n        - encoding: based on row patterns\n  actions:\n    - divide_input: vertical blocks\n    - analyze_rows: within each block\n    - encode_number: based on row analysis\n    - construct_output: grid based on encoded numbers\n  encoding_rules:\n    rule_1: all gray row -> 8\n    rule_2: second and third pixels white in a row -> 2\n    rule_3: otherwise -> 4\n  output_structure: Not Fixed.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\n1.  **Divide Input into Vertical Blocks:** Divide the input grid into vertical blocks. The width of each block is not fixed and must be determined dynamically (e.g. by detecting vertical separators, such as continuous vertical black line).\n2. **Determine Block Encoding and Output Row:**\n    *   Iterate through the vertical blocks of the input.\n    *   Encode each block into a single digit based on patterns with the following rules:\n        *   If any row within the block consists entirely of gray pixels, encode the block as 8.\n        *   If, in the absence of an all-gray row, any row within the block has white pixels at the second and third positions, encode the block as 2.\n        * If a block does not match previous rule, encode as 4.\n    * Collect result in an array.\n3.  **Construct Output:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by the number of vertical blocks identified and other input properties, not fixed at 3x3. Each array built in previous step creates a row.\n\n"
