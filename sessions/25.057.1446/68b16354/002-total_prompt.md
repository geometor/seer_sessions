## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 1 2 1 4
4 4 2 4 8
3 7 2 4 8
2 7 7 8 7
8 7 7 4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C54883450>

**output:**
```
8 7 7 4 8
2 7 7 8 7
3 7 2 4 8
4 4 2 4 8
8 1 2 1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C54B102D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored squares, where each color corresponds to a digit (0-9). The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a spatial manipulation. Specifically, it looks like a vertical flip or reflection along the horizontal midline.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements: pixels
      colors: [blue, azure, red, yellow, green, orange]
      values: [8, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7]

actions:
  - type: reflection
    axis: horizontal
    description: Flip the grid vertically along its horizontal midline.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Process:** Reflect the grid vertically across its horizontal midline. This is equivalent to reversing the order of the rows.
3.  **Output:** Return the modified grid, which is the vertical reflection of the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
