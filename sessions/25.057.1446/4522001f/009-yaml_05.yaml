facts:
  - observation: "The presence of green (color 3) objects in the input consistently leads to the creation of green objects in the output."
  - observation: "The output grid dimensions are not a simple multiple of the input dimensions in all cases."
  - observation: "If the input grid contains green, two green objects of the same shape are created"
  - observation: "The size of green objects in the output match the size of green objects in the input"
  - observation: "The top-left green object is created at the top-left of the output grid."
  - observation: "The bottom-right green object is created at the bottom-right of the output grid."
  - observation: "If a color other than green is present, replace the color with green."
  - observation: "If no green is present, do nothing"
  - object: GreenObject
    properties:
      color: 3
      behavior: "Replicated in output"
    rules:
      - "Create one instance at the top-left corner of the output."
      - "Create another instance at the bottom-right corner of the output."
      - "The shape of the output object equals the shape of input object."
