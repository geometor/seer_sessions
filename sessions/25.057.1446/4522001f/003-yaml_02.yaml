observations:
  - example_set: Training
    objects:
      - name: Red Pixels
        description:  Pixels with a value of 2 in the input grid.  These pixels trigger the creation of green blocks.
        properties:
          color: Red (2)
          behavior: Source for transformation
      - name: Green Blocks
        description: 4x4 blocks of green pixels in the output grid.
        properties:
          color: Green (3)
          size: 4x4
          behavior: Appear where there are Red Pixels in input.
    transformations:
      - name: Replacement
        description: All red pixels in the input are replaced with green pixels.
        input_object: Red Pixels
        output_object: Green Pixels
      - name: Expansion
        description:  Each red pixel location in input results in a 4x4 green box in output
        input_object: Green Pixel locations
        output_object: Green Blocks (4x4)
    grid_size_relation:
      - description: Output grid dimensions are 4 times input
      - input_x: input_grid.shape[1]
      - input_y: input_grid.shape[0]
      - output_x: input_grid.shape[1] * 4
      - output_y: input_grid.shape[0] * 4
