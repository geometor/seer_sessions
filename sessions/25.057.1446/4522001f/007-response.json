The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and green (3). The output grid seems to expand the input, predominantly using green (3) and white (0). The red (2) seems to disappear. The position of the green cluster in output grid is not at the same position in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The remaining cells are set to color 0 (white).\n\n"
