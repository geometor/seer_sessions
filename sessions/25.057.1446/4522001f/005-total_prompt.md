Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a reasonable interpretation of the first example, correctly identifying the color change (red to green) and the expansion of the grid. However, it incorrectly calculated size and shape. The provided results reveal inconsistencies in how the expansion and positioning are handled across different input examples. The core issue lies in the assumption of grid expansion being 4 times the input, while the output shape is different for each example.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Output Shapes:** Carefully analyze the relationship between input and output shapes for *each* example. There isn't a simple consistent multiple. Instead it looks like the colored pixel becomes a fixed sized block.
2.  **Refine Block Placement Logic:** The current code assumes that each transformed pixel's top-left corner aligns with a simple multiple of the original pixel coordinates. This needs adjustment to accommodate the actual positioning in the outputs. It's likely about creating fixed size colored blocks.
3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
    The output size and shape are not directly based on the input dimensions alone. Instead the colored regions of the input are replaced by fixed sized regions in the output.

**Metrics and Results Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of the provided examples, including an analysis of the `code_execution` results:

**Example 1:**

*   Input Shape: (3, 3)
*   Output Shape: (8, 8)
*   `code_execution` Result: `{'example_index': 0, 'success': True, 'input_shape': (3, 3), 'output_shape': (8, 8), 'predicted_output_shape': (12, 12)}`
The shapes are not calculated correctly.

**Example 2:**

*   Input Shape: (3, 3)
*   Output Shape: (10, 12)
*   `code_execution` Result:  `{'example_index': 1, 'success': False, 'input_shape': (3, 3), 'output_shape': (10, 12), 'predicted_output_shape': (12, 12)}`
Shapes are off, position is off, but all reds became greens

**Example 3:**

*   Input Shape: (4, 4)
*   Output Shape: (8, 8)
*   `code_execution` Result:  `{'example_index': 2, 'success': False, 'input_shape': (4, 4), 'output_shape': (8, 8), 'predicted_output_shape': (16, 16)}`
Shapes are way off, the output should have been all zeros, except for two 4x4 green squares.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 0
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        shape: single pixel
        position: (0,1) # row, col
    output_objects:
      - color: green
        shape: 4x4 block
        position: (0,0) # Top-left corner
  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        shape: single pixel
        position: (0,0)
      - color: red
        shape: single pixel
        position: (2,2)
    output_objects:
      - color: green
        shape: 4x4 block
        position: (0,0)
      - color: green
        shape: 4x4 block
        position: (6,8)
  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        shape: 2x2 block
        position: (1,1)
    output_objects:
      - color: green
        shape: 4x4 block
        position: (2,2)

transformations:
  - color_change: red -> green
  - shape_change: single_pixel -> 4x4_block
  - position_change: input pixel position determines top-left of the output block

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are red (color value 2).
2.  **Replace with Green Blocks:** For *each* red pixel found in the input:
    *   Change the color to green (color value 3).
    *   Create a 4x4 block of green pixels.
    *   The top-left corner of this 4x4 block in the output grid corresponds to the original location of the red pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Output Dimensions**: Create an output that can contain these blocks.

    * It is not a simple multiplication of input dimensions.
    * The location of the red pixels in the input grid will define the output shape.
    * The output shape will be different in many cases.
4. **All other pixels are black.**

This revised program addresses the core issues:

*   It explicitly states the 4x4 block creation.
*   It clarifies that the *location* of the red pixel, not just its presence, dictates the 4x4 block's position.
*   It handles the case where red pixels are not present (no transformation for that pixel, implicit zero-filling).
*   It includes creating an output grid large enough to handle the transformation.

The key change is treating the red pixels as triggers for creating 4x4 green blocks at the *same* original row and column indices, rather than scaling the entire grid by a constant factor.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
