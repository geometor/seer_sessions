Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Replace**: Change all red (2) pixels in the input grid to green (3).
2.  **Expansion and Replication**: For each green pixel in the modified input grid, create a 4x4 block of green pixels in the output grid. The top-left corner of each 4x4 block corresponds to a cell that had a value of 2 or 3 in the original input. Empty cells are filled with a value of 0. More precisely, the green and red cells in the input map to the top-left corner of the 4 x 4 green areas in the output.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rules."""

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
