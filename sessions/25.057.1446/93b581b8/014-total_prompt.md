## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 6 0 0
0 0 5 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x786C54814C50>

**output:**
```
2 2 0 0 5 5
2 2 0 0 5 5
0 0 3 6 0 0
0 0 5 2 0 0
6 6 0 0 3 3
6 6 0 0 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x786C5456F850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 6x6 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The primary observation is that the input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions, but with a mirrored and possibly rotated or reflected arrangement of certain colored pixels. The non-zero pixels in the center 2x2 block of the input seem to be the key to the transformation. These central pixels are '3', '6', '5', and '2'. Their colors are green, magenta, gray, and red. The output grid duplicates these, with pairs of two-by-two squares.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [6, 6]
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers 0-9

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value
      - position: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: copy_and_reflect
    agent: central_pixels #speculation
    target: output corners

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: adjacency
    between: pixels

  - type: positional_inversion
    relation: mirroring, or reflection/rotation
    between: central_block and 4_corner_blocks #speculation

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Central Block:** Locate the 2x2 block of pixels in the center of the input grid. Note their colors.
2.  **Copy, Rotate or Reflect:** Copy the central area and rotate or reflect 180 degrees.
3. **Construct:** Construct the output by using 4 copies of the 2 x 2 blocks to the 4 corners.
4.  **Fill Remaining:** Any cells not within area described is value '0'.

In essence, the transformation replicates the color and arrangement found in the 2x2 center by mirroring the original center pixels. It looks that diagonally opposite colors are replicated together into the new 2x2 blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
