The primary observation is that the input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions, but with a mirrored and possibly rotated or reflected arrangement of certain colored pixels. The non-zero pixels in the center 2x2 block of the input seem to be the key to the transformation. These central pixels are '3', '6', '5', and '2'. Their colors are green, magenta, gray, and red. The output grid duplicates these, with pairs of two-by-two squares.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note their colors.\n2.  **Copy, Rotate or Reflect:** Copy the central area and rotate or reflect 180 degrees.\n3. **Construct:** Construct the output by using 4 copies of the 2 x 2 blocks to the 4 corners.\n4.  **Fill Remaining:** Any cells not within area described is value '0'.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replicates the color and arrangement found in the 2x2 center by mirroring the original center pixels. It looks that diagonally opposite colors are replicated together into the new 2x2 blocks.\n"
