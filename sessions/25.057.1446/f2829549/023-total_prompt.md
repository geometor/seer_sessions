Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial `transform` function on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made some specific assumptions:

1.  It looked for a vertical blue stripe.
2.  It created a 3xN output grid.
3.  It placed green "mirrored-L" shapes at fixed positions relative to the output grid, not to the blue stripe.

The results show these assumptions are too narrow and don't generalize to other examples. Specifically, we see:

*   **Example 0**: Works as expected.
*   **Example 1**: Should be a 3 x 4 grid. Currently the result is 3 x 3. No blue in
    the input, so blue stripe column is -1. The program outputs the appropriate
    sized white output grid, and does not populate any of the green "mirrored-L" shapes, which is correct.
*   **Example 2**: Should be 3 x 5. No blue in the input, so blue stripe column is -1. The program
    outputs the appropriate sized blank output grid, and does not populate any of the green "mirrored-L" shapes, which is correct.

The main strategy for improvement is to **generalize the transformation rule**. Here's the updated approach:

1.  **Output Grid Size**: The output grid's height is derived from the input grid's height. However, it is important to consider the edge case for small height inputs (h = 1 or h = 2).
2.  **Blue Stripe Detection**: The blue strip detection logic is ok. We should continue to detect vertical blue stripes. The return value of -1 when no blue stripe is found is correct.
3.  **Mirrored-L shape**: There is a green "mirrored-L" shape (two pixels) in each of the train set outputs.
4. **Special Case**: When the blue stripe is not found (case in example 1 & 2) the appropriate size blank output is provided and there are no green pixels.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results from the prompt)**

      output: output_grid

          if (blue_stripe.column_index != -1 AND output_grid.height > 2) 
             output_grid[1,0] = green
             output_grid[0,1] = green
  - place_green_L_bottom:
      input: output_grid, blue_stripe.column_index, input_grid.height
      rule: >
          if (blue_stripe.column_index != -1)
            if (input_grid.height > 1)
               output_grid[height - 2, 0] = green;
               output_grid[height - 1, 2] = green

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Determine its dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Find Blue Stripe:** Scan the input grid to identify a vertical stripe of blue pixels (color 1). Note the column index of this stripe. If no blue stripe is found, the column index is -1.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid and a fixed width of 3. Initialize all cells to white (color 0).
4.  **Conditional Green "L's":**
    *   If a blue stripe *was* found AND the input grid height is greater than 2:
        *   Place an "L" shaped green object (color 3) in the top left of the output grid, such that its corner is at row 1, column 0.
        *   Place a *mirrored* "L" shaped green object in the bottom right of the output grid. The vertical arm should on on the last row and the second to last row and the horizontal arm should extend to the left.
    *   If no blue stripe was found, no other actions are to be performed
    * If a blue stripe was found AND the input grid height is 2:
        * Place a *mirrored* "L" shaped green object in the bottom right of the output grid.
5.  **Return Output Grid:** The output grid is the result of the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
