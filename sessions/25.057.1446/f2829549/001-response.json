The input and output grids have different dimensions. There appears to be a selective replacement of certain colors based on some criteria, potentially related to their spatial arrangement or adjacency. The color 7 (orange) in input becomes 0(white) in output and 1(blue), 5(grey) are replaced with 3(green).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
