1.  **Column Selection:** From the input grid, select columns 3, 5 and 6 (remembering that columns and rows are zero indexed).

2.  **Color Replacement:** In the selected columns,

    *   Replace all instances of color 5 (gray) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instance of color 7 (orange) with color 0 (white)

3. **Output Formation:** Create a new output grid using only the modified selected columns. The dimensions of the output grid will be 4x3 (height x width).

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and generated code were a good starting point, focusing on column selection and color replacement. However, the results on the full training set reveal that the column selection logic is incorrect, and possibly needs to be dynamic based on the row. The color replacement rules, however, appear to be valid. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Re-examine Column Selection:** Analyze the input-output pairs to determine the correct rule governing which columns are selected. It's likely a pattern exists, possibly related to the colors or positions of pixels in the input. It is not a fixed selection of columns.
2.  **Maintain Color Replacement:** Keep the color replacement rules as they currently are, since all the successful outputs follow them.
3. **Dynamic output size:** the output height should match input height. The output width may depend on identifying the correct columns, but seems to be fixed at 3.

**Metrics and Observations (from manual inspection and confirmed with `code_execution` if necessary):**

| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Correct Columns? | Correct Colors? | Notes                                                                             |
| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 4x7        | 4x3         | Yes               | Yes            | Initial example, code works perfectly.                                           |
| 2       | 4x7         | 4x3       | NO               | partial            | Only the first and second row get correctly selected, while third and fourth rows use incorrect columns                                                                 |
| 3       | 4x7        | 4x3       | NO               | partial          | Similar to 2                                                        |

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Column Selection:** Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, select columns based on the row number.
    - Row 0: Select columns 2, 4, and 5.
    - Row 1: Select columns 2, 4, and 5.
    - Row 2: Select columns 1, 4, and 5.
    - Row 3: Select columns 1, 2, and 5.

2.  **Color Replacement:** In the selected columns:
    *   Replace all instances of color 1 (blue) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instances of color 5 (gray) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instance of color 7 (orange) with color 0 (white).

3.  **Output Formation:** Create a new output grid. The dimensions of the output grid will match the height of the input grid and have a width of 3. Copy the modified selected columns into the output grid.

**Next Steps:**

The updated natural language program accounts for the row-dependent column selection. This description will be provided as context for the coder to refine the python function.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
