Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Column Selection:** Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, select columns based on the row number.
    - Row 0: Select columns 2, 4, and 5.
    - Row 1: Select columns 2, 4, and 5.
    - Row 2: Select columns 1, 4, and 5.
    - Row 3: Select columns 1, 2, and 5.

2.  **Color Replacement:** In the selected columns:
    *   Replace all instances of color 1 (blue) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instances of color 5 (gray) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all instance of color 7 (orange) with color 0 (white).

3.  **Output Formation:** Create a new output grid. The dimensions of the output grid will match the height of the input grid and have a width of 3. Copy the modified selected columns into the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly transformed the first example, it failed on subsequent examples. This indicates that the initial program was too specific and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformation. The core issue is that the column selection logic is row-number-dependent, which is not a generalizable pattern across all examples. The color replacement logic, while partially correct, also needs refinement.

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Re-examine all examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs to identify common patterns and relationships that are independent of specific row numbers.
2.  **Generalize Column Selection:** Determine a more general rule for selecting columns, likely based on the presence of certain colors or patterns, rather than fixed row indices.
3.  **Refine Color Replacement:** Ensure the color replacement rules are consistent across all examples.
4. **Test and Validate**: after updating program, re-run the tests.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get better metrics, let's write a function to represent the task and then view each result.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_width = 3
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through rows and apply row-specific column selection and color replacement
    for i in range(output_height):
        if i == 0 or i == 1:
            selected_columns = [2, 4, 5]
        elif i == 2:
            selected_columns = [1, 4, 5]
        elif i == 3:
            selected_columns = [1, 2, 5]
        else:  # Should not happen based on provided examples, but good practice to have
            selected_columns = []

        for j, col_index in enumerate(selected_columns):
            # Color Replacement within selected columns
            if input_grid[i, col_index] == 1:  # blue
                output_grid[i, j] = 3      # green
            elif input_grid[i, col_index] == 5:  # gray
                output_grid[i, j] = 3      # green
            elif input_grid[i, col_index] == 7:  # orange
                output_grid[i, j] = 0      # white

                output_grid[i, j] = input_grid[i, col_index]

    return output_grid.tolist()

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: Input grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - variable_width: True
      - variable_height: True
  - description: Output grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - fixed_width: 3
      - height: Same as input grid
  - description: Columns with specific colors
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 5, 7]  # Blue, Gray, Orange
      - action: Selection and transformation

actions:
  - description: Column selection
    details: Select columns containing colors 1, 5, or 7 in the input grid.
  - description: Color replacement
    details:
      - Replace color 1 (blue) with color 3 (green).
      - Replace color 5 (gray) with color 3 (green).
      - Replace color 7 (orange) with color 0 (white).
  - description: Output creation
    details: Create an output grid of width 3 and the same height as the input. Populate it with the transformed columns. Other values in input become 0 (white) in output

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the input grid and identify columns that contain at least one pixel of color 1 (blue), 5 (gray), or 7 (orange).

2.  **Color Transformation:** In the identified columns:
    *   Change all instances of color 1 (blue) to color 3 (green).
    *   Change all instances of color 5 (gray) to color 3 (green).
    *   Change all instances of color 7 (orange) to color 0 (white).

3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new output grid with a width of 3 and the same height as the input grid.

4. **Populate Output:**
    *   If a column in the input grid was identified in step 1, copy the transformed values from that column into the output grid. The leftmost identified column becomes the first column of output, next identified becomes second, etc.
    *  If a column was not identified in step 1, fill the corresponding cells in output with 0. If there were fewer than 3 identified columns, fill the remaining columns with 0.

5. **Ordering Output Columns**: The order of the selected columns in the output should correspond to their order in the input. The first (leftmost) column in the input that matches our criteria should be the first column in the output, and so on.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
