```python
"""
The transformation identifies a contiguous shape of green (3) pixels and replaces it with an identical shape of magenta (6) pixels. A single magenta (6) pixel in the input acts as a "seed" or indicator for the replacement color, and this seed pixel itself is turned to white(0) in the output. All other white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved replacing a green shape with a magenta shape, using a single magenta pixel as a "seed" and turning the seed into white. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a slightly different, and simpler pattern that doesn't involve a seed, making that part of the logic extraneous. The core concept of replacing one shape by another is valid, however the color and other details are not.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs, focusing on consistent changes and the properties of the involved shapes.
2.  **Identify the actual rule:** Discard the incorrect "seed" concept and identify the true color transformation rule.
3. **Simplify Logic**: Remove extraneous components in program and code.
4. **Update YAML and Program**

**Example Metrics and Results:**

To better understand each example, I'll describe the changes concisely:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Green "L" shape, single magenta pixel.
    *   Output: Magenta "L" shape, white pixel where the magenta pixel was.
    *   **Initial Result:** Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Green "cross" shape, single magenta pixel.
    *   Output: Magenta "cross" shape, white pixel where the magenta pixel was..
    *   **Initial Result:** Correct.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Green square, single magenta pixel.
    *    Output: Magenta Square, white pixel where magenta pixel was.
    *   **Initial Result:** Correct.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: shape
    color_in: green
    color_out: magenta
    description: >
      A contiguous shape of green pixels is transformed.
      The entire shape changes color uniformly.
  - object: seed_pixel # though we know this is probably wrong
    color_in: magenta
    color_out: white
    description: >
      A single magenta pixel, separate from the main shape,
      is transformed to white.
  - constant_pixels:
    color: white
    description: All other white pixels in the input remain unchanged.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shape:** Find the contiguous shape composed of green (3) pixels.
2.  **Transform Shape Color:** Change all pixels within this green shape to magenta (6).
3. **Identify Seed:** Find the single magenta pixel.
4. **Transform Seed Color:** Change this pixel to white.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other white (0) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
