## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x640 at 0x786C54B10650>

**output:**
```
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x640 at 0x786C54B107D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid primarily consists of '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel near the bottom. The output grid alternates between '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) pixels in a checkerboard pattern. The key transformation seems to be a replacement of all '0' pixels with an alternating pattern of '8' and '1', and changing the '1' on the original input with a '1'.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x2).
  - object: Grid: A 2D array of pixels.
  - property: Pixel: A single cell in the grid, represented by an integer (0-9).
  - property: Color:  Each integer corresponds to a specific color (0: white, 1: blue, 8: azure).
  - action: Replacement: '0' pixels in the input are replaced in the output.
  - action: Alternating Pattern:  The replacement follows an alternating '8' and '1' pattern.
  - observation: The single '1' (blue) pixel in the input corresponds to '1' (blue) in same position of the output
  - relationship: positional correspondence of blue pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Iterate:** Traverse the grid cell by cell, row by row.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   If the current cell value is '0', replace it based on its position:
        *   If the sum of the row index and column index is even, replace it with '8'.
        *   If the sum of the row index and column index is odd, replace it with '1'.
    *   If the current cell value is not a zero, simply copy it over to same position in the output
4. **Output**: Return the new grid.

Essentially all zero values are replaced with alternating 8 and 1 values based on even or odd row + col, and original non zero values are retained in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
