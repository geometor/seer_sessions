The input grid is mostly filled with '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel near the bottom. The output grid replaces the '0's with a repeating pattern of '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) and the '1' in the input grid with a '8'. There is an alternating diagonal pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
