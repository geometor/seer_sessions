Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies two key aspects of the transformation:

1.  Changing all white (0) pixels to azure (8).
2.  Manipulating blue (1) pixels.

However, the initial approach of creating a cross-shaped pattern centered on *a* blue pixel is not entirely accurate. The provided examples show that a single line can be a valid form, if the single line equals the number of blue pixels. It only implemented a cross, not other shapes. The core issue is that the code assumes *a single* blue pixel and creates a cross around *it*. The examples show this isn't always the case – there can be multiple, potentially non-contiguous, blue pixels, and output shape can match the number of input pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Accurate Blue Pixel Handling:** Instead of finding *a* blue pixel, we need to find *all* blue pixels.
2.  **Shape/Pattern Recognition.** The current program uses the first found blue to determine all pixels. This approach is incorrect. We must instead, place the blue pixels on the output to match the locations of all blue pixels on the input.
3. **Background Transformation**: Ensure consistent background transformation (white to azure).

**Metrics and Observations (from provided code output):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid, one blue pixel.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid, azure background, one blue pixel.
    *   Predicted Output: Correct.
    *   Observation: The initial cross logic, by chance, works correctly when a single, central blue pixel exists.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid, three contiguous blue pixels in a horizontal line.
    *   Expected Output: 5x5 grid, azure background, three contiguous blue pixels.
    *   Predicted Output: Correct.
    *   Observation: The initial cross logic, by chance, works correctly when contiguous blue pixels in line equal to size exists.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid, two non-contiguous blue pixels.
    *   Expected Output: 5x5 grid, azure background, two non-contiguous blue pixels.
    *   Predicted Output: Correct.
    *   Observation: The cross generation is applied, and, by chance, works correctly.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    color_before: white (0)
    color_after: azure (8)
    action: replace all pixels
  - object: blue_pixels
    color: blue (1)
    input_locations: variable
    output_locations: same as input locations
    action: maintain location, copy
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Change all white (0) pixels in the input grid to azure (8) in the output grid.
2.  Identify the locations of all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Copy all blue pixels to same location in output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
