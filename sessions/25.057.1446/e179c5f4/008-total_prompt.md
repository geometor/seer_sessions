## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x640 at 0x786C54B107D0>

**output:**
```
8 1 8
1 8 8
8 1 8
8 8 1
8 1 8
1 8 8
8 1 8
8 8 1
8 1 8
1 8 8
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid is mostly filled with '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel near the bottom. The output grid replaces the '0's with a repeating pattern of '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) and the '1' in the input grid with a '8'. There is an alternating diagonal pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 10x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Mostly filled with '0' (white), one '1' (blue) pixel.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 10x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Filled with '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) in an alternating diagonal pattern.
  - action: replace_color
    parameters:
      - input_color: 0
        output_color: [8,1] alternating.
      - input_color: 1
        output_color: 8
  - relationship:
      - object1: input_grid
      - object2: output_grid
      - type: transformation
      - description: The input grid's single '1' pixel is replaced with 8. Zero's are replaced by '1' and '8' forming an alternating pattern of diagonals.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Locate '1':** Find the single blue pixel ('1') in the input grid.
3.  **Replace the '1' value by '8'.**
4. **Iterate Through Grid:** Go through each cell of the input grid.
5.  **Replace '0' Values:**
    *   Replace every '0' (white) pixel based on the sum of its row and column indices.
    *   If the sum of row and column is even replace it by '8'.
    *   If the sum of row and column is odd replace it by '1'.

In summary, the transformation replaces the single '1' with '8' and replaces all '0' based on a diagonal pattern of '1' and '8' based on location.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
