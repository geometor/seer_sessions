Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Green Rows**: Find any horizontal row containing one or more green (3) pixels.
3.  **Check for Vertical Adjacency:** For each green row identified, inspect the rows directly above and below it.
4.  **Conditional Row Transformation:** If *any* red pixel (2) is found in a vertically adjacent row (directly above or below any green pixel in the green row), change *all* green pixels (3) in that identified green row to azure (8).
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of a transformed green row retain their original values.
6.  **Output:** Create an output grid reflecting these changes.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
