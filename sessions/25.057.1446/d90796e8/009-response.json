            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined strategy.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on the adjacency of green (3) and red (2) pixels. However, the provided examples, especially example 3, suggests there is more to the logic than the simple presence of a red neighbor. Specifically the entire row of 3's changes to 8's. It's crucial to revise the natural program to handle all of the training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Go through each example, paying close attention to the *before* and *after* states. Identify *all* changes.\n2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Instead of just checking for *any* adjacent red pixel, we need to understand the context that triggers a change.\n3. **Action**: Capture the new knowledge in facts and a revised program.\n\n**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations:**\n\nSince I don't have direct code execution capabilities, I'll describe what *would* be done and provide expected outputs based on manual inspection of the image.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with a single green (3) pixel in the center, surrounded by black (0) pixels except for one red (2) pixel adjacent to it.\n    *   Expected Output: The green pixel changes to azure (8).\n    *   Actual Output (from provided code): The green pixel changes to azure (8).\n    *   **Observation**: Works as the initial rule stated.\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: 6x6 grid with green and red pixels interspersed, with a single red pixel in a center surrounded by 4 green pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: The green pixels directly adjacent to the red change to azure (8).\n    *   Actual Output (from provided code): The green pixels directly adjacent to the red change to azure (8).\n    *   **Observation**: Still correct.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: 9 x 8 Grid. There is one solid horizontal line of 3's on Row 4. There is a single 2 on Row 5, Col 6.\n    *   Expected Output: Entire row of 3's change to 8's.\n    *   Actual Output (from provided code): The one green adjacent to the red turns to 8.\n    *   **Observation**: **Incorrect**. The current rule only accounts for single 3's connected to 2's. It fails to account for the more complex arrangement here. This is a significant deviation, suggesting a broader rule application. The rule should be adjusted to account for the fact that if a 2 is adjacent to *any* 3 in a row, *all* 3's in that row are replaced by 8's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"6d58a25d\"\n  - example_count: 3\n  - input_objects:\n      - object_1: green pixels (value 3)\n      - object_2: red pixels (value 2)\n  - object_properties:\n      - green:\n          value: 3\n          shape: individual pixel or horizontal line\n      - red:\n          value: 2\n          shape: individual pixel\n  - transformation_trigger:  Presence of a red pixel (2) vertically adjacent to *any* pixel in a horizontal green (3) row.\n  - transformation_action: Replace *all* green pixels (3) on that row with azure pixels (8).\n  - other_pixels: Retain original values.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Green Rows**: Find any horizontal row containing one or more green (3) pixels.\n3.  **Check for Vertical Adjacency:** For each green row identified, inspect the rows directly above and below it.\n4.  **Conditional Row Transformation:** If *any* red pixel (2) is found in a vertically adjacent row (directly above or below any green pixel in the green row), change *all* green pixels (3) in that identified green row to azure (8).\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of a transformed green row retain their original values.\n6.  **Output:** Create an output grid reflecting these changes.\n"
