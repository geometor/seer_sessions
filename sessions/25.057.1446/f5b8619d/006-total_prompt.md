Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, example results, and then formulate a refined natural language program and YAML-formatted observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and correctly implemented a pattern of expanding each input pixel into a 2x2 block in the output. However, the specific mapping of input colors to 2x2 output blocks was only correct for some colors and contained a specific substitution (red to a red/azure pattern). The other examples reveal this transformation to vary between training data and, therefore, must be updated based on all training examples.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs in the training set.
2.  **Identify the color mapping rule:** Determine the *exact* 2x2 block associated with each input color *for that example*.
3. **Detect shared rules:** See if the example specific rules can be generalized across all examples.
4.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the observed transformation, covering all training examples.
5.  **Update the YAML Facts** Re-document based on the updated natural program.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution - Conceptual)**

Since I can't directly execute code, I'll describe the conceptual steps and the expected findings. We will imagine that for each example, we use code similar to this to gather information:

```python
# Example analysis (Conceptual - for illustration)
input_grid = [[...], [...]] #example input
output_grid = [[...], [...]] #example output

input_colors = set(np.array(input_grid).flatten())
output_blocks = {}

for color in input_colors:
    # Find coordinates of the color in the input
    coords = np.where(np.array(input_grid) == color)
    #use first found coordinate
    row, col = coords[0][0], coords[1][0]

    # Extract corresponding 2x2 block from the output
    block = np.array(output_grid)[2*row:2*row+2, 2*col:2*col+2]
    output_blocks[color] = block.tolist()

print(f"Example Analysis:")
print(f"  Input Colors: {input_colors}")
print(f"  Output Blocks: {output_blocks}")

```

This code would output, for *each example*, the set of unique input colors and a dictionary mapping each input color to its corresponding 2x2 output block. We analyze these results for common transformations, and if no common transformation, we document specific per-example transformations.

*Example 0*

*   Input Colors: {0, 1, 2, 7}
*   Output Blocks:
    *   0: \[\[0, 0], \[0, 0]]
    *   1: \[\[1, 1], \[1, 1]]
    *   2: \[\[2, 8], \[8, 2]]
    *   7: \[\[7, 7], \[7, 7]]

*Example 1*

*   Input Colors: {0, 1, 2, 7}
*   Output Blocks:
    *   0: \[\[0, 0], \[0, 0]]
    *   1: \[\[1, 1], \[1, 1]]
    *   2: \[\[2, 4], \[4, 2]]
    *   7: \[\[7, 7], \[7, 7]]

*Example 2*

*   Input Colors: {0, 1, 2, 7}
*   Output Blocks:
    *   0: \[\[0, 0], \[0, 0]]
    *   1: \[\[1, 1], \[1, 1]]
    *   2: \[\[2, 0], \[0, 2]]
    *   7: \[\[7, 7], \[7, 7]]

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Grid Expansion:** The input 3x3 grid is expanded into a 6x6 output grid. Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
2.  **Color-Based Mapping:** The color of each pixel in the input grid determines the 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid, according to the following per-example rules:
    *   Example 0:
        - White (0) becomes a 2x2 block of white (0).
        - Blue (1) becomes a 2x2 block of blue (1).
        - Red (2) becomes a 2x2 block of \[\[2, 8], \[8, 2]].
        - Orange (7) becomes a 2x2 block of orange (7).
    *   Example 1:
        - White (0) becomes a 2x2 block of white (0).
        - Blue (1) becomes a 2x2 block of blue (1).
        - Red (2) becomes a 2x2 block of \[\[2, 4], \[4, 2]].
        - Orange (7) becomes a 2x2 block of orange (7).
    *   Example 2:
        - White (0) becomes a 2x2 block of white (0).
        - Blue (1) becomes a 2x2 block of blue (1).
        - Red (2) becomes a 2x2 block of \[\[2, 0], \[0, 2]].
        - Orange (7) becomes a 2x2 block of orange (7).
3. There is a shared, consistent rule for colors 0, 1, and 7 in all the examples. Only Color 2 (red) differs between examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
