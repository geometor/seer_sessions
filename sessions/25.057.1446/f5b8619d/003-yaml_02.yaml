task: 0792e507
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is expanded into an output grid where each input pixel is replaced by a 2x2 block of pixels.
  - input_grid_size: 3x3 #All example input sizes
  - output_grid_size: 6x6 # All example output sizes
  - pixel_mapping:
      red: |
        [[2, 8],
         [8, 2]]
      white: |
        [[0, 0],
         [0, 0]]
      orange: |
        [[7, 7],
         [7, 7]]
      blue: |
        [[1,1],
         [1,1]]
  - expansion_rule: |
      Each pixel at (i, j) in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block at (2i, 2j) in the output grid.
  - test_input_size: 3x3
