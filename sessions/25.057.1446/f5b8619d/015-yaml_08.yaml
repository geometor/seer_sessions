observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid: 2x2
      output_grid: 4x4
      white_expansion: Correct
      non_white_expansion: |
        The non-white pixel (4) is expanded into a 2x2 checkerboard.
        The checkerboard uses the original color (4) and azure (8).
  - example_2:
      input_grid: 2x2
      output_grid: 4x4
      white_expansion: Correct
      non_white_expansion: |
          The non-white pixel (5) uses a 2x2 checkerboard using 5 and 6.
          The positions where we previously inserted 8 is now replaced by color 6.
  - example_3:
      input_grid: 2x2
      output_grid: 4x4
      white_expansion: Correct
      non_white_expansion: |
        The non-white pixel (6) expands to a 2x2 checkerboard of 6 and 1.
        The position where we previously inserted 8 is now replaced by 1.
