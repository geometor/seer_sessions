The input grid contains a single colored pixel (yellow, represented by the number 4) in the top right corner, with the rest being white (represented by 0). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input. The single yellow pixel in the input seems to be replaced by a 2x2 block in the output. Within that 2x2 block an alternating checkerboard like expansion exists, a yellow pixel and a newly introduced azure pixel (value 8).  The white pixels in the input remain as the background and are expanded.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
