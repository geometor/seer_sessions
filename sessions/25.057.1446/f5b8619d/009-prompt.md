Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (from 6x6 to 12x12).

2.  **Replicate, with offset:** For every '5' (grey pixel) in the input:
    * Place a corresponding '5' in the same relative, upscaled, position in the output grid. Specifically, an input '5' at (row, col) corresponds to a '5' output at (row\*2, col\*2).

3.  **Frame Create:** Fill a two pixel border all of the value '8' around the perimeter of the output grid.

4.  **Fill Adjacency of replicated 5s:**
    * Place a single 8 on the row above and row below an existing 5, in the same column.
    * Place a single 8 on the column left and right of an existing 5, in the same row.

5. **Fill Remainder:**
    * all empty cells are to have value of 8

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
