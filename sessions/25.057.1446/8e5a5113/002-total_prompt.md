## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 2 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
4 1 1 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
4 4 1 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C547D3ED0>

**output:**
```
1 1 2 5 4 4 1 5 1 4 4
4 1 1 5 4 1 1 5 1 1 4
4 4 1 5 1 1 2 5 2 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C54708350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x11 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x11 grid, seemingly derived from the input grid, also with single-digit integers (0-9).
*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as individual objects. There appear to be a blue object, yellow and object, red object and some grey and white colored cells that are part of the background.
*     **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of the colors (and therefore potential "objects") are important. We see mirroring and shifting of colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [3, 11]
    elements:
      - color_blocks: [[1,1,2,5], [4,1,1,5], [4,4,1,5]]
      - background: [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: [3, 11]
    elements:
        - color_blocks: [[1,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,1,4,4], [4,1,1,5,4,1,1,5,1,1,4], [4,4,1,5,1,1,2,5,2,1,1]]
  - observation: The left section [1,1,2,5] , [4,1,1,5], [4,4,1,5] of the input grid, is mirrored in the output grid.
  - observation: The input contains two "L-shapes", one constructed of blue and red pixels on top of each other and the other one of blue and yellow.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into two sections: a left section containing four columns from index 0, and a right section containing seven columns from index 4.

2.  **Mirror the objects:** Within the output grid, copy the objects of the input's left section, reflecting them across a central vertical axis to construct a horizontally mirrored pattern.

3.  **Fill the background:** fill the central part with the objects of the right section.

4.  **Construct shapes:** The core transformation involves creating a new, interwoven color pattern in the output from the 2 L-shaped color blocks, by adding mirror images of each color block.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
