            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed with a mirroring/reflection concept around a vertical line of gray (5) pixels. However, the results show that this approach is only partially correct and fails to fully capture the transformation rule, particularly in cases where the input grid dimensions change. The second training example highlights a critical flaw: the code doesn't correctly handle the absence of reflection when the shapes are already symmetrical. The key is to not always perform a reflection.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the Core Transformation:** Shift the focus from a fixed reflection to a conditional reflection. The transformation should check if reflection is *needed*.\n2.  **Analyze the Results from `analyze_results`**: Examine the `results` dictionary to get specifics about the successes and failures in all examples. The number of differences and locations of difference is helpful, but can also be derived in code.\n3.  **Conditional Execution:** The natural language program and the Python function must only reflect pixels across the gray line if they are not the same.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating insights from the provided `results` and manual inspection:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 11)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 11)\n    *   Transformed Shape: (3, 11)\n    *   Success: `False`\n    *   Differences: Many differences are apparent.\n    *   Observation: The initial assumption of mirroring around the gray line is incorrect for a significant part of the grid. There is a need to handle other colors separately, perhaps as a conditional copy.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 9)\n    *    Transformed Shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Success: `False`\n    *   Differences: Many differences\n    *   Observation: Similar to example 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 7)\n    *    Transformed Shape: (3, 7)\n    *   Success: `True`\n    *   Differences: No differences.\n    *   Observation: Because the output is the same as the input, the mirroring does not change the result.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      - colors: [0, 1, 5, 8] # Colors present in the grids\n      - dimensions: variable # Width and height can change\n\n  - name: gray_line\n    type: vertical line\n    properties:\n      - color: 5\n      - role: potential axis of reflection\n\nactions:\n  - name: reflect_if_needed\n    description: >-\n      Conditionally reflect the non-gray pixels across the gray line. Reflection only occurs\n       if the corresponding cell on the \"other side\" of the gray line is\n      different. If the cell on the other side of the gray line does not exist, copy it.\n    inputs:\n      - grid\n    outputs:\n      - transformed_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Pivot:** Find the vertical line composed of gray (5) pixels. This line serves as a potential axis of reflection.\n2.  **Conditional Reflection:** For each row, examine the pixels to the right of the gray line.\n    *   If a corresponding pixel exists to the left of the gray line (at the same distance from the gray line), and if that pixel color is different than the pixel on the right, then set the color of the cell to the left to be the same as the one on the right.\n    * If a corresponding pixel does not exist to the left, extend the source pixel to the left.\n3. If the cells on either side are the same, no action.\n4. If there are two gray columns, treat as 1.\n\nThis natural language program emphasizes the *conditional* nature of the reflection, addressing the shortcomings of the original approach. The program checks the gray vertical line is an axis of symmetry, then either reflects pixels from one side to the other, copies the pixel, or takes no action, depending on the condition.\n"
