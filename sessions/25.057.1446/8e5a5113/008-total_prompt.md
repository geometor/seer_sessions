## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 3 3 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
6 3 3 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
6 3 2 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x786C54709550>

**output:**
```
6 3 3 5 6 6 6 5 2 3 6
6 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 3 3 6
6 3 2 5 2 3 3 5 3 3 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 3x11 grids (3 rows, 11 columns).
*   **Colors:**  Multiple colors are present, identifiable by their integer values (0-9). I can see colors like magenta (6), green (3), red (2), grey (5), and white (0).
*   **Regions:**  There appear to be distinct regions or blocks of color within the grids. The left side of the input grid has a 4x3 block of colors. The right side of the input grid looks like it could be all zeros (white).
*   **Transformation:** The output grid seems to retain the colored region on the left, but the right portion is filled with colors, mirroring and perhaps expanding upon existing colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x11
    input_state: "Contains distinct colored regions, notably a solid block on the left and a seemingly blank (all white/0) region on the right."
    output_state: "Left colored region preserved; right region filled with colors seemingly derived from the left region."
  - type: object
    description: "Colored blocks"
    properties:
      - color: "Varies (6, 3, 2, 5, 0)"
      - shape: "Rectangular, at least on the left side"
      - behavior: "The main left block is preserved, with some of its colors being used to fill the initially empty region."
  - type: action
    description: "Color Propagation/Mirroring"
    details: "Colors from the left block appear to 'expand' or be 'mirrored' into the right, originally empty, section of the grid. The propagation seems color and row specific, with some colors filling multiple cells."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Left Block:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero (non-white) colored pixels on the left side of the input grid. In this case, it's a 4x3 block.

2.  **Preserve Left Block:** Copy the left block of pixels directly to the same position in the output grid.

3.  **Propagate Colors to the Right (Row-wise):** For each row, examine the colors in the identified left block:
    *   Iterate through the colors on each row of the identified left block from left to right
    *   For each color, populate cells of the output to the right of the left block with the same color.
    *   If there is a color change to the left, then repeat the process for the new color, until the end of the row.
    *   If at any step, the colors of the left block are the same, fill all the remaining cells to the right with the color that changed.

In simpler, high-level terms: The left block of colors is kept as is. Then, for each row, colors from left block "fill in" the rest of the row to the right, repeating each color. The colors are replicated in the same relative positions as they appear in the identified left block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
