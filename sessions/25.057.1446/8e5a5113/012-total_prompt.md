"""

    """Finds the bounding box of the leftmost non-zero block."""

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples. The initial code was based on the first training example, and it seems to have generalized well to some, but not all, of the other examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis, focusing on the leftmost non-zero block and repeating its color sequence across each row, is partially correct. It works perfectly for examples where the transformation involves repeating a horizontal pattern from the left. However, it fails when the transformation is different, such as example 4.

Here's a strategy to address the discrepancies:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting specific differences and where the current code's logic breaks down.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Improve the identification of "objects" or patterns. It may not always be the *leftmost* block. Sometimes it could be an entire pattern within rows.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The natural language program (and subsequently the code) may need to incorporate conditional logic. The transformation rule might depend on certain characteristics of the input grid (e.g., dimensions, existence of specific color patterns).
4. **Iterative Refinement:** use a process where we update the natural language program to better align the new observations.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

I'll use a `report` function to detail characteristics. This function is not provided but assumed.

```python
def report(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_counts = {color: np.sum(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}
    print(f"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")
    print(f"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}")
    print(f"  Color Counts: {color_counts}")

for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(zip(task.train_input_grids, task.train_output_grids)):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print("Input:")
    report(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output:")
    report(output_grid)
    predicted = transform(input_grid)
    print("Predicted Output")
    report(predicted)

    if np.array_equal(predicted,output_grid):
        print("Prediction: Correct")
    else:
        print("Prediction: Incorrect")
```

**Natural Language Program**

The core transformation involves identifying a repeating color sequence *within each row* of the input grid and extending that pattern across the entire row, replacing any '0' (white) pixels. If a row contains only '0' pixels, it will still be only '0's.
In cases where there are distinct row patterns, the pattern is shifted to start from the beginning of the row, and '0's may be added to end.

1.  **Iterate through each row** of the input grid.
2.  **Identify the repeating color sequence** : within the row find non-zero colors, up to the first zero after non-zeros start.
3.  **Extend/Repeat Pattern**: Repeat the identified sequence across the entire row to the right, starting from the beginning of the sequence.
4. If the row has a distinct pattern, shift the whole pattern so it starts from the left and fill any remaining cells with '0' if needed.

The previous version of the natural language program assumed a single block defined the repetition for all rows. The key change is the repetition is now *per row*, and we need to find that row's repeating pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
