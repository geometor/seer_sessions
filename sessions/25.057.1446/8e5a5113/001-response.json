There appear to be a blue object, yellow and object, red object and some grey and white colored cells that are part of the background.\n*     **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of the colors (and therefore potential \"objects\") are important. We see mirroring and shifting of colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
