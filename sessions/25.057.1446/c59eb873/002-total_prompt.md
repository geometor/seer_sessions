## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 5 1
5 5 5
2 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C547D31D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5 5 1 1
0 0 5 5 1 1
5 5 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x786C547D3450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The colors in the input grid seem to be preserved and duplicated in the output grid. The output grid appears to be a scaled-up version of the input grid, with each original pixel replicated in a 2x2 block. The scaling factor is consistent across the entire grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: [0, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0] # white, gray, blue, gray, gray, gray, red, gray, white
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 6x6
        elements: [0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0]
    relationships:
      - output_grid is a scaled version of input_grid
      - scaling_factor: 2 (both dimensions)

actions:
  - name: scale_up
    description: Each pixel in the input_grid is replicated to form a 2x2 block of the same color in the output_grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Obtain the input grid's dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Output Grid Creation:** Create a new output grid with dimensions double that of the input grid (2 \* height, 2 \* width).
3.  **Pixel Replication:** Iterate through each cell (pixel) in the input grid. For each cell:
    *   Get the color value of the current input cell.
    *   Calculate the corresponding top-left coordinate in the output grid by multiplying the input cell's row and column indices by 2.
    *   Fill a 2x2 block in the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left coordinate, with the color value from the input cell. The cells to fill will be at these coordinates:
        *    (2\*row, 2\*col)
        *    (2\*row + 1, 2\*col)
        *    (2\*row, 2\*col + 1)
        *    (2\*row + 1, 2\*col + 1)
4. **Return Output:** The resulting output grid is the transformed output.

In essence, the program describes a simple pixel doubling process, expanding the input grid uniformly.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
