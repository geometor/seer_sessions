## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 2
0 8 0 2
0 3 8 2
3 3 8 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x640 at 0x786C546B4450>

**output:**
```
3 3 8 2
0 3 8 2
0 8 0 2
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 2

0 3 8 2
3 3 8 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The most prominent feature is a vertical line of red (2) pixels on the right side. There's a horizontal "finger" of green (3), blue (8), and red (2) pixels extending to the left from the bottom of the red line. The core transformation seems to involve a reflection or "flipping" of this finger, with the rest of the grid (mostly white (0)) remaining unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 4] # Height x Width
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 8] # White, Red, Green, Blue

  - type: line
    properties:
      color: 2 # Red
      orientation: vertical
      position: rightmost_column
      length: 10

  - type: finger
    properties:
      colors: [3, 3, 8, 2]  # two green, one blue, one red
      orientation: horizontal
      base: bottom_of_red_line
      length: 4

actions:
  - type: reflection # or flip
    subject: finger
    axis: horizontal # relative to the finger's base
    result: finger_moves_to_top

relationships:
  - type: connection
    subject: finger
    object: red_line
    location: base_to_bottom
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Structures:** Locate the vertical red line on the right edge of the grid and a horizontal "finger" of pixels (green, green, blue, red) extending leftward from the bottom of the red line.

2.  **Reflection/Flip:** Reflect or flip the "finger" horizontally. Imagine a horizontal line extending leftwards from the connection point of finger and vertical line. The "finger" is flipped across this imagined horizontal line.

3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid, which are mostly white, remain in their original positions.

4.  **Reconstruct:** Reconstruct the output grid with the reflected "finger" and keep the vertical red line as is.

In simple terms the finger is flipped upwards.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
