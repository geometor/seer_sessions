The most prominent feature is a vertical line of red (2) pixels on the right side. There's a horizontal \"finger\" of green (3), blue (8), and red (2) pixels extending to the left from the bottom of the red line. The core transformation seems to involve a reflection or \"flipping\" of this finger, with the rest of the grid (mostly white (0)) remaining unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Imagine a horizontal line extending leftwards from the connection point of finger and vertical line. The \"finger\" is flipped across this imagined horizontal line.\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid, which are mostly white, remain in their original positions.\n\n4.  **Reconstruct:** Reconstruct the output grid with the reflected \"finger\" and keep the vertical red line as is.\n\nIn simple terms the finger is flipped upwards.\n"
