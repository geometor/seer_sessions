Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Find the columns containing the color combinations [9, 3] and [2, 4]. Note their positions.  It appears that 9 and 3 always appear together, and 2 and 4 always appear together.  Let's call the columns with [2,4] c24 and the column with [9,3] c93.

2.  **Vertical Flip within Columns:**  Within the identified columns (c24 and c93), the colored pixels are vertically flipped (inverted) within their respective column. If a column contains both combinations, both sets of pixels are flipped within that column.  Specifically, if there's a vertical line of colored pixels, the order of those colors is reversed in the output.

3. **Column Swap:**  c24 and c93 are swapped.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
