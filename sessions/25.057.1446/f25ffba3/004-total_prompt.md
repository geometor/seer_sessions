"""
The transformation rule is a reflection or mirroring of the grid across a central vertical axis. The right side is mirrored to the left, and the bottom on the top.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_colored_line(grid, colors):
    # Find the vertical line with specified colors
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for c in reversed(range(cols)):  # Iterate from right to left
        col_pixels = []
        for r in range(rows):

    right_colors = [9,3]

    #Flip vertically top with down
    for r_row, r_col, r_color in right_line:
            output_grid[rows - 1 - r_row, r_col] = r_color

    # Mirror the right line to the left side.
    for r_row, r_col, r_color in right_line:
            output_grid[r_row, cols-1-r_col] = r_color
    
    # Mirror the left pixels to the correct location.
    for l_row, l_col, l_color in left_line:
        output_grid[rows-1 - l_row,l_col] = l_color
        output_grid[l_row, cols-1 -l_col] = l_color

    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis about mirroring across a central vertical axis and flipping vertically was partially correct, but needs refinement. The code correctly identifies and manipulates colored vertical lines. However, it seems there are issues with:

1.  **Incomplete Mirroring:** Not all elements from the right side are being correctly mirrored to the left, and vice versa. The initial assumption that the entire right side mirrors the left seems too broad. The mirroring operation needs to consider not only the right-most and left-most colored lines, but potentially other lines.
2. **Vertical Flip Logic.** Not always the top goes to the bottom.
3. **Specificity of colors**: some of the examples don't have some of the colors.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully inspect each input-output pair, paying close attention to *which* parts are mirrored and flipped, and *how* colors and positions change. We will need to run specific tests on the grids.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Improve the identification of "objects" or "lines" beyond just the right-most and left-most.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation might involve conditions based on the presence or absence of certain colors or patterns.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where appropriate):**

I'll perform several checks:

*   Check 1: Dimensions of input and output grids.
*   Check 2. Identify the columns containing [9,3].
*   Check 3. Identify the columns containing [2,4].

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "The input and output grids have the same dimensions."
    details: "All examples show matching dimensions between input and output."

  - description: "Specific columns contain color combinations [9, 3] and [2, 4]."
    details: |
       Example 1: [9,3] in columns 11 and 12 , [2,4] in columns 10 and 11
       Example 2: [9,3] in columns 11 and 12, [2,4] in columns 10 and 11
       Example 3: [9,3] in columns 11 and 12, [2,4] in columns 10 and 11

  - description: "Vertical mirroring and flipping occurs around detected colored lines."
    details: "Pixels of colors 2, 4, 9 and 3 change their position based on the columns identified."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Find the columns containing the color combinations [9, 3] and [2, 4]. Note their positions.  It appears that 9 and 3 always appear together, and 2 and 4 always appear together.  Let's call the columns with \[2,4] `c24` and the column with \[9,3] `c93`.

2.  **Vertical Flip within Columns:**  Within the identified columns (`c24` and `c93`), the colored pixels are vertically flipped (inverted) within their respective column. If a column contains both combinations, both sets of pixels are flipped within that column.  Specifically, if there's a vertical line of colored pixels, the order of those colors is reversed in the output.

3. **Column Swap:**  `c24` and `c93` are swapped.

This revised program accounts for the vertical flipping *within* the identified columns and doesn't assume a complete mirroring of one side to the other.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
