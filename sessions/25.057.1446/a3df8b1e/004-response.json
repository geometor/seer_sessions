            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial `transform` function (not shown, but implied) clearly doesn't capture the complete transformation logic, as evidenced by the `analyze_results` output. The results show mismatches in both shape and values between the actual and expected outputs for at least some examples. My strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Characterize the Mismatches:** Determine *how* the outputs are wrong. Are they completely off, or is there a partial match (e.g., correct colors but wrong positions, correct shape but wrong colors)?  This requires careful visual comparison of the input, expected output, and actual output (which I don't have directly, but I can infer from the `analyze_results` summary).\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:**  The initial program likely focused on simple object detection (e.g., blue pixels). I need to consider more complex objects, relationships between objects, and spatial properties.\n3.  **Iteratively Update the Natural Language Program:** Based on the mismatch analysis and refined object identification, I'll adjust the natural language program step-by-step to be more accurate and comprehensive.\n4. **Consider the prior** Objectness, Goal-directedness, Numbers & counting, and Basic geometry & topology\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nI'll use the provided `analyze_results` data to construct a more detailed understanding. Since I can't directly execute code, I'll have to reason based on the shape and match information.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Shape Match: Not provided, but can be inferred as False if either values or shape are mismatched.\n    *   Values Match: Not provided.\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: Not provided.\n    *   Expected Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   *Observation:* We expect the output shape is (3,3) so the shapes could have matched. We need the Values Match to understand the error.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Shape Match: Not provided, but can be inferred as False if either values or shape are mismatched.\n    *   Values Match: Not provided.\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: Not provided.\n    *   Expected Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   *Observation:* We expect the output shape is (4,5) so the shapes could have matched. We need the Values Match to understand the error.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Shape Match: Not provided, but can be inferred as False if either values or shape are mismatched.\n    *   Values Match: Not provided.\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: Not provided.\n    *   Expected Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   *Observation:* We expect the output shape is (5,5) so the shapes could have matched. We need the Values Match to understand the error.\n\nIt would greatly help the process if the analyze_results function would also output if any values matched.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        elements: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n        color_counts: {0: 8, 1: 1}\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        shape: (3, 3)\n        elements: [[1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1]]\n        color_counts: {0: 2, 1: 7}\n    transformations:\n      - description: \"Blue pixels become part of a checkered pattern of blue and black.\"\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        shape: (4, 5)\n        elements:  [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]\n        color_counts: {0: 10, 1: 10}\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        type: grid\n        shape: (4, 5)\n        elements: [[1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]\n        color_counts:  {0: 10, 1: 10}\n    transformations:\n        - description: \"A checkerboard pattern is already present.
