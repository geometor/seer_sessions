## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x640 at 0x786C546B7350>

**output:**
```
0 1
1 0
0 1
1 0
0 1
1 0
0 1
1 0
0 1
1 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid seems to consist primarily of '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel in the bottom left corner. The output grid has the same dimensions, but the values appear to have changed. The single blue pixel in the input has become a white pixel. There is an alternating pattern.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x2).
  - observation: Input grid contains mostly '0' (white) with a single '1' (blue) at [9,0].
  - observation: Output grid has an alternating pattern of '0' and '1'.
  - observation: Output's first column matches an inverted copy of the input's first column.
  - observation: The second column is the opposite color of its paired cell in the first column.
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [10, 2]
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [10, 2]
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - relationship: output_grid is a transformation of input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **First column inversion:** The first column of the output is the inverse of the first column in the input. Where the input is `1`, the output is `0`, and vice versa.
3.  **Second column complementing:** Each value in the second column of the output is the complement of the value in the first column, that is if the value in column 1 is `1`, then column 2 is `0`, and vice versa.

Essentially, the transformation inverts the first column of the input and then creates a second column in the output that alternates opposite colors with the first column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
