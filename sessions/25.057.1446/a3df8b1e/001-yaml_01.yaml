facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x2).
  - observation: Input grid contains mostly '0' (white) with a single '1' (blue) at [9,0].
  - observation: Output grid has an alternating pattern of '0' and '1'.
  - observation: Output's first column matches an inverted copy of the input's first column.
  - observation: The second column is the opposite color of its paired cell in the first column.
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [10, 2]
