Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial `transform` function (not shown, but implied) clearly doesn't capture the complete transformation logic, as evidenced by the `analyze_results` output. The results show mismatches in both shape and values between the actual and expected outputs for at least some examples. My strategy is to:

1.  **Characterize the Mismatches:** Determine *how* the outputs are wrong. Are they completely off, or is there a partial match (e.g., correct colors but wrong positions, correct shape but wrong colors)?  This requires careful visual comparison of the input, expected output, and actual output (which I don't have directly, but I can infer from the `analyze_results` summary).
2.  **Refine Object Identification:**  The initial program likely focused on simple object detection (e.g., blue pixels). I need to consider more complex objects, relationships between objects, and spatial properties.
3.  **Iteratively Update the Natural Language Program:** Based on the mismatch analysis and refined object identification, I'll adjust the natural language program step-by-step to be more accurate and comprehensive.
4. **Consider the prior** Objectness, Goal-directedness, Numbers & counting, and Basic geometry & topology

**Metrics and Observations**

I'll use the provided `analyze_results` data to construct a more detailed understanding. Since I can't directly execute code, I'll have to reason based on the shape and match information.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Shape Match: Not provided, but can be inferred as False if either values or shape are mismatched.
    *   Values Match: Not provided.
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: Not provided.
    *   Expected Shape: (3, 3)
    *   *Observation:* We expect the output shape is (3,3) so the shapes could have matched. We need the Values Match to understand the error.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Shape Match: Not provided, but can be inferred as False if either values or shape are mismatched.
    *   Values Match: Not provided.
    *   Input Shape: (4, 5)
    *   Output Shape: Not provided.
    *   Expected Shape: (4, 5)
    *   *Observation:* We expect the output shape is (4,5) so the shapes could have matched. We need the Values Match to understand the error.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Shape Match: Not provided, but can be inferred as False if either values or shape are mismatched.
    *   Values Match: Not provided.
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: Not provided.
    *   Expected Shape: (5, 5)
    *   *Observation:* We expect the output shape is (5,5) so the shapes could have matched. We need the Values Match to understand the error.

It would greatly help the process if the analyze_results function would also output if any values matched.

        color_counts: {0: 4, 1: 21}
    transformations:
      - description: "The blue and black colors invert."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** The core transformation seems to involve creating or inverting a checkerboard pattern using blue (1) and black (0)
2. **Invert colors:** If a checkerboard is present, invert the colors.

Here's the complete program:
The input grid is transformed to a grid of the same dimensions with a checkerboard pattern. If a checkerboard of blue and black is present, the colors are inverted.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
