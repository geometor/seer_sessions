"""
1.  **Identify Starting Point:** Find the blue pixel in the input grid. The output diagonal line starts at this location.
2.  **Generate Diagonal:** From the starting point, create a diagonal line of blue pixels.  The line extends upwards and to the right.  For each step, move one row up and one column to the right.
3. **Preserve Other Colors:** Copy all non-blue pixels from the input grid to the exact same positions in the output grid.
4. **Termination:** Continue the diagonal pattern until the edges of the grid prevent moving further up or right.
