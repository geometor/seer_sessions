The input grid predominantly consists of '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel in the bottom-left corner. The output grid retains the same dimensions but has the blue pixels arranged in a distinct pattern - a diagonal line running from the bottom-left to the top-right corner, with a sort of \"cross\" pattern alternating between rows and columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
