  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains at most one blue pixel. If the input grid
      contains no blue pixels, the output is all black.
  - observation: |
      If a blue pixel is present in the input, the output grid has a blue "+"
      (cross) shape.
  - observation: |
      The arms of the blue "+" extend fully to the edges of the output grid.
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The initial single blue pixel is part of the + in the output.
  - observation: |
        The + in the output grid is centered on the row and column of the
        input grid's blue pixel.
