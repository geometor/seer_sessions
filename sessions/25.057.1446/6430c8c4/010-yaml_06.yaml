  - task: "Determine output grid size and populate corners with green."
  - input_objects:
      - description: "Input grid containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels."
        properties:
          - "Blue pixel acts as a marker."
          - "White pixels are background."
  - output_objects:
      - description: "Output grid containing white (0) and green (3) pixels."
        properties:
          - "Green pixels always in corners."
          - "Output size is related to the position of blue pixel in the input, though the original rule hypothesis is flawed."
  - actions:
      - description: "Calculate output grid dimensions based on input."
        details: "The current method, using the row index of the first non-zero element, is incorrect. Must observe the relationship of the number of 0's after the blue pixel"
      - description: "Place green pixels in the four corners of the output grid."
