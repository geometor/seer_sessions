The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify this information, focusing on specific areas and changing the colors. There's a reduction in both dimensions and the number of distinct colors used. The output grid appears to highlight a specific pattern or feature extracted from the input, and replaces the highlighted color with green (3).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
