The colors in the output grid seem to correspond to the central colored region of the input grid, with the surrounding white (0) pixels being removed. The transformation appears to be a form of \"cropping\" or \"extraction\" of the central non-zero colored region, preserving the spatial relationships of the colors within that region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These boundaries define a rectangular subgrid.\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create the output grid by copying the pixel colors from the identified subgrid (core region) of the input grid.
