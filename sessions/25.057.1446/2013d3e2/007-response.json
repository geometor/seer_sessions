The input grid contains a central cluster of non-zero pixels surrounded by zeros. The output grid seems to be a cropped and condensed version of the central non-zero region of the input, with the surrounding zeros removed. The colors and their relative positions are maintained in the output. The two blue pixels in the input disappear.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
