Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are colored azure (8).
2.  **Group:** Organize the azure pixels into contiguous blocks.  Two azure pixels are considered contiguous if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
3.  **Construct:** Create a new output grid that is 3 rows by 6 columns, filled with black (0) pixels.
4.  **Rearrange:** Transfer the azure pixels to the output grid, maintaining the shape and relative positions of the contiguous blocks, fitting them within the 3x6 output.
    - Preserve the relative horizontal and vertical positions. If block A is above block B in the input, it should generally be above or on the same level as block B in the output. If block A is to the left of block B, it should also be to the left (or in the same column) in the output.
    - The internal shape of each contiguous block must be preserved exactly.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
