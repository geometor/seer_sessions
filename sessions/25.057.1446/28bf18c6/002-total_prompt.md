## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x786C5492C2D0>

**output:**
```
8 8 0 8 8 0
0 8 0 0 8 0
8 8 8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x786C546CAED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The primary color observed is azure (8), with a background of white (0). The input grid appears larger and sparser compared to the output grid, which is smaller and more compact. The transformation seems to involve extracting and rearranging the azure pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    values: [0, 8]
    0_color: white
    8_color: azure

  - object: input_grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    description: Contains scattered azure pixels on a white background.

  - object: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    description: Contains a more compact arrangement of azure pixels, seemingly derived from the input grid.

  - action: extraction
    description: Azure pixels are extracted from the input grid.

  - action: rearrangement
    description: The extracted azure pixels are rearranged into a new, smaller grid.

  - relationship: input_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid through extraction and rearrangement of azure pixels.
    
  - observation: shape change
    input shape: L shape
    output shape: Horizontal T shape
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Isolate the azure pixels from the input grid, disregarding their original positions.
3. **Determine Output size**: The size of the compact shape formed by azure pixels are 3 x 6
4.  **Construct:** Create a new grid with the output size.
5.  **Arrange:** Fill the new grid with the extracted azure pixels.
    - Start with the top row. If there were azure pixels touching the top, copy them to the output in similar locations.
    - Next consider the pixels in the input grid that are in a row beneath the top row of azure pixels.
    - Place these pixels in the output grid in a row at the bottom.
    - If any azure pixels remain, place these in the row between the top and bottom rows that you just created.
    - If the azure pixels are not contiguous, ensure that adjacency of any groups of azure pixels in the input is preserved in the output.
6.  The shape of the azure colored pixels is a compact rectangle.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
