## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x786C5497D8D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x786C546B4350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, with most pixels being black (0) and some being azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in the vicinity of the azure pixels. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant. The positions of the azure pixels don't seem to be changed in this task, but some are "replaced" with a blue pixel.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
    dimensions: [7, 7]
  - type: object
    description: Azure (8) pixels form connected components (objects).
  - type: object
    description: Blue (1) pixels appear in output near azure pixels.
  - type: action
    description: Some azure pixels change to blue pixels.
  - type: relationship
    description: The transformation maintains original grid size.
  - type: relationship
    description: Blue pixels are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to original azure pixel locations.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each azure pixel, check:
    *   Was it at the edge of a group, and adjacent to a 0?
    *   If both are true, then replace some of the 8's adjacent to 0's with 1.

The tricky thing here is that the choice of which 8 is changed to a 1 is not well defined, so it will need a rule to determine that. Looking at the data again:


```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0      0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0      0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0      0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0      0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0      0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0      0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0      0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```


The rule appears to be that the "left-most" pixel of an adjacent azure pixel is replaced by blue if the azure object extends in that direction.

So, to refine the natural language program:

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement, by adjacency:**
    *   If there is an adjacent 0 to the right, and no adjacent 8 to the left, change the pixel to 1.
    *   If there is an adjacent 0 below, and no adjacent 8 above, change the pixel to 1.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
