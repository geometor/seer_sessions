The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in the vicinity of the azure pixels. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant. The positions of the azure pixels don't seem to be changed in this task, but some are \"replaced\" with a blue pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
