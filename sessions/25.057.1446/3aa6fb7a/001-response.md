Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, most of which are white (0). There are some azure (8) pixels forming two distinct 2x2 squares, one in the top-left and another in the bottom-right. In the output, a single blue (1) pixel appears within each of the original azure squares. Specifically, the blue pixel replaces one of the azure pixels in the cluster.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains two distinct clusters of azure (8) pixels.
  - object_1:
      type: cluster
      color: azure (8)
      shape: 2x2 square
      location: top-left
  - object_2:
      type: cluster
      color: azure (8)
      shape: 2x2 square
      location: bottom-right
  - transformation: |
      Within each azure cluster, one pixel is changed to blue (1).
  - location_change: |
        The pixel that changes within the top-left cluster is at relative position (1,0) of the object.
        The pixel that changes within the bottom-right cluster is at relative position (0,1) of the object.
  - environment:
    type: 2D grid
    background_color: white (0)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Clusters:** Find all contiguous clusters of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Locate Target Pixels:** Within each identified cluster of azure pixels:
    * In the top-left cluster, find relative position (1, 0).
    * In the bottom-right cluster, find relative position (0,1)
3.  **Change Pixel Color:** Change the color of the pixel at the location specified to blue (1).
4. **Preserve other Pixels:** All other pixels retain their original color.
