            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. The code identifies azure clusters and attempts to change a single pixel within each cluster to blue. The pixel selection logic (top-left vs. bottom-right) is based on the cluster's top-left corner position relative to the grid center, which is incorrect and doesn't generalize. The subsequent test results clearly demonstrate this, showing discrepancies between the predicted and actual outputs. The core issue is the pixel selection rule within the azure clusters.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs in the training set, paying close attention to the azure clusters and which pixels within them change to blue.\n2.  **Identify Correct Rule:** Determine the precise rule governing pixel selection. It's likely not a simple top-left/bottom-right distinction based on grid position. Consider relative positions *within* the cluster, or possibly a consistent offset from a specific corner of the cluster.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the discovered rule.\n4.  **Update and Test Code:** Modify the Python code to implement the new rule and re-test against all training examples.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo get the best information, I need to examine all the examples and use my tools.\nI will use my code_execution tool to do some analysis and create the reports.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_clusters(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds clusters of a specific color in the grid.
