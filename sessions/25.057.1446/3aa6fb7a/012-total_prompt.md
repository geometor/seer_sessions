Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. The tests show that this program works perfectly for the first and second example, and it mostly fails on the third example. This indicates the initial hypothesis, while partially correct, doesn't capture the complete rule. The primary issue seems to be related to conditions based on the *leftmost* pixel of an azure region. The success of the first two examples indicates the core concept of identifying contiguous azure regions and altering them based on adjacency to white pixels is valid, but edge conditions weren't perfectly determined.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Careful Re-examination of Examples:** We need to meticulously re-examine *all* the training examples, paying very close attention to the third example.
2.  **Focus on the Failing Case:** We need to analyze the *third example* and precisely describe how the current logic fails.
3.  **Refine the Trigger Condition:** The core of the update will be adjusting the conditions under which an azure region is changed to blue.
4. **Hypothesize and Document:** Formulate a clear description of this trigger.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

To fully characterize the transformation, let's write python code snippets. We'll save useful metrics in dictionaries.

```python
import numpy as np

# Helper function to find contiguous regions (from original code)
def get_contiguous_region(input_grid, start_r, start_c, visited, target_color):
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    region = []
    stack = [(start_r, start_c)]

    while stack:
        r, c = stack.pop()

        if (r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or
            visited[r, c] or input_grid[r, c] != target_color):
            continue

        visited[r, c] = True
        region.append((r, c))

        stack.append((r + 1, c))
        stack.append((r - 1, c))
        stack.append((r, c + 1))
        stack.append((r, c - 1))
    return region

**Example 3 Analysis and Output:**

```
[{'region': [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)], 'leftmost_pixel': (1, 1), 'topmost_pixel': (1, 1), 'above_leftmost': (0, 1), 'pixel_above_color': 0, 'left_of_topmost': (1, 0), 'pixel_left_color': 0, 'region_changed': False}]
```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_region
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
      - shape: variable
    actions:
      - change_color:
          to: blue (1)
          condition: "adjacent_to_white"

conditions:
   adjacent_to_white:
     description: "An azure region changes color if a white pixel is located directly above *any* pixel in the azure region"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels. A contiguous region is a group of azure pixels connected horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Check for White Pixel Above:** For each azure region, check if *any* pixel within the region has a white (0) pixel directly above it.
3.  **Transform if Condition Met:** If any pixel within an azure region has a white pixel directly above it, change *all* pixels in that azure region to blue (1).
4.  **Otherwise No Change:** If the condition in step 3 is not met, the azure region remains unchanged.

**Key Changes and Explanation:**

The crucial change is from requiring a white pixel *above the leftmost pixel* to requiring it *above any pixel* in the region. The original logic was too restrictive. The code and report for the third example shows a contiguous block of azure that does *not* change, and the white pixel is above the region, but *not* directly above the left most pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
