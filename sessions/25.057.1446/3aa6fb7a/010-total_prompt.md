Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on the relationship between azure (8) pixels and adjacent white (0) pixels. However, the tests on subsequent training examples reveal that the rule is incomplete.  It correctly identifies *some* azure pixels to change to blue, but it misses others. The core issue seems to be that it doesn't fully capture the *directional* and *contiguous* nature of the transformation. The existing rules consider direct adjacency (right and below), but a more comprehensive check of surroundings might be needed, and there may be constraints the current logic is not addressing. It captures part of the pattern, but not all of it.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will meticulously examine each input/output pair, focusing on:
    *   Where the code's prediction matches the expected output.
    *   Where the code's prediction *differs* from the expected output (both false positives and false negatives).
    *   The spatial relationships between azure pixels, white pixels, and other colors in the *neighborhood* of the changed pixels.
    *  The edge cases.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll revise the natural language program to describe the transformation more accurately. I anticipate this will involve:
    *   Clarifying the conditions under which an azure pixel is changed to blue.
    *   Possibly considering longer chains of adjacent azure pixels.
    *   Considering a "propagation" of the blue color from the identified starting pixels.
3. **Iterative improvement**: repeat the process, gathering more facts and
   hypotheses until the transform function correctly transforms all input to
   the expected output.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To provide quantitative data, I'll describe the mismatches. Let's define:

*   **True Positive (TP):** An azure pixel correctly changed to blue.
*   **False Positive (FP):** A pixel incorrectly changed to blue (wasn't azure, or shouldn't have been changed).
*   **False Negative (FN):** An azure pixel that should have been changed to blue, but wasn't.
*   **True Negative (TN):** An azure pixel correctly left unchanged, or any non-azure pixel.

I cannot execute the python code, so I will do a manual analysis and count.
I will visually compare my generated output with the provided output images.

*Example 1*
- The code correctly handles this case
- TP = 6
- FP = 0
- FN = 0
- TN = all others

*Example 2*
- TP = 4
- FP = 0
- FN = 4
- TN = all others
Here we see that the `transform` did correctly identify and transform 4 of the
azure pixels to blue. However it failed to transform 4 others.
The 4 that were incorrectly transformed were in the top right corner, at
the end of a contiguous block of azure pixels that had a white pixel above the
left-most azure pixel.
It appears that the rule should apply to the *entire* contiguous block, or none.

*Example 3*
- TP = 2
- FP = 0
- FN = 7
- TN = all others
Here we see similar behavior to example 2. The code only transformed the
two azure pixels at the bottom, adjacent to a white pixel. The other 7 were
not changed. It appears there may be a directionality component.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_region
    description: Contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - adjacency: Can be adjacent to white (0) pixels.
      - shape: Can be various shapes, horizontal or vertical lines.
      - transformation: Parts or all of the region may change to blue (1).
  - object: white_pixel
    description: White (0) pixels
    properties:
      - adjacency: determines when and which azure_regions are transformed
  - action: transformation_rule
    description: >-
      Azure pixels are changed to blue based on adjacency to white pixels. If an azure region is
      adjacent to a white pixel either above the left-most pixel, or to the
      left of the top-most pixel, the *entire* contiguous block of azure pixels is changed to blue.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.  These blocks can be horizontal, vertical, or a combination.
2.  **Check for Trigger Condition, horizontal:** For each azure region, check if the pixel *above* the *left-most* azure pixel is white (0).
3.  **Check for Trigger Condition, vertical:** For each azure region, check if the pixel to the *left* of the *top-most* azure pixel is white (0).
4. **Transformation**: If *either* trigger condition exists, change *all* pixels in the entire contiguous azure region to blue (1).

The previous program checked for the white pixel to be only to the *right* or *below* and applied this transformation rule only to the single, adjacent azure pixel.

The revised program changes the focus to check adjacency with the *entire region* of continguous azure pixels, not just individual azure pixels. It checks the trigger condition at the *start* of each region, not on each pixel. It then transforms the *entire* region if the conditions are met.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
