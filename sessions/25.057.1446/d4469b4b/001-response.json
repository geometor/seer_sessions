The central 3x3 subgrid seems important. The output values are a condensation of the input.\n* **Colors:** the output uses only colors that are present in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If red is found in any of these, it \"flags\" the corresponding output pixel as gray. The result is a 3x3 grid representing the original with grey where a red pixel was present.\n"
