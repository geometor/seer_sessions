examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input:
      objects:
        - shape: rectangle
          color: blue
          bounding_box: (3, 5, 3, 5)  # From code execution
          notes: This forms the central region we initially focused on.
        - shape: frame
          color: white
          notes: Surrounds the blue region.
      relationships:
        - The blue region is enclosed by the white frame.
      transformations:
        - type: extract_and_recolor
          details: The blue region within input is extracted. Blue becomes gray.
          result: The output grid is smaller than the input. Blue becomes gray.
    output:
      objects:
      - color: gray
        shape: cross
        bounding_box: (0,2, 0, 2)

  - example_id: 2
    input:
      objects:
        - shape: rectangle
          color: blue
          bounding_box: (3, 5, 3, 5)
          notes: Same as example 1
        - shape: frame
          color: white
          notes: Surrounds the blue region.
      relationships:
        - The blue region is enclosed by the white frame.
      transformations:
        - type: extract_and_recolor
          details: The blue region is extracted, and the blue pixels become gray.
          result: output grid is smaller, blue becomes gray
    output:
      objects:
        - shape: cross
          color: gray
          bounding_box: (0, 2, 0, 2)
          notes:  Same as example 1.

  - example_id: 3
    input:
      objects:
        - shape: rectangle
          color: blue
          bounding_box: (2, 4, 2, 4) # From Code Execution
          notes: Similar to examples 1 & 2, but within a smaller overall grid.
        - shape: frame
          color: white
          notes: Surrounds the blue region.
      relationships:
        - The blue object is enclosed by a white frame.
      transformations:
        - type: extract_and_recolor
          details: The blue region is extracted, and the blue pixels become gray
          result: Output is smaller, blue becomes gray.
    output:
      objects:
        - shape: cross
          color: gray
          bounding_box: (0, 2, 0, 2)  #From code execution

      transformations:
        - type: extract_and_recolor
          details:  The blue region is extracted, and the blue color becomes gray.
    output:
