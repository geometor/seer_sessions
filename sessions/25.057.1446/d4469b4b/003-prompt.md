Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Focus:** Consider the central 3x3 region of the input grid.
2. **Subgrids:** iterate the four 2 x 2 subgrids, starting at these corners:
   * top-left: (0,0)
   * top-right: (0,1)
   * bottom-left: (1,0)
   * bottom-right: (1,1)

3.  **Condensation Rule:**
    *   For each 2x2 subgrid in the input, check all pixels.
    *   If any pixel within the 2x2 subgrid is red (value 2), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (value 5).
    *   If all pixels within the 2x2 subgrid are white (value 0), set the corresponding output pixel to white (value 0).
4. construct a new 3 x 3 output grid of the pixels from processing the 2 x 2 subgrids.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
