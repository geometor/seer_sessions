## Example 4

**input:**
```
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C544994D0>

**output:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C5449AED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains only two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output grid contains white (0) and gray (5).  The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input grid. The positions of the gray pixels in the output seem to correlate with regions of high blue pixel density in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: [0, 1]  # white, blue
    properties:
      - color_distribution: varying density of blue and white pixels

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 5]  # white, gray
    properties:
      - color_distribution: represents a summarized version of the input_grid

actions:
  - name: condense
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Condenses the 5x5 input grid into a 3x3 output grid.

relationships:
  - input_output_size: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - color_mapping: Blue (1) in the input often corresponds to gray (5) in the output, white stays as white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide Input:** Divide the 5x5 input grid into nine overlapping 3x3 regions. The centers of these 3x3 regions are one pixel move from each other forming a grid of 3x3 center pixels.
2.  **Check for Blue:** For each 3x3 region in the input:
    *   If the 3x3 region contains any blue (1) pixels, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to gray (5).
    *   If a region contains only white pixels, set the pixel in output to be white (0)
3.  **Output Result:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

In simpler terms, the transformation checks 3x3 overlapping sections of the input grid. If a section contains at least one blue pixel, the corresponding pixel in the smaller output grid is gray; otherwise, it's white. This effectively summarizes the presence of blue pixels within larger regions of the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
