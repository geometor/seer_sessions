            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a 3x3 subgrid and changing red pixels to gray. The tests on the remaining examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. Some examples involve different subgrid sizes, and the color transformation rule isn't consistent. We need to generalize the approach to handle varying subgrid sizes and identify a more robust color transformation rule. The errors mainly come from incorrect application of the 3x3 rule from the first example on the other tasks that have different properties. The color mapping is correct, but which colors map to which seems incorrect.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs to identify common patterns and variations in subgrid sizes and color transformations.\n2.  **Dynamic Subgrid Extraction:** Modify the code to handle potentially different subgrid sizes. It is likely that we will need to determine subgrid based on properties of the input grid.\n3.  **Generalized Color Transformation:** Determine a more general rule for color changes that applies across all examples, it will likely involve some sort of `if` based selection.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code and natural language program after each modification and iterate until all training examples are processed correctly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo understand the transformations better, let's perform a detailed analysis of each example. I'll focus on:\n\n*   Input grid size\n*   Output grid size\n*   Color changes observed\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, along with observations:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Size: 5x5\n*   Output Size: 3x3\n*   Transformation: Red (2) becomes Gray (5). White (0) remains White (0).\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_size: \"5x5\"\n  output_size: \"3x3\"\n  color_transformations:\n    - \"red (2) -> gray (5)\"\n    - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n  notes: \"The initial observation was correct for this example.\"\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Size: 7x7\n*   Output Size: 5x5\n*   Transformation: Blue (1) becomes Red (2). White (0) remains White (0).\n\n```yaml\nexample_2:\n  input_size: \"7x7\"\n  output_size: \"5x5\"\n  color_transformations:\n    - \"blue (1) -> red (2)\"\n    - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n  notes: \"Subgrid extraction logic needs adjustment. Color transformation rule is different.\"\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input Size: 9x9\n*   Output Size: 7x7\n*   Transformation: Green (3) becomes Yellow (4). White (0) remains White (0).\n\n```yaml\nexample_3:\n  input_size: \"9x9\"\n  output_size: \"7x7\"\n  color_transformations:\n    - \"green (3) -> yellow (4)\"\n    - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n  notes: \"Subgrid extraction and color transformation are inconsistent with previous examples.\"\n```\n**Example 4**\n* Input Size: 11 x 11\n* Output Size: 9 x 9\n* Transformation: Gray(5) becomes Magenta(6). White (0) Remains white(0)\n\n```yaml\nexample_4:\n  input_size: \"11x11\"\n  output_size: \"9x9\"\n  color_transformations:\n    - \"gray (5) -> magenta (6)\"\n    - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n  notes: \"Subgrid extraction and color transformation are inconsistent with previous examples.\"\n```\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\noverall_observations:\n  subgrid_pattern: \"Output size is consistently 2 less than input size in each dimension (e.g., 5x5 input -> 3x3 output).\"\n  color_transformation_pattern: \"The center non-white color changes. Each input color maps consistently to an output color, different in each sub example\"\n  white_preservation: \"White (0) always remains unchanged.\"\n\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input_size: \"5x5\"\n      output_size: \"3x3\"\n      color_transformations:\n        - \"red (2) -> gray (5)\"\n        - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n      notes: \"Original rule worked here.\"\n  - example_2:\n      input_size: \"7x7\"\n      output_size: \"5x5\"\n      color_transformations:\n        - \"blue (1) -> red (2)\"\n        - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n      notes: \"Different color transformation.\"\n  - example_3:\n      input_size: \"9x9\"\n      output_size: \"7x7\"\n      color_transformations:\n        - \"green (3) -> yellow (4)\"\n        - \"white (0) -> white (0)\"\n      notes: \"Different color transformation.\"\n  - example_4:\n      input_size: \"11x11\"\n      output_size: \"9x9\"\n      color_transformations:\n        -  \"gray (5) -> magenta (6)\"\n        - \"white(0) -> white(0)\"\n      notes: \"Different color transformations\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** Begin with an input grid of size *N*x*N*.\n2.  **Output Size:** Determine the output grid size as (*N*-2)x(*N*-2).\n3.  **Subgrid Extraction:** Extract the subgrid from the input that corresponds to the output grid size, centered within the input.\n4.  **Identify Non-White Color:** Find the single non-white color present in the extracted subgrid. Let's call this color *C*.\n5.  **Color Transformation:**\n     *   If *C* is red (2), change it to gray (5) in the output grid.\n     *   If *C* is blue (1), change it to red (2) in the output grid.\n     *   If *C* is green (3), change it to yellow (4) in the output grid.\n     *  If *C* is gray(5), change it to magenta(6) in the output grid.\n     *   If a cell is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output.\n6. **Output:** Return the transformed output which has size of Output Size\n"
