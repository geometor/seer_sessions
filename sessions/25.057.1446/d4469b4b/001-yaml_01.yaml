    input: 2x2 subgrid
    output: single pixel
    description:  A 2x2 section of the input grid is converted to a single pixel in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid corresponds to the central 3x3 region of the input grid.
  - type: conditional
    description: If a 2x2 subgrid in the input has a red (2) pixel, the corresponding output pixel becomes gray, and if 2x2 subgrids only has white, the pixel remains white.
