Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Focus:** Consider the central 3x3 region of the input grid.
2. **Subgrids:** iterate the four 2 x 2 subgrids, starting at these corners:
   * top-left: (0,0)
   * top-right: (0,1)
   * bottom-left: (1,0)
   * bottom-right: (1,1)

3.  **Condensation Rule:**
    *   For each 2x2 subgrid in the input, check all pixels.
    *   If any pixel within the 2x2 subgrid is red (value 2), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (value 5).
    *   If all pixels within the 2x2 subgrid are white (value 0), set the corresponding output pixel to white (value 0).
4. construct a new 3 x 3 output grid of the pixels from processing the 2 x 2 subgrids.

           # Check if any pixel in the subgrid is red (2)
           if 2 in subgrid:
              output_grid[i,j] = 5  # Set corresponding output pixel to gray (5)
           else:
              output_grid[i, j] = 0 # keep output as white
    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program focused on a central 3x3 region and condensing 2x2 subgrids. This approach works for the first example, but fails to generalize to the other training examples. The core issue is that the code assumes a fixed output size (3x3) and a specific region of interest (central 3x3) within the input. The examples demonstrate that the input and output grids can be of various sizes, and the transformation logic needs to be more flexible and data-driven, rather than hardcoded to specific dimensions. The strategy for improvement involves two primary parts: determine the output grid dimensions, and generalize the 2x2 sub-grid processing.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the patterns better, let's analyze each example's input/output dimensions and the observed transformations.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Result: Correct. The initial logic works as expected.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 6x6
    *   Output: 4x4
    *   Result: Incorrect. Output should be 4x4, but the code produces a 3x3. The condensation logic seems correct (red becomes gray), but the output size is wrong.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7
    *   Output: 5x5
    *   Result: Incorrect. Output should be 5x5, but the code produces a 3x3. Again, the condensation logic seems right, but the output dimensions are wrong.

The condensation rule (any red in 2x2 becomes gray, otherwise white) appears to be consistent. The output size, from the data observed, is calculated consistently as: output\_dimension = input\_dimension - 2

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 5x5
      output_shape: 3x3
      transformation: "2x2 subgrids condensed: red presence results in gray, else white."
      result: correct
  - example_2:
      input_shape: 6x6
      output_shape: 4x4
      transformation: "2x2 subgrids condensed: red presence results in gray, else white."
      result: incorrect (output size mismatch)
  - example_3:
      input_shape: 7x7
      output_shape: 5x5
      transformation: "2x2 subgrids condensed: red presence results in gray, else white."
      result: incorrect (output size mismatch)
  general_rule:
      output_dimensions: "Input dimensions - 2"
      pixel_transformation: "Iterate all 2x2 subgrids. If any pixel is red, output pixel is gray. Otherwise, output pixel is white."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the output grid dimensions by subtracting 2 from both the input grid's height and width.
2.  **Iterate Subgrids:** Iterate through all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.  The top-left corners of these subgrids will range from (0,0) up to (height - 2, width - 2).
3.  **Condensation Rule:** For each 2x2 subgrid:
    *   If any pixel within the subgrid is red (value 2), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (value 5).
    *   If all pixels within the 2x2 subgrid are white (value 0) or any other non-red color, set the corresponding output pixel to white/0.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the calculated dimensions and filled according to the condensation rule applied to each 2x2 subgrid.

This revised natural language program addresses the identified issues by:

*   Making the output dimensions dynamic and dependent on input dimensions.
*   Generalizing the iteration to cover the entire relevant area of the input grid, rather than a fixed 3x3 central region.
*   Maintaining the core condensation logic identified in the initial analysis.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
