overall_observations:
  subgrid_pattern: "Output size is consistently 2 less than input size in each dimension (e.g., 5x5 input -> 3x3 output)."
  color_transformation_pattern: "The center non-white color changes. Each input color maps consistently to an output color, different in each sub example"
  white_preservation: "White (0) always remains unchanged."

examples:
  - example_1:
      input_size: "5x5"
      output_size: "3x3"
      color_transformations:
        - "red (2) -> gray (5)"
        - "white (0) -> white (0)"
      notes: "Original rule worked here."
  - example_2:
      input_size: "7x7"
      output_size: "5x5"
      color_transformations:
        - "blue (1) -> red (2)"
        - "white (0) -> white (0)"
      notes: "Different color transformation."
  - example_3:
      input_size: "9x9"
      output_size: "7x7"
      color_transformations:
        - "green (3) -> yellow (4)"
        - "white (0) -> white (0)"
      notes: "Different color transformation."
  - example_4:
      input_size: "11x11"
      output_size: "9x9"
      color_transformations:
        -  "gray (5) -> magenta (6)"
        - "white(0) -> white(0)"
