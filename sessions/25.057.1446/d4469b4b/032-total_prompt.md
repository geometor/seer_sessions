## Example 6

**input:**
```
0 2 0 2 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 0 2
2 2 2 0 0
0 0 2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x786C5449BC50>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 5 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x786C54498A50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 5x5 grid with cells containing either 0 (white) or 2 (red).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with cells containing either 0 (white) or 5 (gray).
*   **Dominant Colors:** White and Red in the input, White and Gray in the output.
*   **Shape Change:** The grid shrinks from 5x5 to 3x3.
*  **Center:** The center pixel of the input seem to be the basis for the output
*  **Color Change**: Red(2) seems to transform to gray(5).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: red
        value: 2
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: gray
        value: 5
  - action: transformation
    type: shrink
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
  - observation: color_change
    from:
        color: red
        input_value: 2
    to:
       color: gray
       output_value: 5
  - observation: center_pixel
    description: The center 3x3 subgrid of the input grid is evaluated.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Begin with a 5x5 input grid.
2.  **Locate Center:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid centered within the 5x5 input grid.
3.  **Transform Colors:**
    *   If a cell in the 3x3 subgrid of the input is red (2), change it to gray (5) in the output.
    *   If a cell in the 3x3 subgrid of the input is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output.
4. **Output:** Create the 3 x 3 output grid from the transformed colors

In essence, the program extracts the central 3x3 portion of the input grid and changes all red pixels within to gray, keeping the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
