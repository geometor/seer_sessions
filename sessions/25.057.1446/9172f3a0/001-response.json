The input grid appears to be a compressed representation of the output grid. Each non-zero pixel in the input grid expands into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid. Zero-valued pixels in the input grid also expand to 3x3 blocks of zeros in the output grid. The spatial relationships between the colors in the input are perfectly maintained in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This determines the dimensions of the output grid.\n\n2.  **Iterate:** For each pixel in the input grid:\n\n3.  **Expand Non-Zero Pixels:** If the pixel's value is not zero, create a 3x3 block in the output grid. The top-left corner of this block corresponds to the position of the current input pixel, scaled by 3 (e.g., input pixel at (0,0) corresponds to output block starting at (0,0), input at (0,1) maps to output at (0,3) etc.). Fill this entire 3x3 block with the value (color) of the input pixel.\n\n4.  **Expand Zero Pixels:** If the pixel's value is zero, create a 3x3 block in the output grid, using the same positional mapping as above. Fill this entire 3x3 block with the value 0.\n5. The relative position between all pixels will be conserved after expanding.\n\nIn essence, the program takes each pixel in the input grid and expands it into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid, maintaining the spatial relationships.\n"
