Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: (3, 7)
  objects:
    blue:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]
    gray:
      - shape: irregular
        positions: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
output_grid:
  size: (3, 3)
  objects:
    red:
      - shape: single cell
        positions: [(1, 1)]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct colored objects: blue (1) and gray (5).

2.  **Focus Object:** The key to the transformation seems to be the gray object.

3.  **Center Extraction:** The output grid is a 3x3 extraction centered around the gray (5) colored cells in the input. However, not all gray cells are treated equally. The transformation centers on the vertically-middle gray cell (1,3).

4.  **Color Change:** The central gray cell (1, 3) in the input grid becomes red (2) in the output grid. All other cells in a new 3x3 grid centered on the central gray position become white(0).

**Step-by-step transformation description:**

1. Locate the vertical middle gray cell, if multiple gray columns exist, pick the horizontal middle one.
2. Create 3x3 sub-grid centered vertically in the input grid and horizontally on the selected gray position.
3. Change the centered cell into `2`.
4. Fill the rest of the cells in the extracted 3x3 sub-grid with `0`.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
