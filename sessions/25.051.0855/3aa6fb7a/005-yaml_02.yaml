  - description: |
      Identify all objects composed of color 8.
      Place a cell of color 1 directly above the top of each vertical line object of color 8,
       unless there is not color 0 above the azure object.
      Place a cell of color 1 directly to the left of the leftmost cell of each horizontal line object of color 8,
       unless there is not color 0 to the left.
      Preserve all existing objects of color 8.
