Do not add color 1 if a colored cell other than color 0 is above.\n3.  **Horizontal Line Rule:** For each horizontal line object of color 8, place a color 1 (blue) cell directly to the left of the leftmost cell of the object. Do not add color 1 if a colored cell other than color 0 is to the left.\n4.  **Preserve:** Keep the original color 8 objects in their original positions.\n5. **Background:** The background (color 0) is preserved in all other cells.\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input:\n    - object: vertical line\n      color: 8\n      position: (1,1) # (row, col) of top-left cell\n      length: 2\n    - object: horizontal line\n      color: 8\n      position: (3,4)\n      length: 2\n    - background:\n      color: 0\n  output:\n    - object: vertical line\n      color: 8\n      position: (1,1)\n      length: 2\n    - object: horizontal line\n      color: 8\n      position: (3,4)\n      length: 2\n    - object: single cell\n      color: 1\n      position: (1,2)\n    - object: single cell\n        color: 1\n        position: (4,3)\n    - background:\n      color: 0\n\ntransformation_rules:\n  - description: |\n      Identify all objects composed of color 8.\n      Place a cell of color 1 directly above the top of each vertical line object of color 8,\n        unless there is not color 0 above the azure object.\n      Place a cell of color 1 directly to the left of the leftmost cell of each horizontal line object of color 8,\n      unless there is not color 0 to the left.\n      Preserve all existing objects of color 8.\n```\n"
