Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_observations:
  - object_1: [4, at (0,1)]
  - object_2: [9, at (0,3)]
  - object_3: [4, at (2,1)]
  - object_4: [6, at (2,2)]
  - object_5: [1, at (3,0)]
  - colors: {0: 12, 4: 2, 9: 1, 6: 1, 1: 1}
  - dimensions: [4x4]

output_observations:
  - object_1: [4, at (2,1)]
  - object_2: [1, at (3,0)]
  - object_3: [4, at (3,1)]
  - object_4: [6, at (3,2)]
  - object_5: [9, at (3,3)]
  - colors: {0: 12, 4: 2, 6: 1, 9: 1, 1:1}
  - dimensions: [4x4]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains five distinct objects, each represented by a single colored cell: `4` at (0,1), `9` at (0,3), `4` at (2,1), `6` at (2,2), and `1` at (3,0).

2.  **Predicate:** The relevant predicate for each object is its color and its initial position.

3. **Action - Row shift:**
   - Non-zero colored cells are moved, while `0` cells always stay as `0`.
   - The `4` at (0,1) is moved down to (2,1) of the output.
   - The `9` at (0,3) moves down to (3,3) of the output.
   - The other `4` at (2,1) remains in its place (2,1).
   - The `6` at (2,2) moves down to row 3, position (3,2).
   - The `1` at (3,0) remains on row 3.

4.  **Overall Transformation:** Each object is moved to the last row available for its column. If objects have the same column index, stack them on the last rows, preserving relative vertical ordering from the input to output. The first object `4` at (0,1) appears to move two steps down while the second `4` at (2,1) does not move. This indicates that objects in the same column are shifted down to the bottom, keeping the relative order.

In summary, the transformation rule can be described as: "Move all non-zero colored cells to the bottom-most available row within their respective columns, maintaining the input order, and fill empty rows by zeros".

```python
"""

    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each column
    for j in range(cols):
        # Extract non-zero elements and their original row indices
        column_elements = []
        for i in range(rows):
            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:
                column_elements.append((i, input_grid[i, j]))
        
        # Place elements at the bottom of the output column
        for k, (original_row, value) in enumerate(column_elements):
            output_grid[rows - len(column_elements) + k, j] = value

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
