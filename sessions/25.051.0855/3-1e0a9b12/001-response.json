If objects have the same column index, stack them on the last rows, preserving relative vertical ordering from the input to output. The first object `4` at (0,1) appears to move two steps down while the second `4` at (2,1) does not move. This indicates that objects in the same column are shifted down to the bottom, keeping the relative order.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule can be described as: \"Move all non-zero colored cells to the bottom-most available row within their respective columns, maintaining the input order, and fill empty rows by zeros\".\n"
