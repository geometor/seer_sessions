observations:
  - object: gray_cells
    description: Cells with the value 5.  These seem to be the anchor for the transformation.
  - object: subgrid
    description: A 3x3 region centered around a specific gray cell.
  - transformation:
    description: >-
      A 3x3 subgrid is extracted, centered on the vertically middle gray cell. 
      Within this subgrid, the central cell is changed to red (2), and all other cells are set to white (0).
      If the subgrid is not exactly 3x3, only the center of the subgrid is changed to 2, the rest is changed to 0
