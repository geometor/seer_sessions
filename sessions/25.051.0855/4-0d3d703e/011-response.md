Okay, I see the issue. My previous attempt only correctly handled the color mappings in Example 3, and failed on the others. It seems I misinterpreted the "vertical lines" condition and applied the mapping to all cells regardless of the overall pattern. The transformation is a general color substitution, but *not* just for vertical lines. It applies to *all* cells in the grid, regardless of their context.

Here's the corrected natural language description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify the color of each cell in the input grid.**
2.  **Apply a color mapping to each cell individually:**
    *   If the cell's color is 5 (gray), change it to 1 (blue).
    *   If the cell's color is 8 (azure), change it to 9 (maroon).
    *   If the cell's color is 6 (magenta), change it to 2 (red).
    *   If the cell's color is 3 (green), change it to 4 (yellow)
    *   If the cell's color is 1 (blue), change it to 5 (gray)
    *   If the cell's color is 2 (red), change it to 6 (magenta)
    *   If the cell's color is 9 (maroon), change it to 8 (azure)
    *  If the cell's color is 4 (yellow), change it to 3 (green).
3.  **All other colors remain unchanged.** The output grid has the exact same dimensions and structure as the input grid; only the specified colors are substituted.

The error in the previous logic was assuming the color changes only applied to vertical lines. They are universal substitutions.
