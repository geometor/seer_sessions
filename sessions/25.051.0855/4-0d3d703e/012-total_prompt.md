Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping:
1. Identify vertical lines of the same color.
2. Map colors:
   - Replace color 5 (gray) with color 1 (blue).
   - Replace color 8 (azure) with color 9 (maroon).
   - Replace color 6 (magenta) with color 2 (red).
3. Preserve the structure and positions of the lines.

Okay, I see the issue. My previous attempt only correctly handled the color mappings in Example 3, and failed on the others. It seems I misinterpreted the "vertical lines" condition and applied the mapping to all cells regardless of the overall pattern. The transformation is a general color substitution, but *not* just for vertical lines. It applies to *all* cells in the grid, regardless of their context.

Here's the corrected natural language description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify the color of each cell in the input grid.**
2.  **Apply a color mapping to each cell individually:**
    *   If the cell's color is 5 (gray), change it to 1 (blue).
    *   If the cell's color is 8 (azure), change it to 9 (maroon).
    *   If the cell's color is 6 (magenta), change it to 2 (red).
    *   If the cell's color is 3 (green), change it to 4 (yellow)
    *   If the cell's color is 1 (blue), change it to 5 (gray)
    *   If the cell's color is 2 (red), change it to 6 (magenta)
    *   If the cell's color is 9 (maroon), change it to 8 (azure)
    *  If the cell's color is 4 (yellow), change it to 3 (green).
3.  **All other colors remain unchanged.** The output grid has the exact same dimensions and structure as the input grid; only the specified colors are substituted.

The error in the previous logic was assuming the color changes only applied to vertical lines. They are universal substitutions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
