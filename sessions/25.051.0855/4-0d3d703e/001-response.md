Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 1
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 4
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 5
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping or substitution. Each vertical line of a specific color in the input grid is transformed into a vertical line of a corresponding color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement (three vertical lines) and dimensions of the grid remain constant.

Here is a natural language description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, locate each vertical line of cells. Each line consists of cells of the same color.

2.  **Map Colors:**
    *   Replace all cells with color 3 (green) with color 4 (yellow).
    *   Replace all cells with color 1 (blue) with color 5 (gray).
    *   Replace all cells with color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The positions and arrangement of these lines remain unchanged. The overall grid structure and size persist.

**Step-by-step explanation of the transformation:**

*   The green (3) vertical line on the left of the input becomes a yellow (4) line.
*   The blue (1) vertical line in the middle of the input becomes a gray (5) line.
*   The red (2) vertical line on the right of the input becomes a magenta (6) line.
