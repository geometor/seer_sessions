Each vertical line of a specific color in the input grid is transformed into a vertical line of a corresponding color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement (three vertical lines) and dimensions of the grid remain constant.\n\nHere is a natural language description of the transformation rule:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, locate each vertical line of cells. Each line consists of cells of the same color.\n\n2.  **Map Colors:**\n    *   Replace all cells with color 3 (green) with color 4 (yellow).\n    *   Replace all cells with color 1 (blue) with color 5 (gray).\n    *   Replace all cells with color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).\n\n3.  **Preserve Structure:** The positions and arrangement of these lines remain unchanged. The overall grid structure and size persist.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation of the transformation:**\n\n*   The green (3) vertical line on the left of the input becomes a yellow (4) line.\n*   The blue (1) vertical line in the middle of the input becomes a gray (5) line.\n*   The red (2) vertical line on the right of the input becomes a magenta (6) line.\n"
