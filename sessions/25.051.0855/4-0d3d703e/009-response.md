Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 5
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 8
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 1
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 9
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

This transformation, like the previous ones, is a color mapping. The positions of the vertical lines and the grid size are preserved.

Here's the natural language description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the three vertical lines, each of a uniform color, within the input grid.

2.  **Map Colors:**
    *   Replace all cells with color 5 (gray) with color 1 (blue).
    *   Replace all cells with color 8 (azure) with color 9 (maroon).
    *   Replace all cells with color 6 (magenta) with color 2 (red).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The relative positions and overall structure of the lines remain constant.

**Step-by-step explanation of the transformation:**

*   The gray (5) vertical line on the left of the input becomes a blue (1) line.
*   The azure (8) vertical line in the middle of the input becomes a maroon (9) line.
*   The magenta (6) vertical line on the right of the input becomes a red (2) line.
