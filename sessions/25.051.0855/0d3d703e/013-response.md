Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this fourth example.

**Observations and Documentation**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 9
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 4
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 2
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]
output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 8
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]
    - color: 3
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]
    - color: 6
      shape: vertical line
      position: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]

```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

This transformation is another instance of color mapping, preserving the structure and grid size.

Here's the natural language description of the transformation rule:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify the three distinct vertical lines of uniform color within the input grid.

2.  **Map Colors:**
    *   Replace all cells with color 9 (maroon) with color 8 (azure).
    *   Replace all cells with color 4 (yellow) with color 3 (green).
    *   Replace all cells with color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** Maintain the spatial arrangement and positions of the lines; only the colors change.

**Step-by-step explanation of the transformation:**

*   The maroon (9) vertical line on the left of the input becomes an azure (8) line.
*   The yellow (4) vertical line in the middle of the input becomes a green (3) line.
*   The red (2) vertical line on the right of the input becomes a magenta (6) line.
