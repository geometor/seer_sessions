```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping:
1. Identify vertical lines of the same color.
2. Map colors:
   - Replace color 3 (green) with color 4 (yellow).
   - Replace color 1 (blue) with color 5 (gray).
   - Replace color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).
3. Preserve the structure and positions of the lines.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
