"""
The transformation rule is a complete, one-to-one color mapping.  Every instance of a specific color in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding color in the output grid, maintaining the original grid's structure. Here are the specific steps:

1.  Iterate: Examine each cell in the input grid.
2.  Map: For each cell, apply the following color mapping:
    *   If the color is 1, replace it with 5.
    *   If the color is 2, replace it with 6.
    *   If the color is 3, replace it with 4.
    *   If the color is 4, replace it with 3.
    *   If the color is 5, replace it with 1.
    *   If the color is 6, replace it with 2.
    *   If the color is 8, replace it with 9.
    *   If the color is 9, replace it with 8.
    *   If the color is any other value, leave it as it.
3. Preserve Structure: The position of each cell is preserved in output. The overall structure, including vertical lines of the same colors, remains the same; only the color values change.
