Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  dimensions: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: L shape (appears as 4 separate cells)
     - color: 7
      positions: [(5,6),(6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6)]
      shape: a vertical line and adjecent squares


  dimensions: (9, 9)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify initial objects:** In the input grid, we have two single-cell objects: one red (color 2) at position (3, 2) and one blue (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Preserve Singletons:** The single cells of color 2 and color 1 from the input are preserved.

3.  **Color 4 insertion:** For the object of color 2, insert, in the previous row, two objects of color 4, located on the left and on the right of the imaginary vertical line containing the object of color 2. Copy those two objects in the row below the object.

4.  **Color 7 insertion, part 1:** For the object of color 1, insert, in the previous row, a single object of color 7.

5. **Color 7 insertion, part 2:** Insert objects of color 7 in all positions of the 3x3 subgrid centered on color 1, except for the position of the object of color 1 itself.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation rule preserves two single cells (colors 2 and 1), and two groups of objects appear around them.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
