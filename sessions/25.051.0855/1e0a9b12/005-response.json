The colors and their positions are noted in `input_observations`.\n\n2.  **Predicate:** For each object, its color and initial position are its key predicates.\n\n3. **Action- Row shift:**\n      - All of the non-zero elements are moved down within their columns\n      - We preserve the order.\n\n4. **Overall transformation**\n   - The rule moves all non-zero elements to the bottom of the grid, to the last available rows.\n   - Within each column, non-zero cells stack from bottom, mantaining the original relative order.\n\nIn summary, we apply the same rule we found before.\n\"Move all non-zero colored cells to the bottom-most available row within their respective columns, maintaining their relative order, and fill the remaining cells with zeros.\"\n"
