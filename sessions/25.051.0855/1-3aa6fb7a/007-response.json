It seems the condition to check for color 0 above or to the left was not correctly implemented, or there may some fault in the object processing.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the blue cells are missing.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a revised natural language description of the transformation, incorporating the necessary corrections:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all objects composed of azure (8) colored cells.\n2.  **Process Vertical Lines:** For each vertical line object (where the number of unique columns is 1 and the number of unique rows is greater than 1):\n    *   Locate the topmost cell of the vertical line.\n    *   Place a blue (1) cell directly above the topmost cell, *if* the cell above is a white cell (0).\n3.  **Process Horizontal Lines:** For each horizontal line object (where the number of unique rows is 1 and the number of unique columns is greater than 1):\n    *   Locate the leftmost cell of the horizontal line.\n    *   Place a blue (1) cell directly to the left of the leftmost cell, *if* the cell at the left is a white cell (0).\n4. **Preservation:** Ensure that all original azure (8) cells are kept in their initial positions within the output grid.\n\n**Revised observations in YAML:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: 'azure (8) lines'\n    properties:\n      - 'vertical lines: single column, multiple rows'\n      - 'horizontal lines: single row, multiple columns'\n  - action: 'place blue (1) cell'\n    conditions:\n      - 'above topmost cell of vertical azure lines, if cell above is 0'\n      - 'left of leftmost cell of horizontal azure lines, if cell to the left is 0'\n  - preservation: 'all existing azure (8) cells'\n```\n\nThe next step would be to update and improve the Python implementation.\n"
