Copy those two objects in the row below the object.\n\n4.  **Color 7 insertion, part 1:** For the object of color 1, insert, in the previous row, a single object of color 7.\n\n5. **Color 7 insertion, part 2:** Insert objects of color 7 in all positions of the 3x3 subgrid centered on color 1, except for the position of the object of color 1 itself.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule preserves two single cells (colors 2 and 1), and two groups of objects appear around them.\n\n"
