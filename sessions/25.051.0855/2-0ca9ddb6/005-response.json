Copy those two objects in the row below the object.\n\n4.  **Color 7 insertion, part 1:** For *each* object of color 1, insert, in the previous row, a single object of color 7.\n\n5.  **Color 7 insertion, part 2:** Insert objects of color 7 in all positions of the 3x3 subgrid centered on *each* color 1, except for the position of the object of color 1 itself.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\n\nThe transformation rule is an extension of the previous one. The insertion rules for colors 4 and 7 are now applied to *all* objects of color 2 and 1 respectively, instead of only one.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is an extension of the previous one. The insertion rules for colors 4 and 7 are now applied to *all* objects of color 2 and 1 respectively, instead of only one.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    # Find coordinates of all cells with the specified color.\n    return np.array(np.where(grid == color)).T\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find the objects of color 2 and 1.\n    objects_2 = find_objects(input_grid, 2)\n    objects_1 = find_objects(input_grid, 1)\n\n    # Apply rules for object of color 2.\n    for obj_2 in objects_2:\n        row, col = obj_2\n        output_grid[row - 1, col - 1] = 4\n        output_grid[row - 1, col + 1] = 4\n        output_grid[row + 1, col - 1] = 4\n        output_grid[row + 1, col + 1] = 4\n    \n    # Apply rules for object of color 1\n    for obj_1 in objects_1:\n        row, col = obj_1\n        output_grid[row-1, col] = 7\n        for i in range(row - 1, row + 2):\n            for j in range(col - 1, col + 2):\n                if (i,j) != (row, col):\n                     output_grid[i,j] = 7\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```\nThe code provided for the previous example already implements the generalized transformation. Therefore, the same python code can be used.\n"
