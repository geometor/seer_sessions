Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation preserves all single cells of colors 2, 1, and 6.  New color cells are added in specific patterns around the original positions of color 2 and color 1 cells.

For each cell of color 2:
- Two cells of color 4 are placed in the row above, one column to the left and right.
- Two cells of color 4 are placed in the row below, one column to the left and right.

For each cell of color 1:
- A cell of color 7 is placed in the row above.
- Cells of color 7 fill the 3x3 neighborhood around the original cell, *excluding* the cell itself and the cells *horizontally adjacent* to it.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
