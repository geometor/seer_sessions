Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shaped structures, and, two azure singletons.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 and 1x2 azure "L" shaped structures, and, two azure singletons.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all the azure (color 8) colored cells in the input grid. In this example, there are two L shaped structures: one at top-left made of cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) and another at the bottom-right made of cells (4,4), (4,5), (5,4).

2. **Identify single azure objects.** Identify singletons (single instances of the same color).

3. **Change singletons color.** Replace single azure cells colors to blue (color 1)

**Elaboration and Refinement Notes (Mental Workspace)**
The transformation identifies singletons from a particular color and change it to blue.

```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies single azure (color 8) cells in the input grid and changes their color to blue (color 1) in the output grid. Other azure cells, forming connected components, remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
