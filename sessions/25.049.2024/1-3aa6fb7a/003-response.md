Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects, including single cells and 2x1/1x2 structures.
  grid_size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Identical to the input grid, except for the single azure cells.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: single cells
  grid_size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) cells in the input grid.

2.  **Identify Single Azure Objects:** Among the azure objects, identify those that are single, isolated cells (not part of a larger contiguous azure shape).

3.  **Change Singleton Color:** Transform the color of identified single azure cells to blue (color 1). All other azure colored cells are left unchanged.

**Elaboration and Refinement Notes (Mental Workspace)**
The code used in the previous example applies perfectly.
The transformation rule consists on identifying singletons (isolated cells) of a specific color (azure, 8) and changing their color to blue (1).
```python
"""
The transformation rule identifies single azure (color 8) cells in the input grid and changes their color to blue (color 1) in the output grid. Other azure cells, forming connected components, remain unchanged.
