Here's a step-by-step description:\n\n1. **Identify Objects:** Detect all connected regions of cells with color '8'. Each such region is considered an \"object\".  Connectivity is defined by adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically).\n\n2. **Calculate Object Properties:** For each identified object (region of '8's):\n    a. Calculate the average row index of all cells within the object.\n    b. Calculate the average column index of all cells within the object.\n\n3. **Determine Object Position Relative to Grid Center:**  Compare the average row index and average column index of the object to the approximate center of the grid. For a 7x7 grid, we can consider the center around row 3 and column 3 (0-indexed).\n    a. **Top-Left Object:** If both the average row index is less than 3 and the average column index is less than 3, classify this object as being in the \"top-left\" region of the grid.\n    b. **Bottom-Right Object:** If both the average row index is greater than 3 and the average column index is greater than 3, classify this object as being in the \"bottom-right\" region of the grid.\n\n4. **Apply Transformation based on Object Position:**\n    a. **For \"Top-Left\" Objects:** Locate the cell within the object that has the smallest row index. If there are multiple such cells, choose the one with the smallest column index among them. Let the coordinates of this cell be (r, c). Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of it, at position (r, c+1), to color '1'.\n    b. **For \"Bottom-Right\" Objects:** Locate the cell within the object that has the smallest row index. If there are multiple such cells, choose the one with the smallest column index among them. Let the coordinates of this cell be (r, c). Change the color of the cell immediately below it, at position (r+1, c), to color '1'.\n\n5. **Output Grid:** The grid resulting from these modifications is the final output grid.\n\n\nThis program describes how to process each distinct object of color '8' and apply a position-dependent transformation to produce the output grid."
