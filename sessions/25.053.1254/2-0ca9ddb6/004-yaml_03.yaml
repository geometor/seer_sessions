          location: [(5,6),(6,7), (7,6)]
          shape: multiple pixels
      transformation:
        - A yellow (4) pixel appears to the left and right of the red (2) pixel on the rows above and below.
        - An orange (7) pixel appears to the left and right of the blue (1) on the same row.
        - If blue is below red, orange appears on the rows below and above blue.

          shape: multiple pixels
      transformation:
        - If red or blue are present, yellow and orange appear around them.
        - Yellow (4) pixels appear to the left and right of the blue (1) pixel on the rows above and below.
        - Yellow pixels appear on the row below and above and to the left and right of any red pixel.
        - Orange (7) pixels appear on either side of the blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
        - The original azure (8) pixel is unchanged.
