            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs, along with a revised natural language program and YAML fact documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have fundamental flaws in how they handle the propagation of color changes. The core issue is that the code modifies the `output_grid` *in-place* while iterating through the `key_pixels`. This means that changes made in one iteration (e.g., changing a white pixel to yellow) affect subsequent iterations, leading to incorrect cascading effects. The L1 distance calculation is also allowing changes that the prompt indicated was not allowed. The program needs to determine all required changes *before* making any of them.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Decouple Change Detection and Application:** The code must first *identify* all pixels that need to be changed and their new colors, and *then* apply those changes in a separate step. This will prevent the cascading effect.\n\n2.  **Correct L1 Distance Calculation:** Review the provided `get_neighbors` function.\n\n3.  **Revisit Natural Language Program:** Refine the description to be absolutely unambiguous about the conditions for color changes and their extent (L1 distance, adjacent only, etc.).\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI will use the provided test results and not code execution, because I can evaluate what went wrong by looking at the result images.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 20\n    *   **Issue:** Excessive spreading of yellow (4) and incorrect placement of orange(7). The yellow spread is L1 distance=2 AND diagonal from the original red(2) and blue(1) and the orange is diagonal from the blue.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 40\n    *   **Issue:** Similar to Example 1, but more extensive due to multiple color sources. Yellow spread is L1=2, orange should be adjacent to azure.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 19\n    *   **Issue:** Same issues with yellow spread.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: pixel\n    properties:\n      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All possible colors\n      position: [row, col] #row and column in the grid\n      changed: [True, False]\n      new_color: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, None]\n\nactions:\n  - name: change_color\n    agent: pixel #acting on other pixels\n    preconditions:\n      - agent.color == 8:  # Azure\n        target.color == 0: #white\n        distance: adjacent #L1 = 1, not diagonal\n      - agent.color in [1, 2]:  # Blue or Red\n        target.color == 0:\n        distance: L1=2 #and not L1=1\n    effects:\n      - agent.color == 8 and target.color == 0 and distance == adjacent:\n          target.new_color = 7   # Change to orange\n      - agent.color in [1, 2] and target.color == 0 and distance == L1 = 2 and distance != adjacent:\n          target.new_color = 4 #change to yellow\n    constraints:\n      - agent.color == 6 has no effect #magenta pixels should not change the colors\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Key Pixels and Neighbors:** Note all non-white pixels and all white\n    pixels.\n3.  **Azure (8) Rule:** If a key pixel is azure (8), then any *adjacent*\n    (directly above, below, left, or right, *not* diagonal) white (0) target\n    pixel will change to orange (7).\n4.  **Red (2) and Blue (1) Rule:** If a key pixel is red (2) or blue (1), any\n    white target pixel that is *exactly* at an L1 distance of 2 (and *not*\n    adjacent, L1=1) will change to yellow (4).\n5. **Magenta (6) Exception:**  Magenta pixels are ignored, and do not change the color of any other pixels.\n6. **Apply changes**: Once *all* pixels that meet the above criteria have had\n   their changes, apply them.\n\nThe key distinction between this and the previous natural language program is\nclarity, specifications of \"adjacent\", \"L1 distance of 2\", and \"not adjacent\".\nThe YAML facts help define the properties of the different objects, their\npossible actions, and constraints.\nThe overall plan is to separate identification of pixels for change from the\nactual change.\n"
