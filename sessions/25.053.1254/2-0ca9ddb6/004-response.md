Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the results of the attempted transformations, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial attempts show a misunderstanding of the transformation. The provided `transformed_` arrays are not the result of any consistent rule related to the input and expected output. The core issue is that the attempted transformations are based on creating 3x3 blocks, while the actual transformations involve a more complex interaction between colored pixels.

The strategy should involve these steps:

1.  **Accurate Observation:** Carefully observe input, expected, and transformed data from the prior attempt.
2.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Determine which pixels in the input are crucial for the transformation.  In all examples, it appears the presence of red (2) and blue (1) pixels trigger changes, and other non-black colors seem involved as well.
3.  **Hypothesize Transformation Rule:** Formulate a hypothesis about how these key pixels interact to produce the output.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the hypothesis, compare it with the `expected_` outputs, and refine the hypothesis and natural language program based on discrepancies.
5. Use the yellow (4) and orange (7) as markers

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Locate all red (2), blue (1), and other non-black colored pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Yellow Placement (around red):** For each red pixel:
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one position to the left and one position to the right of the red pixel, *on the row above and the row below* the red pixel's row. If these positions are outside the grid boundaries or occupied by non-black pixels, do not place a yellow pixel in that specific location.

3.  **Orange Placement (around blue):** For each blue pixel:
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one position to the left and one position to the right of the blue pixel, *on the same row* as the blue pixel.
    * If blue is below red, place orange pixels on the rows above and below, similar to rule 2
    *   If these positions are outside the grid boundaries, or occupied by non-black pixels, do not place an orange pixel.

4. **Other non-black:** other non-black pixels remain unchanged

5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other non-black pixels from the input grid that were *not* red or blue should remain in their original positions and retain their original colors in the output grid.

6. **Black pixels unchanged:** Black (0) pixels are considered the background and are not explicitly acted upon, except where replaced by yellow or orange pixels according to the rules above.
