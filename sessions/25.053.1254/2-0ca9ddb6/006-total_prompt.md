Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a reasonable starting point, focusing on identifying the locations of specific colored pixels (red, blue, yellow, orange). However, it's clear from the `transformed_` outputs that this is *not* the core transformation. The `transformed_` grids show significant changes (expansions of certain colors) that the initial logic doesn't account for. The `expected_` grids have cross patterns inserted at different locations, apparently guided by colored pixels in the input, but also including other colors that weren't in the input (e.g., yellow/4 and orange/7).  The simple location-finding isn't sufficient. We need to shift our focus to understanding how the colored pixels in the input guide the creation of the cross-like structures and color additions in the `expected` output.  The key is to relate the INPUT to the EXPECTED output. The `transformed` grids, which have large same color blocks, are a distraction and a misinterpretation of the task.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Focus on Input and Expected:** Ignore the `transformed_` outputs for now. They are based on a flawed initial hypothesis. Concentrate on the relationship between `input_` and `expected_` grids.

2.  **Identify Cross Centers:** The "cross" patterns in the `expected_` outputs seem crucial. Determine the rule that places the center of these crosses. It's likely related to the positions of colored pixels in the `input_` grids.

3.  **Determine Cross Colors:**  Once the center is located, analyze the logic that determines the colors used in the horizontal and vertical arms of the crosses.  There might be a consistent pattern related to input pixel colors or a fixed color sequence.

4.  **YAML for Object Properties:**  Create a YAML structure that clearly defines:
    *   **Objects:**  The colored pixels in the input (red, blue, etc.) and the crosses in the output.
    *   **Properties:**  Location (row, column), color.
    *   **Actions:**  "Creates cross at location...", "Uses color..."

5.  **Natural Language Program:** Develop a step-by-step program that describes how the input is processed to generate the output:
    *   Find specific colored pixels.
    *   Based on those locations, determine the center of crosses.
    *   Construct the crosses using specific colors.

**Metrics and Reports (from provided code output):**

    *   Orange Pixel Location (Input): None
    *   Expected pixel counts: {0: 73, 1: 1, 2: 1, 4: 4, 6: 1, 7: 4}
    *   Transformed pixel counts: {0: 62, 4: 9, 6:1, 7:9}
    *  Colors in expected but not transformed: {1,2}
    *   Colors in transformed but not expected: set()

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
        locations:
          - example1: [2, 2]
          - example2: [7, 1]
          - example3: [2, 2]
      - color: blue (1)
        locations:
          - example1: [6, 6]
          - example2: [3, 2], [6, 6]
          - example3: [7, 3]
      - color: azure (8)
        locations:
          - example2: [0,3]
      - color: magenta (6)
        locations:
          - example3: [5,6]
  - type: output_cross
    properties:
      - colors: [yellow (4), orange (7)]
        centers: #Determined by location of input pixels.
          - example1:
            - yellow: [2,1], [2,3]  # Based on Red.
            - orange: [6,5], [6,7] # Based on Blue.
          - example2:
            - yellow: [1,5], [1,7], [7, 5], [7,7]
            - orange: [3,1], [3,3]
          - example3:
            - yellow: [1,1], [1,3]  # Based on Red
            - orange: [7,2] # Based on blue

actions:
  - description: "Input pixels of color red and blue determine the placement of output crosses."
  - description: "Crosses have horizontal and vertical lines using yellow(4) and orange(7) in a repeated pattern, and intersecting input color"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Key Pixels:** Locate all red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Input color location as cross intersection** If a red pixel is found, insert a yellow cross. The red pixel becomes the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line.
3.  **Create Yellow Cross:** a. If there isn't a horizontal row of yellow color in the output, insert a row of yellow at the index = input red pixel row index - 1; b. insert yellow color at the columns = input red pixel column index -1 and column index + 1
4.  **Find Key Pixels:** Locate all blue(1) pixels in the input grid.
5. **Create Orange Cross:** If a blue pixel is found, insert an orange cross. The blue pixel becomes the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line.
6.  **Create Orange Cross:** a. If there isn't a horizontal row of orange color in the output, insert a row of orange at the index = input blue pixel row index + 1; b. insert orange color at the columns = input blue pixel column index -1 and column index + 1

The core idea is that red and blue pixels "seed" the creation of yellow and orange crosses, respectively.  The placement of the crosses is directly tied to the row/column of the seeding pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
