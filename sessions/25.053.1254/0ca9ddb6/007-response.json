Yellow Placement (around red): For each red pixel:\n    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one position to the left and one position to the right of the red pixel, *on the row above and the row below* the red pixel's row. If these positions are outside the grid boundaries or occupied by non-black pixels, do not place a yellow pixel in that specific location.\n3.  Orange Placement (around blue): For each blue pixel:\n    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one position to the left and one position to the right of the blue pixel, *on the same row* as the blue pixel.\n    * If blue is below red, place orange pixels on the rows above and below, similar to rule 2\n    *   If these positions are outside the grid boundaries, or occupied by non-black pixels, do not place an orange pixel.\n4. Other non-black: other non-black pixels remain unchanged\n5.  Preserve Other Colors: All other non-black pixels from the input grid that were *not* red or blue should remain in their original positions and retain their original colors in the output grid.\n6.
