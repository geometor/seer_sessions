            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of identifying \"seed\" pixels and expanding them based on color-specific rules has merit. However, the iterative expansion logic is flawed. It appears to be adding pixels in all allowed directions *simultaneously* during the iteration on `new_pixels`, rather than in a truly iterative, layer-by-layer fashion, causing \"bleeding\" of colors beyond what the outputs intend. Specifically, the transformed output grows colors around the entire perimeter of newly placed colors in a single pass, instead of a staged expansion.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Iterative Expansion:** The core issue is the way the `new_pixels` are handled. The iterative expansion should happen in distinct steps. After placing the initial extensions around the seed pixels, we need to treat *only* those new pixels as seeds for the *next* step. This prevents \"over-expansion\" in a single iteration. We need to iterate on the newly added colors only and not extend based on the input colors.\n\n2.  **Refine Neighbor Selection:** Verify neighbors should ensure that expansion occurs only on to white pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has seed pixels: Red (2) and Blue (1).\n    *   Expected output shows a limited expansion of Yellow (4) around Red and Orange (7) around Blue.\n    *   Transformed output shows excessive expansion, particularly around the initial extensions.\n    *   Errors: \"Bleeding\" of colors. The extension is occurring in single passes, not iteratively building out.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has seed pixels: Azure (8), Red (2), Blue (1), and Blue(1).\n    *   Expected output: Azure(8) does not expand, Red(2) expands up left, and right with Yellow, Blue expands down, left, right with orange(7)\n    *   Transformed output: Shows interaction errors. The colors are expanding too aggressively again.\n    *    Errors: \"Bleeding\", colors expanding onto non-white areas.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has seed pixels: Red(2), Magenta(6) and Blue(1)\n    *   Expected output: Red(2) exapnds as expected, Magenta(6) no change as expected. Blue(1) limited extension\n    *   Transformed output: Magenta has no change as expected but Red and Blue expanding too far\n    *   Errors: \"Bleeding\" of the Red/Yellow and Blue/Orange expansion\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 022\nobjects:\n  - type: pixel\n    properties:\n      colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]  # Colors present in inputs/outputs\n      seed_colors: [1, 2, 6, 8]   # Colors that initiate a transformation\n      expansion_colors: {1: 7, 2: 4}  # Mapping of seed color to expansion color\n      expansion_directions:\n        1: [down, left, right]  # Blue expands to Orange in these directions\n        2: [up, left, right]    # Red expands to Yellow in these directions\n        6: []  # stays\n        8: []  # Stays\n      constraints: [expands_onto_white_only] #pixel can only expand where an existing white(0) pixel exists.\nactions:\n  - name: expand_seed_pixels\n    description: Seed pixels initiate color expansions based on their color.\n  - name: iterative_expansion\n    description: Newly added expansion colors continue to expand, one layer at a time, but ONLY onto white(0).\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all non-white (non-0) pixels in the input grid. These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2.  **Initial Expansion (Seed Pixel Rules):**\n    *   If a seed pixel is Blue (1): Add Orange (7) pixels to its immediate left, right, and below positions, *but only if* those positions are currently White (0) in the *output* grid.\n    *   If a seed pixel is Red (2): Add Yellow (4) pixels to its immediate top, left, and right positions, *but only if* those positions are currently White (0) in the *output* grid.\n    *   If a seed pixel is Magenta (6) or Azure (8): Do nothing.\n\n3.  **Iterative Expansion (Layer-by-Layer):**\n    *   **Step 1:** Consider *only* the Orange (7) and Yellow(4) pixels added in the *Initial Expansion*.\n        * If an added pixel is Orange (7): add an Orange(7) pixel to its immediate left, right and below, *but only if* those positions are currently White(0) in the output grid.\n        * If an added pixel is Yellow(4): add an Yellow(4) pixel to its immediate top, left, and right, *but only if* those positions are currently white(0) in the output grid.\n    *  **Step 2 and beyond:** Repeat Step 1, but for each iteration, *only* consider the colored pixels added in the *immediately preceding* step. Continue until no new pixels are added.\n\n4.  **Expansion Constraints:**\n    *   New pixels can only be added to positions that are currently White (0) in the output grid.\n    *   Colors *never* expand onto other non-white colors, whether those colors are from the original input or added during expansion.\n\n5. **Preservation:**\n  * White (0) pixels not modified remain white(0).\n"
