objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All possible colors
      position: [row, col] #row and column in the grid
      changed: [True, False]
      new_color: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, None]

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: pixel #acting on other pixels
    preconditions:
      - agent.color == 8:  # Azure
        target.color == 0: #white
        distance: adjacent #L1 = 1, not diagonal
      - agent.color in [1, 2]:  # Blue or Red
        target.color == 0:
        distance: L1=2 #and not L1=1
    effects:
      - agent.color == 8 and target.color == 0 and distance == adjacent:
          target.new_color = 7   # Change to orange
      - agent.color in [1, 2] and target.color == 0 and distance == L1 = 2 and distance != adjacent:
          target.new_color = 4 #change to yellow
    constraints:
      - agent.color == 6 has no effect #magenta pixels should not change the colors
