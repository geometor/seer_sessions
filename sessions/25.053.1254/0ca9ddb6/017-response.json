The input grid transforms into a modified output grid. The transformation seems to involve adding new colored pixels around existing pixels, based on certain rules. The key seems to be the introduction of '4' (yellow) and '7' (orange) pixels adjacent to existing colored pixels, in specific patterns. There is also a concept of extending.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
