Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains single pixels of various colors (blue, red, azure) scattered within a background of white (represented by 0). The output grid introduces new colors (orange, yellow) and seems to expand or connect existing colored pixels. There's a potential interaction or relationship between the colors and the transformation logic.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cells: pixels
      - colors: [white, blue, red, azure, orange, yellow]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: expand_color
    description: Existing colors influence the color of adjacent white pixels.
  - name: introduce_color
    description: New colors, orange and yellow, are introduced based on some interaction between existing colors.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally and vertically (not diagonally).
  - type: color_interaction
    description: The colors of existing pixels determine the colors of new or modified pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "key pixels".

2.  **Orange Expansion (Azure):**  For the azure pixel (8), change the color to orange (7) of *all* the white pixels that immediately *surround* it, horizontally and vertically.

3.  **Yellow Expansion (Red and Blue):** For red (2) and blue (1) pixels, we replace every white pixel that is at L1 distance = 2 with a yellow pixel (4). L1 distance (Manhattan distance) of two indicates pixels that have a difference of two in either row or column, or one in both.

The transformation seems to be an expansion/filling operation where the original non-white colors "influence" their immediate neighbors. There are two different expansions, one triggered by the azure pixel (8) resulting in orange and the other triggered by the blue (1) and red (2) colors resulting in yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
