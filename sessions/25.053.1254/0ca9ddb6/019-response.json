            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were on the right track, identifying the core concept of conditional pixel extension based on color. However, the execution revealed errors in the placement of the extended pixels. Specifically, the logic for where to add the new colored pixels relative to the original pixels was not entirely correct for all cases, especially for the red (2) pixels. The code also missed applying the rule to *all* instances.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Careful Re-examination of Examples:** We need to meticulously compare the input, expected output, and transformed output for *each* example. This will pinpoint the exact discrepancies in pixel placement.\n2.  **Precise Rule Definition:** Based on the re-examination, we'll refine the natural language program to articulate the exact conditions and positions for pixel extension. The rule should be unambiguous.\n3.  **Object Interaction:** The previous code, and the original program, did not address the interaction, or non-interaction in this case. This should be explicitly stated.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting the specific errors:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Red (2) and Blue (1) pixels present.\n    *   **Expected:** Yellow (4) above and on either side of Red (2); Orange (7) below, and left and right of Blue (1).\n    *   **Transformed:** Yellow incorrectly placed only above. Orange correctly, but incompletely placed around Blue.\n    *   **Errors:** Incorrect placement of Yellow around Red. Incomplete expansion of blue.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Blue (1), Red (2), and Azure (8) pixels.\n    *   **Expected:** Orange (7) around Blue (1), Yellow (4) around Red (2), Azure (8) unchanged.\n    *   **Transformed:** Orange around Blue is incomplete. Yellow placement error around Red is similar to example 1.\n    *   **Errors:** Incorrect placement of Yellow around Red. Incomplete expansion of blue.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Red (2), Magenta (6), and Blue (1) pixels.\n    *   **Expected:** Yellow (4) around Red (2); Magenta (6) unchanged; Orange (7) around Blue (1).\n    *   **Transformed:** Yellow incorrectly placed. Orange correctly, but incompletely placed, around Blue.\n    *   **Errors:** Incorrect Yellow placement around Red. Incomplete expansion of blue.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 018\n  - objects:\n      - color: blue (1)\n        action: extend\n        extension_colors: [orange (7)]\n        extension_directions: [left, right, below]\n        constraints: [only if adjacent cell is white (0)]\n      - color: red (2)\n        action: extend\n        extension_colors: [yellow (4)]\n        extension_directions: [above, left, right]\n        constraints: [only if adjacent cell is white (0)]\n      - color: magenta (6)\n        action: none\n      - color: azure (8)\n        action: none\n  - interaction_notes:\n      - note: Objects do not interact with each other. Extensions only happen if the target cell is white.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).\n2.  **Conditional Extension:**\n    *   If a pixel is Blue (1): Add Orange (7) pixels to its immediate left, right, and below, *only if* those positions are currently White (0).\n    *   If a pixel is Red (2): Add Yellow (4) pixels to its immediate top, left, and right, *only if* those positions are currently White (0).\n    *   If a pixel is Magenta (6) or Azure (8): Do nothing.\n3. **Non Interaction** Pixels, and their extensions, do not interact with each other. Do not extend onto an existing colored cell.\n4.  All other White (0) pixels remain White (0).\n"
