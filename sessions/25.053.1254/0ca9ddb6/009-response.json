The input grid contains single pixels of various colors (blue, red, azure) scattered within a background of white (represented by 0). The output grid introduces new colors (orange, yellow) and seems to expand or connect existing colored pixels. There's a potential interaction or relationship between the colors and the transformation logic.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are the \"key pixels\".\n\n2.  **Orange Expansion (Azure):**  For the azure pixel (8), change the color to orange (7) of *all* the white pixels that immediately *surround* it, horizontally and vertically.\n\n3.  **Yellow Expansion (Red and Blue):** For red (2) and blue (1) pixels, we replace every white pixel that is at L1 distance = 2 with a yellow pixel (4). L1 distance (Manhattan distance) of two indicates pixels that have a difference of two in either row or column, or one in both.\n\nThe transformation seems to be an expansion/filling operation where the original non-white colors \"influence\" their immediate neighbors. There are two different expansions, one triggered by the azure pixel (8) resulting in orange and the other triggered by the blue (1) and red (2) colors resulting in yellow.\n"
