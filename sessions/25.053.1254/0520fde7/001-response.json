The input grid appears to have a larger size and more variety of colors compared to the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified or condensed version of the input, focusing on a specific region and color. There's a noticeable change in color in the output relative to a feature in the input. The size of input and output appear to be related.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
