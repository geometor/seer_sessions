Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the single vertical line of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Note its x-coordinate.
2.  **Extract:** For each row, extract the pixel immediately to the left and the pixel immediately to the right of the gray line.
3.  **Create Output Grid**: create an output grid that has a height of the input grid and width of 3.
4.  **Construct output Rows**: the first value comes from the left of the gray line, and the third from the right of the gray line. The gray line (5) from the input becomes 0 in the output (column two of the output grid).
5. **Translate:** In the output grid, change all blue (1) pixels to red (2). All other numbers that are not 0 become 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
