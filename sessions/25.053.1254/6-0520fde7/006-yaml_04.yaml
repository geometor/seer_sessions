        The transformation identifies the column of the grey object in
        the input grid. It then places one or more red pixels in the output
        grid.  The output grid is always 3x3. The red pixels in the output grid are
        always one column to the left of grey object.  If this results in a column of -1, then column 0 is used.
    - constraints:
        - output_size: 3x3
