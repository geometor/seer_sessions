observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      delimiters: gray (5) pixels often separate regions
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      size: 3x3
      values: integers, primarily 0 (white) and 2 (red)
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      color: 1 (blue)
      location: variable within input_grid
      role: trigger transformation to red
  - object: red_pixels
    properties:
      color: 2 (red)
      location: determined by blue pixel location, relative to gray delimiters
      role: result of transformation
  - action: spatial_mapping
    description: Maps blue pixels in input to red pixels in output based on a quadrant/region rule.
    details: The precise mapping rule needs further refinement, but grey pixels define regions.
