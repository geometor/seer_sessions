# Example

**input:**
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7C6B13C28EB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C46980>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a larger size and more variety of colors compared to the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified or condensed version of the input, focusing on a specific region and color. There's a noticeable change in color in the output relative to a feature in the input. The size of input and output appear to be related.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, gray]
      - dimensions: [3, 7] # 3 rows, 7 columns
    
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red]
      - dimensions: [3, 3] # 3 rows, 3 columns
  - name: column_object
    type: object
    properties:
     - color: gray

actions:
  - type: identify_region
    description: Locates a specific region within the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: region_coordinates

  - type: transform_color
    description: Changes color of the central pixel
    input: region
    output: transformed region

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid corresponds to a 3x3 sub-region of the input grid, centered around the vertical gray stripe.
  - type: color_change
    description: white and blue in input is converted to white in output. the single gray color pixel is now red

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Center:** Locate the vertical stripe of gray (value 5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Define Region:** Define a 3x3 region centered on the identified gray stripe.
3. **Color Change:** The output grid will mirror the region of the input with white and blue becoming white, and gray becoming red.

In essence, the transformation extracts a 3x3 region from the input grid based on the location of the gray stripe, and changes the central color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
