facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable height and width

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: height matches input_grid, width is always 3

  - object: vertical_gray_line
    type: line
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: vertical
      - uniqueness: single instance in input_grid
    actions:
      - identified: located by x-coordinate

  - action: extraction
    description: Pixels to the immediate left and right of the gray line are selected.
    input: input_grid, vertical_gray_line x-coordinate
    output: values of selected pixels

  - action: translation
    description: all instances of blue (1) are changed to red (2); all other non-zero values that are not 5 are changed to white(0)
    input: extracted pixel values
    output: translated pixel values
