The input grid contains four colors: blue (1), white (0), gray (5), and a single instance of red(2) appears in output.. The output grid seems to be a simplified or extracted version of the input grid, focusing on specific colors or patterns. The most notable change is the replacement of some elements to red (2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
