# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7C6B13C28EB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C17190>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger (7x3) than the output grid (3x3). Specific colors seem to play a crucial role: white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) in the input, and white (0) and red (2) in the output. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple sub-region extraction, as the relative positions of colors change. The gray (5) column in the input is not present at all. It appears there is a direct relationship with the location of the blue (1) to the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x7
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - blue (1)
      - gray (5)

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - red (2)

  - observation: "input grid is larger than output grid"

  - observation: "color gray (5) is present only on the input"
  
  - observation: "color blue (1) on the Input might be related to the location of red (2) in the output"

  - observation: "gray color (5) is always in the same column."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an empty 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).

2.  **Blue to Red Transformation:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    *   If the cell is the color of blue (1) is found,
        change the value of the output cell in the current `row` and `col` divided by two to red (2).

3.  **Ignore other colors:** If a cell in input is anything other than blue (1),
    ignore the value.

In simpler terms: The program replaces blue pixels in the input with red pixels in the output, but at scaled down coordinates. Other color are irrelevant. The core transformation maps each blue (1) pixel from the input to a red (2) pixel in the corresponding index divided by 2 in the output. Gray (5) pixels are discarded, and white (0) remains as white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
