Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program transforms an input grid to an output grid based on the following rule:
1. Initialize an output grid of size 3x3, filled with white (0).
2. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. If a cell in the input grid is blue (1), change the cell at the corresponding row and column divided by two in the output grid to red (2).
4. If a cell is not blue (1), ignore it.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 3x3 array filled with white (0).
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # If a cell is blue (1), change the corresponding cell in output_grid to red (2).
            if input_grid[i, j] == 1:
                output_grid[i // 2, j // 2] = 2

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:**

Input:
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```
Expected Output:
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```
match: ERROR: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 3

## Example 2:**

Input:
```
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
0 0 1 5 1 1 1

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
