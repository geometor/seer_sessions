The primary object appears to be a single connected shape made of gray (5) pixels in the input. This shape seems to be \"segmented\" or \"colored\" in the output, resulting in two distinct regions of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The background remains unchanged as white (0). The segmentation seems to follow a specific pattern, creating two regions where the azure pixels are generally above and to the left, and red are below and the right. The gray shape has a rough L shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
