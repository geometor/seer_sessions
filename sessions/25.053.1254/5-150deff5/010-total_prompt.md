# Example

**input:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary object is a recognizable shape formed by connected pixels of value 5 (gray) in the input grid. This shape seems to be the focus of the transformation. The output grid retains the overall structure and dimensions of the input, but the gray pixels are replaced with a combination of 8 (azure) and 2 (red) pixels. The specific arrangement of azure and red pixels appears to depend on the geometry and/or topology of the original gray shape. Specifically, pixels on the left, top, and center are azure, while on the right, its red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x10
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x10
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: shape
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - location: varies
      - outline: left, top, and middle are one color, while right is a different one

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Replaces the color of the shape pixels.
    parameters:
      - original_color: gray (5)
      - replacement_colors: azure (8) and red (2)
      - location_based_replacment: True
    constraints:
      - "azure on leftmost, top and center"
      - "red on the right"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid maintains the same spatial layout as the input grid.
  - type: transformational
    description: The shape in the input grid is transformed into a new shape in the output grid by changing colors based on location.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous block of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This forms the "shape".
2.  **Determine New color based on shape outline:**
    *   If a pixel in original shape, is on its leftmost side, or top, or center, assign the new value of azure (8)
    *   If a pixel in original shape is on the rightmost, assign a value of red (2)
3.  **Create Output:** Construct the output grid, mirroring the input grid's dimensions, but with color on the shape. Every other colors remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
