"""
Identifies a gray (5) object in the input grid and splits it with a vertical line. Pixels of the gray object to the left of the splitting line are colored azure (8), and pixels to the right are colored red (2). The splitting line's y-coordinate is determined by finding the largest y coordinate of azure pixels in the output, plus 1. The rest of the grid (background) remains unchanged.
