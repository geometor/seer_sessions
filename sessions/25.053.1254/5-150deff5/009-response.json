The primary object is a recognizable shape formed by connected pixels of value 5 (gray) in the input grid. This shape seems to be the focus of the transformation. The output grid retains the overall structure and dimensions of the input, but the gray pixels are replaced with a combination of 8 (azure) and 2 (red) pixels. The specific arrangement of azure and red pixels appears to depend on the geometry and/or topology of the original gray shape. Specifically, pixels on the left, top, and center are azure, while on the right, its red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
