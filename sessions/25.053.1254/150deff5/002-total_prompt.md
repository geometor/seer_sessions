Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The primary object appears to be a single connected shape made of gray (5) pixels in the input. This shape seems to be "segmented" or "colored" in the output, resulting in two distinct regions of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The background remains unchanged as white (0). The segmentation seems to follow a specific pattern, creating two regions where the azure pixels are generally above and to the left, and red are below and the right. The gray shape has a rough L shape.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      state: unchanged
  - name: input_shape
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: connected, irregular L-like shape
    actions:
      - segmented
  - name: output_shape_1
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      relation: generally top and left of the input shape
  - name: output_shape_2
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      relation: generally bottom and right of the input shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Shape:** Locate the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels. This is the input shape.

2.  **Segment the Shape:** Divide the input shape into two regions based on the x,y coordinate.

    - first find the average x, and y coordinate of the input gray shape
    - the set of pixels with (x \<= average x) are the first area
    - other pixels in input shape are second area

3.  **Color the Regions:**
    -   Color all pixels in the first area with azure (8).
    - Color all pixels in second area with red (2)

4.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels (the background, color 0) remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
