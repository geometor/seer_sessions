            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and the subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous shapes of gray (5) pixels. However, it incorrectly determines which pixels should be red (edge) and which should be azure (interior). The `is_edge_pixel` function has a flaw in its logic: simply checking for a neighbor *not* belonging to the shape to determine an edge is insufficient. The code considers a pixel an edge pixel by checking the N,S,E, and W neighbor pixels. The current logic can result in two different errors, (1) identifying a pixel inside the shape as and edge and (2) missing an edge.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is to:\n1. Refine Edge Detection:  Instead of simply checking for *any* non-shape neighbor, we should look for *non-shape empty (0) pixels*. If the shape touches the edge, the current logic is fine.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, highlighting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two gray shapes.\n    *   The larger shape is incorrectly filled. The top right of shape is all \"2\".\n    *   Error: Incorrect edge detection.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has one main gray shape.\n    *   The shape spans to the edge of the grid.\n    *   Error: Incorrect edge detection and fill.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input has gray pixels that form a closed border.\n    *    Error: Fails to color interior, and treats the shape as input after the first pass.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"The input grids contain gray (5) shapes.\"\n    type: \"object_identification\"\n    objects: [\"gray shape\"]\n    properties:\n      color: 5\n      shape: \"contiguous\"\n\n  - description: \"Gray shapes are transformed into combinations of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.\"\n    type: \"transformation_rule\"\n    input_object: \"gray shape\"\n    output_objects: [\"red shape\", \"azure shape\"]\n    properties:\n      red_color: 2\n      azure_color: 8\n      transformation_type: \"color replacement\"\n\n  - description: \"Red pixels form the outer edge of the transformed shape.\"\n    type: \"spatial_relationship\"\n    objects: [\"red pixels\", \"azure pixels\"]\n    relationship: \"red pixels surround azure pixels\"\n    property: edge\n    \n  - description: \"Azure pixels form the internal region of the transformed shapes.\"\n    type: \"spatial_relationship\"\n    objects: [\"azure pixels\", \"gray pixels\"]\n    relationship: \"replaces gray pixels not on edge\"\n\n  - description: \"Empty cells remain unchanged\"\n    type: observation\n    objects: [\"empty cells\"]\n    properties:\n      value: 0\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Gray Shapes:** Find all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is defined as a group of gray pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (North, South, East, or West) to at least one other pixel in the group.\n\n2.  **Determine Edge Pixels:** For each identified gray shape, determine its edge pixels. A gray pixel is considered an edge pixel if at least one of its directly adjacent neighbors (North, South, East, or West) is an empty (0) pixel, OR if the pixel is touching the border of the grid.\n\n3.  **Color Transformation:**\n    *   Replace all edge pixels of the gray shape with red (2) pixels.\n    *   Replace all non-edge pixels of the gray shape with azure (8) pixels.\n\n4. **Preserve other pixels:** all pixels that are not gray are unchanged.\n"
