# Example

**input:**
```
5 8 2
5 8 2
5 8 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C28EB0>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C28E80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The most obvious changes are in the first two columns, while the third column remains constant.  It appears that specific colors in the input are mapped to different, specific colors in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9

transformations:
  - type: color_mapping
    details:
      - input_color: 5 (gray)
        output_color: 1 (blue)
      - input_color: 8 (azure)
        output_color: 9 (maroon)
      - input_color: 2 (red)
        output_color: 2 (red)

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
  - constant: the third column remains unchanged

actions:
  - color_substitution:  specific colors are replaced with other specific colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Column Iteration:** Iterate through each column of the grid.
3. **Column Check:**
    *   If the current is the *last* column, *retain* the original values.
    *   If the current column is *not* the last column, perform step 4 color substitution.

4.  **Color Substitution:** For each pixel in the first and second columns:
    *   If the pixel's color is 5 (gray), change it to 1 (blue).
    *   If the pixel's color is 8 (azure), change it to 9 (maroon).
    *   Otherwise, leave original value.
5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
