            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited understanding, derived from only the first example. It implemented a simple color swap between blue (1) and gray (5).  The subsequent tests reveal this is incorrect. The transformation is clearly a color mapping, but it's more complex than a simple swap and involves different colors in each example. The strategy must shift to identifying the *correct* one-to-one color mapping for all examples. This requires a more dynamic approach than hardcoding a swap. We should consider how to create the specific re-mapping in each case.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs to deduce the specific color mapping rule for the entire set.\n2.  **Dynamic Mapping:** The core idea of a mapping is correct, but the specific `mapping` dictionary needs to be derived, not hardcoded, and should encompass the full transformation, not just a swap.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test, compare to all expectations, re-evaluate the overall color mapping.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a more structured analysis of each example:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mapping(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the color mapping between input and output grids.\n    \"\"\"\n    mapping = {}\n    reverse_mapping = {} # added to check for consistent one to one\n    consistent = True\n\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            input_color = input_grid[i][j]\n            output_color = output_grid[i][j]\n            if input_color not in mapping:\n                mapping[input_color] = output_color\n            elif mapping[input_color] != output_color:\n                consistent = False\n                print(f\"Inconsistency: Input color {input_color} maps to both {mapping[input_color]} and {output_color}\")\n\n            if output_color not in reverse_mapping:\n                reverse_mapping[output_color] = input_color\n            elif reverse_mapping[output_color] != input_color:\n                consistent = False\n                print(f\"Inconsistency: Output color {output_color} maps to both {reverse_mapping[output_color]} and {input_color}\")\n\n    return mapping, consistent\n\n# Example Usage (using your provided examples as strings)\nexamples = [\n    (\n        [[3, 5, 2], [3, 5, 2], [3, 5, 2]],\n        [[4, 1, 6], [4, 1, 6], [4, 1, 6]]\n    ),\n    (\n        [[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]],\n        [[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]]\n    ),\n    (\n        [[1, 8, 2], [1, 8, 2], [1, 8, 2]],\n        [[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]\n    ),\n    (\n        [[8, 3, 2], [8, 3, 2], [8, 3, 2]],\n        [[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]\n    ),\n]\n\nfor idx, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):\n    mapping, consistent = analyze_mapping(input_grid, output_grid)\n    print(f\"Example {idx + 1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Mapping: {mapping}\")\n    print(f\"Consistent one-to-one: {consistent}\")\n\n```\n\n**Code Execution Results:**\n\n```text\nExample 1:\n  Mapping: {3: 4, 5: 1, 2: 6}\nConsistent one-to-one: True\nExample 2:\n  Mapping: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}\nConsistent one-to-one: True\nExample 3:\n  Mapping: {1: 1, 8: 9, 2: 2}\nConsistent one-to-one: True\nExample 4:\n  Mapping: {8: 8, 3: 3, 2: 6}\nConsistent one-to-one: True\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      objects:\n        - description: 3x3 grid of pixels\n      input_colors: [3, 5, 2] # green, gray, red\n      output_colors: [4, 1, 6] # yellow, blue, magenta\n      mapping: {3: 4, 5: 1, 2: 6}\n      consistent: True\n  - example_2:\n      objects:\n        - description: 3x3 grid of pixels\n      input_colors: [2, 3, 8] # red, green, azure\n      output_colors: [6, 4, 9] # magenta, yellow, maroon\n      mapping: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}\n      consistent: True\n  - example_3:\n      objects:\n        - description: 3x3 grid of pixels\n      input_colors: [1, 8, 2]  # blue, azure, red\n      output_colors: [1, 9, 2] # blue, maroon, red\n      mapping: {1: 1, 8: 9, 2: 2}\n      consistent: True\n  - example_4:\n      objects:\n        - description: 3x3 grid of pixels\n      input_colors: [8, 3, 2] # azure, green, red\n      output_colors: [8, 3, 6] # azure, green, magenta\n      mapping: {8: 8, 3: 3, 2: 6}\n      consistent: True\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation applies a one-to-one color mapping to the input grid to produce the output grid.  Each input color is consistently replaced by a specific output color. The mapping is not a fixed rule but varies between different examples. However, within each 3x3 grid, the color transformation is consistent. The specific mapping for each example needs to be determined by inspecting the input and output grids. Colors that are not part of the derived mapping for a specific example remain unchanged.\n"
