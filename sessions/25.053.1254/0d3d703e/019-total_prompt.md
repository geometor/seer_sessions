Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a 3x3 grid by applying a color mapping. Gray (5) becomes blue (1), 
azure (8) becomes maroon (9), and the last column is unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through rows
    for i in range(rows):
        # Iterate through columns, stopping before the last column
        for j in range(cols - 1):
            # Color Substitution
            if input_grid[i, j] == 5:  # If gray
                output_grid[i, j] = 1  # Change to blue
            elif input_grid[i, j] == 8:  # If azure
                output_grid[i, j] = 9  # Change to maroon

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
