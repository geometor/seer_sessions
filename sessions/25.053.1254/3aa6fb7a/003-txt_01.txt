Analyzing Example 1:
Number of azure objects found: 2
Object 1:
  Top-left pixel (within object): (1, 1)
Object 2:
  Top-left pixel (within object): (3, 4)
'1' pixel locations in expected output: [(1, 2), (4, 4)]

Analyzing Example 2:
Number of azure objects found: 3
Object 1:
  Top-left pixel (within object): (0, 4)
Object 2:
  Top-left pixel (within object): (2, 2)
Object 3:
  Top-left pixel (within object): (5, 4)
'1' pixel locations in expected output: [(1, 5), (2, 3), (5, 3)]
