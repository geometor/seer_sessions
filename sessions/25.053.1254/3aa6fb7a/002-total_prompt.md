# Example

**input:**
```

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7C6B13C46920>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a numerical value corresponding to a color. The primary color observed is '0' (white) which seems to be the background. There are clusters of '8' (azure) pixels forming distinct objects. The transformation appears to involve a very subtle change related to these azure objects. Specifically, the change seems to be the introduction of the color '1' (blue) within, or near, these objects.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 7x7.
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    description: Fills the majority of the grid.
  - object: azure_shapes
    color: azure (8)
    description:  Two distinct shapes, one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right.
  - action: modification
    target: azure_shapes
    change: introduction_of_blue
    details: |
      A single pixel of color blue (1) appears either within, or directly adjacent to, an azure (8) shape. The precise location where the blue pixel appears to vary between the two azure shapes. Top left shape had blue replace a pixel inside, while the bottom right shape had blue replace a pixel adjacent to it.
  - consistency:
      change_is_consistent: false
      details: |
        One blue introduced inside top-left azure shape, one introduced adjacent to bottom-right azure shape.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Modify Azure Objects:** For each distinct azure object
    a. **Top Left**: Change a pixel inside the azure object to be blue (1)
    b. **Bottom Right**: change a pixel adjacent to the azure object to be blue (1).

The transformation rule applies specifically to the objects of color azure. One object is replaced within, and the other adjacent.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
