# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7C6B13C16590>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure (8) pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between the input and output. There's a spatial relationship that is altered.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 8]

  - name: azure_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: variable, contiguous or non-contiguous

  - name: blue_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: single pixels, possibly others
    relations:
        - appears_near: azure_pixels
        - type: adjacency

actions:
  - name: introduce_blue
    type: modification
    description: Place blue (1) pixels adjacent to some azure (8) pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Select:** Determine specific azure pixels to receive adjacent blue pixels
    There appears to be a rule that adjacent '8' values are treated as
    single objects
    And a diagonal relationships exist between existing '8' values and new
    '1' values, such that the new blue pixel completes an imaginary right
    triangle, where the right angle is a black pixel.

3.  **Introduce:** For the selected azure pixel, check if azure pixel already has an adjacent blue pixel. Add a blue (1) pixel one
    space diagonally, such that the existing azure pixel, a non-azure, non-blue
    pixel, and the new blue pixel form the vertices of a right triangle, where the
    non-azure, non-blue pixel is at the right angle.

4. The specific choice of which eligible '8' to modify seems arbitrary,
   unless we determine a spatial rule that explains this.
   It does appear that the left most and top most azure pixel gets preference.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
