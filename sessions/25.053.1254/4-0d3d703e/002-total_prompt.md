# Example

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C28E80>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C28EB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the digits 1, 2, and 3, representing blue, red, and green, respectively. The output grid contains the digits 4, 5, and 6, representing yellow, gray, and magenta, respectively.  It appears each number in the input is incremented by a fixed value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color-coded: True

actions:
  - type: increment
    operands: grid elements
    parameters:
      increment_value: 3

relationships:
  - type: element-wise
    description: Each element in the input grid corresponds to an element in the output grid at the same position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by adding 3 to each element of the input grid. The spatial structure (3x3 grid) is preserved.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
