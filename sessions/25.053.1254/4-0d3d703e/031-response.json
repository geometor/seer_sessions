            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of using a column-specific color mapping was partially successful. It correctly transformed examples 2 and 3, but failed on examples 1 and 4. The failures indicate that the `column_mappings` are not universally applicable and need adjustments. There's also an issue, in example 2, mapping `2` could map to `6` or `2` - The implementation prioritizes based on the dict order, which isn't optimal for understanding general rules. The core issue is an over-specification of rules that only captures part of the underlying pattern. We should look for a rule that is general, and the exceptions should be well described.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Color Mappings:** Instead of hardcoding specific color transformations for each column, we should try to derive a more general rule that relates the input color, column index, and output color. The current implementation prioritizes the order, and this should be updated.\n2.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will analyze each example and incrementally adjust the color mapping rules. We'll start with a simple rule and add complexity as needed to accommodate more examples.\n3.  **Prioritize Simplicity:** We will strive for the simplest rule that explains the transformations, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nI'll analyze the differences between expected and transformed outputs to pinpoint the specific color mappings that are incorrect. I'll pay close attention to the column index and the input/output color values.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on manual inspection, as I cannot execute code directly:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The mapping `3 -> 4` and `1 -> 5` are correct. The last column, input `2` gives an output of `2` when it should have been `6`.\n*   **Example 2:** All mappings are correct.\n*   **Example 3:** All mappings are correct.\n*   **Example 4:** The input `8` in the first column remains `8`, this is correct. The mapping of the second column `3->4`, and `2->6/2` are not. The correct mapping should be `3 -> 3` and `2 -> 6`.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: \"030\"\n  - objects:\n      - description: \"Input and output grids of identical dimensions.\"\n        properties:\n          - dimensions: \"3x3\"\n          - cell_values: \"Integers representing colors (0-9).\"\n  - transformations:\n      - description: \"Color of each cell is transformed based on its column and initial color.\"\n        details:\n          - \"Column 0: 3 -> 4, 2 -> 6, 5 -> 1, 8 -> 8\"\n          - \"Column 1: 1 -> 5, 3 -> 4 (inconsistent, should be 3 -> 3), 8 -> 9\"\n          - \"Column 2: 2 -> 6 (inconsistent, depends on example, should be 6), 8 -> 9\"\n  - observations:\n      - description: \"The transformation rule is column-specific and involves color mapping.\"\n      - note: \"Current color mappings are not fully accurate and require refinement.\"\n  - inconsistencies:\n      - example_1: \"Last column mapping of 2->2, should have mapped 2->6\"\n      - example_4: \"Second column mapping of 3 -> 4 and third column 2->2, needs review.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is initially a copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Column-Specific Transformation:** For each cell in the grid, apply a color transformation based on the cell's column index.\n3.  **Color Mapping Rules:**\n    *   Column 0:\n        *   If the input color is 3, change it to 4.\n        *   If the input color is 2, change it to 6.\n        *   If the input color is 5, change it to 1.\n        *   If the input color is 8, keep it as 8.\n    *   Column 1:\n        *   If the input color is 1, change it to 5.\n        *   If the input color is 3, keep it as 3.\n        *   If the input color is 8, change it to 9.\n    *   Column 2:\n        *   If the input color is 2, change it to 6.\n        *   If the input color is 8, change it to 9.\n\n4.  **Unmapped Colors:** If a color in a specific column is not explicitly mentioned in the mapping rules, it remains unchanged.\n\nThe above program aims at describing the transformation as a general rule. There are some inconsistencies, that should be investigated and clarified. The rules are expressed using natural language that prioritize explicit rules, rather than inferred rules (e.g., formulas).\n"
