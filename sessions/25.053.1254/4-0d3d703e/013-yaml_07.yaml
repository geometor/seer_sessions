facts:
  - observation: Each input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - observation: The transformation involves changing some of the pixel colors based on a one-to-one mapping.
  - observation: Not all colors are changed; some may remain the same.
  - object: color_mapping
    properties:
      type: dictionary
      description: Maps input pixel values (colors) to output pixel values.
      initial_mapping: {1: 5, 2: 6, 3: 4, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 2, 8: 9, 9: 8}
      revised_mapping: {1:5, 6:6, 4:4, 5:1, 9:9}
      notes: >
       It maps correctly for color 1 and 5, but incorrect for colors 4 and 6, and 9.
       Revised_mapping is hypothesized based on current and old data.
  - action: apply_mapping
    description: Iterates through each pixel of the input grid and applies the color mapping to generate the output grid.
