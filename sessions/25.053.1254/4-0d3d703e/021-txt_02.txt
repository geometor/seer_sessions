            1 9 2
            1 9 2
            1 9 2
            ```

    *   Observation, `5` correctly transforms to `1`, but the transform was updated from `9` to `8` in column 2, and from `2` to `6` in the last column.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `8 3 2`
    *   Expected output: `8 4 6`
    *   Actual Output:   `8 4 6`
        was:
        ```
        8 3 6
        8 3 6
        8 3 6
        ```
    *   Observation: column 1 `8` remains, column 2 `3` becomes `4`, and the final column transforms from `2` to `6`.
