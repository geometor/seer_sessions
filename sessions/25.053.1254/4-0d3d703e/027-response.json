            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the need to replace red pixels with magenta pixels. However, it only partially works. It successfully performs this replacement in Example 4, but fails in Examples 1, 2, and 3. The failures indicate that the transformation rule is more complex than a simple color replacement, and is dependent on the position and/or original color in the input grid. The expected outputs have entirely different colors, suggesting a mapping or lookup, rather than a simple substitution. The consistent size of 3x3 in both the input and the target provides a clue, alluding to the potential need to map each input color to an output color based on the color's position in the grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Color Mappings:** Examine each example pair to determine the precise mapping between input and output colors.\n2.  **Positional Dependence:** Investigate if the mapping is dependent on the position of the pixel within the grid. Since all grids are 3x3, a direct mapping based on position is possible.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the complete color mapping and any positional dependencies.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on a more detailed color change analysis:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]`\n    *   Observed in prev code: `[[3, 1, 6], [3, 1, 6], [3, 1, 6]]`\n    *   Changes: Green (3) -> Yellow (4), Blue (1) -> Gray(5), Red (2) -> Magenta (6)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]]`\n    *   Observed in prev code: `[[6, 3, 8], [6, 3, 8], [6, 3, 8]]`\n    *   Changes: Red (2) -> Magenta (6), Green (3) -> Yellow (4), Azure (8) -> Maroon (9)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 8, 2], [5, 8, 2], [5, 8, 2]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]`\n    *    Observed in prev code: `[[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]`\n    *   Changes: Gray (5) -> Blue (1), Azure (8) -> Maroon (9), Red(2) -> unknown in target, previous code used Magenta(6)\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `[[8, 3, 2], [8, 3, 2], [8, 3, 2]]`\n    *   Expected: `[[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]`\n    *    Observed in prev code: `[[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]`\n    *   Changes: Azure(8) -> Azure(8), Green(3) -> Green(3), Red(2) -> Magenta(6). NOTE, this is the only one that matched, and the colors that did not change did not follow the mapping in examples 1-3.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: \"026\"\nexamples:\n  - input_grid: [[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]\n    output_grid: [[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]\n    color_mapping: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}\n  - input_grid: [[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]\n    output_grid: [[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]]\n    color_mapping: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}\n  - input_grid: [[5, 8, 2], [5, 8, 2], [5, 8, 2]]\n    output_grid: [[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]\n    color_mapping: {5: 1, 8: 9, 2:2}\n  - input_grid: [[8, 3, 2], [8, 3, 2], [8, 3, 2]]\n    output_grid: [[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]\n    color_mapping: {8: 8, 3: 3, 2: 6}\ngrid_size: 3x3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation involves a direct mapping of input pixel values to output pixel values based on their position in the 3x3 grid. The examples demonstrate a lookup of colors dependent on position, and example 4 suggests that example 3 may be incorrect or an outlier. Create a lookup table by position for the first three examples, and lookup the color values in the input grid and map to output grid by position.\n\n```\n[\n  [3->4, 1->5, 2->6],\n  [2->6, 3->4, 8->9],\n  [5->1, 8->9, 2->2], # possibly incorrect target\n  [8->8, 3->3, 2->6]\n]\n\n```\n\nIf the (row,col) input grid color is not in the list above, leave the output grid color the same as the input.\n"
