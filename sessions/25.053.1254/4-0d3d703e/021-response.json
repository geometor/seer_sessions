            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly handles the first two training examples but fails on the third and fourth. The core issue seems to be an incomplete mapping of transformations, specifically related to how the first two columns should change based on the third column's value and the last column transformation logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** I need to pinpoint exactly which color transformations are incorrect in examples 3 and 4.\n2.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the error analysis, I'll adjust the natural language program to include the missing or incorrect transformation rules. The conditional logic based on the last column's value needs to be comprehensively defined for all observed cases.\n3.  **Fact Documentation:** Update the YAML block with facts extracted by carefully comparing the input, expected, and code generated results.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison with the expected output:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Perfect match. The transformation rule for `last_col_val == 2` with input `3` becoming `4`, `1` becoming `5` and the last column `2` becoming `6`, are correctly implemented.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Perfect match. The transformation rule for `last_col_val == 8` with input `2` becoming `6`, `3` becoming `4` and last column `8` becoming `9` are correctly implemented.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `5 8 2`\n    *   Expected Output: `1 8 6`\n    *   Actual Output: `1 8 6`\n        was:\n             ```\n            1 9 2\n            1 9 2\n            1 9 2\n            ```\n\n    *   Observation, `5` correctly transforms to `1`, but the transform was updated from `9` to `8` in column 2, and from `2` to `6` in the last column.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `8 3 2`\n    *   Expected output: `8 4 6`\n    *   Actual Output:   `8 4 6`\n        was:\n        ```\n        8 3 6\n        8 3 6\n        8 3 6\n        ```\n    *   Observation: column 1 `8` remains, column 2 `3` becomes `4`, and the final column transforms from `2` to `6`.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: grid\n    description: 3x3 grid of pixels, each with a color value (0-9).\n    properties:\n      - rows: 3\n      - columns: 3\n  - action: conditional_transformation\n    description: >\n      Pixels in the first two columns are transformed based on the color of\n      the pixel in the third column of the same row. The transformation rule\n      is a mapping.\n    conditions:\n      - condition: last_column_value_2\n        input_value_col1_2:\n          - input: 3, output: 4\n          - input: 1, output: 5\n          - input: 5, output: 1\n          - input: 8, output: 8\n        output_value_col3: 6\n      - condition: last_column_value_8\n        input_value_col1_2:\n          - input: 2, output: 6\n          - input: 3, output: 4\n        output_value_col3: 9\n    actions_performed:\n     - change last column value from 2 to 6\n     - change last column value from 8 to 9\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.\n2.  **Examine** the value (color) of the pixel in the third column (last column) of the current row.\n3.  **Apply Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   **If** the last column's value is 2:\n        *   Change any 3 in the first two columns to 4.\n        *   Change any 1 in the first two columns to 5.\n        *   Change any 5 in the first two columns to 1.\n        *   Change any 8 in the first two columns to 8.\n        *   Change the last column's value to 6.\n    *   **If** the last column's value is 8:\n        *   Change any 2 in the first two columns to 6.\n        *   Change any 3 in the first two columns to 4.\n        *   Change the last column's value to 9.\n4.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).\n\n"
