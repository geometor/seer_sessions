# Example

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C28E80>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B1317B760>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each number in the input grid corresponds to a specific color, and it seems these numbers are mapped to different numbers in the output grid, also maintaining the 3x3 structure. The colors change according to the `COLOR_MAP` provided in the instructions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer value

actions:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each integer in the input grid is mapped to a new integer in the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid (one-to-one mapping of elements based on their position)
  - integer_value: color (defined by a color map)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   The number 2 is transformed to 6.
    *   The number 3 is transformed to 4.
    *   The number 8 is transformed to 9.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of integers, with each element transformed according to the mapping rule in step 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
