# Example

**input:**
```
8 3 2
8 3 2
8 3 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B13C28E80>

**output:**
```
8 3 6
8 3 6
8 3 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C6B127D0DC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in this case). The colors in the grid seem to be the primary elements undergoing transformation. Specifically, the color represented by the digit '2' (red) in the input grid changes to the color represented by the digit '6' (magenta) in the output grid. All other colors remain unchanged.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
    dimensions: [3, 3]
  - type: object
    description: Pixels are the objects, defined by their color.
    properties:
      - color: Represented by digits 0-9.
  - type: transformation
    description: Color change.
    details:
      - from: 2 (red)
      - to: 6 (magenta)
  - type: invariance
    description: other colors are unchanged
    details:
      - color 8 (azure): remains the same
      - color 3 (green): remains the same
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value '2' (red).
2.  **Transform:** Change the value of these pixels to '6' (magenta).
3.  **Preserve:** All other pixels retain their original values.
4.  **Output:** create an output grid with these changes applied.

In simpler terms, the transformation rule is: "Replace all red pixels with magenta pixels, leaving all other colored pixels as they are."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
