Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each number in the input grid corresponds to a specific color, and it seems these numbers are mapped to different numbers in the output grid, also maintaining the 3x3 structure. The colors change according to the `COLOR_MAP` provided in the instructions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer value

actions:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each integer in the input grid is mapped to a new integer in the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid (one-to-one mapping of elements based on their position)
  - integer_value: color (defined by a color map)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   The number 2 is transformed to 6.
    *   The number 3 is transformed to 4.
    *   The number 8 is transformed to 9.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of integers, with each element transformed according to the mapping rule in step 2.
