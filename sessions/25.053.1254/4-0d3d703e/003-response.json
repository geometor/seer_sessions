            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"add 3 to each element\") was too simplistic and did not account for the cyclical nature of the color values (0-9). The code produced values greater than 9, which are outside the valid range, and incorrectly \"rotated\" or shifted the color values. The core issue is that the transformation isn't a simple addition; it's a modular addition or a circular shift within the color palette.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Observations**: Double-check the reported mismatches and ensure they accurately reflect the differences between expected and transformed outputs.\n2.  **Modular Arithmetic**: Recognize that the transformation involves modular arithmetic (modulo 10) to wrap around the color values. If adding 3 results in a number greater than 9, subtract 10 from the result. Alternatively we can think of the rule as a color wheel that must be rotated.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program**: Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the modulo operation or color wheel rotation.\n4.    **Update code**: Modify Python function to correctly implement this modular addition.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the provided examples, including validation that output is the correct shape/size:\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Size Match | Colors Correct | Pixel Matches | Notes                                                                  |\n| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 3x3        | 3x3         | Yes        | Partially      | 0/9          |  Adding 3. values are rotated, but off by one (+3 became -1, etc)      |\n| 2       | 3x3        | 3x3         | Yes        | No             | 0/9          |  Adding 3. Values >9 are present.                                   |\n| 3       | 3x3        | 3x3         | Yes        | No             | 0/9          |  Adding 3. Values >9 are present, and rotation seems wrong again.    |\n| 4       | 3x3        | 3x3         | Yes        | No             | 0/9          |  Adding 3, Values >9, and the amount of rotation appears inconsistent |\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 002\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: 3x3\n      elements: integers # individual color values\n      element_range: 0-9\nactions:\n  - type: element-wise transformation\n    description: Each element's value is modified based on a consistent rule.\n    rule_type: modular addition #or circular shift\n    modulus: 10\n    addend: 3 # add 3 and wrap around.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is transformed into the output grid by adding 3 to each element of the input grid. If the result of the addition is greater than 9, subtract 10 from the sum to get the output color value. The spatial structure (3x3 grid) is preserved. In other words, we are performing modulo 10 addition.\n"
