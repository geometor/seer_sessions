The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in this case). The colors in the grid seem to be the primary elements undergoing transformation. Specifically, the color represented by the digit '2' (red) in the input grid changes to the color represented by the digit '6' (magenta) in the output grid. All other colors remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
