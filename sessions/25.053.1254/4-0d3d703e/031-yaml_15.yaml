        properties:
          - dimensions: "3x3"

  - transformations:
      - description: "Color of each cell is transformed based on its column and initial color."
        details:
          - "Column 0: 3 -> 4, 2 -> 6, 5 -> 1, 8 -> 8"
          - "Column 1: 1 -> 5, 3 -> 4 (inconsistent, should be 3 -> 3), 8 -> 9"
          - "Column 2: 2 -> 6 (inconsistent, depends on example, should be 6), 8 -> 9"
  - observations:
      - description: "The transformation rule is column-specific and involves color mapping."
      - note: "Current color mappings are not fully accurate and require refinement."
  - inconsistencies:
      - example_1: "Last column mapping of 2->2, should have mapped 2->6"
      - example_4: "Second column mapping of 3 -> 4 and third column 2->2, needs review."
