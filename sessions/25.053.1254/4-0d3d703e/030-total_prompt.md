Okay, here's a breakdown of the task, the results, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy was to create a direct color mapping based on position within the 3x3 grid. This approach worked perfectly for the first and fourth examples, but failed on the second and third. The failures indicate that the color transformation isn't *solely* dependent on position; there's likely an interaction or a more complex rule at play. It is significant that the second and third example input grids have values in the cells that were not present in the first example input grid. The strategy so far assumes the transformation rule will apply to all the examples, however the color lookup approach means any new input cell value won't be transformed by default.

The core issue is that the initial `color_map` was built *only* from the first example and extended with data from subsequent examples. This approach is too simplistic and doesn't generalize well when the input color palette varies between examples, or when the transformation rule isn't a simple 1:1 mapping based on position.

The approach for handling previously unseen cell values is incomplete. We need a strategy that can transform input cell values that weren't present in the training data.

The strategy needs to shift from building an absolute color map to understanding the *relationship* between input and output colors, potentially considering factors beyond just position.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a more detailed analysis of each example:

*   **Example 1:** Perfect match. The initial color map worked flawlessly. Input colors: 1, 2, 3. Output colors: 4, 5, 6.
*   **Example 2:** Partial match. Pixels (0,1) and (1,1) and (2,1) are incorrect. Input colors: 2, 3, 8. Output colors: 6, 4, 9. The '3' input correctly produced a '4'. The 2 -> 6 and 8->9 mappings appear correct.
*   **Example 3:** Partial match. Pixels (0,2) and (1,2) and (2,2) are incorrect. Input colors: 5, 8, 2. Output colors: 1, 9, 2. The '8' input produced the correct '9' and the 2 -> 2 mapping appears to be correct for this position. 5 -> 1 is correct.
*   **Example 4:** Perfect match. Input colors: 8, 3, 2. Output colors: 8, 3, 6.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The input and output are 3x3 grids. Each cell within the grid is an "object" with a color property represented by an integer (0-9).

2.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation involves changing the color of each cell based on both its position in the grid *and* its initial color.

3. **Column Specific Rules**:
    * Column 0: Input colors are transformed as follows, irrespective of row: 3 -> 4, 2 -> 6, 5 -> 1, and 8 -> 8.
    * Column 1: Input colors are transformed as follows, irrespective of row: 1 -> 5, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9, 3 -> 3.
    * Column 2: Input colors are transformed as follows, irrespective of row: 2 -> 6, 8 -> 9, 2 -> 2, 2 -> 6

4.  **Process:** For each cell in the input grid, determine its column. Apply the column-specific color transformation rule. If the input color is not in the defined mapping for the column, we need to determine if there is a consistent transformation, or perhaps keep the original color. Based on the examples so far, the color remains the same.

The next step (coder phase) will be crucial to refine the color mapping rules, and to decide how to extend them for the test case, where we may encounter new cell positions and color values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
