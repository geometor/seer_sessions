observations:
  - type: color_mapping
    details: A one-to-one mapping between input and output colors.
    mapping:
      1: 5
      2: 6
      3: 4
      4: 3
      5: 1
      6: 2
      8: 9
      9: 8
  - type: grid_size
    details: Input and output grids are always the same size. All examples are 3x3, but this may not generalize.
  - type: transformation_type
    details: The transformation is a pixel-wise color substitution.  Each pixel's color in the input grid is replaced by its corresponding color in the mapping.
  - type: object_interaction
    details: no object interaction are present in this task.
