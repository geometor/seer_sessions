The primary color observed is '0' (white) which seems to be the background. There are clusters of '8' (azure) pixels forming distinct objects. The transformation appears to involve a very subtle change related to these azure objects. Specifically, the change seems to be the introduction of the color '1' (blue) within, or near, these objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
