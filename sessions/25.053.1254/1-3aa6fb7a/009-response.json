The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure (8) pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between the input and output. There's a spatial relationship that is altered.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Add a blue (1) pixel one\n    space diagonally, such that the existing azure pixel, a non-azure, non-blue\n    pixel, and the new blue pixel form the vertices of a right triangle, where the\n    non-azure, non-blue pixel is at the right angle.\n\n4. The specific choice of which eligible '8' to modify seems arbitrary,\n   unless we determine a spatial rule that explains this.\n   It does appear that the left most and top most azure pixel gets preference.\n"
