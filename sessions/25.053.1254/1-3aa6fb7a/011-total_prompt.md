Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Select:** Determine specific azure pixels to receive adjacent blue pixels.
    There appears to be a rule that adjacent '8' values are treated as
    single objects
    And a diagonal relationships exist between existing '8' values and new
    '1' values, such that the new blue pixel completes an imaginary right
    triangle, where the right angle is a black pixel.

3.  **Introduce:** For the selected azure pixel, check if azure pixel already has an adjacent blue pixel. Add a blue (1) pixel one
    space diagonally, such that the existing azure pixel, a non-azure, non-blue
    pixel, and the new blue pixel form the vertices of a right triangle, where the
    non-azure, non-blue pixel is at the right angle.

4. The specific choice of which eligible '8' to modify seems arbitrary,
   unless we determine a spatial rule that explains this.
   It does appear that the left most and top most azure pixel gets preference.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
