Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Form 2x2 Squares:** For each azure pixel, check if it can form the corner of a 2x2 square within the grid boundaries.

3. **Check for Blocking Colors.** If the other 3 potential positions in the 2x2
   square are not already azure or blue (i.e. positions that would block a new
   pixel from being added)
   
4.  **Add Blue Pixel:** If a 2x2 square can be formed and the diagonally opposite corner from the azure pixel is empty or does not contain a blue pixel or azure pixel, add a blue (1) pixel at that diagonally opposite corner.

5. **Iterate**: Only one blue pixel is added for each suitable azure '8' pixel,
   there doesn't seem to be any criteria that governs selection, it just
   requires a suitable 2x2 block.

6. **Output**: return the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
