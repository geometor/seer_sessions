            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy, based on identifying azure pixels and adding blue pixels diagonally to form right triangles, has fundamental flaws. The generated outputs demonstrate an overgeneration of blue pixels and incorrect placement, indicating the core logic needs significant adjustment. It seems that the original assumption of preference for left most and top most azure pixels is not correct and it's also clear that there's no consideration of blocking behavior of existing azure and blue pixels. The right triangle rule isn't consistently applied, it seems to have the wrong assumption about where the new blue pixel should go.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Right Triangle Rule:** The current implementation misinterprets the spatial relationship. Instead of adding a blue pixel *at the reflected vertex*, it should be added *to complete a 2x2 square*, of which the azure pixel represents a vertex. The triangle is only one possible interpretation.\n\n2.  **Constraint on Blue Pixel Addition:** The current logic adds too many blue pixels. The corrected rule should add *only one* blue pixel per eligible azure pixel, and avoid existing azure or blue cells.\n3. Consider adjacency requirements that prevent new pixels from being created.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze each example.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with azure pixels at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   **Expected Output:** Adds blue pixels at (1,2) and (4,4).\n*   **Transformed Output:**  Adds many incorrect blue pixels.\n*   **Observations:** The output adds extra blue pixels incorrectly and doesn't correctly handle the spatial relationships of \"8\" objects.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with azure pixels at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4).\n*   **Expected Output:** Adds blue pixels at (0,3), (1,4), (2,3), (5,3).\n*   **Transformed Output:** Many blue pixels are added, and they do not appear to be consistently placed.\n*   **Observations:** Similar to example 1, too many blue pixels are generated at the incorrect locations. The code appears to not understand the role of existing blue and azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: azure_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: azure (8)\n      shape: single pixel\n      behavior: static # Azure pixels themselves don't move\n    actions:\n      - name: create_blue_pixel\n        condition: >\n          A 2x2 square can be formed with the azure pixel at a corner.\n        result: >\n            One blue pixel is added at the corner diagonally opposite to\n            the azure pixel to complete a 2x2 block of pixels. The other 2\n            pixels can be of any color, except blue or azure, such that a new\n            pixel is added.\n\n  - object: blue_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: blue (1)\n      shape: single_pixel\n    behavior: appears\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Form 2x2 Squares:** For each azure pixel, check if it can form the corner of a 2x2 square within the grid boundaries.\n\n3. **Check for Blocking Colors.** If the other 3 potential positions in the 2x2\n   square are not already azure or blue (i.e. positions that would block a new\n   pixel from being added)\n   \n4.  **Add Blue Pixel:** If a 2x2 square can be formed and the diagonally opposite corner from the azure pixel is empty or does not contain a blue pixel or azure pixel, add a blue (1) pixel at that diagonally opposite corner.\n\n5. **Iterate**: Only one blue pixel is added for each suitable azure '8' pixel,\n   there doesn't seem to be any criteria that governs selection, it just\n   requires a suitable 2x2 block.\n\n6. **Output**: return the new grid.\n"
