      transformation: "Non-zero pixels are extracted. If there are two, they seem to be placed diagonally from top-left to bottom-right, if possible within the bounds of the output grid."

      transformation: "Single non-zero pixel is placed at the top-left corner."

      output_objects: [object(value=7, position=(0,0)), object(value=7, position=(1,1))]
      transformation: "Same as example 1. Two objects are place diagonally from top-left."

      output_objects: [object(value=9, position=(0,0))]
      transformation: "Same as example 2. Single non-zero pixel placed at top-left"

      transformation: "The non-zero pixels are placed from top to down in the first column."
