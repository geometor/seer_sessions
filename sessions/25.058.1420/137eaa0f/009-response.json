There are a few clusters of non-zero colored pixels. The output is a smaller 3x3 grid containing only the non-zero colored pixels, arranged in a specific way. The positions of the colored pixels in the input grid are seemingly irrelevant; instead, it looks like only colors are kept, and their final locations are reordered. The specific relative locations of the colored pixels are preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
