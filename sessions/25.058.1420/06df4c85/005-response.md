Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies 2x2 blocks and their colors. It attempts to replicate red and green blocks horizontally. However, the replication logic is flawed. It simply pastes the 2x2 block two columns to the right, which leads to incorrect expansions and overwrites existing blocks, as seen in the error results. The current implementation lacks consideration for variable-sized output and doesn't dynamically adjust the output grid size, leading to `IndexError` in cases where the expansion exceeds initial bounds. The approach needs to dynamically resize the output grid and perform insertions rather than overwrites to avoid conflicts.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Grid:** Instead of modifying the input grid in place, create a new, potentially larger, output grid. The size of this new grid should be calculated based on the number of 2x2 red and green blocks and their positions.

2.  **Insertion, Not Overwriting:** Instead of directly copying blocks to fixed offsets, insert the replicated blocks into the new output grid. This will prevent overwriting existing blocks.

3.  **Refined Replication Logic:** The current rule only replicates *to the right*. The provided examples indicate that it should replicate in a way that *expands* the block horizontally, effectively doubling its width.

4. **Object based analysis**: analyze the objects to determine size, location,
   color and then perform the transformation per object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Blocks:** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous 2x2 blocks of pixels with the same color. Note the top-left coordinates and color of each block.

2.  **Calculate Output Size:** Determine the dimensions of the output grid. The number of rows remains the same as the input. The number of columns is the input columns plus two for each red or green 2x2 block.

3. **Iterate and Transform:**
    *   Iterate through the input grid row by row and column by column.
    *   Copy each value to its corresponding location on the output grid.
    * for each object:
    * If a 2x2 block is blue or white, copy it to its corresponding position in the output grid.
    *   If a 2x2 block is red or green, expand that 2x2 block by inserting a duplicate of the 2x2 to its immediate right.
4.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
