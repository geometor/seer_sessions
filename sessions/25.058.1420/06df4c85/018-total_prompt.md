Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Vertical Stripes:** Locate vertical stripes of yellow (4) pixels. These stripes repeat every three columns across the entire grid.

2.  **Identify Target Objects:** Within each yellow stripe, identify 2x2 squares of green (3) or red (2) pixels.

3.  **Horizontal Replication (Conditional):** For each identified 2x2 square within a yellow stripe, replicate it horizontally *within the boundaries of that stripe*.
    *   If a green or red object exists on row `r` and column `c`, check how many empty yellow cells are on that row and within that stripe.
    *   Replicate the object to the right of existing objects, and then to the left (if space allows).
    * The green and red squares appear to duplicate differently depending on the specific input - sometimes just extending to the right, sometimes appearing on both left and right.

4.  **Preserve Unchanged:** All white (0) pixels, and yellow pixels that don't contain replicated objects, remain unchanged.

5. **Output Grid Creation:** The output grid maintains the exact same overall structure as the input, with the changes performed in the horizontal replication of green/red blocks within yellow stripes.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the core concept of replicating 2x2 colored squares within yellow stripes. However, the replication logic (specifically, the conditions and extent of replication) needs refinement. The provided examples and results reveal inconsistencies in how the replication occurs, particularly in terms of leftward vs. rightward expansion and the stopping conditions. The key is to accurately model *when* and *how far* the replication extends in each direction. The provided code correctly determined the boundaries of the yellow stripes.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, I'll meticulously examine the input, expected output, and actual output. I'll use code execution to determine the yellow stripe boundaries, the positions of the 2x2 squares, and the exact cells that are changed (or should be changed).
2.  **Pattern Identification:**  I'll look for consistent patterns in the successful and unsuccessful replications. I'll pay close attention to:
    *   The relative positions of the 2x2 squares within their yellow stripes.
    *   The presence or absence of "obstacles" (non-yellow pixels) that might block replication.
    *   Whether leftward, rightward, or bidirectional replication occurs.
3.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified patterns, I'll create a revised natural language program that accurately describes the replication rules.
4. **Refined YAML facts** Based on the refined description, I'll update facts in YAML format.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I'll use code execution to gather precise information about each example.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: 2x2_square
    colors: [green, red]
    behavior: replicate_within_stripe

stripes:
  - color: yellow
    width: 3  # Spacing between stripes
    role: replication_boundary

replication:
  - direction: bidirectional #Refined: It expands in both directions.
    condition: within_yellow_stripe # Refined
    unit: 2x2_square # Confirmed
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Yellow Stripes:** The grid is divided into vertical stripes that are 3 units wide. The pattern begins with two columns of any color, followed by a column of yellow.

2.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Locate 2x2 squares of green (3) or red (2) pixels within the grid.

3.  **Conditional Replication:**
    *   For each identified 2x2 square, determine the boundaries of the yellow stripe it resides in. The yellow stripe is the column of yellow pixels that either contains the square or, if the square starts to the left of a yellow column, includes the yellow column to the right of the start position.
    *   Replicate the 2x2 square bidirectionally *within* the yellow stripe.
    * The replication stops when it reaches the edge of the yellow stripe or another non-yellow pixel within that stripe. The replication moves 3 units at a time (one full stripe width).
    * If an object begins outside the yellow stripe (in the first two columns) it is replicated *into* the yellow stripe.

4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

5. **Output:** A new grid is created reflecting these changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
