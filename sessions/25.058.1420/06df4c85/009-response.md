Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output grids are identical except for specific regions. The grids consist primarily of white (0) and blue (1) pixels. There are also clusters of other colors (2, 4, 9, 8) within the blue regions. The transformation seems to involve a change in some of the colored clusters, specifically duplicating some parts of colored pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 23x23
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9] # white, blue, red, yellow, azure, maroon
  - type: cluster
    properties:
      - color: variable
      - shape: irregular
      - location: within blue regions
    actions:
      - duplication: horizontal expansion of colored pixels
relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: colored clusters are contained within blue regions
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels of the same color form clusters
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Clusters:** Locate all clusters of non-blue, non-white pixels within the blue regions of the input grid.

2.  **Apply Transformation Based on Color:**
    *   Red (2): Duplicate all pixels twice.
    * Yellow(4): Duplicate all pixels twice.
    *  Maroon (9): Duplicate all pixels twice.
    *  Azure (8): Duplicate all pixels twice.

3. **Construct the output grid by copying the input,** and incorporating the pixel duplications.
