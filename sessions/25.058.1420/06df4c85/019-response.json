            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly captured the core concept of replicating 2x2 squares within yellow stripes, it made some incorrect assumptions that became apparent when applied to the other training examples. The main issues are:\n\n1.  **Stripe Definition:** The initial program assumed stripes were always 3 units wide, starting with two non-yellow columns and then a yellow column. The provided examples show, and confirmed by the code, that the input grid is divided into 3 unit wide stripes. The yellow stripes appear to be related to the position of the 2x2 objects and aren't necessarily pre-existing.\n2.  **Replication Logic:** The replication logic in the code is correct, replicating bidirectionally within a stripe.\n3. **Object Selection** The code correctly selects 2x2 objects and colors.\n\nThe strategy for resolving these errors involves:\n\n1.  **Refine Stripe Identification:** Correct the stripe definition and identification method. The stripes aren't pre-existing, but rather, defined relative to the position of the objects.\n2.  **Maintain Replication Logic:** The core bidirectional replication logic within the now correctly calculated stripe is sound, keep it as is.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the results better, I'll gather some information using print statements inserted in the existing code. For brevity, I will only run the code on the training set.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color, size=2):\n    \"\"\"Finds all 2x2 squares of a given color.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows -
