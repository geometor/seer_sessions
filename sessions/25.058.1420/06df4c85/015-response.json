The dominant colors are yellow (4), white (0), green (3), and red (2). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most obvious change is the replication of colored \"objects\" within the yellow (4) vertical stripes. The white areas remain unchanged. The yellow stripes are consistent. Within some yellow stripes, green and red 2x2 blocks appear to be duplicated horizontally, but only *within* their yellow stripe \"container\". And, the duplication occurs only within that stripe.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
