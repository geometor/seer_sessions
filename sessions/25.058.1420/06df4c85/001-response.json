The primary colors observed are:\n\n*   **Background:** White (0), Azure (8), Blue(1), Yellow(4)\n*   **Object Colors:** Red (2), Green (3), Blue (1), Yellow (4), Maroon(9), Azure(8)\n\nThe objects appear to be $2\\times2$ squares of non-background colors. The background seems to be a repeating tiled pattern of some sort, with lines of the same color and lines of alternating colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
