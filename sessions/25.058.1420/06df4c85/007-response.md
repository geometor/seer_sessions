Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying and expanding 2x2 blocks of red and green. The subsequent tests reveal that this rule doesn't fully capture the transformation logic for all cases. Specifically, example 2 has a blue square and example 3 has no squares at all. We need to account for these variations and potential edge cases in a revised natural language program.
The approach will be first to update the natural language program to account for blue squares, and handle no squares, and then review the provided code to make any necessary changes.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a clearer understanding, I will go through each example and write down observations.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 6x6 grid with a red 2x2 square and a green 2x2 square.
*   **Expected Output:** 6x10 grid with the red and green squares horizontally expanded.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Observations:** The initial logic correctly handles red and green 2x2 squares.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid with one blue 2x2 square.
*   **Expected Output:** 5x5 grid, identical to input.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*    **Observations:** the initial program expands red and green, and other colours are unchanged.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 3x3 grid with multi-colored pixels, but no uniform 2x2 squares.
*   **Expected Output:** 3x3 grid, identical to input.
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Observations:** The code correctly handles the absence of 2x2 squares.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
example_1:
  objects:
    - type: 2x2 square
      color: red
      action: expand horizontally
    - type: 2x2 square
      color: green
      action: expand horizontally
  grid_size:
      input: 6x6
      output: 6x10
example_2:
  objects:
    - type: 2x2 square
      color: blue
      action: none
  grid_size:
    input: 5x5
    output: 5x5
example_3:
  objects: []
  grid_size:
    input: 3x3
    output: 3x3
general_rule:
    - find 2x2 blocks of uniform color.
    - red and green blocks expand horizontally.
    - other colors don't affect grid size.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Blocks:** Examine the input grid to find all 2x2 blocks of pixels that are the same color.
2.  **Conditional Expansion:**
    *   If a 2x2 block is red or green, duplicate it immediately to its right, effectively expanding the grid horizontally by two columns for each such block.
    *   If a 2x2 block is any color and is not red or green, do nothing
    *   If no uniform 2x2 blocks are found, the output grid remains identical to the input grid.
3. **Output:** return the transformed grid.
