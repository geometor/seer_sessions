Within this background, there are distinct 2x2 square blocks of pixels in red (2), blue (1), and green (3).  The key difference between the input and output seems to be the horizontal expansion or replication of these 2x2 colored blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These blocks can be red (2), blue (1), or green (3).\n2. **Conditional Replication:**\n   - If a 2x2 block is red (2) or green (3), replicate it horizontally. Specifically, extend the block to the right by inserting an identical 2x2 block adjacent to the original.\n    - If a block's original location has coordinates (r,c) for the upper left corner. After replication, there will be two adjacent blocks. One at location (r,c), the second at (r, c+2)\n3. **Blue Block Preservation:** If a 2x2 block is blue (1), do not change it.  Leave it in its original position.\n4. **Background Preservation:** All other pixels (the white and azure background) remain unchanged.\n\nIn short, the transformation rule is to horizontally duplicate the red and green 2x2 blocks, while leaving the blue 2x2 blocks and the background unchanged.\n"
