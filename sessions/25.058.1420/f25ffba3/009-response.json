The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). The input grid transforms into the output grid, suggesting a manipulation of the pixel positions or a re-arrangement based on some rule. It looks like a reflection or mirroring of some part of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Merge the mirrored portion with red column to make complete output.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation takes the bottom half of the grid (excluding red column) and uses it to construct the inverse for the top part of the grid.\n"
