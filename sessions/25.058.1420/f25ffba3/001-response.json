The primary colors involved seem to vary between the examples, but consistently include white (0) and other distinct colors. The input grids appear to have a \"filled\" rectangle at the bottom-right corner, which might be a key object of interest. The output grid seems to be a vertically mirrored, or flipped, version of some parts of the input grid. The \"filled\" area also is maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
