            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract a subgrid based on the first occurrence of the value '8'. This works for the first training example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule is more complex and isn't solely dependent on the presence of '8'. We need to consider other factors, potentially including the overall structure, other colors, and the relative positioning of elements. The examples show that sometimes the output grid is a cropped portion of the input, and the cropping can involve the number of '1' and also other numbers.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting not just the presence of '8', but also the dimensions of the output grid and any other patterns. I'll use `code_execution` to get precise dimensions and identify the presence and location of key colors.\n2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll revise the initial hypothesis (which was \"extract subgrid until the first 8\"). I'll develop a more comprehensive natural language program that considers all observed factors.\n3.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a structured YAML representation of the observed facts, properties, and actions for each example. This will help in forming a general rule.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement:** Recognize that the first refined hypothesis might still be imperfect. Be prepared to repeat this process if further testing reveals discrepancies.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo help with the analysis, I need to check the result and dimensions of the grids.\n\n```python\ndef grid_report(grid):\n    \"\"\"returns a report on the grid as a string\"\"\"\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_array = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid_array.shape\n    unique_values = np.unique(grid_array)\n    report_str = (\n        f\"- Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}\\n\"\n        f\"- Unique values: {unique_values}\"\n    )\n    return report_str\n\ntask = {\n    \"train\": [\n        {\n            \"input\": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]],\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]],\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1], [1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[1, 1], [1, 1]],\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[1], [1], [1], [1], [1]],\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]],\n        },\n    ]\n}\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(task[\"train\"]):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(\"Input:\")\n    print(grid_report(example[\"input\"]))\n    print(\"Output:\")\n    print(grid_report(example[\"output\"]))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n```\n**YAML Documentation & Natural Language Program:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            dimensions: 4x6\n            elements: [1, 8]\n            description: A rectangular grid filled mostly with 1s, with a vertical line of 8s separating two blocks of 1s.\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            dimensions: 4x4\n            elements: [1]\n            description: A square grid filled with 1s.
