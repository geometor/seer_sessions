Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of numbers, primarily 1s (blue) with some 8s (azure). The output is a much smaller grid, containing only 1s (blue). The input grid seems to have a pattern: vertical and horizontal lines of 8s intersect in the middle, creating a cross shape, within a field of 1s. The output grid is significantly smaller and retains only a portion of the original blue 1s. The size reduction and the specific area extracted is crucial to observe. The azure pixels seem to be completely removed.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      elements: integers (1, 8)
      colors:
        1: blue
        8: azure
      dimensions:
        input: 11x11
        output: 3x2
      patterns:
        input: "Cross-shape of '8's within a field of '1's"
        output: "Sub-grid of '1's"

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: "Extract a sub-grid from the input."
    parameters:
      start_row: 0
      end_row: 2
      start_col: 0
      end_col: 1

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The output grid corresponds to the top-left corner of the input grid, specifically where the '1' values are before any '8' value on row or column"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the boundaries:** Find the first row index and the first column index where the value 8 appears.
2. **Extract subgrid:** Create a new grid that includes only the top-left portions of the original grid. This extracted grid stops *before* the identified row and column boundaries discovered in step 1.
3. **Return**: The output is the subgrid created in step 2.

In simpler terms, the rule isolates the top-left block of 'blue' (1) pixels before any 'azure' (8) pixels appear, as a sub-grid.
