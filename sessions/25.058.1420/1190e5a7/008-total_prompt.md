Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify the Border:** Locate the '7's (orange pixels) in the input grid, forming a large, thick-lined square open at the top.
2.  **Find the Inner Region:**  Determine the bounding box of the area enclosed by the orange border. This excludes the border itself.
3.  **Locate the Target Object:** Find the 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels within this inner region.
4.  **Extract:**  Extract the 2x2 green block.
5.  **Output:** The extracted 2x2 block becomes the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a 2x2 green block enclosed by an orange border. The code successfully performs this extraction. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. The core issue is that the transformation is NOT always about extracting a 2x2 green block within an orange border. We need to generalize the rule. The provided examples demonstrate variation, particularly in what constitutes the "output". The general strategy will involve:

1.  **Careful Observation of All Examples**: We must examine all input/output pairs to identify common elements and variations in the transformation logic.
2.  **Object Identification Refinement**:  The initial focus on "orange border" and "2x2 green block" is too specific.  We need a more abstract way to describe the relationship between input and output objects.
3.  **Conditional Logic (Possibly)**: The examples *might* require different actions based on input characteristics. We need to look for patterns that suggest conditional execution.
4.  **Iterative Refinement of Natural Language Program**: We'll update the program step-by-step, making it more general and robust.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate general rules and check if it can be applied to other examples.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To help formulate a comprehensive view of the transformation, I'll use code execution to generate a report of grid characteristics. Then a YAML section of the objects, properties, and actions. Finally a revised natural language program.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Border:** Locate the orange (7) pixels in the input grid.  These form an incomplete rectangle, open at the top.
2.  **Define Inner Region:** Determine the rectangular region enclosed by the orange border. This excludes the border itself.
3.  **Identify Inner Object:** Within the inner region, identify the single-colored contiguous object that contrasts with the black(0) background and orange(7) border.
4. **Extract Inner Object**: Create an output grid with just the inner object. The output grid must only contain the inner object.

This revised program focuses on *what* to extract (the single-colored object within the border) rather than assuming a specific color or size.  It emphasizes the relationship between the border, the inner region, and the significant object inside.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
