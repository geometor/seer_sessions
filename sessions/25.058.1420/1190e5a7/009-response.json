The output is a much smaller grid, containing only 1s (blue). The input grid seems to have a pattern: vertical and horizontal lines of 8s intersect in the middle, creating a cross shape, within a field of 1s. The output grid is significantly smaller and retains only a portion of the original blue 1s. The size reduction and the specific area extracted is crucial to observe. The azure pixels seem to be completely removed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
