            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the initial code against all training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it correctly identified the extraction logic for that specific case. However, the other examples reveal a flaw: the assumption that the 2x4 region of '3's is *always* adjacent to the upper-right *internal* corner of the orange border. The failure cases show extractions that are close but not quite right. It is clear that the extraction area is *inside* the border, but we will need a more robust method.\n\nThe general strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Refine Corner Detection:**  The current `find_upper_right_corner` function seems overly specific and brittle.  We need to robustly identify the inner border.\n2.  **Object Identification:**  We'll try identifying the region of 3s as a coherent \"object\" and use its properties to determine the extraction.\n3.  **Relationship-based Extraction**: Instead of relying solely on the corner, we'll use relationships between parts, the border, the inner empty space, and target 2 x 4 block.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the patterns better, let's use `code_execution` to get some concrete data about the input and output grids of each training example, focusing on the location of the 2x4 region of 3s, the overall dimensions, and corner locations.\n\nI will also focus on the difference between the expected output and the actual output.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_border(grid, border_color):\n    border_coords = np.argwhere(grid == border_color)\n    return border_coords\n\ndef find_upper_right_corner(grid, border_coords):\n    min_row = np.min(border_coords[:, 0])\n    max_row = np.max(border_coords[:, 0])\n    min_col = np.min(border_coords[:, 1])\n    max_col = np.max(border_coords[:, 1])\n\n    for r, c in border_coords:\n      if r > min_row and c < max_col:\n        if grid[r-1,c] != 7 and grid[r, c+1] != 7:\n          return r,c\n\n    return None\n\ndef get_object_location(grid, object_value):\n    object_coords = np.argwhere(grid == object_value)\n    if object_coords.size == 0:\n        return None, None, None, None\n    min_row = np.min(object_coords[:, 0])\n    max_row = np.max(object_coords[:, 0])\n    min_col = np.min(object_coords[:, 1])\n    max_col = np.max(object_coords[:, 1])\n    return min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):\n\n    border_coords = find_border(input_grid, 7)\n    internal_corner = find_upper_right_corner(input_grid, border_coords)\n    object_min_row, object_max_row, object_min_col, object_max_col = get_object_location(input_grid, 3)\n\n    print(f\"  Border Pixels: {len(border_coords)}\")\n    if internal_corner:\n      print(f\" internal corner: {internal_corner}\")\n    else:\n      print(\"  Internal Corner: Not found\")\n    if object_min_row is not None:\n        print(f\"  Object '3' Bounding Box: ({object_min_row}, {object_min_col}) - ({object_max_row}, {object_max_col})\")\n    else:\n        print(\"  Object '3': Not found\")\n\n    print(f\" expected_output: {expected_output.tolist()}\")\n    print(f\" actual_output: {actual_output.tolist()}\")\n    diff = expected_output != actual_output\n    if diff.any():\n      print(\"  Differences between Expected and Actual Output\")\n      print(np.argwhere(diff))\n    else:\n      print(\"  Expected and Actual are the same.\")\n\n\nexample_data = [\n    (np.array([[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]), np.array([[3, 3], [3, 3]])),\n    (np.array([[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]), np.array([[3, 3], [3, 3]])),\n    (np.array([[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]), np.array([[3, 3], [3, 3]])),\n]\n\nfor i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(example_data):\n  print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n  actual_output = transform(input_grid)\n  analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output)\n  print(\"-\" * 20)\n```"
