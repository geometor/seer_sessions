```python
"""
This program transforms an input grid containing a cross-shaped object into an output grid where the cross is inflated and mirrored.

1.  **Identify the "cross" object:** Locate the cross-shaped object in the input grid, defined by connected pixels of colors 1, 2, and 4. Note its center coordinates and the colors of each arm.
2.  **Inflate the Cross Center:** The central blue (1) pixel expands into a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels, in the same center location.
3.  **Inflate and Recolor Yellow:** The two yellow (4) pixels in the shape:
    *   Expand to a vertical and horizontal 3x1 yellow (4) block, respectively
    *   A 3x3 yellow (4) block is placed around the center of the shape.
4.  **Mirror the Red:** The single red (2) pixels is replicated to create a 3x3 square, plus four 3x1 bars.
5.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid remain white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which featured a specific cross-shaped object. The subsequent training examples reveal variations in the cross shape, specifically the colors and the extent of the "arms." The existing code makes assumptions that aren't valid for all examples, mainly about the positions and lengths of arms. It fails to capture the general rule. The function works perfectly for the first two cases, but it fails the second one.

The strategy should be:

1.  **Re-evaluate Object Identification:** Instead of hardcoding specific color checks at fixed offsets from the center, we need a more flexible way to identify the "arms" of the cross, regardless of their length or color. We need to traverse from the center.
2.  **Generalized Inflation and Mirroring:** The inflation logic needs to adapt to the varying arm lengths. Mirroring is already present in the code, but it should be done at various locations, according to the length of the arms.
3.  **Dynamically find shape properties**: Identify the extents of each of the cross arms, and use it.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll update the natural language program and code, focusing on one discrepancy at a time.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed)**

Let's collect some metrics about the success and failure cases. Since I can't directly execute code here, I will describe what *would* be done and provide expected results based on visual inspection.

*   **Example 1:** Input shape: (11, 11). Output shape: (11, 11). Result: Success.
*   **Example 2:** Input shape: (13, 13). Output shape: (13, 13). Result: Success.
*   **Example 3:** Input shape: (15, 15). Output shape: (15, 15). Result: **Failure**.
*  Inspecting this example manually, we find that the center is blue (correct). The red arm has now three red pixels instead of 1. The existing algorithm only addresses 1.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: cross
    center_color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - arm_colors: [red (2), yellow (4)] # Colors found in cross arms.
      - arm_directions: [left, right, top] # observed.
      - arm_lengths: variable # Key point: lengths vary across examples
    actions:
      - inflate_center:
        - to_size: 3x3
        - color: blue (1)
      - inflate_arms: # How each arm is extended
        - direction: along_arm_axis
        - amount: variable, depending on center and arm length.
      - mirror:
        - description: red and yellow blocks created based on distance from the center
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped object within the grid. The cross is defined by a central blue (1) pixel and arms extending outwards. The arms can be of different colors (red (2) and yellow (4) observed) and variable lengths.
2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center of the cross by finding the coordinates of the blue (1) pixel.
3.  **Determine Arm Extents**: For each direction (up, down, left, right), traverse outwards from the center pixel until a pixel that isn't part of the cross is encountered or edge of input is reached. This defines arm length.
4.  **Inflate Center:** Expand the central blue (1) pixel into a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Inflate and Mirror around Center**: Create a yellow 5x5 structure centered on the initial blue pixel, except where the inflated center occupies those spaces.
6.  **Inflate Arms and Mirror:**
    *   Extend each arm such that it becomes three pixels wide perpendicular to the original direction, with the original arm forming the center.
    *   If there is a red arm (2), create a mirrored red arm on the opposite side of the center.
    *   If there is a yellow arm (4), create mirrored yellow arm on the opposite side of the center.

This revised natural language program provides a more accurate and general description of the transformation rule. The key improvements are the dynamic determination of arm lengths and the generalized inflation/mirroring process.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
