Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped object within the grid. The cross is defined by a central blue (1) pixel and arms extending outwards. The arms can be of different colors (red (2) and yellow (4) observed) and variable lengths.
2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center of the cross by finding the coordinates of the blue (1) pixel.
3.  **Determine Arm Extents**: For each direction (up, down, left, right), traverse outwards from the center pixel until a pixel that isn't part of the cross is encountered or edge of input is reached. This defines arm length.
4.  **Inflate Center:** Expand the central blue (1) pixel into a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Inflate and Mirror around Center**: Create a yellow 5x5 structure centered on the initial blue pixel, except where the inflated center occupies those spaces.
6.  **Inflate Arms and Mirror:**
    *   Extend each arm such that it becomes three pixels wide perpendicular to the original direction, with the original arm forming the center.
    *   If there is a red arm (2), create a mirrored red arm on the opposite side of the center.
    *   If there is a yellow arm (4), create mirrored yellow arm on the opposite side of the center.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observing the first training example. While it correctly identified the core concept of a cross, its center inflation, and arm extension, it made some assumptions that don't hold true for all examples. Specifically, it assumed:

1.  The presence of a *single* cross.
2.  Symmetry in arm colors (if red on one side, red on the other).
3. The yellow "halo" is always a 5x5 square around the central pixel
4. Arms can be any color, but the code assumes they are either color 2 (red), or color 4 (yellow).

The test results reveal that these assumptions are incorrect. Some examples have different yellow "halo" sizes and positioning. Others don't show the mirroring.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Focus on precisely identifying all objects first. Use np.where to report each color and location.
2.  **Center Identification:** Verify that the cross center identification logic is robust.
3.  **Arm Analysis:** Accurately determine arm lengths and *colors*. This is crucial for handling variations.
4.  **Halo Analysis:** Re-evaluate the logic for creating the yellow "halo". It's not a simple 5x5 square in all cases. It seems related to the overall size of the structure but needs more precise rules.
5.  **Revisit Mirroring:** Understand when mirroring truly applies. It is only across the central structure, which may move depending on the shape and direction of the "arms" of the primary object.
6. **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code based on the analysis of *each* example, not just the first.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped object within the grid. The cross is defined by a central blue (1) pixel. The cross extends outwards, and can be of different colors and variable lengths.
2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center of the cross by finding the coordinates of the blue (1) pixel.
3. **Determine Arm Colors and Extents**: For each direction (up, down, left, right), traverse outwards from the center pixel until a pixel of color 0 is found. Record the length and color of the arm.
4.  **Inflate Center:** Create a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels centered on the original blue pixel.
5.  **Inflate Cross**: Create a cross-shaped structure centered on the original blue pixel.
    *   Extend each arm such that it becomes three pixels wide perpendicular to the original direction, with the original arm forming the center.
6. **Mirror**: For any arm that is not the full extent of the input, mirror the arm across the center.

The key changes here are:
*   No assumption of specific arm colors.
*   "Halo" creation is not assumed.
*   Explicitly check if the color is '0' to stop arm extension.
*   Mirror any arm across the center

This revised program is more general and should handle the variations observed in the training examples better than the original. The code will need to be updated to reflect these changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
