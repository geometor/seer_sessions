Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (21x21).
*   The input grid contains a small "cross" shape made of different colored pixels (1, 2, and 4, representing blue, red, and yellow). The cross is centered around row 8 and column 12.
*   The output grid seems to expand, or "inflate," this cross shape, and also duplicates/mirrors parts of it. There are color changes as well.
*   The background is white (0) in both input and output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: cross
    type: shape
    description: A cross-shaped object composed of different colored pixels.
    properties:
      colors: [blue, red, yellow]
      center: [8, 12] # Row, Column
      arms:
        horizontal:
          left: [8, 10] #red
          right: [8, 14] #yellow
        vertical:
          top: [5, 12] #yellow
          bottom: [9, 12] #blue

  - id: background
    type: color
    value: 0

actions:
 - name: inflate
   agent: cross
   description: expand the object
 - name: mirror
   agent: cross
   description: reflects colors, especially red, along center lines

 - name: recolor
   description: Change certain object's color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The 'cross' object is centered within the grid.
  - type: part-of
    description: The colored pixels are part of the 'cross' object.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "cross" object:** Locate the cross-shaped object in the input grid, defined by connected pixels of colors 1, 2, and 4. Note its center coordinates and the colors of each arm.

2.  **Inflate the Cross Center:** The central blue (1) pixel expands into a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels, in the same center location.

3.  **Inflate and Recolor Yellow:** The two yellow (4) pixels in the shape:
    *   Expand to a vertical and horizontal 3x1 yellow (4) block, respectively
    *   A 3x3 yellow (4) block is placed around the center of the shape.

4. **Mirror the Red:** The single red (2) pixels is replicated to create a 3x3 square, plus four 3x1 bars.

5.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid remain white (0).

In short: we are looking for a cross, inflating its center, mirroring some
elements, and expanding others, with color changes according to a fixed rule.
