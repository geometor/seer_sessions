The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.\n*   **Colors:** Represented by digits 0-9, corresponding to a specific color map (provided in the system prompt).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** Objects have positions within the grid (row, column) and relationships like adjacency (next to) are crucial.\n* **Transformation**: duplication and re-coloring based on shape, size and location\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The green (3) object is duplicated and expanded. The expansion duplicates each pixel of the green object, so the original line of length three pixels becomes three lines of length three. The red object (2) duplicates into three groups of three. Each groups expands into nine, like the green object.\n    *   In the second example the yellow(4) and blue(1) pixels are expanded horizontally to three pixels wide. The red object expands to be length six.\n    *   In the third example, the magenta (6) pixels expands horizontally. The grey(5) object is not changed, and the blue (1) object is moved down and then expanded horizontally.\n\n3. **Place Objects**: Put the changed objects into place. It appears some objects move before expanding and some expand before moving.\n\n"
