Previous Code:
```python
"""
This program transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is considered an object.
2.  **Gray Object Rule:** If an object is composed of gray (5) pixels, leave it unchanged.
3.  **Magenta and Azure Object Rule:**
    *   Locate objects of magenta (6) and azure (1) pixels.
    *   For each of these objects, create two new objects based on extending the base object by one pixel diagonally.
    * For the magenta color, also create an object on top, two pixels away.
    *   Combine these new objects with the original objects to form the output.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid by applying these rules, leaving all other (background) pixels unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
