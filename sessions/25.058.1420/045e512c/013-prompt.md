Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped object within the grid. The cross is defined by a central blue (1) pixel and arms extending outwards. The arms can be of different colors (red (2) and yellow (4) observed) and variable lengths.
2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center of the cross by finding the coordinates of the blue (1) pixel.
3.  **Determine Arm Extents**: For each direction (up, down, left, right), traverse outwards from the center pixel until a pixel that isn't part of the cross is encountered or edge of input is reached. This defines arm length.
4.  **Inflate Center:** Expand the central blue (1) pixel into a 3x3 block of blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Inflate and Mirror around Center**: Create a yellow 5x5 structure centered on the initial blue pixel, except where the inflated center occupies those spaces.
6.  **Inflate Arms and Mirror:**
    *   Extend each arm such that it becomes three pixels wide perpendicular to the original direction, with the original arm forming the center.
    *   If there is a red arm (2), create a mirrored red arm on the opposite side of the center.
    *   If there is a yellow arm (4), create mirrored yellow arm on the opposite side of the center.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
