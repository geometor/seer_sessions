The transformation seems to involve replicating and repositioning specific colored pixels based on their initial positions. The colored pixels (non-zero) seem to be the \"objects\" of interest, and the transformation expands and repositions them. There's a consistent pattern of creating vertical lines of the color 'red' (2) and horizontal lines of the remaining non-zero colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

In other words, fill the entire column of the output grid with the value '2' wherever a '2' appears in the input grid.\n\n3. **Identify other colored pixels**: Locate all the other pixels with non zero value.\n\n4.  **Horizontal Replication:** For other colored pixels, replicate the whole rows horizontally, filling every column of the output grid.\n\n5.  **Background:** All other cells in the output grid that weren't filled in the previous steps remain '0' (white/background).\n"
