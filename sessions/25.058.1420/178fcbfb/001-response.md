Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve replicating and repositioning specific colored pixels based on their initial positions. The colored pixels (non-zero) seem to be the "objects" of interest, and the transformation expands and repositions them. There's a consistent pattern of creating vertical lines of the color 'red' (2) and horizontal lines of the remaining non-zero colored pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Values observed in the examples
      position: [row, col]

actions:
  - name: replicate_vertically
    object: pixel with color 2
    description: Replicates the red pixel (color 2) down and up, filling its column.
  - name: replicate_horizontally
    object: all non zero and non red pixels.
    description: Replicates horizontally all the rows where those pixels are.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The position of non-zero pixels in the input determines the position of replicated lines in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify "red" pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red) in the input grid.

2.  **Vertical Replication:** For each red pixel, replicate its value vertically across the entire column in the output grid. In other words, fill the entire column of the output grid with the value '2' wherever a '2' appears in the input grid.

3. **Identify other colored pixels**: Locate all the other pixels with non zero value.

4.  **Horizontal Replication:** For other colored pixels, replicate the whole rows horizontally, filling every column of the output grid.

5.  **Background:** All other cells in the output grid that weren't filled in the previous steps remain '0' (white/background).
