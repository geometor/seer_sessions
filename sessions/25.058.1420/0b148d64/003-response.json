The azure and white pixels seem to form a background, while the red pixels create a distinct shape in the lower portion of the grid. The output grid is smaller (10x10) and consists only of red (2) and white (0) pixels. The output appears to be a cropped and condensed version of the red shape from the input. The azure pixels are completely removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

I will refer to this box as B.\n4. **Remove background:** remove all azure (8) pixels. The box, B, contains only red and white pixels.\n5.  **Resize:** reduce the height and width of the bounding box, B, by half, rounding down.\n6. **Output:** The resulting cropped, filtered, and resized grid is the output.\n"
