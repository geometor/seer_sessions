Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a region of yellow and white pixels, removing blue pixels within that region. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The code correctly extracts a subgrid but doesn't handle all color filtering or object interactions correctly. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the color filtering rule, as shown in examples 2 & 3 the blue remains.

My strategy to resolve these errors involves the following steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the colors present, their spatial arrangement, and how they change.
2.  **Object and Relationship Identification**: catalog objects and their properties.
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the example analysis, adjust the initial hypothesis (natural language program) to account for the observed variations. Specifically, refine rules for color changes.
4.  **Code Modification Planning:** Translate the refined hypothesis into specific code changes. This involves planning how to modify the existing functions or add new ones to achieve the desired transformation.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered via observation.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 10x10, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *   Output: 6x5, Colors: Yellow, White
    *   Observations: The code correctly extracted the yellow region and removed the blue.
    *   `Assessment: PASS`

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 11x10, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *   Output: 7x5, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *   Observations: Code extracts the yellow and white region, but the blue is set to white, not maintained.
    *   `Assessment: FAIL`

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: 10x10, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *    Output: 7x5, Colors: Yellow, White, Blue
    *    Observations: Code extracts the yellow and white region, the blue is set to white, not maintained.
    *   `Assessment: FAIL`

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: bottom-left}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: background, position: surrounds object_1 and object_2}
  output_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: fills output}
    - object_2: {color: white, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
    - Select all contiguous non yellow colors until reaching a non-white or non-blue.
    - Remove blue from within the selection.
    - Output is the resulting sub-grid.

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: bottom-left}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: background, position: surrounds object_1 and object_2}
  output_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: fills output}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: bottom}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1 and above object_2}
  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
    - Select all contiguous non yellow colors until reaching a non-white or non-blue.
    - Output is the resulting sub-grid.

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: bottom-left}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: background, position: surrounds object_1 and object_2}
  output_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: fills output}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: bottom}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1 and above object_2}
  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
    - Select all contiguous non yellow colors until reaching a non-white or non-blue.
    - Output is the resulting sub-grid.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. It is at the bottom-left.
2.  **Define Extraction Boundaries:** Determine a rectangular boundary around the yellow region. Expand the region to contain contiguous white or blue pixels.
3.  **Extract Sub-Grid:** from the coordinates of the bounding box created, copy the contents.
4.  **Form Output:** The resulting sub-grid becomes the output grid.

Essentially the update is to include the contiguous blue and white region - but no other colors.
