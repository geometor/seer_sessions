Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a large grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids consist of single-digit integers representing colors. There's a prominent red rectangle in the input grid, visually highlighting a region. The output grid seems to be a condensed, color-sampled version of the input. The colors in the output appear to also be present in the input, so it's not creating new colors, but potentially selecting existing colors and maybe applying rules to them.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [23, 21] # Height x Width
        elements: integers (0-9)
        color_map: standard_arc
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [6, 8]
        elements: integers (0-9)
        color_map: standard_arc
      - name: red_rectangle
        properties:
          color: red (2)
          shape: rectangle
          location:  # Approximate, might need refinement
            top_left: [3, 4] # row, column indexing starts from zero.
            bottom_right: [10, 13]

actions:
  - name: extract_region # Hypothetical name, needs validation
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      region_definition: red_rectangle
      sampling_rule: unknown
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: red_rectangle
  - type: corresponds_to # a vague relationship to start with
    from: output_grid
    to: input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Rectangle:** Locate the rectangular region within the input grid that is bounded by red (color value 2) pixels.

2.  **Extract and Sample:** Extract the region of the input grid defined by the *interior* of the red rectangle. The output is generated by sampling pixels within this extracted sub-grid using an at-the-moment unknown sampling rule. The colors of the output pixels are from colors in the subgrid.

3. **Sampling Rule**: The sampling does not look regular, which means that there isn't an easy rule to compute indices from one grid to the other. Since there are very few examples, the sampling rule could be a very complex combination of row and columns selection. I think a 'fitting' algorithm could be more successful than a direct geometrical rule computation.
