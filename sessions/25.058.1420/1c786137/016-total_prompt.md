Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions, notably a large "8" (azure) shape in the center. The output grid seems to be a simplified, smaller representation, possibly focusing on specific features or a zoomed-out view of the input. There's no obvious one-to-one color mapping; some colors from the input are absent in the output, suggesting information filtering or abstraction.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2, 3, 5, 8] # white, red, green, gray, azure
      - size: large
      - shape: rectangular
    relations:
      - contains: [shape_8, other_colored_regions]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2, 3, 5] # white, red, green, gray
      - size: small
      - shape: rectangular
    relations:
      - derived_from: input_grid

  - name: shape_8
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: 8 # azure
      - location: center_of_input_grid
      - shape: large, connected_component

  - name: other_colored_regions
    type: regions
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2, 3, 5]
      - location: scattered_throughout_input_grid

actions:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts a simplified representation.
    details:
      - method:  Potentially downsampling or feature extraction, focusing on color and relative position.
      - color_mapping: Not a direct mapping; some colors are filtered out.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input:** Take the entire input grid as the starting point.

2.  **Downsample/Reduce Resolution:** The input will create a smaller grid, meaning reduce the total amount of pixels used for the data.

3. **Focus and Create**: Locate area of intererest and create output.

4.  **Filter Colors:** Retain only colors 0 (white), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 5 (gray) in the output. Discard information about color 8 (azure), and any others if applicable.

5.  **Preserve Relative Positions:** Maintain the general spatial relationships between the remaining colored regions, although at a lower resolution. That means we take the colors that stay, then we find the center of that region and put the color at the new coordinate.

In essence, the transformation acts like a "zoom-out" operation that simplifies the image, keeps only certain colors and approximates the input data.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
