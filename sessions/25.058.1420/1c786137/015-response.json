The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions, notably a large \"8\" (azure) shape in the center. The output grid seems to be a simplified, smaller representation, possibly focusing on specific features or a zoomed-out view of the input. There's no obvious one-to-one color mapping; some colors from the input are absent in the output, suggesting information filtering or abstraction.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Discard information about color 8 (azure), and any others if applicable.\n\n5.  **Preserve Relative Positions:** Maintain the general spatial relationships between the remaining colored regions, although at a lower resolution. That means we take the colors that stay, then we find the center of that region and put the color at the new coordinate.\n\nIn essence, the transformation acts like a \"zoom-out\" operation that simplifies the image, keeps only certain colors and approximates the input data.\n"
