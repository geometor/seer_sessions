The grids consist of single-digit integers representing colors. There's a prominent red rectangle in the input grid, visually highlighting a region. The output grid seems to be a condensed, color-sampled version of the input. The colors in the output appear to also be present in the input, so it's not creating new colors, but potentially selecting existing colors and maybe applying rules to them.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output is generated by sampling pixels within this extracted sub-grid using an at-the-moment unknown sampling rule. The colors of the output pixels are from colors in the subgrid.\n\n3. **Sampling Rule**: The sampling does not look regular, which means that there isn't an easy rule to compute indices from one grid to the other. Since there are very few examples, the sampling rule could be a very complex combination of row and columns selection. I think a 'fitting' algorithm could be more successful than a direct geometrical rule computation.\n"
