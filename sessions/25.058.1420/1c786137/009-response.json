The output is a significantly smaller grid, also composed of single-digit numbers/colors. The output grid appears to be some kind of condensed or summarized representation of the input grid, not a direct sub-region selection. The most prominent colors in the input grid are yellow (4), magenta(6), maroon (9), white (0) and green(3). Green(3) forms cross shapes. The colors of output pixels are present in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
