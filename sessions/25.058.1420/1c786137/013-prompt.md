Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify all horizontal and vertical lines that are of color 6 (magenta) or 8 (azure). A line is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color in either a row or a column.
2. **Record Positions:** Note the row index of each horizontal line and the column index of each vertical line.  If a color 6 or 8 line does not appear, that element is not included in the output.
3. **Create Output Grid Shell**: Create an output grid where the number of rows equals the number of identified lines of color 6 or 8 and the number of columns equals the number of lines identified by color 6 or 8.
4. **Fill Pixels by Intersection**: The output grid is formed by taking the pixels at the intersections of the collected rows and columns in the original input grid. The background is filled with black (color 0).
5. Remove any duplicate rows or columns.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
