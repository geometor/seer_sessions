The output grids are always smaller or equal in at least one dimension compared to the input grids.\n*   **Colors:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. There's a mix of colors present, suggesting color plays a crucial role.\n* **Compression/Sub-sampling?**: The relative dimensions suggest information reduction, possibly by sub-sampling or region selection.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
