The most obvious change between input and output is the removal of certain regions, specifically regions of white (0) pixels. Other colored pixels seem to remain unchanged. The shape and size of the removed regions seem consistent across all input output pairs. It appears the task is to \"erase\" specific white regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
