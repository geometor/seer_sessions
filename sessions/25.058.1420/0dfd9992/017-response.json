Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input grid appears to contain multiple colored \"objects\" or regions. Some regions are solid blocks of a single color, while others seem to be composed of alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid looks like a simplified or filtered version of the input grid, where certain colors have been removed or replaced, specifically the white (0) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
