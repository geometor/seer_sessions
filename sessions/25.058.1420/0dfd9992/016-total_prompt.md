Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, example results, and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to remove all white pixels. While this worked for the first example, it's clear from the subsequent examples that the rule is more nuanced. The code, as it stands, simply preserves non-white pixels and sets white pixels to white, which is essentially a no-op for non-white pixels. The core issue is that it does not handle the case where entire regions of white exist, we need to remove those to ensure the output grid dimensions match the example output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** We'll examine each input-output pair, noting the differences and identifying what the current code *doesn't* account for.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Develop facts based on object, properties, actions, focusing on how white regions are treated differently.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the transformation, incorporating the new understanding.

**Gather Metrics and Results:**

To be precise, I need to simulate the code execution (as I am unable to run it directly). I will "reason" through the code's execution on the input grids.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8], [8], [8]]`
    *   Actual Output (Simulated): `[[0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`
    *   Observation: The code kept the structure the same, it needs to remove white areas.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[7], [7], [7], [7], [7], [7]]`
    *   Actual Output (Simulated): `[[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Observation: White regions are not collapsed or removed.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Actual Output (Simulated): `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Observation: White regions on all sides need to be removed, only contiguous non-white regions remain.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Result of removing contiguous regions of white pixels.
  - name: white_region
    type: Contiguous block
    description: One or more adjacent white pixels.
  - name: non_white_region
    type: contiguous block
    description: One or more adjacent non-white pixels.

properties:
  - color: integer value (0-9)
  - adjacency: pixels next to each other (horizontally or vertically)
  - contiguity: connected regions of the same color.

actions:
  - name: remove
    target: white_region
    description: Delete the entire region of contiguous white pixels.
  - name: preserve
    target: non_white_region
    description: Keep all contiguous blocks of non-white colored pixels
  - name: collapse
    target: output_grid
    description: Reduce dimensions to fit the remaining non-white regions.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of white pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
2.  **Remove Regions:** Completely eliminate all identified contiguous regions of white pixels.
3.  **Preserve Non-White:** Keep all remaining non-white pixels.
4. **Collapse output:** The output dimensions match the bounding box of the preserved non-white pixels.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid containing *only* the preserved non-white pixels, adjusting the grid dimensions to fit tightly around these remaining pixels. The output is a collapsed version of the preserved non-white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
