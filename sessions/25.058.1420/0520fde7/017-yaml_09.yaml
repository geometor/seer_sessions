example_1:
  input:
    shape: (3, 6)
    blue_pixel_counts: [1, 3, 1]
    object_counts: {}
  output:
    shape: (3, 3)
    description: "Red pixels indicate the presence and quantity of blue pixels in the corresponding input row."
  transformation:
    rule: "For each row, if blue pixels exist, place a red pixel at x = blue_count."

example_2:
  input:
    shape: (3, 5)
    blue_pixel_counts: [0, 2, 1]
    object_counts: {}
  output:
    shape: (3, 3)
    description:  "Red pixels indicate rows with blue pixels, x coordinate corresponds to the blue pixel count."
  transformation:
    rule: "For each row, if blue pixels exist, place a red pixel at x = blue_count."
example_3:
  input:
    shape: (3, 5)
    blue_pixel_counts: [0, 0, 0]
    object_counts: {}
  output:
    shape: (3, 3)
    description: "Output is all white (all zeros)."
  transformation:
    rule: "If no blue pixels are present in any row, the output is all white."
