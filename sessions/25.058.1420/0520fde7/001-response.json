The most prominent feature is a vertical gray (5) stripe in the input grids. The output grids are always 3x3, and contain red (2) pixels in locations that seem to correlate with blue (1) pixels in the input, relative to the gray stripe. White (0) pixels seem to be background or filler in both input and output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each blue pixel in the *input* grid:\n\n    *   Calculate its horizontal distance (number of columns) from the gray stripe.\n    *   If the blue pixel is to the *left* of the gray stripe, place a red (2) pixel in the output grid at the row corresponding to the input row and one col to the *left* from the middle.\n    *   If the blue pixel is to the *right* of the gray stripe, place a red pixel in the output grid at the row corresponding to the input row and and one col to the *right* from the middle.\n    * If the blue pixel is in the same column, place a 2 in the middle of the output grid.\n\n4. **Result:** All other cells in the output should be white (0). The output grid will always be 3x3.\n"
