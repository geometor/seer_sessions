The input grid seems to have a pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid appears to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, containing only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is smaller in dimensions compared to the input grid. There is a direct correspondence in terms of position: Every blue (1) in input became red (2) in output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
