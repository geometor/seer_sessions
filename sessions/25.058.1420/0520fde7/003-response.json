The input grid appears to have a specific pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid seems to simplify the input, retaining a smaller grid size and featuring only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is always 3x3, whereas the input is 3x7. The output red pixel appears to correspond to the intersecting point, the center, of blue rows and the gray columns from the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note color (1) and color (5).\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.\n4. **Mark the position:** Find the center point (1,1) of a 3x3 grid.\n5.  **Place Result:** At the center of the output grid (coordinates 1, 1, using 0-based indexing), change the pixel to the next color after input blue(1), red (2).\n6. **Other cells:** Fill the rest of the cells with (0).\n"
