Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The colors in the input grid are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).  The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2). The gray pixels in the input do not appear in the output at all. The blue pixels are somehow transformed to red in the ouput, but at different locations.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 7]
      colors: [0, 1, 5]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      colors: [0, 2]
  - color_mapping:
      input:
        0: white
        1: blue
        5: gray
      output:
        0: white
        2: red
  - observations:
    - The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
    - Gray pixels in the input grid are removed.
    - Blue pixels become red.
    - Only one red pixel is present on rows which had blue on them
    - The output red pixel's x location is the count of blue pixels present in
      that row of the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialize** an output grid of size 3x3 with all white (0) pixels.
2. **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
3. **Count** the number of blue (1) pixels in the current row.
4. **If** the count of blue pixels is greater than 0, place a single red pixel on
   output grid, in that row.
5.  The **x-coordinate** of the new red pixel is the count computed previously.

Essentially, the transformation counts blue pixels in each row of the input, then creates new red pixels with a x-coordinate equal to that count on the same row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
