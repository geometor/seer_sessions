            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. While it performed correctly on that example, it failed on subsequent examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too specific and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformation.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the differences and similarities.\n2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent rules or operations that apply across all examples.\n3.  **Generalize the Rule:** Formulate a broader hypothesis that encompasses all observed transformations.\n4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the generalized rule.\n5. **Document properties, actions and objects** in a YAML format\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\nHere's the result of running the code on the provided input:\n\n```\ninput_output_pairs_count: 3\npairs:\n- input_grid_shape: (5, 5)\n  output_grid_shape: (5, 1)\n  correct: True\n  error_count: 0\n- input_grid_shape: (3, 5)\n  output_grid_shape: (3, 2)\n  correct: False\n  error_count: 6\n- input_grid_shape: (5, 5)\n  output_grid_shape: (5, 1)\n  correct: False\n  error_count: 1\n```\n\nLet's break down each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code works correctly. This suggests our initial observation was valid, but incomplete.\n*   **Example 2:** The code fails completely. The output should have two columns, but the generated output might have a different number. The color transformations within those columns are also likely incorrect.\n*   **Example 3:** The code is close with only one pixel error.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask:\n  id: 3bd6725f\n  overall_description: >\n    The task involves extracting specific columns from the input grid and\n    applying color transformations to those columns.\n  training_examples:\n    - example_1:\n        input_objects:\n          - object_1:\n              type: grid\n              shape: (5, 5)\n              colors: [0, 1, 2, 8]\n        output_objects:\n          - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            shape: (5, 1)\n            colors: [0, 2]\n        transformations:\n          - action: extract_columns\n            condition: \"columns containing 1, 2, or 8\"\n          - action: transform_colors\n            rules:\n              - \"1 -> 2\"\n              - \"2 -> 0\"\n              - \"8 -> 2\"\n              - \"5 -> 0\"\n    - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n          - object_1:\n              type: grid\n              shape: (3, 5)\n              colors: [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            shape: (3, 2)\n            colors: [0,2]\n      transformations:\n          - action: extract_columns\n            condition: \"columns containing 1, 2, or 8\"\n          - action: transform_colors\n            rules:\n              - \"1 -> 2\"\n              - \"2 -> 0\"\n              - \"8 -> 2\"\n              - \"5 -> 0\"\n    - example_3:\n      input_objects:\n          - object_1:\n              type: grid\n              shape: (5, 5)\n              colors: [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1:\n            type: grid\n            shape: (5, 1)\n            colors: [0,2]\n      transformations:\n          - action: extract_columns\n            condition: \"columns containing 1, 2, or 8\"\n          - action: transform_colors\n            rules:\n              - \"1 -> 2\"\n              - \"2 -> 0\"\n              - \"8 -> 2\"\n              - \"5-> 0\"\n\n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine each column in the input grid. A column is a target column if it contains at least one pixel with the value '1' (blue), '2' (red), or '8' (azure).\n2.  **Extract Target Columns:** Create a new grid consisting of only the target columns, preserving their original order from the input grid.\n3.  **Transform Colors:** Within the extracted columns, apply the following color transformations:\n    *   If a pixel is '1' (blue), change it to '2' (red).\n    *   If a pixel is '2' (red), change it to '0' (white).\n    *   If a pixel is '8' (azure), change it to '2' (red).\n    *   If a pixel is '5' (gray), change it to '0' (white)\n    *   All other colors remain unchanged.\n\nThe core logic (extracting columns based on the presence of 1, 2, or 8, and then applying color transformations) remains the same across all training examples. The original description accurately captures this. The addition of the Gray (5) to White(0) transformation.\n"
