Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid appears to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, containing only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is smaller in dimensions compared to the input grid. There is a direct correspondence in terms of position: Every blue (1) in input became red (2) in output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      pixels:
        values: [0, 1, 2, 5]  # Possible pixel values
        colors: [white, blue, red, gray]
    instances:
      input_grid:
        dimensions: [3, 7]
        pixel_values: [[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]]
      output_grid:
        dimensions: [3, 3]
        pixel_values: [[0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]

actions:
  - name: transform_grid
    description: Converts the input grid to the output grid.
    parameters:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid

relationships:
    - type: size_reduction
      from: input_grid
      to:  output_grid
      details: output width is a function of input width. It picks columns from input where blue(1) exists.
    - type: color_mapping
      details: Specific color transformations between input and output.
      mapping:
        1: 2  # Blue becomes Red
        0: 0  # White remains White
        5: 0    # Gray remains White
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns of Interest:** Examine the input grid and identify the columns that contain the value '1' (blue).
2.  **Extract Columns:** Create a new grid by extracting only the columns from step 1 in the input.
3.  **Map Colors:** In the new grid, transform the pixel values based on the following rules:
    *   '1' (blue) becomes '2' (red).
    *   '0' (white) remains '0' (white).
    *    '5'(gray) becomes '0'(white)

Effectively, the program extracts the columns with blue pixels and simplifies the colors to red and white.
