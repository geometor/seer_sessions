The input grid contains a few isolated pixels of different colors (blue, red, azure) against a background of white (0). The output grid introduces orange and yellow pixels, and the original blue and red pixels seems to \"influence\" their surroundings. There's a sense of \"spreading\" or \"reflection\" of the existing non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note their original color and position (row, column).\n\n2.  **Azure Pixel (8) Handling**: The azure pixel remains unchanged in its position.\n\n3. **Create and place Orange cross**:\n    - For each original *blue* pixel (color 1), create two *orange* pixels(7).\n    - place one directly to the left, and place one directly to the right.\n    - place one above, and one directly below, forming a cross.\n\n4.  **Create and place Yellow cross**:\n    - For each original *red* pixel (color 2) create two *yellow* pixels (4).\n    - place one two spaces to the left, and place one two spaces to the right.\n    - place one two spaces above, and one two spaces below, forming a cross shape.\n\n5.  **Preserve Original Colors:** Keep the original blue(1), red(2) and azure(8) pixels in their original positions.\n\n6. **Background remains**: Any cell not filled is set or remains at color white (0).\n\nIn summary: blue pixels generate an adjacent cross of orange pixels, red pixels generate a cross of yellow pixels two spaces away. The Azure pixel stays put. All other values are white/background.\n"
