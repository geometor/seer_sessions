```python
"""
1. **Identify Centers:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These are the "center" pixels.
2. **Red Center Expansion:** For each pixel with the value '2' (red) in the input grid, place pixels of value '4' (yellow) directly above, below, and to the left and right of it in the output grid. Do not replace the original '2'.
3. **Blue Center Expansion:** For each pixel with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid, place pixels with the value '7' (orange) directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it in the output grid. Do not replace the original '1'.
4.  **Preserve Zeros:** All '0' (white) pixels in the input that do not have colored pixels placed over them, remain '0' in the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
