Both grids are 9x9 and contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grid primarily consists of '0' (white) pixels, with a few pixels of '2' (red) and '1' (blue). The output grid introduces '4' (yellow) and '7' (orange) pixels while retaining the '2' (red) and '1' (blue) pixels from the input, although they are now in a different context. It seems the non-zero pixels in the input grid are \"centers\" around which new colored pixels are placed in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are the \"center\" pixels.\n2.  **Red Center Expansion:** For each pixel with the value '2' (red) in the input grid, place pixels of value '4' (yellow) directly above, below, and to the left and right of it in the output grid. Do not replace the original '2'.\n3. **Blue Center Expansion:** For each pixel with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid, place pixels with the value '7' (orange) directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it in the output grid. Do not replace the original '1'.\n4.  **Preserve Zeros:** All '0' (white) pixels in the input that do not have colored pixels placed over them, remain '0' in the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation expands around the non-zero pixels in the input, creating a cross-shaped pattern of new colors in the output grid, with the original pixels acting as the centers of these crosses.\n"
