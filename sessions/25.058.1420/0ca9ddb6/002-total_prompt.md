<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1808x1202 at 0x7A608C34AAD0>Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 9x9 grids. The input grids contain single pixels of various colors (besides white/0), while the output grids seem to expand these single pixels into cross-shaped patterns, using two different colors. The central color of input is maintained at the center, a new color outlines it. The output introduces two new colors, yellow(4) and orange(7). The location of the colored pixels in the input appears to determine the location of the cross-shaped patterns in the output. It seems each single non-zero pixel in the input maps to a 5-pixel cross in output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: pixel
    type: element within grid
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

  - name: cross_pattern
    type: composite object, derived from single pixel
    properties:
      - center_color: color of original pixel
      - outline_color: a new color introduced based on the original position
      - shape: "+"

actions:
  - name: transform_pixel
    input: single pixel
    output: cross_pattern
    description: Expands a single pixel into a cross-shaped pattern.

relationships:
    - type: "input pixel to output cross"
    - description: each input pixel maps to one output cross. Its coordinates are the same.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid and find all pixels with a value other than 0 (white).
2.  **Generate Cross Pattern for Each Pixel:** For each non-zero pixel found:
    *   Maintain the color of this pixel at the center of new cross.
    *   If the input pixel's column is less than 5, color the adjacent top and bottom pixels with color 4(yellow). Otherwise, color top and adjacent bottom pixels with color 7(orange).
    *   If the input pixel's row is less than 5, color the adjacent left and right pixels with color 4(yellow). Otherwise, color the adjacent left and right pixels with color 7(orange).
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Place the generated cross patterns onto a new 9x9 grid, initially filled with 0s. The center of each cross pattern should correspond to the position of the original non-zero pixel in the input grid.

In summary the rule creates a '+' shaped object centered on the position of each color pixel in the input. The color of the center is the same as the input pixel. The outline of the '+' uses color 4(yellow) if it's within the first 4 rows and columns of the input, and uses orange(7) otherwise.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
