            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly handles azure and green pixels, leaving them unchanged. It also correctly identifies the cross-shaped transformation associated with blue and red pixels. However, the code has a subtle error in how far away the secondary crosses are generated: they seem to overlap in the output, where in the solution the secondary crosses are distinct from the initial pixels. The strategy will be to refine handling of distances, keeping the overall concept correct.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the specifics, let's analyze each example pair. I'll describe my observations and then provide a structured YAML representation.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Blue pixel at (2, 2), Red pixel at (5, 8).\n    *   Expected Output: Orange cross centered on (2, 2), Yellow cross two spaces away from (5,8).\n    *   Actual Output: Orange cross centered on (2,2), Yellow cross centered on (5,8)\n    *   Analysis: The code makes the yellow cross adjacent when it should be 2 spaces away.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Azure pixel at (1, 7), Green pixel at (9, 2), Red pixel at (4, 4).\n    *   Expected Output:  Azure at (1,7), Green at (9,2), Yellow cross two spaces away from (4,4).\n    *   Actual Output: Azure at (1,7), Green at (9,2), Yellow cross centered at (4,4)\n    *    Analysis: Same issue, the Red pixel transformation places the yellow cross too close.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input:  Blue pixels at (2, 6) and (6, 3).  Azure pixel at (9, 9).\n    *   Expected Output:  Orange crosses centered at (2, 6) and (6, 3). Azure at (9,9)\n    *   Actual Output: Orange crosses centered at (2, 6) and (6, 3). Azure at (9,9).\n    *   Analysis: Correct.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: pixel\n    properties:\n      color: [blue, red, azure, green, orange, yellow, white]\n      shape: point\n      position: (row, column)\n    relations:\n      - type: spatial\n        description: can be adjacent or distant\n\n  - object: cross\n    properties:\n       color: [orange, yellow]\n       shape: cross-like (+ shape)\n       center: (row, column)\n    relations:\n      - type: spatial\n        description: Created around a source pixel location, positions on the cross arms are either adjacent or two spaces away from this center.\n\n  - transformation:\n    input:\n      - object: pixel\n        properties:\n          color: blue\n    output:\n      - object: cross\n        properties:\n          color: orange\n          center: same as input pixel\n\n  - transformation:\n    input:\n      - object: pixel\n        properties:\n          color: red\n    output:\n      - object: cross\n        properties:\n          color: yellow\n          center: two spaces away from input pixel in cardinal directions\n\n  - transformation:\n      input:\n        - object: pixel\n          properties:\n            color: azure\n      output:\n        - object: pixel\n          properties:\n            color: azure\n            position: same as input\n\n  - transformation:\n      input:\n          - object: pixel\n            properties:\n              color: green\n      output:\n          - object: pixel\n            properties:\n                color: green\n                position: same as input\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Azure and Green Pixels:** If a pixel is azure (8) or green (3), it remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Blue Pixels:** If a pixel is blue (1), create an orange (7) cross centered on the blue pixel's location. The cross extends one pixel in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) from the original blue pixel location. The original blue pixel remains blue.\n\n4.  **Red Pixels:** If a pixel is red (2), the original pixel color remains. Create a yellow (4) cross *two* spaces away from the red pixel's location in each of the four cardinal directions.\n\n5.  **Other Pixels:** All other pixels (including original white pixels) are set to white (0) in the output grid, unless they are part of a cross created in steps 3 or 4.\n"
