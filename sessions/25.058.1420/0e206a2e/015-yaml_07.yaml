objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 16x14 (rows x columns)
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - type: pixel_cluster
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular, but somewhat connected in the example input,
             irregular connected in output,
      movement: transposed and possibly duplicated relative to other colored pixels

  - type: single_pixels
    properties:
       colors: blue(1), red(2), yellow(4),
       shape: single cell
       movement: position appears to be the point from which the new azure shape originates,

actions:
  - type: translate
    description: The azure cluster's position shifts relative to other single colored pixels.
  - type: duplication_along_axis
    description: the original set of connected azure pixels is duplicated

relationships:
  - description: The blue, red and yellow pixels' positions are maintained, and the azure cluster's position in the input grid is the source for transformation of the positions of pixels in the cluster.
