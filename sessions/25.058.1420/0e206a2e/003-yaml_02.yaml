objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 14x18 (both input and output)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: cluster
    properties:
      - definition: contiguous block of non-zero pixels
      - colors: can contain multiple colors
      - movement: appears to be repositioned within the grid
      - note: clusters appear in the top right and lower-left

actions:
  - type: reposition
    description: moving clusters of pixels
    details:
      -  a horizontal swap of relative positions of two single, same color pixels, and a rotation of the cluster.

relationships:
   - input_clusters:
      - cluster1:
        colors: [3,8,1,8,4,8] lower left corner area
        structure: somewhat irregular shape
      - cluster2:
        colors: [3,8,4,8,1] upper corner area
        structure: L shape
   - output_clusters:
      - cluster1:
        colors: [3,8,4,8,1] lower left
        structure: modified position of colors, rotated and swapped pixels
      - cluster2:
        colors: [8,4,8,3,8,8,8,1] upper right
        structure: modified positions of colors, rotated
