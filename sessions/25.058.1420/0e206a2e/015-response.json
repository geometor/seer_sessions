The primary observation is a rearrangement and, in some cases, an apparent duplication or spreading of colored pixels. The background remains unchanged (filled with 0s, or white). Specifically, there's a cluster of azure (8) pixels in the input, and a somewhat mirrored cluster of azure pixels in the output. Other colored pixels (blue, red, yellow) seem to trigger the placement or serve as \"anchors\" or \"seeds\" from the original cluster is then spread.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
