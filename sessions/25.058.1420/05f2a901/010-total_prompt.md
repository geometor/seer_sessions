Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, with most being white (0) and some forming distinct colored objects. The primary colors observed are red (2) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a shift or movement of a specific object within the grid. The overall grid size and shape remain consistent.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    shape: irregular, but contiguous
    initial_position: top-left quadrant
    final_position: center, shifted right
  - id: azure_object
    color: azure (8)
    shape: 2x2 square
    initial_position: center-right
    final_position: center-right, unchanged
grid:
  size: 9x10
  background: white (0)
actions:
  - type: move
    object: red_object
    description: Shifted to the right, maintaining relative shape.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The red and azure objects are separate and do not overlap.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the red (2) object and the azure (8) object within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Azure:** The azure (8) object's position and shape are maintained in the output grid.
3.  **Translate Red:** The red (2) object is moved horizontally to the right. The relative structure within itself is maintained. The right-most edge of shifted red block maintains a 1-pixel offset from the blue block. The final position is such that the empty area to the left of the initial red object's position is equal to the position occupied to the right by the move.
4.  **Background:** All other pixels remain white (0).

Essentially, the program describes a rightward translation of the red object, while the azure object remains fixed, maintaining the background.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
