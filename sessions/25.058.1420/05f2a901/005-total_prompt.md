Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify two objects within the grid: a red object (color 2) and an azure object (color 8).
2.  The azure object (color 8) remains in its original position.
3.  The red objects shape and position in the input becomes empty in the output.
4.  The shape of the red object is identified in the input.
5.  A copy of the shape of the red object appears on the grid, such that the top two rows overlap the initial position of the red object.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
