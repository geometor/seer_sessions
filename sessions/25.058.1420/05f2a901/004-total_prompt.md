Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (14x9).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors (0-9).
*   Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white).
*   There are two distinct colored objects: one red (2) and one azure (8).
*   The red object appears to be moving, while the azure object seems to remain static.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    initial_position:
      rows: [2, 3]
      cols: [1, 2, 3] # includes diagonals
      shape: irregular, but contained within a 2x3 bounding box if diagonals are considered filled

  - id: azure_object
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position:
      rows: [10, 11]
      cols: [3, 4]
      shape: 2x2 square
    final_position:
      rows: [10, 11]
      cols: [3, 4]

actions:
  - type: move
    object: red_object
    details: >
          The red object's initial position is a cluster, where some red pixels exist.
          The objects final position overlaps with the top two rows of the object's initial position.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details: The red and azure objects are spatially separated and do not overlap.
  - type: positional_change
    details: Red object moves down, azure object stays the same.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify two objects within the grid: a red object (color 2) and an azure object (color 8).
2.  The azure object (color 8) remains in its original position.
3.  The red objects shape and position in the input becomes empty in the output.
4.  The shape of the red object is identified in the input.
5.  A copy of the shape of the red object appears on the grid, such that the top two rows overlap the initial position of the red object.

In essence, the red object "drops down" five rows, essentially, its initial position is where it should begin in the output, while maintaining a fixed position relative to the unchanged azure object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
