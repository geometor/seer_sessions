Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves two objects, a red object (color 2) and a blue object (color 8). If the right edge of the red object is to the left of the left edge of the blue object, the red object is moved horizontally to the right. The movement is such that the right edge of the red object is positioned one pixel to the left of the left edge of the blue object. If red object's right edge is not to the left of the blue block's left edge, the red object is not moved. The shape and size of the red object are preserved during the movement (or non-movement). The blue object serves as a fixed reference and doesn't move. All other pixels are white/background.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
