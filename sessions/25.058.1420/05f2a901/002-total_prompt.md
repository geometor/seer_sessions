<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1936x1842 at 0x7A608CEF6490>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two primary colored objects (red and azure) within a grid. The background is consistently white (0). The objects appear to be rigid, maintaining their shape and internal structure. The key transformation seems to involve a relative repositioning of these objects, with empty space (white/0) acting as padding. The objects are always contiguous.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    type: contiguous_block
    initial_position: variable
    final_position: variable

  - id: azure_object
    color: azure (8)
    type: contiguous_block
    initial_position: variable
    final_position: variable

  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    type: grid_fill

actions:
  - type: reposition
    agent: red_object
    target: relative_to_azure_object
    constraints: maintain_shape

  - type: reposition
    agent: azure_object
    target: relative_to_red_object
    constraints: maintain_shape

relationships:
    - object1: red_object
      object2: azure_object
      relation: spatial_rearrangement
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous red (2) object and the contiguous azure (8) object within the input grid.
2.  **Relative Reposition, keeping the azure object fixed:** Move the red and azure objects, so in effect, swapping their y-location in input and output.

In all provided examples the azure object stayes fixed, only the position of the red object changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
