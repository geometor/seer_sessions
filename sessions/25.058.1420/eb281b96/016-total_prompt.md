Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid consists of a 2x2 checkerboard pattern of white (0) and red (2) pixels.
The transformation expands the input grid vertically to create the output grid. 
The output grid maintains the same 2x2 checkerboard pattern and width as the input.
The height is expanded from 4 to 13, by rules based on the color.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which had a 2x2 checkerboard pattern. The code expands the input grid vertically based on the color and row index. However, the other training examples reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the code assumes a fixed expansion and hard-coded row mappings, whereas the actual transformation seems to involve replicating rows or blocks based on their initial positions and, possibly, colors. The strategy should shift from hard-coded expansion to a more flexible replication approach, and account for variations in the number of white (0) pixels in a row.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results, leveraging observation where needed to analyze the grid structures:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 4x4 checkerboard (red and white).
    *   Output: 13x4, seemingly expanding rows based on position. White squares are expanded to 3, red ones expanded to 2.
    *   Result: Partially correct, captures some aspects of the expansion, but not fully accurate.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 4x7 grid with varying patterns.
    *   Output: 13x7, appears to replicate rows based on the original layout.
    *   Result: Fails. The hardcoded row mapping and fixed height expansion do not accommodate the different input structure. Row 1 (index 0) - white pixels expand to 3, red ones expanded to 2; Row 2 (index 1) all expanded to 2; Row 3 (index 2) - all expanded to 2; Row 4 (index 3) - all expanded to 3.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 4x5 grid, different patterns.
    *   Output: 13x5, row replication.
    *   Result: Fails. Similar reasons as Example 2. Row 1 (index 0) - white pixels expand to 3, red ones expanded to 2; Row 2 (index 1) all expanded to 2; Row 3 (index 2) - all expanded to 2; Row 4 (index 3) - all expanded to 3.

**YAML Fact Block**

        row_3: all x3
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input:** A grid of arbitrary width and height (4) containing red (2) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output:** A grid with the same width as the input grid, and a fixed height of 13.
3. **Expansion Rule.**
    *   The output grid's height is always 13.
    *   Examine each row of the input grid.
    *   For each row, replicate the pixel values into the output grid as follows:
        1.  For the pixels in the first row (index 0) if the pixel is white (0) replicate it vertically three times, otherwise, if it is red (2) replicate twice.
        2.  For pixels in the second (index 1) and third (index 2) row, replicate all pixels vertically two times.
        3.  For the pixel in the fourth row (index 3), replicate each pixel three times vertically.
        4.  The expansion starts from row 0, row 3, row 6, and row 9, based on the original 4 row input.
4.  The horizontal arrangement of pixels within each row remains unchanged.

Essentially, the program takes each of the 4 input rows and, for each row, extends the pixels downwards according to the replication number described in #3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
