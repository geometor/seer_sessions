Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, with two colors: white (0) and red (2). The input grid appears to be a checkerboard-like pattern, but with a smaller scale (2x2 blocks instead of 1x1). The output grid is an enlarged version of the input, with each original "block" of four pixels (2x2) expanded both vertically and horizontally.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2]  # White and Red
      pattern: 2x2 checkerboard-like
      dimensions: [4 x 17]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2] # White and Red
      pattern: 2x2 checkerboard-like
      dimensions: [13 x 17]

  - name: pixel_block
    type: object
    properties:
       color: can be 0 or 2
       size: input is 2x2, and the entire block changes together in the input.
       expansion_factor_y: input height * x = output height
       expansion_factor_x: output and input grids have same width

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: system
    target: pixel_block
    parameters:
      vertical_factor: ~3 (13 / 4 = 3.25)
      horizontal_factor: 1
    description: Each 2x2 block of pixels in the input is expanded.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output_grid is a vertically expanded version of the input_grid, preserving the original pattern.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Blocks:** Divide the input grid into contiguous 2x2 blocks of pixels. Each block will consist of four pixels of the same color (either all white or all red).

2.  **Vertical Expansion:** For each 2x2 block in the input.

    *   If the first row has 0 at any position, add two rows below it.
    *   If the first row has 2 at any position, add one row below it.
3.  **Horizontal Preservation:** The width of the output grid remains the same as the width of the input grid. The relative horizontal positions of the 2x2 blocks are maintained.
4. maintain same pattern in expansion.
