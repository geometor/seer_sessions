  - name: pixel_block
    type: object
    properties:
       color: can be 0 or 2
       size: input is 2x2, and the entire block changes together in the input.
       expansion_factor_y: input height * x = output height
       expansion_factor_x: output and input grids have same width

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: system
    target: pixel_block
    parameters:
      vertical_factor: ~3 (13 / 4 = 3.25)
      horizontal_factor: 1
    description: Each 2x2 block of pixels in the input is expanded.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output_grid is a vertically expanded version of the input_grid, preserving the original pattern.
