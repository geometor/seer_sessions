objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state of the pixels.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state of the pixels.
  - name: row
    type: 1D array
    description: A horizontal line of pixels within a grid.
actions:
  - name: expand_row
    description: Replicates a row from the input grid multiple times in the output grid.
    parameters:
      - name: row_index
        type: integer
        description: The index of the row in the input grid.
      - name: expansion_factor
        type: integer
        description: The number of times the row is replicated.
    logic: |
      The expansion factor depends on the row index.  If the index 0 or 3, the
      expansion factor is 3. For all other indexes, it's 2.
