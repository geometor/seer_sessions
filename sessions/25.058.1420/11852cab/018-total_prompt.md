Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved identifying a blue pixel and duplicating vertically adjacent yellow pixels symmetrically around it. The code seems to capture this specific transformation, but from looking at the prompt before, it has failed to generalize to all other training examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too narrow and needs to be broadened to encompass the variations observed in the other examples.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze each example individually**: Examine the input, expected output, and the actual output of the current code. Identify discrepancies.
2.  **Identify common patterns and variations**: Look for elements or rules that apply across multiple examples, as well as differences that suggest conditional logic or additional rules. Check for the failures.
3.  **Refine the natural language program**: Update the description to account for the observed patterns and variations.
4.  Iterate if necessary

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To effectively analyze each pair I will calculate a simple difference grid.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_diff(grid1, grid2):
    # Ensure both grids have the same shape
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Grids have different shapes"

    # Calculate the absolute difference
    diff = np.abs(grid1 - grid2)
    return diff

def show_grid(grid, title):
    print(title)
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    print(f"rows: {rows}")
    print(f"cols: {cols}")
    print(grid)

def process_examples(examples):
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
        diff_grid = calculate_diff(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid)

        example_info = {
            'example_index': i,
            'input': input_grid.tolist(),
            'expected_output': expected_output_grid.tolist(),
            'predicted_output': predicted_output_grid.tolist(),
            'diff': diff_grid.tolist() if isinstance(diff_grid, np.ndarray) else diff_grid
        }
        results.append(example_info)

     # Print details of each example
    for example_result in results:
        print(f"\nExample {example_result['example_index'] + 1}:")
        show_grid(np.array(example_result['input']), "Input Grid")
        show_grid(np.array(example_result['expected_output']), "Expected Output Grid")
        show_grid(np.array(example_result['predicted_output']), "Predicted Output Grid")
        show_grid(np.array(example_result['diff']), "Difference Grid")
        print(f"diff sum: {np.sum(example_result['diff'])}")

# assuming the train set is provided via prompt history

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- objects:
    - color: blue (1)
      role: reference point
      properties:
        - unique: true
    - color: yellow (4)
      role: target for duplication
      properties:
        - adjacent:
            - vertically adjacent to blue pixel
- actions:
    - name: vertical_duplication
      description: Duplicate yellow pixels vertically, maintaining symmetry with respect to the blue pixel.
      conditions:
        - trigger: Presence of a blue pixel and vertically adjacent yellow pixels.
        - symmetry: The number of yellow pixels duplicated above the blue pixel matches the number duplicated below.  If there are no pixels above or below, extend in the available space.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the blue pixel**: Find the single blue (1) pixel in the grid. This pixel serves as the center of symmetry for the transformation.

2.  **Identify vertically adjacent yellow pixels**: Locate all yellow (4) pixels that are directly above or below the blue pixel. And continue identifying yellow pixels until another color is found.

3.  **Duplicate yellow pixels symmetrically**:
    *   If there are yellow pixels above the blue pixel, extend the same number and pattern of yellow pixels by the same distance below, as long as there are available cells.
    *   If there are yellow pixels below the blue pixel, extend the same number and pattern of yellow pixels by the same distance above, as long as there are available cells.

4.  **Leave other pixels unchanged:** All pixels that are not part of the duplicated yellow structure should retain their original values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
