observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - type: horizontal_line
          color: red
          length: 3
      output_objects:
        - type: horizontal_line
          color: red
          length: 5
      transformation: Horizontal extension of red line by one pixel on each end.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 2x2
      output_objects:
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 4x4
      transformation:  Expansion of the red square in all directions.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - type: single_pixel
          color: red
        - type: single_pixel
          color: red
      output_objects:
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 3x3
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 3x3
      transformation: Each red pixel expands into a 3x3 square.
general_rule: All contiguous groups of red pixels expand outwards by one pixel in all four directions (up, down, left, right), regardless of initial shape.
