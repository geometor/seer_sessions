Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the blue pixel**: Find the single blue (1) pixel in the grid. This pixel serves as the center of symmetry for the transformation.

2.  **Identify vertically adjacent yellow pixels**: Locate all yellow (4) pixels that are directly above or below the blue pixel. And continue identifying yellow pixels until another color is found.

3.  **Duplicate yellow pixels symmetrically**:
    *   If there are yellow pixels above the blue pixel, extend the same number and pattern of yellow pixels by the same distance below, as long as there are available cells.
    *   If there are yellow pixels below the blue pixel, extend the same number and pattern of yellow pixels by the same distance above, as long as there are available cells.

4.  **Leave other pixels unchanged:** All pixels that are not part of the duplicated yellow structure should retain their original values.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
