Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The input grids appear to have a central "cross" or "plus" shape formed by colored pixels (non-zero values). The transformation seems to involve duplicating some parts of this cross shape.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)
      - color_representation:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 8: azure}

  - object: cross_shape
    properties:
      - composition: contiguous non-zero pixels
      - shape:  '+' (plus sign)
      - location: centered (approximately)

  - action: duplication
    description: Replication of certain parts of the cross shape.
    parameters:
      - source: vertical arms of the cross
      - destination: potentially new rows added below and/or above existing non-zero rows

  - relation: adjacency
    description:  Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Relevant for defining the cross shape.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the central "cross" shape in the input grid. This is defined as a set of contiguous, non-zero pixels forming a plus shape.

2.  **Identify Arms:** the arms of the cross shape can be found by color. In at least one
    case, the input cross has more than 4 arms.

3.  **Duplicate Vertical Arms:** If there are vertical arms of the cross, create
    a copy of it in the row adjacent to the center of the cross.

4.  **No change of other pixels**: Do not make any other changes to any other pixels.

In summary the logic is duplicating the cross arms above or below the center row.
