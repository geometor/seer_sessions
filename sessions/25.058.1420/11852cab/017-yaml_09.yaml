- objects:
    - color: blue (1)
      role: reference point
      properties:
        - unique: true
    - color: yellow (4)
      role: target for duplication
      properties:
        - adjacent:
            - vertically adjacent to blue pixel
- actions:
    - name: vertical_duplication
      description: Duplicate yellow pixels vertically, maintaining symmetry with respect to the blue pixel.
      conditions:
        - trigger: Presence of a blue pixel and vertically adjacent yellow pixels.
        - symmetry: The number of yellow pixels duplicated above the blue pixel matches the number duplicated below.  If there are no pixels above or below, extend in the available space.
