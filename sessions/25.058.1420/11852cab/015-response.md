Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by integers 0-9. The primary colors involved in the transformation appear to be azure (8), yellow (4), and blue (1). White (0) seems to represent the background or empty space. The core change seems to involve a duplication of yellow (4) pixels in relation to the blue(1) pixel, specifically in the vertical direction.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - yellow (4)
        - blue (1)
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: duplicate
    object: yellow pixel
    condition: vertical adjacency to blue pixel

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [pixel, pixel]
    directions: [vertical, horizontal, diagonal]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single blue (1) pixel within the grid.
2.  **Locate vertically adjacent pixels:** Find all of the yellow pixels that are vertically adjacent to existing yellow pixels.
3. **Duplicate Yellow:** If there are two yellow pixels arranged vertically on opposite sides of the blue one, leave them. If yellow pixels are arranged vertically adjacent only on one side of the blue pixel, replicate the single vertical line of yellow pixels onto the opposite side of the blue pixel, such that it becomes symmetrical about the blue pixel.
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including azure (8) and white (0), remain unchanged.

In short, the transformation duplicates yellow pixels vertically based on their adjacencies, creating symmetry around the blue pixel.
