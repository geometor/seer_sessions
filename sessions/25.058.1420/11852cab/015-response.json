The primary colors involved in the transformation appear to be azure (8), yellow (4), and blue (1). White (0) seems to represent the background or empty space. The core change seems to involve a duplication of yellow (4) pixels in relation to the blue(1) pixel, specifically in the vertical direction.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If yellow pixels are arranged vertically adjacent only on one side of the blue pixel, replicate the single vertical line of yellow pixels onto the opposite side of the blue pixel, such that it becomes symmetrical about the blue pixel.\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including azure (8) and white (0), remain unchanged.\n\nIn short, the transformation duplicates yellow pixels vertically based on their adjacencies, creating symmetry around the blue pixel.\n"
