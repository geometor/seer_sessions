Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous shape formed by the digit '5' (gray) in the input grid.
2.  **Split and Replace:** Replace the gray colored pixels. The left part of the shape is replaced by '2's (red) and the right part by '8' (azure). A pixel belong to the left or right part based on a vertical split.
3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid, which have the value '0' (white), remain unchanged.
4. **Vertical split reference:** to determine which pixels of the shape get the color on the left or right, we locate the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the shape. The x coordinate of leftmost pixel will form the reference to color with the left color and the x coordinate of the rightmost pixel will be the reference to color the right color. The shape's pixels that have and x between these 2 extreme values, will be assigned the color associated with the closest extreme.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
