The primary change seems to be a substitution of certain color values with others, while maintaining the spatial arrangement (shape and position) of the original colored regions. Specifically, one color is replaced by two different colors, seemingly based on a pattern within the original shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

'Outer' seems to be the external boundary.\n3. **Inner Replacement:** The inner pixels, not part of the external boundary, should form horizontal lines, from left to right, top to bottom. If the length of a line is odd, the central pixel is 8 (azure). If the length is even, the central two pixels are 8 (azure) and the rest of the pixels are 2 (red).\n4.  **Preserve Background:** Keep all pixels with the color value 0 (white) unchanged.\n5, output the changed grid.\n\nEssentially a gray object is in the input, and is replaced by red horizontal lines with a central azure pixel or two central azure pixels.\n"
