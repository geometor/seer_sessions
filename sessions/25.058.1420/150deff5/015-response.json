The input grid contains a shape formed by the digit '5' (gray) on a background of '0' (white). The output grid seems to maintain the same shape, but the '5's are replaced by '2's (red) and '8's (azure). The '2's form the left side of 3 and the 8's form the right part of the 3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A pixel belong to the left or right part based on a vertical split.\n3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid, which have the value '0' (white), remain unchanged.\n4. **Vertical split reference:** to determine which pixels of the shape get the color on the left or right, we locate the leftmost and right most pixels of the shape. The x coordinate of leftmost pixel will form the reference to color with the left color and the x coordinate of the rightmost pixel will be the reference to color the right color. The shape's pixels that have and x between these 2 extreme values, will be assigned the color associated with the closest extreme.\n\n"
