Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous shape formed by the digit '5' (gray) in the input grid.
2.  **Split and Replace:** Replace the gray colored pixels. The left part of the shape is replaced by '2's (red) and the right part by '8' (azure). A pixel belong to the left or right part based on a vertical split.
3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid, which have the value '0' (white), remain unchanged.
4. **Vertical split reference:** to determine which pixels of the shape get the color on the left or right, we locate the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the shape. The x coordinate of leftmost pixel will form the reference to color with the left color and the x coordinate of the rightmost pixel will be the reference to color the right color. The shape's pixels that have and x between these 2 extreme values, will be assigned the color associated with the closest extreme.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying a contiguous shape of '5' (gray) and splitting it vertically, replacing parts with '2' (red) and '8' (azure). However, the provided results indicate some discrepancies. The code generally works, but it needs to address cases where there are multiple groups of 5s.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Multiple Shapes:** The core issue seems to be the presence of multiple distinct shapes of color '5'. The current code only considers one shape. We need to modify the program to handle multiple shapes of 5s independently.
2.  **Refine Splitting Logic:** Double check how we split and that the left and right coloring is always performed correctly.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution for accuracy):**

    # Find shapes in input, output, and expected output

    expected_output_shapes_2 = find_shapes(expected_output_grid, 2)

      1. Find all contiguous shapes of color 5.
      2. For each shape:
         a. Determine the leftmost x-coordinate (min_x).
         b. Determine the rightmost x-coordinate (max_x).
         c. For each pixel in the shape:
            i. If the pixel's x-coordinate is min_x, change its color to 2 (red).
            ii. If the pixel's x-coordinate is max_x, change its color to 8 (azure).
            iii. Otherwise, if the pixel's x is closer to min_x, color it 2 (red).
            iv. Otherwise, color it 8 (azure).
    output:
      - red_shape
      - azure_shape
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes formed by the digit '5' (gray) in the input grid.  There may be multiple, distinct shapes.
2.  **Process Each Shape:** For *each* identified gray shape:
    a. **Find Extremes:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates (horizontal positions) of the shape.
    b. **Split and Replace:** Replace the gray pixels within that shape.
        *   Pixels at the leftmost x-coordinate become '2' (red).
        *   Pixels at the rightmost x-coordinate become '8' (azure).
        *  Other pixels: those closer to leftmost are colored red (2), and those closer to rightmost, azure (8).
3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid (those not part of any identified gray shape) remain unchanged.

The key improvement is explicitly handling *multiple* gray shapes and applying the splitting and replacement logic to each one independently. The previous program treated all 5s as a single connected shape. Also improved the clarity of the description.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
