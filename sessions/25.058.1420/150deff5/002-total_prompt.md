<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x1202 at 0x7A608CEF5E50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value (represented by digits 0-9). The primary element is a single connected "object" composed of grey (5) pixels in the input grid. This object undergoes a color transformation, resulting in two distinct colored regions within the original object's shape in the output grid. The colors used for replacement appear to be azure (8) and red (2), with the assignment depending on the shape and position of the input object and adjacent colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: "primary_shape"
    input_color: 5  # Grey
    output_colors: [8, 2]  # Azure, Red
    connectivity: "4-connected" # Pixels are considered connected if they share an edge (not diagonally)
  - transformation: "color_replacement"
    description: "The grey object is recolored with two colors based on relative pixel positions."
  - spatial_relation_red: "left_column_or_area"
    description: "red(2) is general assigned to fill leftmost columns of the original input shape"
  - spatial_relation_azure: "remaining_area_fill"
     description: "azure (8) fills the areas not colored red"
  - edge_cases: "left_column_width"
    description: "the width of left-most column of the input shape determines the extent of the red color"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Object:** Locate the contiguous region of grey (5) pixels in the input grid. This forms the primary object.

2.  **Determine Leftmost Column(s):** find the column containing the left-most edge of the object

3.  **Assign Red:**
    color all pixels in this column red (2).

4. **Color remaining object parts azure:** Color all the remaining connected pixels that are part of the
   object, but are not in the leftmost column, azure (8).

5.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the primary object, which is now colored with red and azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
