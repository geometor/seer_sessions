      1. Find all contiguous shapes of color 5.
      2. For each shape:
         a. Determine the leftmost x-coordinate (min_x).
         b. Determine the rightmost x-coordinate (max_x).
         c. For each pixel in the shape:
            i. If the pixel's x-coordinate is min_x, change its color to 2 (red).
            ii. If the pixel's x-coordinate is max_x, change its color to 8 (azure).
            iii. Otherwise, if the pixel's x is closer to min_x, color it 2 (red).
            iv. Otherwise, color it 8 (azure).
    output:
      - red_shape
      - azure_shape
