Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grids consistently contain a connected shape made of blue (1) pixels on a white (0) background. The transformation seems to selectively change some of the blue pixels to red, while leaving the rest of the blue pixels and white background unchanged. The location of red pixels appears related to the shape of the connected blue regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red]
      - width: 10
      - height: 10
  - name: blue_shape
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - shape: irregular
      - location: varies
  - name: red_shape
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - color: red
      - shape: varies, derived from blue_shape
      - location: within_blue_shape

actions:
 - name: change_color
   agent: system
   input: blue_pixels, blue_shape
   properties: change pixels that meet a shape criteria to red
   output: red pixels, modified grid

relationships:
  - type: part_of
    subject: blue_shape
    object: grid
  - type: derived_from
    subject: red_shape
    object: blue_shape
  - type: color_change
    source: blue_shape
    target: red_shape
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue shape:** Locate the contiguous block of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Analyze the shape:** Determine the leftmost columns of the blue shape.
3. **Change to red**: Transform the leftmost columns to red(2) in all rows where it is found.
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid, where the identified pixels within the blue shape have been changed to red, and all other pixels remain the same.
