Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to find an enclosed area *on the left side* of a blue object and change its color to red. The provided examples and results indicate a few key issues:

1.  **"Left Side" Specificity:** The concept of "left side" is too restrictive. The enclosed area can be above, below, or to the right of the blue object, as long as it's fully enclosed *by* the blue object. The initial code's attempt to prioritize leftward movement in the flood fill is incorrect.
2.  **Enclosure Definition:** The flood fill algorithm needs to correctly identify a region *completely* enclosed by blue. The current implementation has flaws, evident from incorrect fills. It does not work when there is complex blue object, such as example 2.
3. **Start point for search:** The initial concept tried scan from left side to find a start - this assumes that enclosed region will always be to the left.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Remove Directional Bias:** Eliminate the "left side" constraint from the natural language program and the code. Focus on finding *any* fully enclosed area, regardless of its relative position to the blue object.
2.  **Improve Enclosure Detection:** Refactor the flood fill to accurately detect a fully enclosed region. The current algorithm is insufficient. We are looking for all 0-value cells that connected and who's neighbors are all blue cells.
3. **Correct start points** start point should be determined by searching around a blue pixel for a zero-valued pixel.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations about the provided code's output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** A simple blue rectangle enclosing a single white pixel.
    *   **Expected Output:** The white pixel becomes red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Correct. The code successfully filled the enclosed area.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   Blue object count: 1
        *   Enclosed area count: 1
        *   Enclosed area size: 1x1
        *   Enclosed changed color: Yes (white to red)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** A more complex blue shape ("U" shaped) enclosing a region of white pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** The white pixels inside the "U" are turned red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Incorrect. Many other white pixels outside blue "U" changed to red.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   Blue object count: 1
        *   Enclosed area count: 1
        *   Enclosed area size: 3x3
        *    Enclosed changed color: Yes (white to red)

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** A blue vertical line with no enclosed regions.
    *   **Expected Output:** No change.
    *   **Actual Output:** No change. The code appears to work.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   Blue object count: 1
        *   Enclosed area count: 0
        *   Enclosed area size: N/A
        *   Enclosed changed color: No

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    blue_objects:
      - shape: rectangle
        enclosed_area:
          exists: true
          color_change: white_to_red
          size: 1x1
  - example_id: 2
    blue_objects:
      - shape: U-shape
        enclosed_area:
          exists: true
          color_change: white_to_red
          size: 3x3
  - example_id: 3
    blue_objects:
      - shape: vertical_line
        enclosed_area:
          exists: false
          color_change: none
          size: N/A
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels. Consider each of these a single "blue object."
2.  **Find Enclosed Areas:** For each blue object, check if it fully encloses any regions of white (0) pixels. A region is considered "enclosed" if all of its 0-valued pixels border one or more blue pixels from that object.
3. **Change color** If one or more regions exist that is enclosed, change all those pixels within all enclosed areas from white (0) to red (2).
4.  **Otherwise:** If no enclosed area is found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
