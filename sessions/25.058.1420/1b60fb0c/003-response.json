The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grid appears to contain a blue object, somewhat resembling a stylized \"S\" shape, against a white background. The output grid maintains the same dimensions and background, but with a portion of the blue object replaced by red pixels. Specifically, red pixels appear to fill an enclosed area on the left side of the blue object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
