Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, with each pixel having a color value represented by an integer (0-9). The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grid seems to contain a shape made of blue (1) pixels against a white (0) background. The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific part, region or sub-shape within the blue shape and changing its color to red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    type: grid
    color: white (0)
    property: static

  - name: shape_1
    type: object
    color: blue (1)
    property: contiguous

  - name: sub_shape_1
    type: object
    color: red (2)
    property: part_of_shape_1

actions:
  - name: identify_sub_shape
    description: locate a specific region within shape_1. The rule is based on surrounding.

  - name: change_color
    description: change the color of a sub_shape from blue (1) to red (2)

relationships:
   - sub_shape_1 is contained within shape_1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue (1) shape:** Find all contiguous blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Locate the sub-shape:** Identify the leftmost vertical contiguous block of the blue shape, only when at that 'x' coordinate, it is surrounded by white pixels on the top and on the bottom and by three of the left side.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of this leftmost segment to red (2).
4. All other pixels remain the same color.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
