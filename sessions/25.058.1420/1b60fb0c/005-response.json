            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to find an enclosed area *on the left side* of a blue object and change its color to red. The provided examples and results indicate a few key issues:\n\n1.  **\"Left Side\" Specificity:** The concept of \"left side\" is too restrictive. The enclosed area can be above, below, or to the right of the blue object, as long as it's fully enclosed *by* the blue object. The initial code's attempt to prioritize leftward movement in the flood fill is incorrect.\n2.  **Enclosure Definition:** The flood fill algorithm needs to correctly identify a region *completely* enclosed by blue. The current implementation has flaws, evident from incorrect fills. It does not work when there is complex blue object, such as example 2.\n3. **Start point for search:** The initial concept tried scan from left side to find a start - this assumes that enclosed region will always be to the left.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Remove Directional Bias:** Eliminate the \"left side\" constraint from the natural language program and the code. Focus on finding *any* fully enclosed area, regardless of its relative position to the blue object.\n2.  **Improve Enclosure Detection:** Refactor the flood fill to accurately detect a fully enclosed region. The current algorithm is insufficient. We are looking for all 0-value cells that connected and who's neighbors are all blue cells.\n3. **Correct start points** start point should be determined by searching around a blue pixel for a zero-valued pixel.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations about the provided code's output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** A simple blue rectangle enclosing a single white pixel.\n    *   **Expected Output:** The white pixel becomes red.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Correct. The code successfully filled the enclosed area.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   Blue object count: 1\n        *   Enclosed area count: 1\n        *   Enclosed area size: 1x1\n        *   Enclosed changed color: Yes (white to red)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** A more complex blue shape (\"U\" shaped) enclosing a region of white pixels.\n    *   **Expected Output:** The white pixels inside the \"U\" are turned red.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Incorrect. Many other white pixels outside blue \"U\" changed to red.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   Blue object count: 1\n        *   Enclosed area count: 1\n        *   Enclosed area size: 3x3\n        *    Enclosed changed color: Yes (white to red)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** A blue vertical line with no enclosed regions.\n    *   **Expected Output:** No change.\n    *   **Actual Output:** No change. The code appears to work.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   Blue object count: 1\n        *   Enclosed area count: 0\n        *   Enclosed area size: N/A\n        *   Enclosed changed color: No\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    blue_objects:\n      - shape: rectangle\n        enclosed_area:\n          exists: true\n          color_change: white_to_red\n          size: 1x1\n  - example_id: 2\n    blue_objects:\n      - shape: U-shape\n        enclosed_area:\n          exists: true\n          color_change: white_to_red\n          size: 3x3\n  - example_id: 3\n    blue_objects:\n      - shape: vertical_line\n        enclosed_area:\n          exists: false\n          color_change: none\n          size: N/A\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels. Consider each of these a single \"blue object.\"\n2.  **Find Enclosed Areas:** For each blue object, check if it fully encloses any regions of white (0) pixels. A region is considered \"enclosed\" if all of its 0-valued pixels border one or more blue pixels from that object.\n3. **Change color** If one or more regions exist that is enclosed, change all those pixels within all enclosed areas from white (0) to red (2).\n4.  **Otherwise:** If no enclosed area is found, the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n"
