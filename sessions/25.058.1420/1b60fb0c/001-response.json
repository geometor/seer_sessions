The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grids consistently contain a connected shape made of blue (1) pixels on a white (0) background. The transformation seems to selectively change some of the blue pixels to red, while leaving the rest of the blue pixels and white background unchanged. The location of red pixels appears related to the shape of the connected blue regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
