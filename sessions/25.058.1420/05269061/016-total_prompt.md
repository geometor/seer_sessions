Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4), moving from top-left to bottom-right. The rest of the grid is filled with white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, but the white pixels are replaced, seemingly completing the diagonal patterns started by the non-white pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains diagonal lines of colored pixels (azure, green, and yellow) on a white background.
  - object: |
      Pixels of different colors: 0 (white), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), and 8 (azure).
  - relationship: |
      The non-white colors form incomplete diagonal stripes.
  - transformation: |
      The white pixels (0) in the input are replaced in the output.
  - property: |
      The replacement colors alternate between azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4).
  - pattern: |
      The output grid exhibits complete, alternating diagonal stripes of azure, green, and yellow.
  - constraint:
      The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify initial stripes:** Observe the existing diagonal stripes formed by the non-white pixels (azure, green, and yellow) in the input grid.
2.  **Extend Stripes** Continue each diagonal stripe, maintaining the color of the pixels and wrapping around to extend from all sides.
3.    **Fill Background**: replace each white pixel to extend a nearby stripe.

In simpler terms, the transformation extends the existing colored diagonals, wrapping around the edges of the grid, and using the color sequence azure, green, yellow, repeating.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
