The non-zero digits appear to form a diagonal line extending downwards and to the right. The output is also a 7x7 grid, but it's filled with a repeating pattern of the numbers 1, 2, and 4, arranged in a checkerboard-like fashion. The zeros in the input grid are replaced, the original input non-zero digits do not exist in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Fill the output grid with a repeating pattern of the numbers 1, 2, and 4. The pattern starts with '2' in the top-left cell (0,0) and proceeds as follows.\n\n3. **Checkerboard Application:** Consider the grid to be a checkerboard and fill each cell.\n    -   If the sum of the row and column indices is even, and it is the first element, fill with 2. If not, fill with the next item in the pattern 1,2,4.\n    -   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, fill with the previous item in the pattern 1,2,4.\n\n4. **Result:** the output grid replaces the original input grid with a 1, 2, 4 repeating sequence.\n"
