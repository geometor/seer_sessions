objects:
  - name: seed
    description: The base pattern that is tiled.
    properties:
      size: Varies (3x3, 4x4 observed).
      values: Derived from input, often diagonal dominance of non-zero values.

  - name: grid
    description: 2D array of color values.
    properties:
      size: Varies.
      values: 0-9 (representing colors).

actions:
  - name: tiling
    description: Repeating the seed pattern to fill the output grid.

  - name: seed_extraction
    description: Extracting the seed values and generating the seed structure.

  - name: dynamic_replacement
