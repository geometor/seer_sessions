Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. Disregard the input grid's values.
3. Fill the output grid with a repeating 1, 2, 4 pattern in a checkerboard style.
    - Start with '2' in the top-left corner.
    - If (row + col) is even: fill with the next in the pattern.
    - If (row + col) is odd: fill with the previous in the pattern.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and identify areas for improvement in the natural language program and the code itself.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a limited observation (likely just the first training example). The code attempts a checkerboard pattern with a repeating sequence of 1, 2, and 4. However, the provided test results across the full training set reveal that this initial assumption is incorrect, and the code needs significant adjustments. The failures indicate that the simple checkerboard and the 1, 2, 4 sequence aren't universally applicable.

My strategy will involve these steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll meticulously examine each input-output pair in the training set. I'll pay close attention to the size of the grids, the placement of colors, and any potential relationships between input and output that go beyond a simple checkerboard.

2.  **Pattern Identification:** I'll look for alternative patterns. The 1, 2, 4 sequence might be a red herring.  Perhaps the pattern is simpler, or perhaps it depends on the row/column indices in a more complex way than initially assumed. I will consider different starting points, sequence, repetition style.

3.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the pattern analysis, I will revise the natural language program to describe the *actual* transformation rule more accurately.

4.  **Code Adaptation:** The revised natural language program will guide the changes necessary in the Python code to achieve the transformation.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using Code Execution where needed)**

Since I do not have direct access to execute the code, I must rely on a conceptual analysis, enhanced by my understanding of how grids and NumPy arrays work. I will describe what I *would* do with code execution if it were available, and perform a similar analysis based only on observation of the inputs and outputs.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, all zeros.
    *   Output: 3x3, checkerboard of 2 and 1.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, all zeros.
    *   Output: 5x5, checkerboard of 2 and 1.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7, all zeros.
    *   Output: 7x7, checkerboard of 2 and 1.

*If I had code execution, I would:*

1.  *Run the provided `transform` function on each input grid.*
2.  *Compare the generated output with the expected output, pixel by pixel.*
3.  *Calculate the accuracy (percentage of correctly predicted pixels) for each example.*
4. Print shape of input and output
5. Print the input grid
6. Print the expected output
7. Print the actual output

Based on the provided images, the current code generates a checkerboard pattern, but the original code logic uses a 1,2,4 sequence, which produces incorrect color outputs. The images all use a sequence of 1 and 2, and it appears the top left corner is always 2.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: d511f180
  - input_type: grid
  - output_type: grid
  - grid_properties:
      - dimensions_vary: true # The grids have different sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7)
      - all_input_values_zero: true # The input grids are always all zeros.
      - output_pattern: checkerboard # The output is always a checkerboard pattern.
      - output_colors: [2, 1] # The checkerboard uses only colors 2 (red) and 1 (blue).
      - top_left_color: 2 # The top-left corner of the output grid is always color 2 (red).
  - transformation_type: conditional_fill
  - actions:
    - fill_based_on_position: true # Fill cells based on their row and column indices.
    - even_odd_rule: true  # The rule depends on whether (row + col) is even or odd.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  **Ignore Input Values:** Disregard the numerical values present in the input grid. The input grid serves only to determine the size of the output.
3. **Checkerboard Pattern:** Create output by filling the grid with the two colors 1 (blue) and 2 (red) forming a 2 color checkerboard.
4.  **Starting Color:** Always start with color 2 (red) in the top-left cell (row 0, column 0) of the output grid.
5. **Fill based on index:** Determine whether to fill cells based on the sum of its row, and column value:
    *   If `(row + column)` is even, fill the cell with the color 2 (red).
    *   If `(row + column)` is odd, fill the cell with the color 1 (blue).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
