Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The non-zero digits appear to form a diagonal line extending downwards and to the right. The output is also a 7x7 grid, but it's filled with a repeating pattern of the numbers 1, 2, and 4, arranged in a checkerboard-like fashion. The zeros in the input grid are replaced, the original input non-zero digits do not exist in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: Integers (0-9)
    description: Contains a diagonal line of non-zero digits.
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: Integers (1, 2, 4)
    description: Filled with a repeating 1, 2, 4 pattern.

properties:
  - name: Color
    values:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      4: yellow

actions:
  - name: Replace
    description: All input grid values are replaced.
  - name: PatternFill
    description: Output grid is filled with a repeating pattern.

relationships:
  - InputGrid and OutputGrid have the same dimensions.
  - The non-zero values in InputGrid seem to have no effect on the contents of OutputGrid, other than existing.
  - The OutputGrid follows the sequence 1, 2, 4 repeating sequence.
  - Output grid pattern alternates starting with 2 in the top-left.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7 in this case).

2.  **Pattern Generation:** Disregard all values of the original input. Fill the output grid with a repeating pattern of the numbers 1, 2, and 4. The pattern starts with '2' in the top-left cell (0,0) and proceeds as follows.

3. **Checkerboard Application:** Consider the grid to be a checkerboard and fill each cell.
    -   If the sum of the row and column indices is even, and it is the first element, fill with 2. If not, fill with the next item in the pattern 1,2,4.
    -   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, fill with the previous item in the pattern 1,2,4.

4. **Result:** the output grid replaces the original input grid with a 1, 2, 4 repeating sequence.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
