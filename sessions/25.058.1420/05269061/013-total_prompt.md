Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  **Ignore Input Values:** Disregard the numerical values present in the input grid. The input grid serves only to determine the size of the output.
3. **Checkerboard Pattern:** Create output by filling the grid with the two colors 1 (blue) and 2 (red) forming a 2 color checkerboard.
4.  **Starting Color:** Always start with color 2 (red) in the top-left cell (row 0, column 0) of the output grid.
5. **Fill based on index:** Determine whether to fill cells based on the sum of its row, and column value:
    *   If `(row + column)` is even, fill the cell with the color 2 (red).
    *   If `(row + column)` is odd, fill the cell with the color 1 (blue).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
