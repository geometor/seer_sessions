Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extends the existing colored diagonals in the input grid, wrapping around the edges, and using the color sequence azure, green, yellow, repeating.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by extending the diagonal color patterns.
    """
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    color_sequence = [8, 3, 4]  # Azure, Green, Yellow

    # Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] == 0:  # If the cell is white
                # Determine the diagonal index and corresponding color
                diagonal_index = (c - r) % len(color_sequence)
                # Adjust for negative modulo, not needed for python
                output_grid[r, c] = color_sequence[diagonal_index]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simplified understanding, assuming a straightforward extension of existing diagonals. However, the provided test results, especially failing Example 3, reveal a flaw in this interpretation. The code isn't correctly handling the diagonal pattern extension and wrapping. It seems to be overwriting pixels and not properly accounting for cases where a pixel doesn't have pre-existing diagonal to extend. The core issue seems to be an incorrect diagonal_index. Instead of a fixed color sequence, it needs to start from existing non-black colors and expand.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to how diagonals are extended, which colors are used, and how wrapping occurs.
2.  **Refine Diagonal Identification:** The current method of calculating `diagonal_index` is incorrect. We need to find a way to trace diagonals accurately, potentially by starting from existing colored cells and extending outwards.
3. **Improve the color pattern**: consider how existing colored objects impact
   the transformation
4.  **Handle Wrapping Correctly:** Ensure that when a diagonal extends beyond the grid boundaries, it wraps around to the opposite side properly.
5.  **Iterative Testing:** After each modification to the natural language program (and subsequently the code), test against all available examples.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To understand the patterns, let's put together reports on properties of the
input and output.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def grid_report(grid, grid_name="Grid"):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    num_unique_colors = len(unique_colors)
    color_counts = {color: np.sum(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}

    report = f"{grid_name}:\n"
    report += f"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}\n"
    report += f"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}\n"
    report += f"  Number of Unique Colors: {num_unique_colors}\n"
    report += f"  Color Counts: {color_counts}\n"

    return report

def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

    print(grid_report(input_grid, "Input Grid"))
    print(grid_report(output_grid, "Output Grid"))
    print("---")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
