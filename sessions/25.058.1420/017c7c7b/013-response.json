The input grid is 6 rows by 3 columns. The input consists of alternating rows of \"white, blue, white\" and \"blue, white, blue\".\n*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array of pixels, similar in structure to the input, but with different color values (0=white, 2=red). The output grid is 9 rows by 3 columns. It appears to extend the input by repeating the rows. The output consists of alternating rows of \"white, red, white\" and \"red, white, red\".\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve replacing the blue pixels (1) in the input with red pixels (2) in the output, and lengthening the vertical axis.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If a pixel is blue (value 1), change it to red (value 2). If a pixel is white (value 0), it does not change and remains 0.\n3. **Vertical Expansion:** Expand the new grid, by repeating each existing row by 1.5, that is, add half as many rows to each row by copying the row content. Since fractions are not possible, the total length can be achieved by tripling the number of original rows and subsequently removing 1/3.\n4. The result will be the output grid.\n\n"
