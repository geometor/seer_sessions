Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids. The input grids contain pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids but contain white (0) and red (2) pixels. The transformation appears to be a simple color substitution. There's a consistent pattern where blue pixels in the input become red pixels in the output, while white pixels remain white.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain pixels of color white (0) and blue (1).
  - observation: Output grids contain pixels of color white (0) and red (2).
  - relationship: The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.
  - transformation: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid are replaced with red (2) pixels in the output grid.
  - transformation: White (0) pixels in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid.
  - object: grid - a two dimensional array of single digit integers
  - property: height - number of rows
  - property: width - number of columns
  - property: pixel color - integer representing a color
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **If** the pixel's color is blue (1), **then** change it to red (2) in the corresponding position of the output grid.
3.  **Else If** the pixel's color is white (0), **then** keep the output grid cell at the corresponding position at white(0).
4. The dimensions (height and width) of input and output are the same.

In essence, the program performs a direct color substitution, replacing all blue pixels with red, and leaving white pixels unchanged.
