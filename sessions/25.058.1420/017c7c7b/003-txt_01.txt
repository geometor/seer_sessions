     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output (from `transform` function):** (Same as expected)
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Diff:** None. The code works as expected for this specific case.

*Example 2*

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output (from `transform` function):** (Same as expected)
   ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Diff:** None.  The code *also* works as expected for this case.

*Example 3*

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output (from `transform` function):** (Same as expected)
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Diff:** None. The code works as expected.
