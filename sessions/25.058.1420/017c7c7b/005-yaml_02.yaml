          shape: contiguous block
    output:
      objects:
        - color: red #2
          shape: contiguous block, corresponds to input blue block
        - color: white #0
          shape: contiguous block, corresponds to input white block
    transformation: blue becomes red, white stays white

          shape: entire grid
    transformation: white becomes blue
