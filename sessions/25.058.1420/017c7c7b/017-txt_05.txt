        ```
     * Mismatch: An extra blank row is inserted at the end.

**Analysis:**

The critical difference between Example 3 and the others is that Example 3 contains *two* rows that have blue pixels. The expected output *does not* duplicate the blank rows, whereas the current program does. The blank rows are inserted *between* rows with blue, but not after the last one. This strongly suggests that a blank row is inserted *only* when a row containing blue is immediately followed by *another* row containing blue, effectively separating blocks of blue.
