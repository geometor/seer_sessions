Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal shapes.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical and 1x2 horizontal shapes.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** In the input grid, there are two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One on the top left is a vertical 2x1 and second one on the right is a 1x2 horizontal shape.

2.  **Change based on relative position:** For each such shape, find its down-right diagonal position.

3.  **Create Blue Pixel:** In output, set to blue (color 1) the down-right diagonal for both shapes.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation involves identifying the down-right diagonal neighbor from azure shapes, and turning those pixels from background to blue.


*text:*
Okay, here's the Python code implementing the transformation rule, based on the analysis I provided:



*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation involves identifying azure (color 8) shapes in the input grid. 
For each azure pixel, the transformation checks if it's part of a connected azure region. 
It then identifies the down-right diagonal neighbor of each azure pixel, and changes that neighbor pixel to blue (color 1) in the output grid.

        for c in range(cols):
            if input_np[r, c] == 8:
                # Check bounds for down-right diagonal
                if r + 1 < rows and c + 1 < cols:
                    output_grid[r + 1, c + 1] = 1
    return output_grid.tolist()

    print()

```

*text:*


I've used numpy for easier grid manipulation. The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is azure (8), it checks if a down-right diagonal neighbor exists within the grid boundaries. If it does, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to blue (1).

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the provided input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several disconnected and connected azure pixels.

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Same as input.
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: single pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** The input grid contains several azure (color 8) pixels, some connected and others isolated.

2.  **Locate Down-Right Diagonal:** For *every* azure pixel, identify its down-right diagonal neighbor.

3.  **Transform to Blue:** Change the color of the down-right diagonal neighbor of the azure pixel to blue (color 1) in the output grid. Azure pixels stays azure.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The rule is: For each azure pixel in the input grid, change the color of its down-right diagonal neighbor to blue in the output grid, while keeping all of the azure pixels.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }

{ allowed imports that support the transform }
