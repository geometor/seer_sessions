Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The input grids vary in size, while the output grids are smaller, square grids (3x3 or 5x5).
2.  **Colors:** The grids use a palette of colors (0-9). Each input grid has one dominant "background" color and a few other colors forming distinct shapes or patterns.
3.  **Background Color:** The background color appears to be the most frequent color in the input grid. It's used extensively in the output grid as well.
4.  **Foreground Objects:** The non-background colors in the input form simple geometric shapes, typically involving 4 or 5 pixels. The shapes observed are rectangles (often represented by their 4 corners), crosses ('+'), and diamonds (rotated squares).
5.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying the unique non-background colors and their associated shapes in the input. Based on the number and types of these shapes/colors, a specific output grid size (3x3 or 5x5) and a symmetric pattern are chosen. The identified non-background colors and the background color are then placed into this pattern grid according to specific rules.
6.  **Output Patterns:** The output grids exhibit symmetry (horizontal and vertical). There appear to be three distinct output patterns observed:
    *   A 3x3 pattern seen in `train_1`.
    *   A 5x5 pattern seen in `train_2`.
    *   A different 5x5 pattern seen in `train_3`.
7.  **Color Assignment:** The assignment of input colors to specific positions in the output pattern seems to depend on the shape associated with the color (rectangle, cross, diamond) and sometimes the numerical value of the color (for sorting).
8.  **Size Determination:** The size of the output grid (N x N) appears related to the number of unique non-background colors (`k`). When `k=4`, N=5. When `k=2`, N can be 3 or 5, potentially depending on the total number of non-background pixels.

    properties:

        attributes:
          - height: fixed (3 or 5 observed)
          - width: fixed (3 or 5 observed), equals height
          - symmetry: horizontal and vertical

  - element: color
    properties:
      - role: background
        value: most frequent color in input
      - role: foreground
        value: colors other than background
        count: k (2 or 4 observed)
        forms: objects/shapes
  - element: object
    properties:
      - type: shape
        formed_by: contiguous pixels of the same foreground color
        examples:
          - shape_type: rectangle
            pixels: 4 (typically corners)
            colors_observed: azure(8), yellow(4), red(2), blue(1)
          - shape_type: cross
            pixels: 4 or 5
            colors_observed: green(3), orange(7)
          - shape_type: diamond
            pixels: 4
            colors_observed: blue(1)

relationships:
  - relationship: input_to_output_size
    notes: |
      Output size N x N seems determined by the count (k) of unique foreground colors.
      If k=4, N=5.
      If k=2, N=3 or N=5 (N=3 if total foreground pixels=9, else N=5 based on examples).
  - relationship: input_colors_shapes_to_output_pattern
    notes: |
      The specific output pattern (A, B, or C) depends on k and N.
      Pattern A (3x3) used when k=2, N=3.
      Pattern B (5x5) used when k=4, N=5.
      Pattern C (5x5) used when k=2, N=5.
  - relationship: color_assignment
    notes: |
      Foreground colors are assigned to specific roles within the output pattern based on shape type and color value.
      Pattern A: Rectangle color -> corners, Cross color -> edges.
      Pattern B: Diamond color -> inner corners; other 3 colors sorted -> outer corners, outer edges, inner edges.
      Pattern C: Rectangle color -> corners, Cross color -> center of edges.
      Background color fills remaining positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Input Grid:**
    a.  Determine the background color, which is the most frequent color in the input grid.
    b.  Identify all unique non-background (foreground) colors present in the input grid. Let the number of unique foreground colors be `k`.
    c.  For each unique foreground color, identify the contiguous shape(s) it forms. Determine the type of shape (e.g., rectangle, cross, diamond) and count the number of pixels in the shape(s) of that color. Calculate the total number of foreground pixels (`P_total`).

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size (N) and Pattern Type:**
    a.  If `k` = 4, set the output grid size N = 5 and select Pattern B.
    b.  If `k` = 2:
        i.  If `P_total` = 9, set the output grid size N = 3 and select Pattern A.
        ii. If `P_total` != 9, set the output grid size N = 5 and select Pattern C.

3.  **Assign Colors to the Selected Pattern:**
    a.  **For Pattern A (N=3, k=2):**
        i.  Identify the foreground color associated with the 'rectangle' shape (`ColorRect`).
        ii. Identify the foreground color associated with the 'cross' shape (`ColorCross`).
        iii. Create a 3x3 grid. Place `ColorRect` at the four corners. Place `ColorCross` at the center of the four edges. Place the background color in the center cell.
    b.  **For Pattern B (N=5, k=4):**
        i.  Identify the foreground color associated with the 'diamond' shape (`ColorDiamond`).
        ii. Identify the remaining three foreground colors (typically associated with 'rectangle' shapes). Sort these three colors numerically in ascending order: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`.
        iii. Create a 5x5 grid. Place `c1` at the four outer corners (OC). Place `c2` at the middle of the four outer edges (OE). Place `ColorDiamond` at the four inner corner positions (IC - at (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2) relative to the outer frame, actually coordinates like (0,2) (2,0) (2,4) (4,2) is wrong based on output, should be (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)? No, let's re-examine `train_2` output: `(0,2)=1`, `(2,0)=1`, `(2,4)=1`, `(4,2)=1`. Correcting IC positions to (0,2), (2,0), (2,4), (4,2)). Place `c3` at the middle of the four inner edges (IE - at (1,0), (0,1), (3,0), (0,3)? No, examine `train_2`: `(1,0)=8`, `(0,1)=4`. OK, IE are `(1,0), (3,0), (1,4), (3,4)`? No, `(1,0)=8`, `(3,0)=8`, `(1,4)=8`, `(3,4)=8`. Correcting IE positions to (1,0), (3,0), (1,4), (3,4)). Fill the central 3x3 block (from (1,1) to (3,3)) with the background color. *Correction:* Check pattern B structure carefully:
