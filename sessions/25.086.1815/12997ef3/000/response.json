Its shape varies across examples ('L', 'T', '+', 'S'/'Z').\n    *   Other objects are single pixels of various colors (magenta, red, green, azure, yellow).\n    *   The output grid consists of multiple objects, each being a 3x3 grid pattern.\n    *   The *shape* of the output objects matches the shape of the blue object found in the corresponding input grid (scaled or represented within a 3x3 bounding box).\n    *   The *colors* of the output objects correspond to the colors of the single non-blue pixels found in the input grid.\n    *   The number of output objects equals the number of single non-blue pixels in the input.\n    *   The blue object from the input does not appear directly in the output; it serves only as a shape template.\n    *   The arrangement of the output objects (stacked vertically or horizontally) depends on the relative positions of the single-pixel color sources in the input. If they share the same column, they stack vertically (Examples 1, 2). If they share the same row, they stack horizontally (Examples 3, 4).\n    *   When stacked horizontally, there is a single column of white pixels separating the output shapes. When stacked vertically, there is no separation.\n    *   The order of the stacked shapes in the output matches the order (top-to-bottom or left-to-right) of the corresponding single-pixel color sources in the input.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
