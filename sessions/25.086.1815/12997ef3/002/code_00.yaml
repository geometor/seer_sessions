Input_Objects:
  - type: Template_Shape
    color: blue (1)
    description: A single contiguous object made of blue pixels. Its shape is defined relative to its top-left corner within its minimal bounding box (observed to be <= 3x3). Connectivity includes diagonals.
  - type: Color_Source
    color: any color except white (0) and blue (1)
    description: Single pixels (no adjacent neighbors, including diagonals, of the same color).
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, column)

Output_Objects:
  - type: Individual_Shape
    description: A 3x3 grid representing the Template_Shape pattern painted with the color of a specific Color_Source. Generated for each Color_Source. Initialized as white (0).
  - type: Final_Grid
    description: The composite grid formed by arranging the Individual_Shapes.

Actions:
  1. Identification:
     - Find the contiguous blue object (Template_Shape).
     - Find all single, non-white, non-blue pixels (Color_Sources).
  2. Extraction:
     - Determine the relative pixel coordinates of the Template_Shape within a 3x3 grid anchored at its top-left corner.
  3. Sorting:
     - Sort the identified Color_Sources primarily by row index, then by column index.
  4. Generation:
     - For each sorted Color_Source, create a 3x3 Individual_Shape by applying the extracted Template_Shape pattern using the Color_Source's color onto a white background.
  5. Arrangement:
     - Analyze the spatial relationship of the original Color_Source positions.
     - If all Color_Sources share the same column index: Stack the corresponding Individual_Shapes vertically in their generated order.
     - If all Color_Sources share the same row index: Place the corresponding Individual_Shapes horizontally adjacent to each other (left-to-right) in their generated order, with *no* separating columns.
     - (Assumption: Cases where sources are neither in the same row nor same column might not occur or might default to a specific behavior, like vertical stacking, though this isn't fully confirmed by the examples).
  6. Construction:
     - Combine the Individual_Shapes according to the determined arrangement to form the Final_Grid.

Derived_Properties:
  - Output_Dimensions: Depend on the number of Color_Sources and their alignment.
    - Vertical: (3 * num_sources) x 3
    - Horizontal: 3 x (3 * num_sources)
