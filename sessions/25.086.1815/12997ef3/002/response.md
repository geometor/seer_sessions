The metrics confirm the analysis:
*   Example 3: Expected width 6 (two 3x3 shapes), Output width 7. Expected separators 0, Output separators 1. Width difference 1.
*   Example 4: Expected width 9 (three 3x3 shapes), Output width 11. Expected separators 0, Output separators 2. Width difference 2.

The code incorrectly adds one separator column between each shape when stacking horizontally. The rule should be to stack them directly adjacent.

Final check on the `is_single_pixel` logic in the code. The provided code snippet uses a slightly complex check. It first checks if `color not in [0, 1]`. Then, it iterates through neighbors (`dr`, `dc` from -1 to 1) and sets `is_isolated` to `False` if any neighbor has the same color. This seems correct for identifying pixels that have *no* adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) neighbors of the same color. The examples support this interpretation.

The assumption that the template shape fits within a 3x3 bounding box relative to its top-left corner also holds for all examples.

The sorting by row, then column seems correct and necessary for consistent output ordering.

The updated natural language program needs to explicitly state that horizontal stacking involves no separators.**General Assessment**

The provided Python code attempts to solve the ARC task by identifying a 'template' shape (from blue pixels) and 'color source' pixels (isolated non-blue, non-white pixels). It then replicates the template shape using the colors from the sources and arranges these replicated shapes.

The code successfully solves the first two examples where the color sources are aligned vertically, leading to vertical stacking of the output shapes.

However, the code fails on examples 3 and 4 where the color sources are aligned horizontally. The failure analysis indicates that the horizontal stacking logic incorrectly inserts a single column of white pixels between each replicated shape. The expected output for these horizontal cases shows the shapes placed directly adjacent to each other without any separator.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the horizontal stacking logic in the code generation phase to use `np.hstack` without adding the separator columns.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input_Objects:
  - type: Template_Shape
    color: blue (1)
    description: A single contiguous object made of blue pixels. Its shape is defined relative to its top-left corner within its minimal bounding box (observed to be <= 3x3). Connectivity includes diagonals.
  - type: Color_Source
    color: any color except white (0) and blue (1)
    description: Single pixels (no adjacent neighbors, including diagonals, of the same color).
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, column)

Output_Objects:
  - type: Individual_Shape
    description: A 3x3 grid representing the Template_Shape pattern painted with the color of a specific Color_Source. Generated for each Color_Source. Initialized as white (0).
  - type: Final_Grid
    description: The composite grid formed by arranging the Individual_Shapes.

Actions:
  1. Identification:
     - Find the contiguous blue object (Template_Shape).
     - Find all single, non-white, non-blue pixels (Color_Sources).
  2. Extraction:
     - Determine the relative pixel coordinates of the Template_Shape within a 3x3 grid anchored at its top-left corner.
  3. Sorting:
     - Sort the identified Color_Sources primarily by row index, then by column index.
  4. Generation:
     - For each sorted Color_Source, create a 3x3 Individual_Shape by applying the extracted Template_Shape pattern using the Color_Source's color onto a white background.
  5. Arrangement:
     - Analyze the spatial relationship of the original Color_Source positions.
     - If all Color_Sources share the same column index: Stack the corresponding Individual_Shapes vertically in their generated order.
     - If all Color_Sources share the same row index: Place the corresponding Individual_Shapes horizontally adjacent to each other (left-to-right) in their generated order, with *no* separating columns.
     - (Assumption: Cases where sources are neither in the same row nor same column might not occur or might default to a specific behavior, like vertical stacking, though this isn't fully confirmed by the examples).
  6. Construction:
     - Combine the Individual_Shapes according to the determined arrangement to form the Final_Grid.

Derived_Properties:
  - Output_Dimensions: Depend on the number of Color_Sources and their alignment.
    - Vertical: (3 * num_sources) x 3
    - Horizontal: 3 x (3 * num_sources)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Template:** Locate the single, contiguous object composed of blue (1) pixels in the input grid (using diagonal adjacency). Determine its shape relative to its top-left corner, fitting it within a 3x3 area. This is the `template_pattern`.
2.  **Identify Color Sources:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1), and which are 'single' pixels (meaning they have no neighbors, including diagonals, of the same color). Record the color and original (row, column) position of each such `color_source_pixel`.
3.  **Sort Sources:** Sort the list of `color_source_pixel`s based first on their row index (ascending) and then on their column index (ascending).
4.  **Generate Shapes:** For each `color_source_pixel` in the sorted list:
    a.  Create a new 3x3 grid filled with white (0) pixels.
    b.  Apply the `template_pattern` onto this 3x3 grid, using the color of the current `color_source_pixel`. This results in an `individual_output_shape`.
    c.  Collect these `individual_output_shape`s in the order they were generated.
5.  **Arrange Shapes:** Determine the arrangement based on the original positions of the sorted `color_source_pixel`s:
    a.  **Vertical Alignment:** If all `color_source_pixel`s have the same column index, stack the generated `individual_output_shape`s vertically, top-to-bottom, in the order they were generated.
    b.  **Horizontal Alignment:** If all `color_source_pixel`s have the same row index, place the generated `individual_output_shape`s horizontally adjacent to each other, left-to-right, in the order they were generated, with **no** separator columns between them.
    c.  **Other Alignments:** (Handle potential edge cases or default behavior if sources are neither strictly vertical nor horizontal - e.g., default to vertical stacking as observed in the previous code attempt's fallback).
6.  **Construct Output:** Combine the `individual_output_shape`s according to the determined arrangement to create the final output grid.
