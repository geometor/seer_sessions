            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves transforming a larger input grid into a fixed 3x3 output grid. The input grids consist primarily of a single background color (azure, maroon, or orange in the examples) with one or more white pixels scattered within. The output grid seems to summarize the spatial distribution of the white pixels from the input grid onto a 3x3 grid. The background color of the input is preserved as the background color of the output grid. The key transformation appears to map regions of the input grid to single cells in the output grid. Specifically, the input grid is divided into a 3x3 matrix of equal-sized rectangular regions. If any region in the input contains at least one white pixel, the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid becomes white; otherwise, it retains the background color.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
