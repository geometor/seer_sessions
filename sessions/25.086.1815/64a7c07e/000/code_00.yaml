task_description: Move azure objects horizontally based on their width.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - object_color: 8 (azure)
  - dimensions: variable (input and output have same dimensions)

objects:
  - type: contiguous_group_of_pixels
  - color: 8 (azure)
  - properties:
      - pixels: list of (row, col) coordinates
      - bounding_box: defined by min/max row and min/max column
      - width: calculated as (max_col - min_col + 1)

actions:
  - name: find_objects
    description: Identify all distinct connected components of azure pixels in the input grid.
    connectivity: 8-way (adjacency includes diagonals)
  - name: calculate_properties
    description: For each object, determine its bounding box and width.
  - name: translate_object
    description: Move each azure object horizontally to the right.
    parameters:
      - object: the specific azure object to move
      - shift_amount: horizontal distance to move (integer value)
    details: Each pixel (r, c) of the object moves to (r, c + shift_amount).

relationships:
  - type: shift_dependency
    description: The horizontal shift amount for each azure object is determined by its width.
    rule: shift_amount = object_width + 1

output_generation:
  - Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
  - For each identified azure object in the input:
      - Calculate its width.
      - Calculate the shift amount using the rule (width + 1).
      - Determine the new coordinates for each pixel of the object after applying the shift.
      - Place the azure color (8) at these new coordinates in the output grid.
