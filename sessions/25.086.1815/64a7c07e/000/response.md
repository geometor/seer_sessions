Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of varying sizes (5x5, 10x10, 12x12) filled primarily with white pixels (0).
2.  **Objects:** Each grid contains one or more distinct objects composed of azure pixels (8). These objects have different shapes and sizes (squares, 'H' shapes, irregular blobs). Objects appear to be defined by contiguous blocks of azure pixels (likely using 8-way connectivity, including diagonals).
3.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (0) and appears unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the azure objects horizontally to the right. The background pixels remain stationary.
5.  **Movement Pattern:** The amount each object shifts to the right is not constant across all objects within a grid or across different examples. It seems dependent on the properties of the specific object being moved.
6.  **Shift Calculation:** By analyzing the examples:
    *   Example 1: A 2-wide object shifts 2 columns right.
    *   Example 2: A 3-wide object ('H') shifts 4 columns right; a 1-wide object (single pixel) shifts 2 columns right.
    *   Example 3: A 4-wide object shifts 5 columns right; a 2-wide object shifts 3 columns right.
    *   This suggests a consistent rule: `horizontal_shift = object_width + 1`. The width is calculated based on the object's bounding box (max column index - min column index + 1).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Move azure objects horizontally based on their width.

grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - object_color: 8 (azure)
  - dimensions: variable (input and output have same dimensions)

objects:
  - type: contiguous_group_of_pixels
  - color: 8 (azure)
  - properties:
      - pixels: list of (row, col) coordinates
      - bounding_box: defined by min/max row and min/max column
      - width: calculated as (max_col - min_col + 1)

actions:
  - name: find_objects
    description: Identify all distinct connected components of azure pixels in the input grid.
    connectivity: 8-way (adjacency includes diagonals)
  - name: calculate_properties
    description: For each object, determine its bounding box and width.
  - name: translate_object
    description: Move each azure object horizontally to the right.
    parameters:
      - object: the specific azure object to move
      - shift_amount: horizontal distance to move (integer value)
    details: Each pixel (r, c) of the object moves to (r, c + shift_amount).

relationships:
  - type: shift_dependency
    description: The horizontal shift amount for each azure object is determined by its width.
    rule: shift_amount = object_width + 1

output_generation:
  - Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
  - For each identified azure object in the input:
      - Calculate its width.
      - Calculate the shift amount using the rule (width + 1).
      - Determine the new coordinates for each pixel of the object after applying the shift.
      - Place the azure color (8) at these new coordinates in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct, connected groups of azure pixels (color 8) in the input grid. Treat pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same group (object).
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Find the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the pixels of this object.
    b.  Calculate the width of the object's bounding box as `width = maximum_column_index - minimum_column_index + 1`.
    c.  Calculate the horizontal shift distance for this object as `shift = width + 1`.
    d.  For every pixel belonging to this object at position `(row, column)` in the input grid:
        i.  Calculate its new position in the output grid as `(row, column + shift)`.
        ii. Set the color of the pixel at this new position in the output grid to azure (8).
4.  Return the completed output grid.
