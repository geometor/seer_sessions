            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of varying sizes (5x5, 10x10, 12x12) filled primarily with white pixels (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each grid contains one or more distinct objects composed of azure pixels (8). These objects have different shapes and sizes (squares, 'H' shapes, irregular blobs). Objects appear to be defined by contiguous blocks of azure pixels (likely using 8-way connectivity, including diagonals).\n3.  **Background:** The background is consistently white (0) and appears unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the azure objects horizontally to the right. The background pixels remain stationary.\n5.  **Movement Pattern:** The amount each object shifts to the right is not constant across all objects within a grid or across different examples. It seems dependent on the properties of the specific object being moved.\n6.  **Shift Calculation:** By analyzing the examples:\n    *   Example 1: A 2-wide object shifts 2 columns right.\n    *   Example 2: A 3-wide object ('H') shifts 4 columns right; a 1-wide object (single pixel) shifts 2 columns right.\n    *   Example 3: A 4-wide object shifts 5 columns right; a 2-wide object shifts 3 columns right.\n    *   This suggests a consistent rule: `horizontal_shift = object_width + 1`. The width is calculated based on the object's bounding box (max column index - min column index + 1).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
