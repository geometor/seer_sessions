**Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code correctly identified the azure objects and understood that a horizontal shift was required. However, the calculation of the shift amount (`width + 1`) was incorrect. The results consistently show that the actual shift applied by the code is one unit greater than the expected shift.

The strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the object's properties (specifically its width) and the required horizontal shift distance. By comparing the calculated widths with the observed correct shifts in the examples, we can deduce the correct formula for the shift.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's analyze each example to confirm the object widths and the required shifts.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: One azure object.
    *   Bounding box: (1, 0) to (2, 1).
    *   Width: `max_col - min_col + 1` = `1 - 0 + 1` = 2.
    *   Observed shift in expected output: The leftmost pixel moves from column 0 to column 2. Shift = 2.
    *   Code's calculated shift: `width + 1` = `2 + 1` = 3. This matches the incorrect `transformed output`.
    *   Discrepancy: Code shifted by 3, expected shift is 2.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two azure objects.
    *   Object 1 (top): Bounding box (1, 1) to (3, 3). Width = `3 - 1 + 1` = 3. Observed shift = 3 (leftmost pixel moves from column 1 to 4). Code's shift = `3 + 1` = 4.
    *   Object 2 (bottom): Bounding box (6, 1) to (6, 1). Width = `1 - 1 + 1` = 1. Observed shift = 1 (pixel moves from column 1 to 2). Code's shift = `1 + 1` = 2.
    *   Discrepancy: Code shifted the top object by 4 (expected 3) and the bottom object by 2 (expected 1).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Two azure objects.
    *   Object 1 (top): Bounding box (1, 1) to (4, 4). Width = `4 - 1 + 1` = 4. Observed shift = 4 (leftmost pixel moves from column 1 to 5). Code's shift = `4 + 1` = 5.
    *   Object 2 (bottom): Bounding box (8, 4) to (9, 5). Width = `5 - 4 + 1` = 2. Observed shift = 2 (leftmost pixel moves from column 4 to 6). Code's shift = `2 + 1` = 3.
    *   Discrepancy: Code shifted the top object by 5 (expected 4) and the bottom object by 3 (expected 2).

**Conclusion from Metrics:** The required horizontal shift for each azure object is exactly equal to its width (the width of its bounding box), not `width + 1`.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task_description: Translate azure objects horizontally based on their width.
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: connected_group
    color: 8 # azure
    connectivity: 8-way # includes diagonals
properties_extracted:
  - width: horizontal span of the object's bounding box (max_col - min_col + 1)
actions:
  - action: translate
    direction: horizontal # positive (right)
    amount_calculation: width # The shift amount equals the object's width
    reference_point: each pixel within the object
grid_modification:
  - operation: copy_paste
    source: pixels of the identified azure object
    destination: new position calculated by adding the shift amount to the original column index
    target_color: 8 # azure
    output_initialization: background_color (0)
constraints:
  - Preserve original pixel positions relative to each other within the object.
  - Apply transformation independently to each identified object.
  - Ensure translated pixels stay within grid boundaries; pixels shifted outside are discarded.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify all distinct, connected groups (objects) of azure pixels (color 8) in the input grid using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Calculate its width based on the horizontal span of its bounding box (`width = max_col - min_col + 1`).
    b.  Determine the horizontal shift amount, which is equal to the object's `width`.
    c.  For every pixel belonging to the object at input position `(row, column)`, calculate its new position `(row, column + width)`.
    d.  If the new position `(row, column + width)` is within the grid boundaries, place the azure color (8) at this new position in the output grid.
4.  Return the final output grid.
