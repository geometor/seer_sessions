            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the azure objects and understood that a horizontal shift was required. However, the calculation of the shift amount (`width + 1`) was incorrect. The results consistently show that the actual shift applied by the code is one unit greater than the expected shift.\n\nThe strategy is to re-evaluate the relationship between the object's properties (specifically its width) and the required horizontal shift distance. By comparing the calculated widths with the observed correct shifts in the examples, we can deduce the correct formula for the shift.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the object widths and the required shifts.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: One azure object.\n    *   Bounding box: (1, 0) to (2, 1).\n    *   Width: `max_col - min_col + 1` = `1 - 0 + 1` = 2.\n    *   Observed shift in expected output: The leftmost pixel moves from column 0 to column 2. Shift = 2.\n    *   Code's calculated shift: `width + 1` = `2 + 1` = 3. This matches the incorrect `transformed output`.\n    *   Discrepancy: Code shifted by 3, expected shift is 2.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Two azure objects.\n    *   Object 1 (top): Bounding box (1, 1) to (3, 3). Width = `3 - 1 + 1` = 3. Observed shift = 3 (leftmost pixel moves from column 1 to 4). Code's shift = `3 + 1` = 4.\n    *   Object 2 (bottom): Bounding box (6, 1) to (6, 1). Width = `1 - 1 + 1` = 1. Observed shift = 1 (pixel moves from column 1 to 2). Code's shift = `1 + 1` = 2.\n    *   Discrepancy: Code shifted the top object by 4 (expected 3) and the bottom object by 2 (expected 1).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Two azure objects.\n    *   Object 1 (top): Bounding box (1, 1) to (4, 4). Width = `4 - 1 + 1` = 4. Observed shift = 4 (leftmost pixel moves from column 1 to 5). Code's shift = `4 + 1` = 5.\n    *   Object 2 (bottom): Bounding box (8, 4) to (9, 5). Width = `5 - 4 + 1` = 2. Observed shift = 2 (leftmost pixel moves from column 4 to 6). Code's shift = `2 + 1` = 3.\n    *   Discrepancy: Code shifted the top object by 5 (expected 4) and the bottom object by 3 (expected 2).\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The required horizontal shift for each azure object is exactly equal to its width (the width of its bounding box), not `width + 1`.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n"
