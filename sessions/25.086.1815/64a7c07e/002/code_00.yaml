task_description: Translate azure objects horizontally based on their width.
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - type: connected_group
    color: 8 # azure
    connectivity: 8-way # includes diagonals
properties_extracted:
  - width: horizontal span of the object's bounding box (max_col - min_col + 1)
actions:
  - action: translate
    direction: horizontal # positive (right)
    amount_calculation: width # The shift amount equals the object's width
    reference_point: each pixel within the object
grid_modification:
  - operation: copy_paste
    source: pixels of the identified azure object
    destination: new position calculated by adding the shift amount to the original column index
    target_color: 8 # azure
    output_initialization: background_color (0)
constraints:
  - Preserve original pixel positions relative to each other within the object.
  - Apply transformation independently to each identified object.
  - Ensure translated pixels stay within grid boundaries; pixels shifted outside are discarded.
