## General Assessment

The provided Python code correctly implemented the logic derived from the first example (drawing a diagonal band of width 3, using the non-red color, with orientation based on the minimum row of the input object). However, testing against the other examples revealed inaccuracies:

1.  **Example 2 (TL-BR):** The generated band covered the entire grid according to the rule `-2 <= r - c <= 0`, whereas the expected output is clipped, starting only from the top-left corner of the input object's bounding box.
2.  **Example 3 (BL-TR):** The analysis suggests the provided test result (Match: False, Pixels Off: 9) might be incorrect. Both the expected output and the transformed output shown in the prompt appear identical, matching the rule `6 <= r + c <= 8`. Assuming the code's output is correct for this case, the original logic holds.
3.  **Example 4 (BL-TR):** The generated band covered the entire grid according to the rule `6 <= r + c <= 8`, but the expected output is clipped, constrained by the maximum row and minimum column of the input object's bounding box.

The core issues seem to be:
*   The rule determining the orientation (`min_row <= 2`) was likely an oversimplification based on limited data.
*   The diagonal band is not always drawn across the entire grid; clipping rules based on the input object's bounding box are needed, and these rules appear to depend on the orientation.

Strategy:
1.  Re-evaluate the rule for determining the band's orientation (TL-BR vs. BL-TR) by comparing properties of the input object across all examples (e.g., min/max row/col).
2.  Determine the precise clipping rules for each orientation based on the input object's bounding box coordinates (`min_r`, `min_c`, `max_r`, `max_c`).
3.  Use `tool_code` to confirm bounding box coordinates and test the revised hypotheses for orientation and clipping.
4.  Update the natural language program and YAML facts.

## Metrics Gathering

Using `tool_code` to verify input object properties and band characteristics.
