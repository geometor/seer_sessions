Transformation Rule:

1. Identify the non-background (non-white) pixels in the input grid.
2. Determine the two unique colors present among these pixels. One will be red (2). Identify the other color, referred to as `pattern_color`.
3. Find the minimum row index (`min_row`) among all non-white pixels.
4. Determine the orientation of the output diagonal band based on `min_row`:
    - If `min_row` is 0, 1, or 2, the orientation is Top-Left to Bottom-Right (TL-BR).
    - Otherwise, the orientation is Bottom-Left to Top-Right (BL-TR).
5. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
6. Draw a diagonal band of width 3 pixels using the `pattern_color` onto the output grid according to the determined orientation:
    - TL-BR: Color pixels (r, c) where -2 <= r - c <= 0.
    - BL-TR: Color pixels (r, c) where (H-1) - 2 <= r + c <= (H-1), where H is the grid height.
