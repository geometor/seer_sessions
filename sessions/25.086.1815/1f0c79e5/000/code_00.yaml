task_elements:
  - item: grids
    properties:
      - type: input and output
      - background_color: white (0)
      - size: H x W (9x9 in examples)
  - item: input_object
    properties:
      - type: cluster of connected non-white pixels
      - location: localized within the input grid
      - composition: contains pixels of exactly two colors
      - colors:
          - red (2)
          - another color C (variable: magenta, green, orange, yellow)
  - item: output_pattern
    properties:
      - type: diagonal band
      - color: C (the non-red color from the input_object)
      - width: 3 pixels
      - orientation: determined by input_object's vertical position
      - placement: extends across the entire grid
relationships:
  - type: color_mapping
    description: The output pattern's color is the non-red color present in the input object.
  - type: orientation_rule
    description: >
      If the minimum row index of any pixel in the input_object is less than or equal to 2,
      the output pattern orientation is Top-Left to Bottom-Right (TL-BR).
      Otherwise, the orientation is Bottom-Left to Top-Right (BL-TR).
  - type: pattern_definition
    description: >
      The output pattern is a 3-pixel wide diagonal band.
      If TL-BR, pixels (r, c) are colored if -2 <= r - c <= 0.
      If BL-TR, pixels (r, c) are colored if (H-1) - 2 <= r + c <= H-1, where H is the grid height.
