            "text": "**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input is a square grid (9x9 in examples) mostly filled with the background color white (0). It contains a small, localized cluster of non-white pixels.\n2.  **Input Objects:** This cluster consists of pixels of two distinct colors. One color is always red (2). The other color varies across examples (magenta (6), green (3), orange (7), yellow (4)).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is a grid of the same size as the input, also mostly white (0). It features a prominent diagonal band pattern.\n4.  **Output Pattern:** The pattern is a diagonal band, consistently 3 pixels wide, stretching across the grid.\n5.  **Color Transformation:** The color used for the output band is the non-red color found in the input cluster. The red pixels from the input are effectively ignored or removed.\n6.  **Pattern Orientation:** The diagonal band can have two orientations:\n    *   Top-Left to Bottom-Right (TL-BR)\n    *   Bottom-Left to Top-Right (BL-TR)\n7.  **Orientation Determinant:** The orientation seems to depend on the vertical position of the input cluster. Specifically, if the highest pixel (minimum row index) of the input cluster is in the top few rows (rows 0, 1, or 2), the orientation is TL-BR. Otherwise, the orientation is BL-TR.\n8.  **Band Placement:** The 3-pixel wide band appears consistently placed relative to the grid's main diagonal or anti-diagonal, depending on the orientation.\n    *   For TL-BR, the band includes the main diagonal (`row == col`) and the two diagonals immediately above it (`row == col - 1`, `row == col - 2`).\n    *   For BL-TR, the band includes the main anti-diagonal (`row + col == height - 1`) and the two anti-diagonals immediately \"below\" it towards the bottom-left (`row + col == height - 2`, `row + col == height - 3`).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Apply the coloring rule based on the orientation:\n    *   If the orientation is `TL-BR`: Check if the condition `-(Wd-1) <= r - c <= 0` (i.e., `-2 <= r - c <= 0`) is true. If it is, set the color of the output grid pixel `(r, c)` to `pattern_color`.\n    *   If the orientation is `BL-TR`: Check if the condition `(H-1) - (Wd-1) <= r + c <= H-1` (i.e., `H-3 <= r + c <= H-1`) is true. If it is, set the color of the output grid pixel `(r, c)` to `pattern_color`.\n9.  Return the completed output grid."
