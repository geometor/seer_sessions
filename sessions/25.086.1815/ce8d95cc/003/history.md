"""
Extract structural information by identifying vertical and horizontal lines and their intersections, 
condensing the grid based on these features.

1.  Identify Horizontal Lines: Scan the input grid row by row. Identify rows where all non-white (0) pixels share the same color, and there is at least one non-white pixel. Record the row index and the color for each horizontal line found.
2.  Identify Vertical Lines: Scan the input grid column by column. For each column, examine the pixels in rows that are *not* identified as horizontal lines. If all non-white pixels in these examined rows share the same color, and there is at least one such non-white pixel, identify this column as a vertical line column. Record the column index and the color for each vertical line found. Keep track of the order of vertical lines from left to right.
3.  Determine Output Dimensions: Calculate the output grid height as `2 * (number of horizontal lines) + 1` and the width as `2 * (number of vertical lines) + 1`.
4.  Initialize Output Grid: Create an output grid of the calculated dimensions, initialized with white (0).
5.  Populate Output Grid: Iterate through the rows (`r_out`) and columns (`c_out`) of the output grid.
    *   If `r_out` is even (Segment Row): 
        *   Set even columns (`c_out % 2 == 0`) to white (0).
        *   Set odd columns (`c_out % 2 != 0`) to the color of the corresponding vertical line (`v_lines[c_out // 2][1]`).
    *   If `r_out` is odd (Horizontal Line Row):
        *   Let this correspond to the `k`-th horizontal line (`k = r_out // 2`) with input row index `r_in` and color `H`.
        *   Set even columns (`c_out % 2 == 0`) to the horizontal line color `H`.
        *   Set odd columns (`c_out % 2 != 0`) to the color found at the intersection in the input grid: `input_grid[r_in][c_in]`, where `c_in` is the column index of the corresponding vertical line (`v_lines[c_out // 2][0]`).
6.  Return Output Grid.

**General Assessment**

The provided results indicate that the Python code failed on all training examples except potentially the first one (which was used to derive the logic). However, a detailed step-by-step trace of the provided Python code against each training example reveals that the code *actually produces the correct output for all four examples*. The "Transformed Output" listed in the results section of the prompt appears to be corrupted or from a different execution, leading to incorrect failure reports (`Match: False`, `Size Correct: False`, etc.).

For example:
- In Example 1, the reported "Transformed Output" is a large 25x19 grid, while the code logic correctly produces the expected 5x3 grid.
- In Examples 2, 3, and 4, the reported "Transformed Output" only shows the first row of the correct output grid.

Therefore, the Python code and the natural language program describing its logic seem correct and do not require modification based on the provided examples. The issue lies in the discrepancy between the code's actual behavior and the reported results in the prompt.

**Strategy:**
The strategy is to proceed with the existing code and natural language program, acknowledging that the reported test results in the prompt were erroneous. We will confirm the key metrics (line counts, dimensions) using `tool_code` to be certain.

**Revised Assessment based on Metrics:**

The `tool_code` execution reveals that my manual trace of the *definition* of horizontal and vertical lines was flawed, specifically for the horizontal lines. The previous code's `find_horizontal_lines` function identified *any* row consisting of only white and one other color as a horizontal line. This is incorrect according to the expected outputs.

Looking at the examples again:
- **Horizontal Lines:** Only rows that are *completely filled* with a single non-white color should count.
    - Example 1: Rows 4 (green) and 9 (azure) are true H-lines.
    - Example 2: Rows 3 (red) and 9 (gray) are true H-lines.
    - Example 3: Rows 1 (orange), 6 (red), and 10 (azure) are true H-lines.
    - Example 4: Rows 1 (green) and 6 (gray) are true H-lines.
- **Vertical Lines:** The definition seems correct - columns where all *non-white* pixels *between* the true horizontal lines share the same color.
    - Example 1: Col 2 (yellow) is the only V-line.
    - Example 2: Cols 2 (blue), 5 (azure), 7 (green) are V-lines.
    - Example 3: Cols 2 (green), 7 (blue) are V-lines.
    - Example 4: Cols 3 (azure), 8 (magenta) are V-lines.

The code's implementation of `find_horizontal_lines` needs correction. It should check if `len(non_white_pixels)` is equal to the grid width *and* if all `non_white_pixels` are the same color.

The definition of `find_vertical_lines` also needs a slight adjustment. It should only consider columns that *intersect* the horizontal lines. The current definition checks columns based on pixels *between* horizontal lines, which seems correct for determining the V-line color, but maybe the selection of *which* columns are V-lines should be based on intersections? Let's reconsider Example 1. Row 4 is `3 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3`. Row 9 is `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Column 2 is `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 4 4`. The non-white pixels between rows 4 and 9 in col 2 are `[4, 4, 4, 4]`. These are all yellow (4). So, Col 2 is a V-line with color yellow (4). This matches the previous finding and the expected output structure. The V-line logic seems okay.

The primary error is the definition of a horizontal line in the `find_horizontal_lines` function.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: Condense a grid by representing it as an intersection of significant horizontal and vertical lines.

definitions:
  horizontal_line:
    description: A row in the input grid that is completely filled with a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - index: The row number.
      - color: The single non-white color filling the row.
  vertical_line:
    description: A column in the input grid where all non-white pixels located in rows *between* (exclusive) the identified horizontal lines share the same single color. There must be at least one such non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - index: The column number.
      - color: The single non-white color found in the segments between horizontal lines.
  segment_row:
    description: A row in the output grid that corresponds to the space between horizontal lines in the input grid (or above the first/below the last). Output segment rows have even indices (0, 2, 4...).
  intersection_row:
    description: A row in the output grid that corresponds to a horizontal line from the input grid. Output intersection rows have odd indices (1, 3, 5...).
  segment_column:
    description: A column in the output grid that corresponds to the space between vertical lines in the input grid (or left of the first/right of the last). Output segment columns have even indices (0, 2, 4...).
  intersection_column:
    description: A column in the output grid that corresponds to a vertical line from the input grid. Output intersection columns have odd indices (1, 3, 5...).

transformation:
  - action: Identify all horizontal lines (rows completely filled with one non-white color) in the input grid. Record their row indices and colors.
  - action: Identify all vertical lines. For each column, examine only the pixels in rows that are *not* horizontal lines. If all non-white pixels in these examined rows share the same color (and there's at least one), record the column index and this shared color.
  - action: Determine output grid dimensions. Height = 2 * (number of horizontal lines) + 1. Width = 2 * (number of vertical lines) + 1.
  - action: Initialize the output grid with white (0).
  - action: Fill the output grid based on input lines and intersections:
      - For cells (r_out, c_out) where r_out is even (segment row) and c_out is odd (intersection column): Fill with the color of the corresponding vertical line.
      - For cells (r_out, c_out) where r_out is odd (intersection row) and c_out is even (segment column): Fill with the color of the corresponding horizontal line.
      - For cells (r_out, c_out) where r_out is odd (intersection row) and c_out is odd (intersection column): Fill with the color from the input grid at the intersection of the corresponding horizontal line's row index and vertical line's column index.
      - All other cells (where r_out is even and c_out is even) remain white (0).

output:
  description: A smaller grid representing the structure defined by the horizontal and vertical lines and their intersections.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines**: Scan the input grid row by row. Identify rows that are completely filled with a single non-white color. Record the row index and the color for each such horizontal line found. Store these as `h_lines` (list of `(row_index, color)`).
2.  **Identify Vertical Lines**: Scan the input grid column by column. For each column, consider only the rows that were *not* identified as horizontal lines in step 1. Examine the pixels in this column within these specific rows. If there is at least one non-white pixel among them, and *all* non-white pixels share the same color, then identify this column as a vertical line. Record the column index and the shared color for each vertical line found. Store these as `v_lines` (list of `(column_index, color)`), maintaining their left-to-right order.
3.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: Calculate the output grid height as `H_out = 2 * len(h_lines) + 1` and the width as `W_out = 2 * len(v_lines) + 1`.
4.  **Initialize Output Grid**: Create an output grid of size `H_out x W_out`, filled with the background color white (0).
5.  **Populate Output Grid**: Iterate through the output grid cells using row index `r_out` (from 0 to `H_out-1`) and column index `c_out` (from 0 to `W_out-1`):
    *   **Case 1: Intersection Point (r_out odd, c_out odd)**:
        *   Find the corresponding horizontal line: `h_idx = r_out // 2`. Get its original row index `r_in = h_lines[h_idx][0]`.
        *   Find the corresponding vertical line: `v_idx = c_out // 2`. Get its original column index `c_in = v_lines[v_idx][0]`.
        *   Set the output cell `output_grid[r_out, c_out]` to the color found at the intersection in the input grid: `input_grid[r_in, c_in]`.
    *   **Case 2: Horizontal Line Segment (r_out odd, c_out even)**:
        *   Find the corresponding horizontal line: `h_idx = r_out // 2`. Get its color `h_color = h_lines[h_idx][1]`.
        *   Set the output cell `output_grid[r_out, c_out]` to `h_color`.
    *   **Case 3: Vertical Line Segment (r_out even, c_out odd)**:
        *   Find the corresponding vertical line: `v_idx = c_out // 2`. Get its color `v_color = v_lines[v_idx][1]`.
        *   Set the output cell `output_grid[r_out, c_out]` to `v_color`.
    *   **Case 4: Background Corner (r_out even, c_out even)**:
        *   Leave the output cell `output_grid[r_out, c_out]` as white (0).
6.  **Return Output Grid**.
