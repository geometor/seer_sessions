            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying strictly defined horizontal lines (rows completely filled with one color) and vertical lines derived from segments between these horizontal lines. The results show this approach is incorrect. The generated outputs have incorrect dimensions and structure compared to the expected outputs.\n\nThe key failure seems to be in the definition and identification of the \"lines\" or structural elements that define the output grid. The output grid appears to be a compressed representation based on specific rows and columns from the input, but not necessarily rows/columns that are *entirely* filled with a single color.\n\nOur strategy will be:\n\n1.  Re-define what constitutes a \"significant\" row and a \"significant\" column based on the patterns observed across all examples.\n2.  Verify this new definition against all training examples.\n3.  Formulate a new natural language program based on this revised understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples to find a consistent definition for the rows and columns that are preserved or represented in the output.\n\n**Hypothesis:** The output grid is constructed based on \"significant\" rows and columns from the input.\n*   A **Significant Row** is an input row that either:\n    *   Is entirely filled with a single non-white color.\n    *   Contains more than one unique non-white color.\n*   A **Significant Column** is an input column that either:\n    *   Is entirely filled with a single non-white color.\n    *   Contains more than one unique non-white color.\n\nLet's verify this using code execution to count significant rows/cols for each example and check if the output dimensions match `(2 * num_sig_rows + 1) x (2 * num_sig_cols + 1)`.\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution reveals that the current definition of \"Significant Row/Column\" is also incorrect. It identifies far too many rows and columns as significant, leading to calculated output shapes that do not match the expected ones.\n\nLet's refine the definition based on visual inspection again:\n\n*   **Significant Rows:** Rows that act as horizontal \"dividers\" or contain key intersection information.\n    *   Ex1: Row 4 (mix of green/yellow), Row 9 (solid azure). Indices: [4, 9].\n    *   Ex2: Row 3 (mix), Row 9 (mix). Indices: [3, 9].\n    *   Ex3: Row 1 (mix), Row 6 (mix), Row 10 (solid azure). Indices: [1, 6, 10].\n    *   Ex4: Row 1 (mix), Row 6 (mix). Indices: [1, 6].\n    *   Commonality: These rows either contain multiple non-white colors *or* are solid non-white lines that seem important structurally. What distinguishes Row 9 (solid azure) in Ex1 from Row 2 (just yellow) in Ex1? Row 9 intersects with the significant column (Col 2), maybe? No, Row 2 also intersects.\n    *   Let's revisit: Row 4 has green and yellow. Row 9 has only azure.\n    *   Is it rows where the set of non-white colors is *different* from the set of non-white colors in the immediately adjacent non-white rows? No, that's too complex.\n    *   How about: Rows that contain colors that also appear in Significant Columns? Or rows that contain colors that *don't* appear in significant columns?\n    *   Let's assume the simple definitions were correct and try to find the bug in the `get_grid_metrics` code.\n        *   Ah, the code defines `unique_non_white = np.unique(non_white)`. If a row is `[0, 0, 4, 0, 0]`, `non_white` is `[4]`, `unique_non_white` is `[4]`, `len(unique_non_white)` is 1. `len(non_white)` is 1, `width` is 5. `len(non_white) == width` is false. So this row is NOT marked significant. This seems wrong.\n        *   If a row is `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, `non_white` is `[8,8,8,8,8]`, `unique_non_white` is `[8]`, `len(unique_non_white)` is 1. `len(non_white)` is 5, `width` is 5. `len(non_white) == width` is true. So this row IS marked significant.\n        *   If a row is `[3, 3, 4, 3, 3]`, `non_white` is `[3,3,4,3,3]`, `unique_non_white` is `[3, 4]`, `len(unique_non_white)` is 2. So this row IS marked significant.\n        *   This matches the manual analysis for rows in Ex1: Row 4 (mix) -> Sig, Row 9 (solid) -> Sig. Indices [4, 9]. Num_sig_rows = 2.\n        *   Now for columns in Ex1:\n            *   Col 0: `[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`. `non_white=[3, 8]`. `unique=[3, 8]`. Len=2. -> Sig Col.\n            *   Col 1: `[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`. `non_white=[3, 8]`. `unique=[3, 8]`. Len=2. -> Sig Col.\n            *   Col 2: `[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4]`. `non_white=[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4]`. `unique=[4, 8]`. Len=2. -> Sig Col.\n            *   Col 3: `[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`. `non_white=[3, 8]`. `unique=[3, 8]`. Len=2. -> Sig Col.\n            *   ...All columns contain [3, 8] from rows 4 and 9. So all columns are significant? This doesn't match the expected output 5x3 (needs 1 sig col).\n*   **Revised Hypothesis:** The definition needs refinement. What makes Col 2 in Ex1 special? It's the only column that contains a non-white color (yellow, 4) *outside* of the significant rows (4 and 9).\n    *   **Significant Column:** A column `c` where `grid[:, c]` contains at least one non-white color *not* located in a Significant Row.\n    *   **Significant Row:** A row `r` where `grid[r, :]` contains at least one non-white color *not* located in a Significant Column. **This is circular.**\n\n*   Let's go back to basics: Find the \"grid lines\".\n    *   Maybe \"lines\" are defined by being mostly monochromatic?\n    *   **Horizontal Lines:** Rows that are *fully* non-white and monochromatic. Ex1: Row 9 (azure). Ex3: Row 10 (azure).\n    *   **Vertical Lines:** Columns that are *fully* non-white and monochromatic. Ex1: None.\n    *   This doesn't capture enough structure.\n\n*   Let's focus on the output structure again. It looks like a grid formed by specific input rows/columns.\n    *   Input Rows selected: [4, 9] (Ex1), [3, 9] (Ex2), [1, 6, 10] (Ex3), [1, 6] (Ex4).\n    *   Input Columns selected: [2] (Ex1), [2, 5, 7] (Ex2), [2, 7] (Ex3), [3, 8] (Ex4).\n\n    *   What defines these selected rows/columns?\n        *   Selected Rows: They seem to be the only rows containing multiple distinct non-white colors OR rows that are fully monochromatic non-white. (This matches `sig_rows` calculation from the tool code attempt).\n            *   Ex1: Row 4 (3,4), Row 9 (8). Indices [4, 9]. Correct.\n            *   Ex2: Row 3 (2,1,8,3), Row 9 (5,1,8,3). Indices [3, 9]. Correct.\n            *   Ex3: Row 1 (7,3,1), Row 6 (2,3,1 - mistake in manual check earlier, it's 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2 -> colors 2,1), Row 10 (8). Indices [1, 6, 10]. Correct.\n            *   Ex4: Row 1 (3,8,6), Row 6 (5,8,6). Indices [1, 6]. Correct.\n        *   Selected Columns: How are they defined?\n            *   Ex1: Col 2 selected. `[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4]`. Contains colors 4, 8.\n            *   Compare selected Col 2 with non-selected Col 0: `[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`. Contains colors 3, 8.\n            *   Compare selected Col 2 with non-selected Col 3: `[0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,0,0]`. Contains colors 3, 8.\n            *   Why is Col 2 selected but not 0 or 3? Col 2 contains yellow (4), which does *not* appear in the other significant columns (if we considered them). It seems Col 2 is the only column containing yellow (4). Is yellow special? No.\n            *   Maybe it's columns that contain more than one unique non-white color?\n                *   Ex1: Col 0 (3,8), Col 1 (3,8), Col 2 (4,8), Col 3 (3,8), ... Col 8 (3,8). All contain 2 unique non-white colors. This doesn't single out Col 2.\n            *   Maybe it's columns that contain colors *other* than the primary colors found in the significant rows?\n                *   Ex1: Sig Rows 4, 9. Colors involved: 3, 4, 8. What are the 'primary' colors? Row 4 is mostly 3, Row 9 is 8. Primary = {3, 8}. Col 2 contains 4 (yellow), which is not in {3, 8}. Col 0 contains 3 and 8, which are in {3, 8}. Col 3 contains 3 and 8... This looks promising!\n                *   **Rule for Significant Column:** A column `c` is significant if it contains at least one non-white color that does *not* appear as the *majority* non-white color in any Significant Row.
