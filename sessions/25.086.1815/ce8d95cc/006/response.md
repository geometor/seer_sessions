Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment**

The provided code successfully transformed the first example but failed on the subsequent three. The failures consistently resulted in incorrectly shaped output grids (specifically, always having a width of 1 in the failed cases). This strongly suggests that the logic for identifying "significant columns" (`find_significant_columns`) is flawed or not general enough, as it seems to be finding zero significant columns in examples 2, 3, and 4. The logic for "significant rows" might also be incorrect, as it seems to identify *all* rows as significant in the failing cases, leading to an incorrect output height.

The core idea of compressing the grid based on key structural lines (rows and columns) seems plausible, but the definitions used to identify these lines need revision. The way the output grid is constructed (intersections, horizontal segments, vertical segments, corners) based on these lines appears logically sound, assuming the lines themselves are correctly identified.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-examine the definition of "significant rows" and "significant columns" by comparing the input and expected output for all examples.
2.  Use `tool_code` to verify the calculated significant rows/columns from the original code on a failed example (e.g., Example 2).
3.  Develop and test revised definitions for significant rows and columns using `tool_code` against all examples.
4.  Update the natural language program to reflect the refined definitions and transformation steps.
