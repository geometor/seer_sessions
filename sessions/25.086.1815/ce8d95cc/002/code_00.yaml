task_description: Condense a grid by representing it as an intersection of significant horizontal and vertical lines.

definitions:
  horizontal_line:
    description: A row in the input grid that is completely filled with a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - index: The row number.
      - color: The single non-white color filling the row.
  vertical_line:
    description: A column in the input grid where all non-white pixels located in rows *between* (exclusive) the identified horizontal lines share the same single color. There must be at least one such non-white pixel.
    properties:
      - index: The column number.
      - color: The single non-white color found in the segments between horizontal lines.
  segment_row:
    description: A row in the output grid that corresponds to the space between horizontal lines in the input grid (or above the first/below the last). Output segment rows have even indices (0, 2, 4...).
  intersection_row:
    description: A row in the output grid that corresponds to a horizontal line from the input grid. Output intersection rows have odd indices (1, 3, 5...).
  segment_column:
    description: A column in the output grid that corresponds to the space between vertical lines in the input grid (or left of the first/right of the last). Output segment columns have even indices (0, 2, 4...).
  intersection_column:
    description: A column in the output grid that corresponds to a vertical line from the input grid. Output intersection columns have odd indices (1, 3, 5...).

transformation:
  - action: Identify all horizontal lines (rows completely filled with one non-white color) in the input grid. Record their row indices and colors.
  - action: Identify all vertical lines. For each column, examine only the pixels in rows that are *not* horizontal lines. If all non-white pixels in these examined rows share the same color (and there's at least one), record the column index and this shared color.
  - action: Determine output grid dimensions. Height = 2 * (number of horizontal lines) + 1. Width = 2 * (number of vertical lines) + 1.
  - action: Initialize the output grid with white (0).
  - action: Fill the output grid based on input lines and intersections:
      - For cells (r_out, c_out) where r_out is even (segment row) and c_out is odd (intersection column): Fill with the color of the corresponding vertical line.
      - For cells (r_out, c_out) where r_out is odd (intersection row) and c_out is even (segment column): Fill with the color of the corresponding horizontal line.
      - For cells (r_out, c_out) where r_out is odd (intersection row) and c_out is odd (intersection column): Fill with the color from the input grid at the intersection of the corresponding horizontal line's row index and vertical line's column index.
      - All other cells (where r_out is even and c_out is even) remain white (0).

output:
  description: A smaller grid representing the structure defined by the horizontal and vertical lines and their intersections.
