            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided results indicate that the Python code failed on all training examples except potentially the first one (which was used to derive the logic). However, a detailed step-by-step trace of the provided Python code against each training example reveals that the code *actually produces the correct output for all four examples*. The \"Transformed Output\" listed in the results section of the prompt appears to be corrupted or from a different execution, leading to incorrect failure reports (`Match: False`, `Size Correct: False`, etc.).\n\nFor example:\n- In Example 1, the reported \"Transformed Output\" is a large 25x19 grid, while the code logic correctly produces the expected 5x3 grid.\n- In Examples 2, 3, and 4, the reported \"Transformed Output\" only shows the first row of the correct output grid.\n\nTherefore, the Python code and the natural language program describing its logic seem correct and do not require modification based on the provided examples. The issue lies in the discrepancy between the code's actual behavior and the reported results in the prompt.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe strategy is to proceed with the existing code and natural language program, acknowledging that the reported test results in the prompt were erroneous. We will confirm the key metrics (line counts, dimensions) using `tool_code` to be certain.\n\n**Metrics**\n"

            "text": "**Revised Assessment based on Metrics:**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution reveals that my manual trace of the *definition* of horizontal and vertical lines was flawed, specifically for the horizontal lines. The previous code's `find_horizontal_lines` function identified *any* row consisting of only white and one other color as a horizontal line. This is incorrect according to the expected outputs.\n\nLooking at the examples again:\n- **Horizontal Lines:** Only rows that are *completely filled* with a single non-white color should count.\n    - Example 1: Rows 4 (green) and 9 (azure) are true H-lines.\n    - Example 2: Rows 3 (red) and 9 (gray) are true H-lines.\n    - Example 3: Rows 1 (orange), 6 (red), and 10 (azure) are true H-lines.\n    - Example 4: Rows 1 (green) and 6 (gray) are true H-lines.\n- **Vertical Lines:** The definition seems correct - columns where all *non-white* pixels *between* the true horizontal lines share the same color.\n    - Example 1: Col 2 (yellow) is the only V-line.\n    - Example 2: Cols 2 (blue), 5 (azure), 7 (green) are V-lines.\n    - Example 3: Cols 2 (green), 7 (blue) are V-lines.\n    - Example 4: Cols 3 (azure), 8 (magenta) are V-lines.\n\nThe code's implementation of `find_horizontal_lines` needs correction. It should check if `len(non_white_pixels)` is equal to the grid width *and* if all `non_white_pixels` are the same color.\n\nThe definition of `find_vertical_lines` also needs a slight adjustment. It should only consider columns that *intersect* the horizontal lines. The current definition checks columns based on pixels *between* horizontal lines, which seems correct for determining the V-line color, but maybe the selection of *which* columns are V-lines should be based on intersections? Let's reconsider Example 1. Row 4 is `3 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3`. Row 9 is `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Column 2 is `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 4 4`. The non-white pixels between rows 4 and 9 in col 2 are `[4, 4, 4, 4]`. These are all yellow (4). So, Col 2 is a V-line with color yellow (4). This matches the previous finding and the expected output structure. The V-line logic seems okay.\n\nThe primary error is the definition of a horizontal line in the `find_horizontal_lines` function.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
