Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements**

1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids typically feature a white (0) background. Embedded within this background are:
    *   One or more distinct vertical lines composed of a single non-white color. These lines span most of the grid's height.
    *   One or more distinct horizontal lines composed of a single non-white color. These lines span the full width of the grid.
    *   The vertical lines might appear "interrupted" where they intersect with the horizontal lines. The pixel at the intersection might take the color of the vertical line or the horizontal line.

2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids, both in height and width.
    *   The width seems determined by the number of vertical lines found in the input.
    *   The height seems determined by the number of horizontal lines found in the input.
    *   The output grid represents a "summary" or "skeleton" of the input's structure, focusing on the vertical lines and how they interact with the horizontal lines and the background.

3.  **Transformation Pattern:**
    *   **Column Selection:** Only the columns containing the main vertical lines from the input are represented in the output.
    *   **Row Condensation:** The rows of the output correspond to the horizontal lines found in the input, plus representative rows for the segments *between* (and above/below) these horizontal lines.
    *   **Pixel Composition:**
        *   The output grid has alternating columns: columns representing the vertical lines, and columns acting as separators.
        *   In output rows corresponding to segments *between* horizontal lines, the separator columns are white (0), and the vertical line columns show the color of the respective vertical line.
        *   In output rows corresponding to a horizontal line, the separator columns take the color of that horizontal line. The vertical line columns take the color found at the intersection of the original vertical and horizontal lines in the input grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Scan the input grid row by row. Identify rows that consist predominantly of a single non-white color. Record the row index and the color for each horizontal line found.
2.  **Identify Vertical Lines:** Scan the input grid column by column. For each column, examine the pixels in rows that are *not* identified as horizontal lines. If all non-white pixels in these examined rows share the same color, identify this column as a vertical line column. Record the column index and the color for each vertical line found. Keep track of the order of vertical lines from left to right.
3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the output grid height as `2 * (number of horizontal lines) + 1` and the width as `2 * (number of vertical lines) + 1`.
4.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an empty output grid of the calculated dimensions.
5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Iterate through the rows of the output grid, from index `r_out = 0` to `output_height - 1`.
    *   **If `r_out` is even:** This row represents a segment (above the first horizontal line, between horizontal lines, or below the last).
        *   Set the separator color to white (0).
        *   Fill the even-indexed columns (`0, 2, 4, ...`) of the output row with the separator color (white).
        *   Fill the odd-indexed columns (`1, 3, 5, ...`) of the output row with the colors of the identified vertical lines, in their left-to-right order.
    *   **If `r_out` is odd:** This row represents a horizontal line. Let this correspond to the `k`-th horizontal line found in step 1 (where `k = r_out // 2`), having input row index `r_in` and color `H`.
        *   Set the separator color to `H`.
        *   Fill the even-indexed columns (`0, 2, 4, ...`) of the output row with the separator color (`H`).
        *   For each odd-indexed column `c_out` in the output row (corresponding to the `j`-th vertical line, where `j = c_out // 2`, with input column index `c_in`):
            *   Look up the color `C_intersect` at `input_grid[r_in][c_in]`.
            *   Set the pixel `output_grid[r_out][c_out]` to `C_intersect`.
6.  **Return Output Grid:** The populated grid is the result.
