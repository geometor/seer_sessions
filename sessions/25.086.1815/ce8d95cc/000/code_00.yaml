task_description: "Extract structural information by identifying vertical and horizontal lines and their intersections, condensing the grid based on these features."

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: "A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9."
  - element: background
    type: color
    value: 0 (white)
    description: "The predominant color in the input grid."
  - element: vertical_line
    description: "A column predominantly composed of a single non-white color, potentially interrupted by horizontal lines."
    properties:
      - index: integer (column number)
      - color: integer (1-9)
  - element: horizontal_line
    description: "A row predominantly composed of a single non-white color."
    properties:
      - index: integer (row number)
      - color: integer (1-9)
  - element: intersection
    description: "A pixel where a vertical line column and a horizontal line row meet."
    properties:
      - location: (row_index, column_index)
      - color: integer (can be vertical line color or horizontal line color)
  - element: segment
    description: "A contiguous block of rows in the input grid located above the first horizontal line, between two consecutive horizontal lines, or below the last horizontal line."

relationships:
  - relationship: selection
    description: "Vertical line columns from the input are selected to form the basis of the output columns."
  - relationship: condensation
    description: "Input rows are condensed into output rows representing horizontal lines and the segments between them."
  - relationship: composition
    description: "Output pixels are composed based on whether the output row represents a segment or a horizontal line, using vertical line colors, horizontal line colors, and the background color."

output_structure:
  - property: width
    derivation: "2 * (number of vertical lines) + 1"
  - property: height
    derivation: "2 * (number of horizontal lines) + 1"
  - property: columns
    pattern: "Alternating separator columns and vertical line columns."
  - property: rows
    pattern: "Alternating segment representation rows and horizontal line representation rows."
