task_description: Fill white space between specific pairs of colored pixels based on color combination and orientation.

elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors 0-9.
  - element: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid with a color value.
  - element: background
    description: Pixels with color white (0).
  - element: object
    description: A contiguous region of non-white pixels. In this task, objects are often single pixels or small blocks (e.g., 2x2 green).
  - element: color_pairs
    description: Specific combinations of colors that trigger a fill operation.
    pairs:
      - { colors: [Orange(7), Green(3)], orientation: horizontal, fill_color: Orange(7) }
      - { colors: [Green(3), Azure(8)], orientation: horizontal, fill_color: Azure(8) }
      - { colors: [Green(3), Blue(1)], orientation: horizontal, fill_color: Blue(1) }
      - { colors: [Green(3), Orange(7)], orientation: vertical, fill_color: Orange(7) }
      - { colors: [Green(3), Magenta(6)], orientation: vertical, fill_color: Magenta(6) }
      - { colors: [Blue(1), Green(3)], orientation: vertical, fill_color: Blue(1) }

actions:
  - action: find_pairs
    description: Identify pairs of non-white pixels in the input grid that lie on the same row or same column.
  - action: check_path
    description: Verify that the path (pixels) between a found pair consists only of white (0) pixels.
  - action: fill_path
    description: If the path is clear, change the color of the white pixels on the path to a specific fill color determined by the color pair and orientation rules.

relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they are in the same row or same column, separated only by white pixels.
  - relationship: trigger
    description: The presence of specific color pairs with clear white paths between them triggers the fill action. Green (3) is often part of the trigger pair.

process:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Scan each row of the input grid to find horizontal adjacent pairs matching the rules.
  - step: For each matching horizontal pair with a clear white path, update the corresponding pixels in the output grid with the specified fill color.
  - step: Scan each column of the input grid to find vertical adjacent pairs matching the rules.
  - step: For each matching vertical pair with a clear white path, update the corresponding pixels in the output grid with the specified fill color.
  - step: Return the modified output grid.
