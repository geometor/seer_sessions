            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task uses grids of pixels with different colors (0-9). The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels form objects, mostly single pixels, but sometimes small blocks (like the 2x2 green block).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves filling sections of white pixels between specific pairs of non-white pixels. The filling process depends on the colors of the pixel pair and their relative orientation (horizontal or vertical).\n4.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   White (0): Background, potential space to be filled.\n    *   Green (3): Appears frequently and seems to be a key component in triggering the fill rules. Often paired with other colors.\n    *   Orange (7), Azure (8), Blue (1), Magenta (6): These colors are involved in specific fill rules when paired with Green (3) or sometimes other specific colors (e.g., Blue(1)-Green(3) vertical, Green(3)-Azure(8) horizontal).\n5.  **Filling Logic:**\n    *   **Connectivity:** Fills occur only between two non-white pixels in the same row or same column.\n    *   **Path:** The path between the two pixels must consist entirely of white (0) pixels in the input grid.\n    *   **Color Dependency:** The color used for filling depends on the specific pair of colors found and whether the connection is horizontal or vertical.\n    *   **Fill Color Determination:**\n        *   Horizontal {Orange(7), Green(3)} -> Fill with Orange(7)\n        *   Horizontal {Green(3), Azure(8)} -> Fill with Azure(8)\n        *   Horizontal {Green(3), Blue(1)} -> Fill with Blue(1)\n        *   Vertical {Green(3), Orange(7)} -> Fill with Orange(7)\n        *   Vertical {Green(3), Magenta(6)} -> Fill with Magenta(6)\n        *   Vertical {Blue(1), Green(3)} -> Fill with Blue(1)\n6.  **Process:** The transformation seems to identify all qualifying pairs in the input and then apply the fills to create the output. Fills appear independent and based on the initial input state.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
