"""
Identify pairs of non-white pixels that lie on the same row or column with only white (0) pixels between them. 
Fill the white space between these pairs based on specific color combinations and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

Horizontal Rules:
- If the pair is {Orange(7), Green(3)}, fill the path with Orange(7).
- If the pair is {Green(3), Azure(8)}, fill the path with Azure(8).
- If the pair is {Green(3), Blue(1)}, fill the path with Blue(1).

Vertical Rules:
- If the pair is {Green(3), Orange(7)}, fill the path with Orange(7).
- If the pair is {Green(3), Magenta(6)}, fill the path with Magenta(6).
- If the pair is {Blue(1), Green(3)}, fill the path with Blue(1).
- If the pair is {Green(3), Azure(8)}, fill the path with Azure(8). # Added rule based on Example 1 analysis
