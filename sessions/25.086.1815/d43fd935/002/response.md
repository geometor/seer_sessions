## General Assessment

The initial code successfully identified the core mechanism: filling white space between pairs of non-white pixels along rows and columns based on specific color combinations. It correctly handled the path clearance check (ensuring only white pixels lie between the pair). The code passed Examples 2 and 3, indicating that the identified rules for those specific color pairs and orientations are likely correct.

The failure in Example 1 points to an incomplete set of rules. Specifically, a vertical fill occurred in the expected output that was not accounted for by the rules implemented in the code. The strategy is to:

1.  Pinpoint the exact location of the discrepancy in Example 1.
2.  Identify the pair of colors involved and the orientation (vertical) in the input grid that corresponds to the filled area in the expected output.
3.  Add the missing rule to the vertical rule set.
4.  Verify that this new rule doesn't conflict with the successful transformations in Examples 2 and 3.
5.  Update the natural language program and YAML documentation.

Analysis Confirmation:

*   The difference is indeed at `(1, 6)`, where the expected output is Azure (8) and the transformed output is White (0).
*   Looking at the input grid's column 6, the pixels are `[8 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0]`.
*   The non-white pixels are Azure (8) at `(0, 6)` and Green (3) at `(2, 6)`.
*   The path between them, `(1, 6)`, contains only White (0).
*   The expected fill color is Azure (8).
*   This confirms the need for a vertical rule: `{Green(3), Azure(8)}` should be filled with Azure (8).
*   Checking Examples 2 and 3 confirms that adding this vertical rule does not introduce conflicts, as there are no vertical pairs of {Green(3), Azure(8)} with a clear white path between them in those examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    a.  Find all pairs of non-white pixels within that row.
    b.  For each pair, check if all pixels strictly between them in that row are white (0).
    c.  If the path is clear (all white), check the colors of the pair against the horizontal fill rules:
        *   If the pair is {Orange(7), Green(3)}, fill the white path between them with Orange(7) in the output grid.
        *   If the pair is {Green(3), Azure(8)}, fill the white path between them with Azure(8) in the output grid.
        *   If the pair is {Green(3), Blue(1)}, fill the white path between them with Blue(1) in the output grid.
3.  **Vertical Scan:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.
    a.  Find all pairs of non-white pixels within that column.
    b.  For each pair, check if all pixels strictly between them in that column are white (0).
    c.  If the path is clear (all white), check the colors of the pair against the vertical fill rules:
        *   If the pair is {Green(3), Orange(7)}, fill the white path between them with Orange(7) in the output grid.
        *   If the pair is {Green(3), Magenta(6)}, fill the white path between them with Magenta(6) in the output grid.
        *   If the pair is {Blue(1), Green(3)}, fill the white path between them with Blue(1) in the output grid.
        *   If the pair is {Green(3), Azure(8)}, fill the white path between them with Azure(8) in the output grid.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
