task_description: Fill white space between specific pairs of non-white pixels along rows or columns.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer 0-9 (0=white, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, 4=yellow, 5=gray, 6=magenta, 7=orange, 8=azure, 9=maroon)
      location: (row, column) coordinates
  - type: line_segment
    properties:
      orientation: horizontal or vertical
      endpoints: two non-white pixels
      path: sequence of pixels between endpoints along the orientation
      path_state: clear (all white pixels) or blocked (contains non-white pixels)
actions:
  - name: find_endpoint_pairs
    description: Identify all pairs of non-white pixels that share the same row or column.
  - name: check_path_clarity
    description: For each pair, check if all pixels strictly between the endpoints along their shared row/column are white.
  - name: apply_fill_rules
    description: If the path is clear, determine the fill color based on the endpoint colors and orientation using specific rules, then change the color of the white pixels in the path to the fill color.
rules:
  - condition: Horizontal path, clear path, endpoints are {Orange(7), Green(3)}
    action: Fill path with Orange(7)
  - condition: Horizontal path, clear path, endpoints are {Green(3), Azure(8)}
    action: Fill path with Azure(8)
  - condition: Horizontal path, clear path, endpoints are {Green(3), Blue(1)}
    action: Fill path with Blue(1)
  - condition: Vertical path, clear path, endpoints are {Green(3), Orange(7)}
    action: Fill path with Orange(7)
  - condition: Vertical path, clear path, endpoints are {Green(3), Magenta(6)}
    action: Fill path with Magenta(6)
  - condition: Vertical path, clear path, endpoints are {Blue(1), Green(3)}
    action: Fill path with Blue(1)
  - condition: Vertical path, clear path, endpoints are {Green(3), Azure(8)} # Added rule
    action: Fill path with Azure(8)
