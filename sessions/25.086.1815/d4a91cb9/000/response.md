Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain mostly white (0) pixels, with exactly one red (2) pixel and one azure (8) pixel. These colored pixels are single points.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original red and azure pixels from the input. Additionally, a path of yellow (4) pixels appears, connecting the red and azure pixels.
3.  **Path Characteristics:** The yellow path follows a rectilinear ("L" shape) route, consisting of one horizontal segment and one vertical segment that meet at a corner.
4.  **Path Formation:** The path seems to connect the coordinates of the red and azure pixels. Examining the examples reveals a consistent pattern for determining the corner of the 'L' path.
5.  **Corner Determination:** If the red pixel is at (R_row, R_col) and the azure pixel is at (A_row, A_col), the corner point of the 'L' path is consistently located at (R_row, A_col).
6.  **Drawing the Path:**
    *   A vertical segment is drawn between the azure pixel's location (A_row, A_col) and the corner point (R_row, A_col). This segment covers all cells in column A_col between rows A_row and R_row (inclusive).
    *   A horizontal segment is drawn between the red pixel's location (R_row, R_col) and the corner point (R_row, A_col). This segment covers all cells in row R_row between columns R_col and A_col (inclusive).
7.  **Color Interaction:** The yellow path pixels only replace white (0) pixels. The original red and azure pixels are preserved in the output.

      - Draw horizontal line from (R_row, R_col) to (R_row, A_col)
    condition: Only replace White (0) pixels. Preserve existing Red (2) and Azure (8) pixels.
output: Input grid modified with the Yellow Path.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the coordinates of the single red pixel (color 2); let them be (R_row, R_col).
3.  Locate the coordinates of the single azure pixel (color 8); let them be (A_row, A_col).
4.  Determine the coordinates of the corner point: Corner = (R_row, A_col).
5.  Draw the vertical segment of the path: Iterate through the rows from the minimum of R_row and A_row to the maximum of R_row and A_row (inclusive). For each row `r` in this range, if the pixel at (r, A_col) in the output grid is white (0), change its color to yellow (4).
6.  Draw the horizontal segment of the path: Iterate through the columns from the minimum of R_col and A_col to the maximum of R_col and A_col (inclusive). For each column `c` in this range, if the pixel at (R_row, c) in the output grid is white (0), change its color to yellow (4).
7.  Return the modified output grid.
