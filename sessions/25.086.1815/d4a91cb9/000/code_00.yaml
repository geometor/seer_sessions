task_description: Draw a rectilinear path between a red pixel and an azure pixel.
elements:
  - object: Grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - object: Red Pixel
    attributes:
      color: 2 (red)
      count: 1 per input grid
      location: (R_row, R_col)
  - object: Azure Pixel
    attributes:
      color: 8 (azure)
      count: 1 per input grid
      location: (A_row, A_col)
  - object: Yellow Path
    description: A newly created path connecting the Red and Azure pixels.
    attributes:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: Rectilinear (L-shape)
      segments:
        - type: Vertical
          endpoints: [(A_row, A_col), (R_row, A_col)]
          range: Column A_col, rows between A_row and R_row (inclusive)
        - type: Horizontal
          endpoints: [(R_row, R_col), (R_row, A_col)]
          range: Row R_row, columns between R_col and A_col (inclusive)
    relationships:
      - connects: [Red Pixel, Azure Pixel]
      - via: Corner point (R_row, A_col)
interaction:
  - action: Find
    actor: System
    target: [Red Pixel, Azure Pixel]
    result: Locations (R_row, R_col) and (A_row, A_col)
  - action: Determine Corner
    actor: System
    inputs: [(R_row, R_col), (A_row, A_col)]
    result: Corner point (R_row, A_col)
  - action: Draw Path Segments
    actor: System
    color: Yellow (4)
    segments:
      - Draw vertical line from (A_row, A_col) to (R_row, A_col)
      - Draw horizontal line from (R_row, R_col) to (R_row, A_col)
    condition: Only replace White (0) pixels. Preserve existing Red (2) and Azure (8) pixels.
output: Input grid modified with the Yellow Path.
