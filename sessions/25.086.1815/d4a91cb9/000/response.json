            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids contain mostly white (0) pixels, with exactly one red (2) pixel and one azure (8) pixel. These colored pixels are single points.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original red and azure pixels from the input. Additionally, a path of yellow (4) pixels appears, connecting the red and azure pixels.\n3.  **Path Characteristics:** The yellow path follows a rectilinear (\"L\" shape) route, consisting of one horizontal segment and one vertical segment that meet at a corner.\n4.  **Path Formation:** The path seems to connect the coordinates of the red and azure pixels. Examining the examples reveals a consistent pattern for determining the corner of the 'L' path.\n5.  **Corner Determination:** If the red pixel is at (R_row, R_col) and the azure pixel is at (A_row, A_col), the corner point of the 'L' path is consistently located at (R_row, A_col).\n6.  **Drawing the Path:**\n    *   A vertical segment is drawn between the azure pixel's location (A_row, A_col) and the corner point (R_row, A_col). This segment covers all cells in column A_col between rows A_row and R_row (inclusive).\n    *   A horizontal segment is drawn between the red pixel's location (R_row, R_col) and the corner point (R_row, A_col). This segment covers all cells in row R_row between columns R_col and A_col (inclusive).\n7.  **Color Interaction:** The yellow path pixels only replace white (0) pixels. The original red and azure pixels are preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
