"""
Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
Scan the input grid to locate all instances of a specific "cross" pattern. A cross is defined by:
    *   A central pixel of color C1 (where C1 is not white).
    *   Four pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the center, all having the same color C2 (where C2 is not white, and C1 is different from C2).
    *   The four pixels diagonally adjacent to the center must be white (color 0), if those positions exist within the grid boundaries.
For each identified cross pattern:
    a.  Note the coordinates (r, c) of its central pixel.
    b.  Note the color C1 of its central pixel.
    c.  Define a set of eight diagonal offset pairs: (-2, -2), (-2, +2), (-1, -1), (-1, +1), (+1, -1), (+1, +1), (+2, -2), (+2, +2).
    d.  For each offset pair (dr, dc) in the set:
        i.  Calculate the target coordinates (target_r, target_c) = (r + dr, c + dc).
        ii. Check if the (target_r, target_c) coordinates are within the bounds of the grid.
        iii. If the target coordinates are within bounds, change the color of the pixel at (target_r, target_c) in the output grid to the central color C1.
After processing all identified crosses, return the modified output grid.
