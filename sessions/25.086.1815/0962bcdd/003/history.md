"""
Identify cross shapes in the input grid and add pixels at knight's move locations relative to the center of each cross.

The transformation rule involves the following steps:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid to find potential centers of cross shapes. A cross shape is defined as a central pixel of color C1 surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right) by pixels of color C2 (where C1 != C2 and C1, C2 != 0), and diagonally by white pixels (color 0).
3. For each identified cross center at (row, col) with color C1:
    a. Define the eight knight's move offsets relative to the center: (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1).
    b. For each offset (dr, dc), calculate the target coordinates (new_row, new_col) = (row + dr, col + dc).
    c. If the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at (new_row, new_col) in the output grid to color C1.
4. Return the modified output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The provided Python code attempted to solve the task by identifying cross patterns and applying knight's moves relative to the *center* of the cross. The results show this approach is incorrect, as the transformed outputs do not match the expected outputs for the training examples.

The `Transformed Output` grids generated by the code place the new pixels (using the center color of the cross) at locations that are knight's moves away from the *center* pixel. However, comparing this with the `Expected Output` grids reveals that the new pixels should actually be placed at locations that are knight's moves away from the *arm* pixels of the cross. The color used for the new pixels remains the color of the cross's *center* pixel.

The strategy for resolving the errors involves:
1.  Correctly identifying the source pixels for the knight's moves as the four orthogonal 'arm' pixels of the cross pattern.
2.  Applying the knight's moves from each of these four arm pixels.
3.  Placing the *center* color of the cross at the destination coordinates of each valid knight's move.
4.  Ensuring the process starts with a copy of the input grid and adds these new pixels, potentially overwriting existing ones.

**Metrics:**

Let's gather some basic metrics to confirm the discrepancies.

```
The metrics confirm the visual analysis:
*   Shapes and color palettes match between expected and transformed outputs.
*   The `Match` is False for both examples.
*   There are 40 differing pixels in both examples.
*   The `Color_Count_Match` is False. Specifically, the counts for the color used in the cross arms (color 8 in Ex1, color 7 in Ex2) are much lower in the `Transformed_Counts` (8) compared to the `Expected_Counts` (16). This likely happens because the incorrect knight's moves from the center overwrite some of the arm pixels. The counts for the center color (color 6 in Ex1, color 2 in Ex2) are the same (18), suggesting the number of added pixels is correct, but their locations are wrong. The background color (0) count difference reflects the misplaced pixels.

    output:
      - Modified grid.
    steps:
      - Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
      - Iterate through the input grid to find all valid Cross Patterns.
      - For each found Cross Pattern:
          - Identify the center color C1 and the locations of the four arm pixels (color C2).
          - Define the eight standard knight's move offsets: [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)].
          - For each of the four arm pixels at location (arm_r, arm_c):
              - For each knight's move offset (dr, dc):
                  - Calculate the target coordinate (target_r, target_c) = (arm_r + dr, arm_c + dc).
                  - Check if (target_r, target_c) is within the grid boundaries.
                  - If it is within bounds, set the pixel at (target_r, target_c) in the output grid to the center color C1 (overwriting any existing pixel).
      - Return the final modified output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to locate all instances of a specific "cross" pattern.
3.  A "cross" pattern is defined by:
    *   A central pixel of color C1 (where C1 is not white).
    *   Four orthogonally adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) all having the same color C2 (where C2 is not white and C2 is not equal to C1). These are the "arm" pixels.
    *   The four diagonally adjacent pixels must be white (color 0), if they exist within the grid boundaries.
4.  For *each* identified cross pattern:
    *   Note the color C1 of the center pixel.
    *   Identify the coordinates of the four arm pixels (which have color C2).
    *   For *each* of these four arm pixels:
        *   Consider its location (arm\_row, arm\_col).
        *   Calculate the eight positions reachable by a knight's move from (arm\_row, arm\_col). The knight's move offsets are: (-2,-1), (-2,1), (-1,-2), (-1,2), (1,-2), (1,2), (2,-1), (2,1).
        *   For each calculated knight's move position (new\_row, new\_col):
            *   If (new\_row, new\_col) is within the bounds of the grid:
                *   Set the color of the pixel at (new\_row, new\_col) in the *output grid* to the center color C1. This step may overwrite existing pixels in the output grid.
5.  After processing all identified cross patterns, return the final modified output grid.
