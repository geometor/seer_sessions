From each arm pixel, perform knight's moves. Place the color of the original cross's center pixel at each valid knight's move destination.\n\nThe transformation rule involves the following steps:\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through the input grid to find all valid \"cross\" patterns.\n   - A cross pattern has:\n     - A central pixel (r, c) with color C1 (not white/0).\n     - Four orthogonal neighbors (arms) with the same color C2 (not white/0, C1 != C2).\n     - Four diagonal neighbors that are white/0 (if within grid bounds).\n3. For each identified cross pattern:\n    a. Get the center color C1.\n    b. Get the coordinates of the four arm pixels.\n    c. Define the eight knight's move offsets: (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1).\n    d. For each of the four arm pixels at (arm_r, arm_c):\n        i. For each knight's move offset (dr, dc):\n           - Calculate the target coordinates (new_row, new_col) = (arm_r + dr, arm_c + dc).\n           - If the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at (new_row, new_col) in the output grid to the center color C1.\n4.
