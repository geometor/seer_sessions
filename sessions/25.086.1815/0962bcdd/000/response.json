In both examples, these shapes are identical \"plus\" or \"cross\" patterns.\n2.  **Object Composition:** Each cross shape consists of a central pixel of one color (magenta 6 in train_1, red 2 in train_2) and four adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) of another color (azure 8 in train_1, orange 7 in train_2).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids retain the original cross shapes from the input. Additionally, new pixels are added around each cross shape.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The new pixels appear at specific locations relative to the center of each cross. Observing their positions, they consistently match the eight possible \"knight's moves\" in chess (two steps in one cardinal direction and one step perpendicularly) starting from the central pixel of the cross.\n5.  **Color Rule:** The color of the newly added pixels is identical to the color of the *central* pixel of the corresponding cross shape (magenta 6 in train_1, red 2 in train_2).\n6.  **Multiple Objects:** The transformation is applied independently to each identified cross shape in the input.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
