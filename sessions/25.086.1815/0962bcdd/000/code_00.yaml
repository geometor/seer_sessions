task_type: pattern_completion
input_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white
  - type: object
    shape: cross (3x3, center + 4 adjacent)
    properties:
      - center_pixel:
          color: C1 (e.g., magenta, red)
          location: (row, col)
      - arm_pixels:
          color: C2 (e.g., azure, orange)
          location: adjacent to center
output_elements:
  - type: background
    color: white
  - type: object (original cross)
    shape: cross
    properties: (same as input)
  - type: added_pixels
    count: 8 per cross object
    color: C1 (same as center_pixel of corresponding cross)
    placement: knight's move positions relative to the center_pixel of the cross
relationships:
  - The transformation identifies specific 'cross' objects in the input.
  - For each cross object, the color of its central pixel (C1) determines the color of the pixels to be added.
  - The location of the central pixel determines the anchor point for placing the added pixels.
  - Added pixels are placed at locations defined by a fixed geometric offset (knight's move) from the anchor point.
actions:
  - Identify cross objects based on shape and color pattern.
  - For each identified cross:
    - Get the center pixel's color (C1) and location (row, col).
    - Calculate the 8 knight's move coordinates relative to (row, col).
    - Place pixels of color C1 at these calculated coordinates in the output grid, ensuring they are within bounds.
  - Copy the original input grid content to the output grid. (The new pixels are added without removing original content).
