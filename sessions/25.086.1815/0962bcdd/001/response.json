Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid to find potential centers of cross shapes. A cross shape is defined as a central pixel of color C1 surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right) by pixels of color C2 (where C1 != C2 and C1, C2 != 0), and diagonally by white pixels (color 0).\n3. For each identified cross center at (row, col) with color C1:\n    a. Define the eight knight's move offsets relative to the center: (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1).\n    b. For each offset (dr, dc), calculate the target coordinates (new_row, new_col) = (row + dr, col + dc).\n    c. If the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at (new_row, new_col) in the output grid to color C1.\n4. Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _is_within_bounds(r, c, height, width):\n  \"\"\"Checks if coordinates (r, c) are within the grid dimensions.\"\"\"\n  return 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width\n\ndef _is_cross_center(grid, r, c, height, width):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if the pixel at (r, c) is the center of a valid cross pattern.\n  Returns the center color C1 if it is, otherwise None.\n  \"\"\"\n  center_color_c1 = grid[r, c]\n  if center_color_c1 == 0: # Center cannot be white\n    return None\n\n  cardinal_offsets = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n  diagonal_offsets = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n\n  arm_color_c2 = None\n\n  # Check cardinal neighbors\n  for dr, dc in cardinal_offsets:\n    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n    if not _is_within_bounds(nr, nc, height, width):\n      return None # Cross must be fully formed within bounds for arms\n\n    neighbor_color = grid[nr, nc]\n    if neighbor_color == 0 or neighbor_color == center_color_c1:\n        return None # Arms cannot be white or same color as center\n\n    if arm_color_c2 is None:\n      arm_color_c2 = neighbor_color # Set the expected arm color\n    elif neighbor_color != arm_color_c2:\n      return None # All arms must have the same color C2\n\n  if arm_color_c2 is None: # Should not happen if loop ran, but safety check\n      return None\n\n  # Check diagonal neighbors (must be white)\n  for dr, dc in diagonal_offsets:\n    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n    if _is_within_bounds(nr, nc, height, width):\n      if grid[nr, nc] != 0:\n        return None # Diagonal neighbors must be white\n\n  # If all checks pass, it's a valid cross center\n  return center_color_c1\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the cross pattern knight's move transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to numpy array for easier slicing and manipulation\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    height, width = input_grid_np.shape\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid_np)\n\n    # Define knight's move offsets\n    knight_moves = [\n        (-2, -1), (-2, 1),\n        (-1, -2), (-1, 2),\n        (1, -2), (1, 2),\n        (2, -1), (2, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Iterate through each cell to find potential cross centers\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            # Check if the current cell is a center of a cross pattern\n            center_color = _is_cross_center(input_grid_np, r, c, height, width)\n\n            if center_color is not None:\n                # If it is a cross center, apply knight's moves\n                for dr, dc in knight_moves:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n\n                    # Check if the target coordinate is within bounds\n                    if _is_within_bounds(nr, nc, height, width):\n                        # Place the center color at the knight's move position\n                        # Note: This overwrites whatever might be there, consistent with examples\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = center_color\n\n    # Return the modified grid (convert back to list of lists if necessary,\n    # but numpy array is often preferred)\n    return output_grid.tolist() # Convert back to list of lists as per standard ARC format\n```"
