task_description: Identify specific cross patterns and expand them by placing pixels at relative offsets.

definitions:
  - &cross_pattern
    name: Cross Pattern
    type: Object
    properties:
      - shape: A central pixel surrounded by four cardinal neighbors and four diagonal neighbors.
      - center_pixel:
          color: C1 (must not be white/0)
      - cardinal_pixels: # Up, Down, Left, Right neighbors
          color: C2 (must not be white/0, must be different from C1, all four must have the same color C2)
      - diagonal_pixels: # Pixels diagonal to the center
          color: white/0 (must be white/0 if within grid bounds)
  - &center_color
    name: Center Color (C1)
    type: Property
    description: The color of the central pixel of a found Cross Pattern.
  - &arm_color
    name: Arm Color (C2)
    type: Property
    description: The color of the four cardinal neighbors (arms) of a found Cross Pattern.
  - &diagonal_offsets
    name: Diagonal Offsets
    type: Relative Position Set
    value: [(-2, -2), (-2, 2), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (2, -2), (2, 2)]
  - &extended_cardinal_offsets
    name: Extended Cardinal Offsets
    type: Relative Position Set
    value: [(-2, 0), (2, 0), (0, -2), (0, 2)]

actions:
  - action: Initialize Output
    description: Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
  - action: Find Patterns
    object: *cross_pattern
    description: Scan the input grid to locate all instances of the Cross Pattern. Record the center coordinates (r, c), center color (C1), and arm color (C2) for each found pattern.
  - action: Place Center Color
    description: For each found cross pattern with center (r, c) and center color C1:
      target_locations: Calculate coordinates (r+dr, c+dc) for each offset (dr, dc) in *diagonal_offsets.
      effect: If a target location is within the grid bounds, change the pixel color at that location in the output grid to C1, overwriting the existing color.
  - action: Place Arm Color
    description: For each found cross pattern with center (r, c) and arm color C2:
      target_locations: Calculate coordinates (r+dr, c+dc) for each offset (dr, dc) in *extended_cardinal_offsets.
      effect: If a target location is within the grid bounds, change the pixel color at that location in the output grid to C2, overwriting the existing color.
  - action: Return Output
    description: Return the modified output grid after processing all crosses.

flow:
  - Initialize Output
  - Find Patterns
  - For each pattern found:
    - Place Center Color
    - Place Arm Color
  - Return Output
