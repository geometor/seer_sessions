            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the \"cross\" pattern as defined (center C1, arms C2, white diagonals). However, the transformation logic was incomplete. It only placed the center color (C1) at specific diagonal offsets `(-2,-2), (-2,2), (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2)`.\n\nComparing the transformed outputs with the expected outputs reveals two key issues:\n1.  **Missing Pixels:** The expected outputs contain additional pixels not generated by the code. These pixels correspond to the *arm* color (C2) placed at extended cardinal offsets `(-2,0), (2,0), (0,-2), (0,2)` relative to the cross center.\n2.  **Overwriting:** The code correctly initializes the output as a copy of the input. The placement logic then overwrites pixels at the target locations. Based on the expected output, this overwriting behavior appears correct; the issue was that the code only performed *part* of the required placements. The original cross pattern itself seems to remain untouched in the final output.\n\nThe strategy is to update the transformation rule to include the placement of the arm color (C2) at the extended cardinal locations, in addition to placing the center color (C1) at the diagonal locations.\n\n## Metrics and Evidence\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 in detail:\n\n**Input Grid (Example 1):**\n"
