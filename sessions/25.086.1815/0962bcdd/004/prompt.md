"""
Identify cross shapes in the input grid. For each cross, find the four orthogonal 'arm' pixels. From each arm pixel, perform knight's moves. Place the color of the original cross's center pixel at each valid knight's move destination.

The transformation rule involves the following steps:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterate through the input grid to find all valid "cross" patterns.
   - A cross pattern has:
     - A central pixel (r, c) with color C1 (not white/0).
     - Four orthogonal neighbors (arms) with the same color C2 (not white/0, C1 != C2).
     - Four diagonal neighbors that are white/0 (if within grid bounds).
3. For each identified cross pattern:
    a. Get the center color C1.
    b. Get the coordinates of the four arm pixels.
    c. Define the eight knight's move offsets: (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1).
    d. For each of the four arm pixels at (arm_r, arm_c):
        i. For each knight's move offset (dr, dc):
           - Calculate the target coordinates (new_row, new_col) = (arm_r + dr, arm_c + dc).
           - If the target coordinates are within the grid boundaries, set the pixel at (new_row, new_col) in the output grid to the center color C1.
4. Return the modified output grid.
