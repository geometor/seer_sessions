Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.

For each identified cross pattern:

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified the "cross" pattern as defined (center C1, arms C2, white diagonals). However, the transformation logic was incomplete. It only placed the center color (C1) at specific diagonal offsets `(-2,-2), (-2,2), (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2)`.

Comparing the transformed outputs with the expected outputs reveals two key issues:
1.  **Missing Pixels:** The expected outputs contain additional pixels not generated by the code. These pixels correspond to the *arm* color (C2) placed at extended cardinal offsets `(-2,0), (2,0), (0,-2), (0,2)` relative to the cross center.
2.  **Overwriting:** The code correctly initializes the output as a copy of the input. The placement logic then overwrites pixels at the target locations. Based on the expected output, this overwriting behavior appears correct; the issue was that the code only performed *part* of the required placements. The original cross pattern itself seems to remain untouched in the final output.

The strategy is to update the transformation rule to include the placement of the arm color (C2) at the extended cardinal locations, in addition to placing the center color (C1) at the diagonal locations.

## Metrics and Evidence

Let's analyze Example 1 in detail:

**Input Grid (Example 1):**

```

0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
... (second cross similar)
```

Cross 1: Center (3, 3), Color C1=6 (magenta), Arms C2=8 (azure).

**Expected Output Grid (Example 1):**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 at (1,1), (1,5); C2 at (1,3)
0 0 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 at (2,2), (2,4)
0 8 8 6 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C2 at (3,1), (3,5); Original cross at (3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(2,3),(4,3)
0 0 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 at (4,2), (4,4)
0 6 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 at (5,1), (5,5); C2 at (5,3)
...
```


**Transformed Output Grid (Example 1):**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 placed correctly; Missing C2 at (1,3)
0 0 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 placed correctly (overwriting Input 0)
0 0 8 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- Original cross preserved; Missing C2 at (3,1), (3,5)
0 0 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 placed correctly (overwriting Input 0)
0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0  <- C1 placed correctly; Missing C2 at (5,3)
...
```


**Observations:**
*   The `_find_crosses` function correctly identifies the cross centers (3,3) and (9,8), their center colors (C1=6), and implicitly the arm colors (C2=8).
*   The code correctly placed C1 (magenta, 6) at the 8 diagonal offsets relative to each center, overwriting the original content (which was white/0 in this case).
*   The code *failed* to place C2 (azure, 8) at the 4 extended cardinal offsets: `(-2,0), (2,0), (0,-2), (0,2)` relative to each center.
*   The original cross pattern pixels (e.g., (3,3)=6, (2,3)=8, (4,3)=8, (3,2)=8, (3,4)=8 for the first cross) are present in the expected output, indicating they should not be removed or overwritten by the transformation process itself (though they could be overwritten if they happen to fall on a target location of *another* cross, which doesn't occur here).

Example 2 shows the same pattern: C1 (red, 2) is placed correctly at diagonal offsets (overwriting existing pixels, including orange/7), but C2 (orange, 7) is missing from the extended cardinal offsets.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the `output_grid` as an identical copy of the `input_grid`.
2.  Scan the `input_grid` to find all occurrences of a specific "cross" pattern. A cross is defined by:
    *   A central pixel at coordinates `(r, c)` with color `C1`, where `C1` is not white (0).
    *   The four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the center pixel all have the same color `C2`, where `C2` is not white (0) and `C1` is different from `C2`.
    *   The four diagonal neighbors of the center pixel are all white (0) (checking only those neighbors that fall within the grid boundaries).
3.  For each identified cross pattern with center `(r, c)`, center color `C1`, and arm color `C2`:
    a.  Define the set of eight diagonal offsets: `D = {(-2, -2), (-2, 2), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (2, -2), (2, 2)}`.
    b.  For each offset `(dr, dc)` in `D`:
        i.  Calculate the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c) = (r + dr, c + dc)`.
        ii. If `(target_r, target_c)` is within the grid bounds, update the `output_grid` at `(target_r, target_c)` to color `C1` (overwriting any previous color).
    c.  Define the set of four extended cardinal offsets: `E = {(-2, 0), (2, 0), (0, -2), (0, 2)}`.
    d.  For each offset `(dr, dc)` in `E`:
        i.  Calculate the target coordinates `(target_r, target_c) = (r + dr, c + dc)`.
        ii. If `(target_r, target_c)` is within the grid bounds, update the `output_grid` at `(target_r, target_c)` to color `C2` (overwriting any previous color).
4.  After processing all identified crosses, return the final `output_grid`.
