Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is a larger grid (14x14 in the examples) containing various colors (represented by integers 0-9). The output is always a small 3x3 grid.
2.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid consistently displays a '+' shape made of a single color against a white background. The '+' occupies the center row/column.
3.  **Input Colors:** The input grids contain white pixels (0) and typically 2 or 3 other distinct non-white colors.
4.  **Key Input Feature:** The presence or absence of 3x3 '+' shapes within the input grid seems crucial. A '+' shape is defined as a 5-pixel structure where a central pixel and its four cardinal neighbors share the same non-white color, and the four corner pixels within the 3x3 bounding box are white (0).
5.  **Color Selection Logic:** The color used for the output '+' shape depends on the non-white colors present in the input and specifically which of those colors form '+' shapes.
    *   In Example 1, three non-white colors are present (Blue, Red, Yellow). Blue and Red form '+' shapes, while Yellow does not. The output is a Yellow '+'.
    *   In Example 2, two non-white colors are present (Azure, Red). Red forms '+' shapes, while Azure does not. The output is an Azure '+'.
    *   In Example 3, two non-white colors are present (Azure, Magenta). Azure forms '+' shapes, while Magenta does not. The output is an Azure '+'.
6.  **Rule Dependency on Color Count:** The logic appears to change based on the *number* of distinct non-white colors in the input.
    *   If there are *three* distinct non-white colors, the output color seems to be the one that *does not* form a '+' shape.
    *   If there are *two* distinct non-white colors, the output color seems to be consistently Azure (8), regardless of which color forms the '+' shape.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Create a 3x3 '+' pattern output grid. The color of the '+' is determined by analyzing the non-white colors present in the input grid and identifying which of them form 3x3 '+' shapes.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - name: color
    type: integer (1-9) representing a non-white color.
  - name: plus_shape
    type: object
    description: A pattern within a grid where a central pixel and its four cardinal neighbors have the same non-white color `C`, and the four corner pixels within the 3x3 bounding box around the center are white (0). Requires checking grid boundaries.

input_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: The source grid containing various colors and potentially plus_shapes.
  - name: non_white_colors
    type: set of colors
    description: All unique colors present in the input_grid, excluding white (0).
  - name: num_non_white_colors
    type: integer
    description: The count of unique non-white colors.

transformation_logic:
  - step: 1. Identify the set of all unique non-white colors (`non_white_colors`) present in the `input_grid`.
  - step: 2. Count the number of unique colors found (`num_non_white_colors`).
  - step: 3. Determine the `output_color` based on `num_non_white_colors`.
    - condition: if `num_non_white_colors` is 3
      action:
        - a. For each color `C` in `non_white_colors`, check if it forms at least one `plus_shape` within the `input_grid`.
        - b. Identify the single color from `non_white_colors` that does *not* form any `plus_shape`. This color is the `output_color`.
    - condition: if `num_non_white_colors` is 2
      action:
        - a. Set the `output_color` to Azure (8).
  - step: 4. Construct the `output_grid`.

output_elements:
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      pattern: A plus_shape centered in the grid.
      color: The determined `output_color`.
      background_color: White (0).

assumptions:
  - If `num_non_white_colors` is 3, exactly one color will not form a `plus_shape`.
  - If `num_non_white_colors` is 2, the required `output_color` is always Azure (8), potentially implying Azure is always one of the two colors present in this scenario, or that Azure takes precedence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input grid and identify the set of all unique non-white colors present. Let this set be `Colors`.
2.  Count the number of colors in the set `Colors`. Let this count be `NumColors`.
3.  Define a procedure `CheckPlusShape(grid, color)`: Iterate through all possible center coordinates (r, c) in the `grid`. For each coordinate, check if it is the center of a 3x3 '+' shape of the specified `color`. A '+' shape exists if the pixel at (r, c) and its neighbors at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) all have the specified `color`, AND the pixels at (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c+1) are all white (0). Ensure all coordinates are within the grid boundaries. The procedure returns `True` if at least one such shape is found for the `color`, and `False` otherwise.
4.  Determine the `OutputColor`:
    *   If `NumColors` is 3: Iterate through each `C` in `Colors`. Call `CheckPlusShape` for `C`. The `OutputColor` is the single color `C` for which `CheckPlusShape` returns `False`.
    *   If `NumColors` is 2: Set the `OutputColor` to Azure (8).
5.  Create a new 3x3 grid initialized entirely with white (0).
6.  Set the pixel at (1, 1) (center) to `OutputColor`.
7.  Set the pixels at (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 2) (cardinal neighbors) to `OutputColor`.
8.  Return the created 3x3 grid.
