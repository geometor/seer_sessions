Crucially, it finds that *none* of them form a '+' shape according to the strict definition (center+cardinal = color, corners = white).\n    *   This invalidates the rule \"output color is the one that does NOT form a plus\". If none form a plus, how is Yellow(4) chosen?\n    *   Let's reconsider Example 1. Colors are 1, 2, 4. Output is 4. Maybe it's the color with the highest index? Or the one appearing fewest/most times? Or related to position?\n        *   Counts: Blue(1) appears 10 times. Red(2) appears 6 times. Yellow(4) appears 12 times. Not min or max count.\n        *   Position: Yellow(4) appears near the corners and center-right/bottom. Blue(1) appears top-right and left/bottom-right. Red(2) appears middle-right and bottom-left. No obvious positional key.\n        *   What if the shape definition is different? What if corners don't have to be white? Let's define `check_plus_shape_loose`: check only center+cardinal neighbors are the same color.\n"

            "text": "**Further Revised Analysis:**\n\nOkay, even the \"loose\" plus check (ignoring corners) only finds a match for Azure(8) in Example 3. This means the '+' shape check (strict or loose) is not the deciding factor for color choice in Example 1, nor for shape choice in Example 2.\n\nLet's rethink the rules entirely, incorporating the number of colors and the confirmed output shapes/colors.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Output Color**\n    *   If 2 non-white input colors: Output color is Azure (8). (Matches Ex 2, Ex 3)\n    *   If 3 non-white input colors: Output color is Yellow (4). (Matches Ex 1). This seems specific. Is it always Yellow(4) if there are 3 colors? Or is it specific to *these* 3 colors (1, 2, 4)? The task description implies a general rule. Maybe it's the color with the highest numerical value among the three? (max(1, 2, 4) = 4). Let's tentatively propose this: if N=3, output color = max(input colors).\n\n*   **Rule 2: Output Shape** (The output is always 3x3)\n    *   Shape depends on the *input* conditions.\n    *   If N=3 (Ex 1, colors 1, 2, 4; output color 4): Output shape is Shape A `[[C,0,0],[0,C,C],[C,0,0]]`.\n    *   If N=2:\n        *   Check if Azure(8) forms a *strict* 3x3 '+' shape (center+cardinal=8, corners=0) in the input.\n        *   If Yes (Ex 3, colors 8, 6; output color 8): Output shape is '+' `[[0,C,0],[C,C,C],[0,C,0]]`.\n        *   If No (Ex 2, colors 8, 2; output color 8): Output shape is 'X' `[[C,0,C],[0,C,0],[C,0,C]]`.\n\nThis set of rules now seems consistent with all examples and the verified metrics. The strict `check_plus_shape` is relevant *only* for determining the shape when N=2, and specifically checks for the color Azure(8). The color selection rule uses the count N and potentially the max color value if N=3.\n\n## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis focused heavily on the '+' shape based on the first example and the coder's interpretation, which proved inaccurate when applied to all examples. The code execution revealed inconsistencies in the assumed '+' shape presence.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-evaluate the core logic based on the number of unique non-white colors (`N`).\n2.  Establish separate rules for determining the *output color* and the *output shape*.\n3.  Use the results from `tool_code` execution (number of colors, strict '+' check results) as ground truth.\n4.  Formulate new hypotheses for color selection (e.g., fixed color for N=2, max color for N=3) and shape selection (e.g., fixed shape for N=3, conditional shape based on '+' check for N=2).\n5.  Validate these hypotheses against all three examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Input Non-White Colors (Count) | Output Color | Strict '+' in Input for Azure(8)? | Output Shape |\n| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :----------------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------ | :----------- |\n| 1       | 14x14      | 3x3         | {1, 2, 4} (3)                  | 4 (Yellow)   | N/A (No Azure(8) in input)      | Shape A      |\n| 2       | 14x14      | 3x3         | {2, 8} (2)                     | 8 (Azure)    | False                           | Shape X      |\n| 3       | 14x14      | 3x3         | {6, 8} (2)                     | 8 (Azure)    | True                            | Shape +      |\n\n*Shape Definitions:*\n*   Shape A: `[[C,0,0],[0,C,C],[C,0,0]]`\n*   Shape X: `[[C,0,C],[0,C,0],[C,0,C]]`\n*   Shape +: `[[0,C,0],[C,C,C],[0,C,0]]`\n\n## Facts\n\n"
