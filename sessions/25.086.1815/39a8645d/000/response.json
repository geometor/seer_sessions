The output is always a small 3x3 grid.\n2.  **Output Pattern:** The output grid consistently displays a '+' shape made of a single color against a white background. The '+' occupies the center row/column.\n3.  **Input Colors:** The input grids contain white pixels (0) and typically 2 or 3 other distinct non-white colors.\n4.  **Key Input Feature:** The presence or absence of 3x3 '+' shapes within the input grid seems crucial. A '+' shape is defined as a 5-pixel structure where a central pixel and its four cardinal neighbors share the same non-white color, and the four corner pixels within the 3x3 bounding box are white (0).\n5.  **Color Selection Logic:** The color used for the output '+' shape depends on the non-white colors present in the input and specifically which of those colors form '+' shapes.\n    *   In Example 1, three non-white colors are present (Blue, Red, Yellow). Blue and Red form '+' shapes, while Yellow does not. The output is a Yellow '+'.\n    *   In Example 2, two non-white colors are present (Azure, Red). Red forms '+' shapes, while Azure does not. The output is an Azure '+'.\n    *   In Example 3, two non-white colors are present (Azure, Magenta). Azure forms '+' shapes, while Magenta does not. The output is an Azure '+'.\n6.  **Rule Dependency on Color Count:** The logic appears to change based on the *number* of distinct non-white colors in the input.\n    *   If there are *three* distinct non-white colors, the output color seems to be the one that *does not* form a '+' shape.\n    *   If there are *two* distinct non-white colors, the output color seems to be consistently Azure (8), regardless of which color forms the '+' shape.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Count the number of colors in the set `Colors`. Let this count be `NumColors`.\n3.  Define a procedure `CheckPlusShape(grid, color)`: Iterate through all possible center coordinates (r, c) in the `grid`. For each coordinate, check if it is the center of a 3x3 '+' shape of the specified `color`. A '+' shape exists if the pixel at (r, c) and its neighbors at (r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1) all have the specified `color`, AND the pixels at (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c+1) are all white (0). Ensure all coordinates are within the grid boundaries. The procedure returns `True` if at least one such shape is found for the `color`, and `False` otherwise.\n4.  Determine the `OutputColor`:\n    *   If `NumColors` is 3: Iterate through each `C` in `Colors`. Call `CheckPlusShape` for `C`. The `OutputColor` is the single color `C` for which `CheckPlusShape` returns `False`.\n    *   If `NumColors` is 2: Set the `OutputColor` to Azure (8).\n5.  Create a new 3x3 grid initialized entirely with white (0).\n6.  Set the pixel at (1, 1) (center) to `OutputColor`.\n7.
