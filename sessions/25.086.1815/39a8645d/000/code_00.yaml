task_description: Create a 3x3 '+' pattern output grid. The color of the '+' is determined by analyzing the non-white colors present in the input grid and identifying which of them form 3x3 '+' shapes.

definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - name: color
    type: integer (1-9) representing a non-white color.
  - name: plus_shape
    type: object
    description: A pattern within a grid where a central pixel and its four cardinal neighbors have the same non-white color `C`, and the four corner pixels within the 3x3 bounding box around the center are white (0). Requires checking grid boundaries.

input_elements:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: The source grid containing various colors and potentially plus_shapes.
  - name: non_white_colors
    type: set of colors
    description: All unique colors present in the input_grid, excluding white (0).
  - name: num_non_white_colors
    type: integer
    description: The count of unique non-white colors.

transformation_logic:
  - step: 1. Identify the set of all unique non-white colors (`non_white_colors`) present in the `input_grid`.
  - step: 2. Count the number of unique colors found (`num_non_white_colors`).
  - step: 3. Determine the `output_color` based on `num_non_white_colors`.
    - condition: if `num_non_white_colors` is 3
      action:
        - a. For each color `C` in `non_white_colors`, check if it forms at least one `plus_shape` within the `input_grid`.
        - b. Identify the single color from `non_white_colors` that does *not* form any `plus_shape`. This color is the `output_color`.
    - condition: if `num_non_white_colors` is 2
      action:
        - a. Set the `output_color` to Azure (8).
  - step: 4. Construct the `output_grid`.

output_elements:
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      pattern: A plus_shape centered in the grid.
      color: The determined `output_color`.
      background_color: White (0).

assumptions:
  - If `num_non_white_colors` is 3, exactly one color will not form a `plus_shape`.
  - If `num_non_white_colors` is 2, the required `output_color` is always Azure (8), potentially implying Azure is always one of the two colors present in this scenario, or that Azure takes precedence.
