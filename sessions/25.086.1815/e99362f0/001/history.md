Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is 11 rows by 9 columns. A consistent feature is a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels spanning the entire width at row index 5. This line divides the grid into an upper section (rows 0-4) and a lower section (rows 6-10). Column index 4 is also consistently filled with yellow (4) pixels, intersecting the horizontal yellow line at the grid's center.
2.  **Color Distribution:**
    *   The upper section (rows 0-4) contains scattered orange (7) and maroon (9) pixels on a white (0) background, distributed across the columns left (0-3) and right (5-8) of the central yellow column.
    *   The lower section (rows 6-10) contains scattered red (2) and azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background, similarly distributed across the columns left (0-3) and right (5-8) of the central yellow column.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid is 5 rows by 4 columns. The colors present in the output (orange, maroon, red, azure, white) are the same non-yellow colors found in the input.
4.  **Transformation Clues:** The dimensions of the output (5x4) match the dimensions of the four sub-quadrants created by the yellow dividing lines in the input grid (excluding the yellow lines themselves). This suggests the output is derived by combining information from these four input quadrants.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Combine information from four input grid quadrants based on a priority order to generate the output grid.
input_grid:
  size: 11x9
  properties:
    - Contains a horizontal yellow line (color 4) at row 5.
    - Contains a vertical yellow line (color 4) at column 4.
    - These lines divide the grid into four main quadrants (excluding the lines themselves).
  quadrants:
    - top_left:
        rows: 0-4
        cols: 0-3
        colors: [0, 7, 9] # white, orange, maroon
    - top_right:
        rows: 0-4
        cols: 5-8
        colors: [0, 7, 9] # white, orange, maroon
    - bottom_left:
        rows: 6-10
        cols: 0-3
        colors: [0, 2, 8] # white, red, azure
    - bottom_right:
        rows: 6-10
        cols: 5-8
        colors: [0, 2, 8] # white, red, azure
output_grid:
  size: 5x4
  properties:
    - Contains colors derived from the input quadrants.
transformation:
  type: overlay_priority
  steps:
    - Define the four 5x4 input quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
    - Initialize a 5x4 output grid (O).
    - Iterate through each cell position (r, c) from (0,0) to (4,3).
    - Determine the output cell color O[r][c] by checking the corresponding cells in the input quadrants in the specific priority order: BR, TL, TR, BL.
    - The value for O[r][c] is the color of the first non-white (non-zero) cell found in the sequence: BR[r][c], TL[r][c], TR[r][c], BL[r][c].
    - If all corresponding cells in the sequence are white (0), then O[r][c] is white (0).
priority_order: [Bottom-Right, Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left]
ignore_color: 0 # white
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the central horizontal yellow line (row 5) and the central vertical yellow line (column 4) in the 11x9 input grid.
2.  Define four 5x4 subgrids (quadrants) from the input grid, excluding the yellow lines:
    *   `Top-Left` (TL): Input rows 0 through 4, columns 0 through 3.
    *   `Top-Right` (TR): Input rows 0 through 4, columns 5 through 8.
    *   `Bottom-Left` (BL): Input rows 6 through 10, columns 0 through 3.
    *   `Bottom-Right` (BR): Input rows 6 through 10, columns 5 through 8.
3.  Create a new 5x4 output grid, initially empty or filled with a default value (e.g., white).
4.  For each position `(r, c)` where `r` ranges from 0 to 4 and `c` ranges from 0 to 3:
    a.  Examine the color at `BR[r][c]`. If this color is not white (0), set the output grid color at `(r, c)` to this color and proceed to the next position.
    b.  If `BR[r][c]` is white, examine the color at `TL[r][c]`. If this color is not white (0), set the output grid color at `(r, c)` to this color and proceed to the next position.
    c.  If `TL[r][c]` is white, examine the color at `TR[r][c]`. If this color is not white (0), set the output grid color at `(r, c)` to this color and proceed to the next position.
    d.  If `TR[r][c]` is white, examine the color at `BL[r][c]`. If this color is not white (0), set the output grid color at `(r, c)` to this color and proceed to the next position.
    e.  If `BL[r][c]` is also white (meaning all corresponding quadrant cells were white), set the output grid color at `(r, c)` to white (0).
5.  Return the completed 5x4 output grid.
