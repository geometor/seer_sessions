            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is 11 rows by 9 columns. A consistent feature is a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels spanning the entire width at row index 5. This line divides the grid into an upper section (rows 0-4) and a lower section (rows 6-10). Column index 4 is also consistently filled with yellow (4) pixels, intersecting the horizontal yellow line at the grid's center.\n2.  **Color Distribution:**\n    *   The upper section (rows 0-4) contains scattered orange (7) and maroon (9) pixels on a white (0) background, distributed across the columns left (0-3) and right (5-8) of the central yellow column.\n    *   The lower section (rows 6-10) contains scattered red (2) and azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background, similarly distributed across the columns left (0-3) and right (5-8) of the central yellow column.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** Each output grid is 5 rows by 4 columns. The colors present in the output (orange, maroon, red, azure, white) are the same non-yellow colors found in the input.\n4.  **Transformation Clues:** The dimensions of the output (5x4) match the dimensions of the four sub-quadrants created by the yellow dividing lines in the input grid (excluding the yellow lines themselves). This suggests the output is derived by combining information from these four input quadrants.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
