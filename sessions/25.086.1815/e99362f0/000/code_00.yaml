task_description: Combine information from four input grid quadrants based on a priority order to generate the output grid.
input_grid:
  size: 11x9
  properties:
    - Contains a horizontal yellow line (color 4) at row 5.
    - Contains a vertical yellow line (color 4) at column 4.
    - These lines divide the grid into four main quadrants (excluding the lines themselves).
  quadrants:
    - top_left:
        rows: 0-4
        cols: 0-3
        colors: [0, 7, 9] # white, orange, maroon
    - top_right:
        rows: 0-4
        cols: 5-8
        colors: [0, 7, 9] # white, orange, maroon
    - bottom_left:
        rows: 6-10
        cols: 0-3
        colors: [0, 2, 8] # white, red, azure
    - bottom_right:
        rows: 6-10
        cols: 5-8
        colors: [0, 2, 8] # white, red, azure
output_grid:
  size: 5x4
  properties:
    - Contains colors derived from the input quadrants.
transformation:
  type: overlay_priority
  steps:
    - Define the four 5x4 input quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR).
    - Initialize a 5x4 output grid (O).
    - Iterate through each cell position (r, c) from (0,0) to (4,3).
    - Determine the output cell color O[r][c] by checking the corresponding cells in the input quadrants in the specific priority order: BR, TL, TR, BL.
    - The value for O[r][c] is the color of the first non-white (non-zero) cell found in the sequence: BR[r][c], TL[r][c], TR[r][c], BL[r][c].
    - If all corresponding cells in the sequence are white (0), then O[r][c] is white (0).
