There are two distinct rules: one for horizontal gray segments and one for vertical gray segments.\n\n1.  **Horizontal Propagation Rule:**\n    a.  Identify all maximal horizontal segments of gray pixels (5).\n    b.  For each segment located at row `r` spanning columns `c_start` to `c_end`:\n        i.  Iterate through each column `c_source` from `c_start` to `c_end`.\n        ii. Search vertically downwards starting from the pixel below the segment at `(r + 1, c_source)`. Find the *first* pixel `(r_source, c_source)` that is neither white (0) nor gray (5).\n        iii. If such a source pixel is found with color `source_color`:\n            1. Propagate `source_color` horizontally to the right within row `r_source`.\n            2. Iterate through target columns `c_target` from `c_source + 1` to `c_end`.\n            3. If the pixel at `(r_source, c_target)` in the *output* grid is currently white (0), change its color to `source_color`.\n            4. **Stop** searching further down in column `c_source` for this horizontal segment (use `break` after finding the first source in the downward search).\n\n2.  **Vertical Tiling Rule:**\n    a.  Identify all maximal vertical segments of gray pixels (5).\n    b.  For each segment located at column `c` spanning rows `r_top` to `r_bottom`:\n        i.  Check the column immediately to the right (`c + 1`). Identify all \"seed\" pixels `(r_adj, c + 1)` within the segment's row bounds (`r_top <= r_adj <= r_bottom`) that are neither white (0) nor gray (5).\n        ii. If seed pixels are found:\n            1.  Determine the connected component of non-white, non-gray pixels containing these seeds, constrained to rows `r_top` to `r_bottom` and columns `c + 1` onwards.\n            2.  Find the bounding box `(r_source_top, r_source_bottom, c_source_left, c_source_right)` of this component (this defines the \"pattern block\").\n            3.  If a valid pattern block exists (height > 0):\n                a.  Calculate the pattern height: `H_pattern = r_source_bottom - r_source_top + 1`.\n                b.  Iterate upwards through target rows `r_target` from `r_source_top - 1` down to `r_top`.\n                c.  For each `r_target`, calculate the corresponding source row `r_source` within the pattern block using modulo arithmetic: `relative_target_row = r_source_top - 1 - r_target`; `relative_source_row = (H_pattern - 1) - (relative_target_row % H_pattern)`; `r_source = r_source_top + relative_source_row`.\n                d.  Iterate through target columns `c_target` from `c_source_left` to `c_source_right`.\n                e.  If the pixel at `(r_target, c_target)` in the *output* grid is currently white (0):\n                    i.  Get the color `source_color` from the *input* grid at `(r_source, c_target)`.\n                    ii. If `source_color` is neither white (0) nor gray (5), change the color of the output pixel `(r_target, c_target)` to `source_color`.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_connected_component_bbox(grid, seed_points, r_min_bound, r_max_bound, c_min_bound):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the bounding box of the connected component of non-white, non-gray pixels\n    containing the seed points, constrained by row and column bounds.
