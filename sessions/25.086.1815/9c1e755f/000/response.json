            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples use a 10x10 grid.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), gray (5), and various other colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, yellow=4, magenta=6, orange=7, maroon=9).\n3.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   **Gray Lines/Segments (Color 5):** These appear as solid horizontal or vertical lines or segments. They seem to act as boundaries or triggers for the transformation. They remain unchanged in the output.\n    *   **Colored Patterns:** These are non-white, non-gray pixels that appear adjacent (immediately below or immediately to the right) to the gray segments. These patterns are the \"source\" for the transformation.\n    *   **White Space (Color 0):** This is the background color that gets filled during the transformation.\n4.  **Transformation Actions:** The core action is the propagation or \"tiling\" of the colored patterns into adjacent white space. The direction and manner of propagation depend on the orientation of the adjacent gray line segment.\n    *   **Horizontal Propagation:** If a colored pattern (a column of pixels) is immediately below a horizontal gray segment, each pixel's color in that column is extended horizontally to the right, filling the white space in its respective row, up to the end of the gray segment above it. (Seen in train_1, train_3 right side).\n    *   **Vertical Propagation:** If a colored pattern (one or more rows of pixels) is immediately to the right of a vertical gray segment, this block of rows is tiled vertically upwards, filling the white space, repeating the pattern block until it reaches the top boundary defined by the vertical gray segment. (Seen in train_2, train_3 left side, train_4).\n5.  **Boundaries:** The propagation seems strictly bounded by the extent of the adjacent gray line segment. Propagation only overwrites white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
