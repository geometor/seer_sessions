Task: Propagate colors based on adjacent gray segments.

Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (H x W)
      - pixels: integer values 0-9 representing colors
  - type: Segment
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical
      - location: (row, col_start, col_end) | (col, row_start, row_end)
      - extent: length (number of pixels)
  - type: ColorSource
    properties:
      - color: non-white (0), non-gray (5)
      - location: pixel coordinates (r, c)
      - relation_to_segment:
          - horizontal_trigger: located at (segment.row + 1, c) where segment.col_start <= c <= segment.col_end
          - vertical_trigger: located within a connected component adjacent (at col + 1) to a vertical segment, within the segment's row bounds.
  - type: FillArea
    properties:
      - initial_color: white (0)
      - location: pixel coordinates (r, c)
      - relation_to_segment_and_source:
          - horizontal_fill: located at (source.row, c_fill) where source.col < c_fill <= segment.col_end
          - vertical_fill: located at (r_fill, c_fill) where segment.row_start <= r_fill < source.pattern_top_row and source.pattern_left_col <= c_fill <= source.pattern_right_col

Actions:
  - name: FindGraySegments
    input: Grid
    output: List of horizontal segments, List of vertical segments
    description: Identify all maximal contiguous segments of gray pixels horizontally and vertically.
  - name: HorizontalPropagation
    input: Grid, HorizontalSegment
    output: Modified Grid
    description: For each column 'c' under the segment (segment.col_start to segment.col_end), if a ColorSource exists at (segment.row + 1, c), propagate its color rightwards into the FillArea (segment.row + 1, c+1) to (segment.row + 1, segment.col_end), only overwriting white pixels.
  - name: VerticalPropagation
    input: Grid, VerticalSegment
    output: Modified Grid
    description: Identify the connected ColorSource pattern adjacent to the right of the segment (within segment row bounds). Tile this pattern vertically upwards into the FillArea above the pattern (up to segment.row_start), only overwriting white pixels. Tiling uses modulo arithmetic based on pattern height.
