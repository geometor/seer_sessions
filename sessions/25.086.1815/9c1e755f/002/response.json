            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement a transformation based on horizontal and vertical gray (color 5) segments acting as triggers.\n- **Horizontal segments:** Trigger horizontal propagation of colors found immediately below the segment, filling white space (color 0) to the right, bounded by the segment's width.\n- **Vertical segments:** Trigger vertical tiling/propagation of patterns found immediately to the right of the segment, filling white space upwards, bounded by the segment's height.\n\nThe results show that the vertical propagation rule seems to be implemented correctly (Examples 2 and 4 passed, and the vertical part of Example 3 seems okay visually, though the overall result failed).\nHowever, the horizontal propagation rule is flawed. In Examples 1 and 3, only the color found in the first relevant column below the horizontal gray bar was propagated. Other colors in subsequent columns below the same bar were ignored.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\nThe horizontal propagation logic needs refinement. Instead of finding the *first* source color and propagating it, the logic should iterate through *all* columns below the horizontal gray segment (within its horizontal extent). For each column `c` where a non-white, non-gray pixel exists at `(r+1, c)`, that specific color should be propagated rightwards from `(r+1, c+1)` to `(r+1, c_end)`, filling only white pixels. This process should apply independently for each source pixel found below the gray segment.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's gather some metrics for each example to better understand the structures involved.\n\n"

Vertical tiling worked.\n*   **Example 3 (Fail):** 1 horizontal segment `(0, 6-9)`, 1 vertical segment `(1-8, 0)`. Vertical tiling worked. Horizontal propagation failed to propagate colors from `(2,6)`, `(3,6)`, `(4,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,6)` rightwards. `Pixels Off: 15`.\n*   **Example 4 (Pass):** 1 vertical segment `(2-5, 2)`. Vertical tiling worked.\n\nThe metrics confirm the analysis: failures occur when horizontal propagation is needed, specifically when multiple different source pixels exist below the same horizontal gray segment. The vertical propagation appears correct. The identification of segments (even single points) seems appropriate.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
