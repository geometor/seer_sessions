            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully solves Examples 2 and 4, indicating that the logic for vertical propagation (tiling adjacent patterns upwards based on vertical gray segments) is likely correct or very close.\n\nHowever, the code fails on Examples 1 and 3. Both failures seem related to the horizontal propagation rule. The current implementation only checks the row *immediately* below the horizontal gray segment (`r+1`) for source colors. The correct behavior, as seen in the expected outputs, requires finding the source color further down if necessary and propagating it within its own row.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the horizontal propagation logic to correctly identify the source pixel and its row for propagation. The vertical propagation logic will be kept as is for now.\n\n## Metrics\n\nNo specific code execution is required for metric gathering at this stage. The key metrics are already provided:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Failed (25 pixels off). Horizontal propagation incorrect.\n*   **Example 2:** Passed. Vertical propagation correct.\n*   **Example 3:** Failed (15 pixels off). Horizontal propagation incorrect. Vertical propagation seems correct.\n*   **Example 4:** Passed. Vertical propagation correct.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
