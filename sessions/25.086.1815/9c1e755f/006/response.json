            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully solved Examples 2 and 4, which primarily involved the vertical tiling rule. However, it failed on Examples 1 and 3, both of which rely heavily on the horizontal propagation rule. The transformed output for these failed examples shows that only the *first* non-background color found below the horizontal gray segment in the starting column was propagated horizontally. The expected output clearly shows that *all* non-background colors found vertically below the segment (within the segment's column span) should be propagated horizontally across the columns covered by the segment.\n\nThe error stems from the interpretation and implementation of the horizontal propagation rule. The previous logic included a `break` after finding the first source color in the downward search for each column under the gray segment. This prevented subsequent colors in the same column from being propagated.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the horizontal propagation rule description to explicitly state that the search for source colors below the gray segment should continue downwards for the entire height of the grid for each column under the segment.\n2.  The corresponding implementation change will involve removing the `break` statement within the downward search loop (`for r_source_row in range(r + 1, H):`) in the horizontal propagation section of the code.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's examine the differences in the failed examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Grid (relevant part):\n    "
