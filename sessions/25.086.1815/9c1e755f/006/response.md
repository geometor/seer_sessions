## General Assessment

The previous code successfully solved Examples 2 and 4, which primarily involved the vertical tiling rule. However, it failed on Examples 1 and 3, both of which rely heavily on the horizontal propagation rule. The transformed output for these failed examples shows that only the *first* non-background color found below the horizontal gray segment in the starting column was propagated horizontally. The expected output clearly shows that *all* non-background colors found vertically below the segment (within the segment's column span) should be propagated horizontally across the columns covered by the segment.

The error stems from the interpretation and implementation of the horizontal propagation rule. The previous logic included a `break` after finding the first source color in the downward search for each column under the gray segment. This prevented subsequent colors in the same column from being propagated.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the horizontal propagation rule description to explicitly state that the search for source colors below the gray segment should continue downwards for the entire height of the grid for each column under the segment.
2.  The corresponding implementation change will involve removing the `break` statement within the downward search loop (`for r_source_row in range(r + 1, H):`) in the horizontal propagation section of the code.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's examine the differences in the failed examples:

**Example 1:**
*   Input Grid (relevant part):
    
```
    0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0
    0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

*   Expected Output (relevant part):
    
```
    0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0
    0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
    0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
    0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
    0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0
    0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
    0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
    ```

*   Transformed Output (relevant part):
    
```
    0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0
    0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

*   Analysis: The code correctly identified the red pixel (2) at (2, 1) below the gray segment (row 1, cols 1-6) and propagated it horizontally to fill row 2, cols 2-6. However, it stopped searching downwards in column 1 after finding the first color (red). It missed the blue (1) at (3, 1), red (2) at (4, 1), magenta (6) at (5, 1), blue (1) at (6, 1), and blue (1) at (7, 1), which should have been propagated across their respective rows (rows 3-7) within the segment's horizontal extent (cols 2-6).

**Example 3:**
*   Input Grid (relevant part):
    
```
    0 0 5 5 5 5
    0 0 3 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0
    0 0 7 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0
    0 0 7 0 0 0
    0 0 7 0 0 0
    ```

*   Expected Output (relevant part):
    
```
    0 0 5 5 5 5
    0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 7 7 7 7
    0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 7 7 7 7
    0 0 7 7 7 7
    ```

*   Transformed Output (relevant part):
    
```
    0 0 5 5 5 5
    0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 3 0 0 0
    0 0 7 0 0 0
    0 0 3 0 0 0
    0 0 7 0 0 0
    0 0 7 0 0 0
    ```

*   Analysis: Similar to Example 1. The gray segment is at row 0, cols 6-9. The code processed column 6. It found green (3) at (1, 6) and propagated it. It found orange (7) at (3, 6) and propagated it. It found orange (7) at (5, 6) and propagated it. It found orange (7) at (6, 6) and propagated it. Crucially, it *missed* propagating the green (3) at (2, 6) and the green (3) at (4, 6) because of the incorrect `break` logic tied to finding the *first* color in the downward scan *per column*. The rule should be: for *each* column under the gray segment, find *all* non-white/non-gray colors below it, and for *each* of those found colors, propagate it horizontally to the right within its row, up to the boundary of the gray segment.

        - For *each* pixel `(r_source, c_source)` found with a `source_color` (not white or gray):

    steps:

        - Determine the bounding box `(r_source_top, r_source_bottom, c_source_left, c_source_right)` of this component (pattern block).
        - If a valid pattern block exists:
          - Calculate pattern height `H_pattern`.
          - Tile upwards: For each target row `r_target` from `r_source_top - 1` down to `r_top`:
            - Calculate the corresponding source row `r_source` using modulo arithmetic based on `H_pattern`.
            - For each target column `c_target` from `c_source_left` to `c_source_right`:
              - If `(r_target, c_target)` is white (0):
                - Get `source_color` from input grid at `(r_source, c_target)`.
                - If `source_color` is not white (0) or gray (5), set `(r_target, c_target)` to `source_color`.

final_grid_construction:
  - Start with a copy of the input grid.
  - Apply horizontal propagation rule for all horizontal gray segments.
  - Apply vertical tiling rule for all vertical gray segments. The order might matter if rules overlap or interact, but based on examples, applying horizontal then vertical seems correct. The modifications happen on the same output grid copy.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Propagation Rule:**
    a.  Identify all maximal horizontal segments of gray pixels (5).
    b.  For each horizontal segment located at row `r` spanning columns `c_start` to `c_end`:
        i.  Iterate through each column `c_source` from `c_start` to `c_end`.
        ii. Search vertically downwards starting from the pixel below the segment at `(r + 1, c_source)`.
        iii. For **every** pixel `(r_source, c_source)` found during this downward search that has a color `source_color` which is neither white (0) nor gray (5):
            1. Propagate this `source_color` horizontally to the right within its own row `r_source`.
            2. Iterate through target columns `c_target` from `c_source + 1` to `c_end`.
            3. If the pixel at `(r_source, c_target)` in the *output* grid is currently white (0), change its color to `source_color`.
3.  **Vertical Tiling Rule:**
    a.  Identify all maximal vertical segments of gray pixels (5).
    b.  For each vertical segment located at column `c` spanning rows `r_top` to `r_bottom`:
        i.  Check the column immediately to the right (`c + 1`). Identify all "seed" pixels `(r_adj, c + 1)` within the segment's row bounds (`r_top <= r_adj <= r_bottom`) that are neither white (0) nor gray (5).
        ii. If seed pixels are found:
            1.  Determine the connected component of non-white, non-gray pixels containing these seeds, constrained to rows `r_top` to `r_bottom` and columns `c + 1` onwards.
            2.  Find the bounding box `(r_source_top, r_source_bottom, c_source_left, c_source_right)` of this component (this defines the "pattern block").
            3.  If a valid pattern block exists (height > 0):
                a.  Calculate the pattern height: `H_pattern = r_source_bottom - r_source_top + 1`.
                b.  Iterate upwards through target rows `r_target` from `r_source_top - 1` down to `r_top`.
                c.  For each `r_target`, calculate the corresponding source row `r_source` within the pattern block using modulo arithmetic: `relative_target_row = r_source_top - 1 - r_target`; `relative_source_row = (H_pattern - 1) - (relative_target_row % H_pattern)`; `r_source = r_source_top + relative_source_row`.
                d.  Iterate through target columns `c_target` from `c_source_left` to `c_source_right`.
                e.  If the pixel at `(r_target, c_target)` in the *output* grid is currently white (0):
                    i.  Get the color `source_color` from the *input* grid at `(r_source, c_target)`.
                    ii. If `source_color` is neither white (0) nor gray (5), change the color of the output pixel `(r_target, c_target)` to `source_color`.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
