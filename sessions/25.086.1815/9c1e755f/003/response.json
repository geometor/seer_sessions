These segments trigger color propagation into adjacent white space (color 0).\n\n1.  **Horizontal Propagation:**\n    - Find all maximal horizontal gray segments.\n    - For each segment (at row `r`, columns `c_start` to `c_end`):\n    - Check the row below (`r + 1`).\n    - For each column `c_source` from `c_start` to `c_end`:\n        - If the pixel `input[r + 1, c_source]` has a color (not 0/white, not 5/gray):\n            - Propagate this `source_color` rightwards from `(r + 1, c_source + 1)` to `(r + 1, c_end)`.\n            - Fill only pixels in the `output` grid that are currently white (0).\n\n2.  **Vertical Propagation:**\n    - Find all maximal vertical gray segments.\n    - For each segment (at column `c`, rows `r_top` to `r_bottom`):\n    - Check the column to the right (`c + 1`) within the segment's row bounds (`r_top` to `r_bottom`).\n    - Identify seed pixels (not 0/white, not 5/gray) at `(r_adj, c + 1)`.\n    - If seeds exist, find the bounding box of the connected component formed by these seeds and other adjacent non-white/non-gray pixels, constrained by the segment's row bounds (`r_top` to `r_bottom`) and columns `c + 1` onwards.\n    - If a valid pattern block is found (bbox: `r_source_top` to `r_source_bottom`, `c_source_left` to `c_source_right`):\n        - Tile this pattern (from the `input` grid) vertically upwards, starting from row `r_source_top - 1` up to `r_top`.\n        - Use modulo arithmetic based on the pattern height to determine the source row for each target row.\n        - Fill only pixels in the `output` grid that are currently white (0) within the pattern's column bounds (`c_source_left` to `c_source_right`).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_connected_component_bbox(grid, seed_points, r_min_bound, r_max_bound, c_min_bound):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the bounding box of the connected component of non-white, non-gray pixels\n    containing the seed points, constrained by row and column bounds.
