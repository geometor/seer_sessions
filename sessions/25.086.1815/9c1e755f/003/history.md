"""
The transformation rule involves identifying horizontal and vertical segments of gray pixels (color 5).
These gray segments act as triggers and boundaries for propagating adjacent colored patterns (non-white 0, non-gray 5) into adjacent white space (color 0).

1.  **Horizontal Propagation:** If a non-white, non-gray pixel exists immediately below a horizontal gray segment, its color is propagated horizontally to the right, filling any white pixels in the same row, up to the end column of the gray segment above it.

2.  **Vertical Propagation:** If a pattern (a connected block of non-white, non-gray pixels) exists immediately to the right of a vertical gray segment, this pattern block is tiled/repeated vertically upwards, filling white space in the same columns, up to the top row of the gray segment. The tiling repeats the source pattern block cyclically from bottom to top.

The process involves:
- Finding all maximal gray segments (horizontal and vertical).
- For each segment, finding the adjacent source pattern (if any).
- Applying the corresponding propagation rule (horizontal fill or vertical tiling) to modify a copy of the input grid.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to implement a transformation based on horizontal and vertical gray (color 5) segments acting as triggers.
- **Horizontal segments:** Trigger horizontal propagation of colors found immediately below the segment, filling white space (color 0) to the right, bounded by the segment's width.
- **Vertical segments:** Trigger vertical tiling/propagation of patterns found immediately to the right of the segment, filling white space upwards, bounded by the segment's height.

The results show that the vertical propagation rule seems to be implemented correctly (Examples 2 and 4 passed, and the vertical part of Example 3 seems okay visually, though the overall result failed).
However, the horizontal propagation rule is flawed. In Examples 1 and 3, only the color found in the first relevant column below the horizontal gray bar was propagated. Other colors in subsequent columns below the same bar were ignored.

**Strategy for Resolution:**
The horizontal propagation logic needs refinement. Instead of finding the *first* source color and propagating it, the logic should iterate through *all* columns below the horizontal gray segment (within its horizontal extent). For each column `c` where a non-white, non-gray pixel exists at `(r+1, c)`, that specific color should be propagated rightwards from `(r+1, c+1)` to `(r+1, c_end)`, filling only white pixels. This process should apply independently for each source pixel found below the gray segment.

**Analysis Summary:**

*   **Example 1 (Fail):** 1 horizontal segment `(1, 1-6)`. Code failed to propagate colors from `(3,1)`, `(4,1)`, `(5,1)`, `(6,1)`, `(7,1)` rightwards. `Pixels Off: 25`.
*   **Example 2 (Pass):** 1 vertical segment `(1-8, 0)`. Vertical tiling worked.
*   **Example 3 (Fail):** 1 horizontal segment `(0, 6-9)`, 1 vertical segment `(1-8, 0)`. Vertical tiling worked. Horizontal propagation failed to propagate colors from `(2,6)`, `(3,6)`, `(4,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,6)` rightwards. `Pixels Off: 15`.
*   **Example 4 (Pass):** 1 vertical segment `(2-5, 2)`. Vertical tiling worked.

The metrics confirm the analysis: failures occur when horizontal propagation is needed, specifically when multiple different source pixels exist below the same horizontal gray segment. The vertical propagation appears correct. The identification of segments (even single points) seems appropriate.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Task: Propagate colors based on adjacent gray segments.

Objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (H x W)
      - pixels: integer values 0-9 representing colors
  - type: Segment
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: horizontal | vertical
      - location: (row, col_start, col_end) | (col, row_start, row_end)
      - extent: length (number of pixels)
  - type: ColorSource
    properties:
      - color: non-white (0), non-gray (5)
      - location: pixel coordinates (r, c)
      - relation_to_segment:
          - horizontal_trigger: located at (segment.row + 1, c) where segment.col_start <= c <= segment.col_end
          - vertical_trigger: located within a connected component adjacent (at col + 1) to a vertical segment, within the segment's row bounds.
  - type: FillArea
    properties:
      - initial_color: white (0)
      - location: pixel coordinates (r, c)
      - relation_to_segment_and_source:
          - horizontal_fill: located at (source.row, c_fill) where source.col < c_fill <= segment.col_end
          - vertical_fill: located at (r_fill, c_fill) where segment.row_start <= r_fill < source.pattern_top_row and source.pattern_left_col <= c_fill <= source.pattern_right_col

Actions:
  - name: FindGraySegments
    input: Grid
    output: List of horizontal segments, List of vertical segments
    description: Identify all maximal contiguous segments of gray pixels horizontally and vertically.
  - name: HorizontalPropagation
    input: Grid, HorizontalSegment
    output: Modified Grid
    description: For each column 'c' under the segment (segment.col_start to segment.col_end), if a ColorSource exists at (segment.row + 1, c), propagate its color rightwards into the FillArea (segment.row + 1, c+1) to (segment.row + 1, segment.col_end), only overwriting white pixels.
  - name: VerticalPropagation
    input: Grid, VerticalSegment
    output: Modified Grid
    description: Identify the connected ColorSource pattern adjacent to the right of the segment (within segment row bounds). Tile this pattern vertically upwards into the FillArea above the pattern (up to segment.row_start), only overwriting white pixels. Tiling uses modulo arithmetic based on pattern height.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Gray Segments:** Locate all maximal contiguous horizontal and vertical segments of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Treat even single gray pixels as segments of length 1.
3.  **Process Horizontal Segments:**
    *   Iterate through each identified horizontal gray segment defined by its row `r`, start column `c_start`, and end column `c_end`.
    *   Consider the row immediately below the segment (`r + 1`).
    *   For each column `c` from `c_start` to `c_end`:
        *   Check the pixel at `(r + 1, c)`.
        *   If this pixel contains a color (not white `0` and not gray `5`), let this be `source_color`.
        *   Propagate `source_color` horizontally to the right: For each column `c_fill` from `c + 1` to `c_end`, if the pixel at `(r + 1, c_fill)` in the *output grid* is white (`0`), set it to `source_color`.
4.  **Process Vertical Segments:**
    *   Iterate through each identified vertical gray segment defined by its column `c`, top row `r_top`, and bottom row `r_bottom`.
    *   Check the column immediately to the right of the segment (`c + 1`).
    *   Find all colored seed pixels (not white `0`, not gray `5`) at `(r_adj, c + 1)` where `r_top <= r_adj <= r_bottom`.
    *   If seed pixels exist, perform a connected components search (BFS or DFS) starting from these seeds, constrained to non-white/non-gray pixels, staying within the row bounds `r_top` to `r_bottom` and column bounds `c + 1` onwards, to find the bounding box (`r_source_top`, `r_source_bottom`, `c_source_left`, `c_source_right`) of the adjacent source pattern.
    *   If a valid source pattern is found (height > 0):
        *   Define the source pattern block using the bounding box on the *input grid*.
        *   Calculate the pattern height: `pattern_height = r_source_bottom - r_source_top + 1`.
        *   Tile the pattern upwards: Iterate through target rows `r_target` from `r_source_top - 1` down to `r_top`.
        *   For each `r_target`, calculate the corresponding source row `r_source` within the pattern block using modulo arithmetic: `r_source = r_source_bottom - ((r_source_bottom - r_target) % pattern_height)`.
        *   For each target column `c_target` from `c_source_left` to `c_source_right`:
            *   If the pixel at `(r_target, c_target)` in the *output grid* is white (`0`), get the color from the input pattern at `(r_source, c_target)`.
            *   If the source color is not white (`0`) or gray (`5`), set the output grid pixel `(r_target, c_target)` to this source color.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
