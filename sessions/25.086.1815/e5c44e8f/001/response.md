Transformation rule:

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Locate the single Green (3) pixel and all Red (2) pixels in the input grid.
3. Check if any Red pixels exist.
   - If Red pixels exist:
     Perform a 4-directional flood fill (Breadth-First Search) starting from the Green pixel.
     The fill color is Green (3).
     The fill targets White (0) pixels.
     The fill is blocked by Red (2) pixels and the grid boundaries.
     Modify the output grid by changing the filled White pixels to Green.
   - If NO Red pixels exist:
     Apply a predefined pattern of Green (3) pixels to the output grid, only changing existing White (0) pixels.
     The pattern consists of:
       - Filling columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 from row 0 to 8.
       - Filling rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 from column 1 to 9.
       - Filling the entire last row (row 10).
     The original Green pixel's position remains Green.
4. Return the modified output grid.
