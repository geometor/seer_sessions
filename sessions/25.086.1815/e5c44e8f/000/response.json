            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All examples use 11x11 grids.\n2.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are White (0), Red (2), and Green (3).\n3.  **Input Structure:** Each input grid contains exactly one Green pixel and zero or more Red pixels scattered across a White background.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid retains the positions of the original Red and Green pixels from the input. Additionally, some White pixels from the input are changed to Green in the output.\n5.  **Core Transformation:** The transformation appears to depend on the presence or absence of Red pixels.\n    *   **With Red Pixels (Train 1, Train 3):** The Green color seems to \"spread\" or \"fill\" outwards from the initial Green pixel's location. This spread is contained or blocked by the Red pixels, which act like walls. The spread also stops at the grid boundaries. The fill occurs in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).\n    *   **Without Red Pixels (Train 2):** When no Red pixels are present in the input, a distinct, seemingly fixed pattern of Green pixels is generated in the output, largely independent of the initial Green pixel's location (except that the initial Green pixel's position is preserved). This pattern involves filling specific rows and columns: alternating columns (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) up to row 8, alternating rows (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) between columns 1 and 9, and the entire last row (row 10).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
