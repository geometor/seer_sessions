            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n## Perception of Elements\n\n1.  **Input Grid:** Contains a dominant background color (orange, 7) and several scattered pixels of different colors. These non-background pixels appear to be the key elements.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Has the same dimensions as the input grid. It displays a pattern of concentric squares (or rectangles if the grid isn't square) centered within the grid.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The colors used in the output pattern are precisely the non-background colors found in the input grid. The background color from the input is not used in the output pattern.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The arrangement of colors in the output's concentric layers depends on the spatial relationship of the corresponding non-background pixels in the input grid relative to the input grid's center.\n5.  **Ordering Principle:** Pixels closer to the center of the input grid determine the colors of the inner layers in the output, while pixels farther from the center determine the colors of the outer layers. Manhattan distance seems to be the relevant distance metric.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** When multiple input pixels have the same Manhattan distance from the center, a tie-breaking rule is needed. Based on Example 1, it appears the pixel with the larger row index comes first, and if rows are also tied, the one with the larger column index comes first (reverse row-major order of the original pixel positions).\n7.  **Pattern Formation:** The output pattern is formed by drawing successive squares/rectangles, centered in the grid, each filled with a color determined by the sorted input pixels. The innermost layer is a 1x1 pixel, the next a 3x3, then 5x5, and so on, until the dimensions match the output grid. Each layer overwrites the central part of the previous layers.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Identify the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.\n3.  Find all pixels in the input grid that do not have the background color. For each such pixel, record its color, row index `r`, and column index `c`.\n4.  Calculate the center coordinates of the grid: `center_row = floor((H - 1) / 2)` and `center_col = floor((W - 1) / 2)`.\n5.  For each non-background pixel found in step 3, calculate its Manhattan distance `d` from the center: `d = abs(r - center_row) + abs(c - center_col)`.\n6.  Create a list of the non-background pixels, storing them with their calculated distance and original coordinates.\n7.  Sort this list primarily by distance `d` in ascending order. If two pixels have the same distance, sort them secondarily by their original row index `r` in descending order. If row indices are also the same, sort them tertiarily by their original column index `c` in descending order. Let the sorted colors be `C_0, C_1, ..., C_{N-1}`.\n8.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions HxW.\n9.  Iterate through the sorted pixels from index `i = 0` to `N-1`. For each pixel `i` with color `C_i`:\n    a.  Define the boundaries of the `i`-th layer's square/rectangle centered at `(center_row, center_col)`. The boundaries are:\n        *   `min_row = center_row - i`\n        *   `max_row = center_row + i`\n        *   `min_col = center_col - i`\n        *   `max_col = center_col + i`\n    b.  Iterate through all grid cells `(row, col)` such that `min_row <= row <= max_row` and `min_col <= col <= max_col`.\n    c.  For each such cell `(row, col)`, if it is within the grid bounds (0 <= `row` < H and 0 <= `col` < W), set the color of the cell in the output grid to `C_i`. (This effectively draws filled squares/rectangles, with later layers overwriting the central parts of earlier ones).\n10. The final state of the output grid after iterating through all sorted colors is the result."
