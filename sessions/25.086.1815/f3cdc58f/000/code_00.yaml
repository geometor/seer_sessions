- task_type: transformation
- input_domain:
    - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    - colors_present: white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4)
    - grid_size: consistent within pairs (e.g., 10x10)
- output_domain:
    - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9), same dimensions as input
    - structure: vertical bars of color in the leftmost columns against a white background
- elements:
    - pixels: individual cells with color values
    - colors_of_interest: blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4)
    - output_bars: contiguous vertical segments of a single color
- relationships:
    - input_output_dimensions: same height and width
    - color_to_column_mapping:
        - blue (1) maps to column 0
        - red (2) maps to column 1
        - green (3) maps to column 2
        - yellow (4) maps to column 3
    - count_to_height_relationship: The count of each color (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input grid determines the height (number of pixels) of the corresponding colored bar in the output grid.
    - alignment: The colored bars in the output grid are bottom-aligned.
- actions:
    - count: Count the occurrences of each color (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input grid.
    - generate: Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to white (0).
    - draw_bars: For each color (1, 2, 3, 4), draw a vertical bar of that color in its designated column (0, 1, 2, 3) in the output grid. The height of the bar equals the count of that color, and the bar starts from the bottom row and extends upwards.
