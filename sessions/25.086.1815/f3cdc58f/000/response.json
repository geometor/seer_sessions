The output grid has the same dimensions as the input but is mostly white. The key feature of the output grid is a set of vertical bars located in the first four columns (columns 0, 1, 2, and 3). Each bar consists of a single color: column 0 is blue, column 1 is red, column 2 is green, and column 3 is yellow. The height of each colored bar seems to correspond to the total count of pixels of that specific color in the input grid. These bars are aligned to the bottom edge of the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
