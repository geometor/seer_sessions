The background is predominantly white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there are typically two distinct non-white entities:\n    *   A larger, multi-colored, connected object (let's call it the \"pattern object\"). This object always contains at least one gray (5) pixel.\n    *   A single, isolated gray (5) pixel (let's call it the \"marker pixel\").\n3.  **Transformation:** The output grid retains the original pattern object in its initial position. A modified copy of the pattern object is added to the grid.\n4.  **Copy Placement:** The position of the copied object seems determined by the location of the marker pixel in the input. Specifically, the marker pixel's location in the input corresponds to the location where the gray pixel *from within the pattern object* should be placed in the output copy.\n5.  **Modification:** The copied object is identical to the original pattern object, except that the gray pixel within the pattern object is replaced with a white (0) pixel in the copied version. The original marker pixel location is overwritten by the corresponding pixel from the copied pattern object (which might be white or another color, depending on the pattern object's structure relative to its internal gray pixel).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the main connected \"pattern object\" (composed of non-white pixels and containing at least one gray pixel). Determine its bounding box and the coordinates of the gray pixel(s) within it. Assuming there is only one such gray pixel.\n3.  Identify the single, isolated \"marker pixel\" (which is gray). Determine its coordinates.\n4.  Calculate the relative offset (row\\_offset, col\\_offset) of the gray pixel within the pattern object with respect to the pattern object's top-left corner.\n5.  Calculate the target top-left corner coordinates for the copied object by subtracting the relative offset from the marker pixel's coordinates:\n    *   `copy_row = marker_row - row_offset`\n    *   `copy_col = marker_col - col_offset`\n6.  Iterate through each pixel (`pixel_color`) of the original pattern object at its relative position (`rel_row`, `rel_col`) within its bounding box.\n7.  Determine the corresponding absolute coordinates (`target_row`, `target_col`) in the output grid where this pixel should be copied:\n    *   `target_row = copy_row + rel_row`\n    *   `target_col = copy_col + rel_col`\n8.  Check if the current relative position (`rel_row`, `rel_col`) matches the relative offset (`row_offset`, `col_offset`) of the gray pixel found in step 4.\n9.  If it matches, set the pixel color at (`target_row`, `target_col`) in the output grid to white (0).\n10. If it does not match, set the pixel color at (`target_row`, `target_col`) in the output grid to the `pixel_color` from the original pattern object. Ensure this write operation stays within the grid boundaries."
