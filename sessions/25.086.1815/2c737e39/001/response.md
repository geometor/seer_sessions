"""
Identifies two key structures in the input grid: a multi-pixel, potentially multi-color 'pattern object' containing at least one gray (5) pixel, and a single, isolated gray (5) 'marker pixel'.
The transformation copies the input grid to the output grid, then overlays a modified version of the 'pattern object' onto the output grid.
The position of this overlay is determined by the 'marker pixel'. Specifically, the location of the gray pixel *within* the original pattern object is mapped to the location of the marker pixel in the input grid.
The copied pattern object is identical to the original, except the gray pixel corresponding to the one in the original pattern object is replaced with a white (0) pixel.
