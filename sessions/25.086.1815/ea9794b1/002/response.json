            "text": "**Correction**: My manual check for Ex1, (0,2) was wrong. The input BR pixel is `input_np[5, 7]` which is 8, not 0.\nLet me re-evaluate:\nEx1, (0,2): Inputs (TL=4, TR=0, BL=0, BR=8). Expected Output=4.\nEx1, (1,1): Inputs (TL=4, TR=0, BL=0, BR=8). Expected Output=8.\nThe code output confirms these inputs yield different outputs in Ex1.\n\nEx2 also has a case with inputs (4, 0, 0, 8) at coords (4, 2), and the output is 8.\nEx2, (4,2): Inputs (TL=4, TR=0, BL=0, BR=8). Expected Output=8.\n\nSo we have:\n- Ex1, (0,2): Input (4,0,0,8) -> Output 4\n- Ex1, (1,1): Input (4,0,0,8) -> Output 8\n- Ex2, (4,2): Input (4,0,0,8) -> Output 8\n\nThis strongly suggests either:\na) A typo in Ex1, specifically at Output(0,2). Maybe it should be 8?\nb) A dependency on the coordinate (r, c).\n\nLet's hypothesize that Output(0,2) in Ex1 is a typo and *should* be 8.\nIf `Input(4,0,0,8) -> Output 8`, what's the rule?\nLet's test the priority BR -> BL -> TL -> TR (non-white only).\n- Case (4,0,0,8): BR=8 (non-white). Use 8. Matches hypothetical corrected Ex1(0,2), Ex1(1,1), Ex2(4,2).\nLet's test other cases with this rule.\n- Case (0,0,0,0): BR=0. BL=0. TL=0. TR=0. Use 0. Matches Ex1(0,0).\n- Case (4,0,9,0): BR=0. BL=9 (non-white). Use 9. Matches Ex1(0,1).\n- Case (0,0,9,0): BR=0. BL=9 (non-white). Use 9. Matches Ex2(0,0).\n- Case (4,0,0,0): BR=0. BL=0. TL=4 (non-white). Use 4. Matches Ex2(0,1).\n- Case (0,0,9,8): BR=8 (non-white). Use 8. Output=9 in Ex2(0,2). Doesn't match.\n\nHypothesis BR -> BL -> TL -> TR fails.\n\nLet's try priority BL -> BR -> TL -> TR (non-white only). (This was close to the original code, but the original code used TR regardless if others were white).\n- Case (4,0,0,8): BL=0. BR=8 (non-white). Use 8. Matches hypothetical corrected Ex1(0,2), Ex1(1,1), Ex2(4,2).\n- Case (0,0,0,0): BL=0. BR=0. TL=0. TR=0. Use 0. Matches Ex1(0,0).\n- Case (4,0,9,0): BL=9 (non-white). Use 9. Matches Ex1(0,1).\n- Case (0,0,9,0): BL=9 (non-white). Use 9. Matches Ex2(0,0).\n- Case (4,0,0,0): BL=0. BR=0. TL=4 (non-white). Use 4. Matches Ex2(0,1).\n- Case (0,0,9,8): BL=9 (non-white). Use 9. Matches Ex2(0,2).\n- Case (0,0,0,8): BL=0. BR=8 (non-white). Use 8. Matches Ex2(0,3).\n- Case (4,3,9,0): BL=9 (non-white). Use 9. Output=3 in Ex2(0,4). Doesn't match.\n\nHypothesis BL -> BR -> TL -> TR fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the original Ex1(0,2) which was (4,0,0,8) -> 4.\nLet's try TL -> TR -> BL -> BR (non-white only).\n- Case (4,0,0,8): TL=4 (non-white). Use 4. Matches Ex1(0,2).\n- Case (4,0,0,8): TL=4 (non-white). Use 4. Output=8 in Ex1(1,1). Doesn't match.\n\nThis coordinate dependence is very confusing if true. Let's assume Ex1(0,2) is the outlier/typo. The most consistent behaviour seems to be linked to `BL -> BR -> TL -> TR` or `BR -> BL -> ...`.\n\nLet's re-examine Ex2(0,4): Inputs (4,3,9,0) -> Output 3.\nRule `BL -> BR -> TL -> TR`: BL=9. Use 9. Fails.\nRule `BR -> BL -> TL -> TR`: BR=0. BL=9. Use 9. Fails.\nRule `TL -> TR -> BL -> BR`: TL=4. Use 4. Fails.\nRule `TR -> TL -> BL -> BR`: TR=3. Use 3. Matches!\n\nLet's test `TR -> TL -> BL -> BR` (non-white only, else white) hypothesis.\n- Case (4,0,0,8) -> Output 8 (hypothetical Ex1(0,2), Ex1(1,1), Ex2(4,2)): TR=0. TL=4. Use 4. Fails.\n\nOkay, none of the simple quadrant priorities work consistently even if we assume Ex1(0,2) is a typo.\n\nWhat if the rule is: Count non-white pixels. If count is 1, use that pixel's color. If count > 1, use a specific priority?\nCount=0: `(0,0,0,0)` -> 0. Output=0. (Ex1(0,0))\nCount=1:\n  `(4,0,0,0)` -> 4. Output=4. (Ex2(0,1))\n  `(0,0,0,8)` -> 8. Output=8.

Expected=3. TR=3. Matches.\n  `(0,3,9,8)` -> 3. Colors={3,9,8}. Output=3 (TR). (Ex1(4,1))\n  `(0,3,0,8)` -> 3. Colors={3,8}. Count=2. Output=3 (TR). (Ex1(1,2), Ex1(2,2))\n  `(4,3,9,8)` -> 3.

(Ex1(2,3))\n\nSummary of findings:\n- If 0 non-white pixels -> Output 0.\n- If 1 non-white pixel -> Output is that pixel's color.\n- If >1 non-white pixels:\n    - (4,0,9,0) -> 9 (BL)\n    - (4,0,0,8) -> 4 (TL) *OR* 8 (BR) --- CONFLICT ---\n    - (0,0,9,8) -> 9 (BL)\n    - (0,3,9,0) -> 3 (TR)\n    - (4,3,9,0) -> 3 (TR)\n    - (0,3,9,8) -> 3 (TR)\n    - (0,3,0,8) -> 3 (TR)\n    - (4,3,9,8) -> 3 (TR)\n\nIt seems TR has a very high priority when multiple pixels are present, *except* when BL=9 is present? Or when the combination is (4,0,0,8)?\n\nLet's re-examine the conflict: (4,0,0,8) -> 4 (at 0,2) vs 8 (at 1,1 and 4,2).\nIf we ignore Ex1(0,2) and assume (4,0,0,8) -> 8 (BR).\n\nRevised rules for Count > 1:\n- If TR != 0, Output = TR ?\n  - (0,3,9,0) -> 3. Matches.\n  - (4,3,9,0) -> 3. Matches.\n  - (0,3,9,8) -> 3. Matches.\n  - (0,3,0,8) -> 3. Matches.\n  - (4,3,9,8) -> 3.

Ex2(2,0): TL=0,TR=0,BL=9,BR=0 -> Output=9 (BL). Fits.\n  - (4,0,0,0) -> 4 (TL) (Count=1 case, already covered)\n  - (0,0,0,8) -> 8 (BR) (Count=1 case, already covered)\n  - What is the priority between TL, BL, BR when TR=0?\n    - Cases with BL=9: (4,0,9,0)->9; (0,0,9,8)->9; (0,0,9,0)->9. Seems like BL=9 wins?\n    - Case without BL=9: (4,0,0,8)->8. BR wins over TL.\n\nTentative Hypothesis:\n1. Get the four corresponding pixels: TL, TR, BL, BR.\n2. Count non-white pixels (Count).\n3. If Count == 0, Output is 0.\n4. If Count == 1, Output is the non-white pixel color.\n5. If Count > 1:\n   a. If TR != 0, Output is TR.\n   b. If TR == 0:\n      i. If BL == 9, Output is 9.\n      ii. Else if BR != 0, Output is BR.\n      iii. Else (only TL must be non-white, but Count > 1 implies this isn't possible if TR=0, BL!=9, BR=0), Output is TL. (Let's refine this: If TR=0 and BL!=9: check BR. If BR !=0, use BR. If BR==0, use BL (if non-zero). If BL also zero, use TL.)\n\nLet's try again for Count > 1:\n5. If Count > 1:\n   a.

(This case implies TL is the only non-white one, contradicting Count > 1)\n\nLet's re-state 5b:\n   b. Else (TR == 0): Use priority BL (if 9) -> BR -> BL -> TL among the non-white pixels.\n      i. Check BL: if BL == 9, output 9.\n      ii. Else check BR: if BR != 0, output BR.\n      iii. Else check BL: if BL != 0, output BL.\n      iv. Else check TL: if TL != 0, output TL.\n      v. Else output 0 (This shouldn't be reached if Count > 1 and TR=0).\n\nLet's test this consolidated hypothesis:\nRule: Priority TR -> BL(9) -> BR -> BL -> TL (only consider non-white, if all white, output 0)\n\n1.  `TR != 0`: Output = TR.\n    - (0,3,9,0) -> 3. Matches.\n    - (4,3,9,0) -> 3. Matches.\n    - (0,3,9,8) -> 3. Matches.\n    - (0,3,0,8) -> 3. Matches.\n    - (4,3,9,8) -> 3. Matches.\n2.  `TR == 0`:\n    - Check BL==9:\n        - (4,0,9,0) -> 9. Matches.\n        - (0,0,9,8) -> 9. Matches.\n        - (0,0,9,0) -> 9. Matches.\n    - Else (TR=0, BL!=9), check BR != 0:\n        - (4,0,0,8) -> 8. Matches (assuming Ex1(0,2) is typo).\n        - (0,0,0,8) -> 8. Matches (Count=1 case, covered by this too).\n    - Else (TR=0, BL!=9, BR=0), check BL != 0:\n        - (Need example with TR=0, BL!=0, BL!=9, BR=0. Maybe `(4,0,2,0)`? None found readily).\n    - Else (TR=0, BL!=9, BR=0, BL=0), check TL != 0:\n        - (4,0,0,0) -> 4. Matches (Count=1 case, covered by this too).\n    - Else (all are 0):\n        - (0,0,0,0) -> 0. Matches.\n\nThis rule seems consistent across all tested points, *assuming Output(0,2) in Example 1 should be 8 instead of 4*.\n\nLet's write down the metrics and facts based on this hypothesis.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code implemented a quadrant overlay logic based on the first example (`BL -> BR -> TL -> TR`, using the first non-white pixel, with a special case for TR). However, testing revealed this logic fails on all examples, including the first one upon closer inspection of the expected vs. transformed outputs.\n\nThe core issue seems to be that the initial hypothesis derived from a single example was incorrect. Analysis of multiple examples, including contradictory cases within Example 1 (specifically pixels `(0,2)` and `(1,1)` having identical input combinations but different outputs), suggests either a complex rule or a potential typo in the examples.\n\nAssuming the contradiction in Example 1 at output coordinate `(0,2)` is a typo (i.e., `Output(0,2)` should be 8, not 4), a revised hypothesis involving a specific priority order among the four corresponding input pixels seems plausible and consistent with the other examples examined.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-analyze the relationship between the four input pixels (TL, TR, BL, BR) and the corresponding output pixel across all examples.\n2.  Assume `Example 1, Output(0,2)` is a typo and should be 8.\n3.  Develop a priority rule based on this assumption that explains the observed transformations.\n4.  Formulate a new natural language program based on this revised rule.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nUsing the provided `tool_code` and inspection, we gathered data points mapping the four input quadrant pixels to the output pixel for various coordinates across examples.\n\n**Key Data Points:**\n\n| Example | Coords | TL | TR | BL | BR | OUT | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ex1 | (0,0) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | All white |\n| Ex1 | (0,1) | 4 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 9 | BL=9 present |\n| Ex1 | (0,2) | 4 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 4 | **Conflict Point**.
