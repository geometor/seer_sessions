            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 10x10, while the output grids are 5x5.\n2.  **Quadrants:** The 10x10 input grid can be naturally divided into four 5x5 quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n3.  **Color Distribution:** Each quadrant in the input seems associated with a primary non-white color, though it also contains white (0) pixels:\n    *   TL: Primarily yellow (4)\n    *   TR: Primarily green (3)\n    *   BL: Primarily maroon (9)\n    *   BR: Primarily azure (8)\n4.  **Transformation:** The output 5x5 grid appears to be a composite of the four input quadrants. For each pixel position `(r, c)` in the output grid, the color seems to be determined by looking at the corresponding position `(r, c)` within each of the four input quadrants, following a specific priority order.\n5.  **Priority Rule:** By comparing input quadrants with the output grid across examples, a consistent pattern emerges. For a given output coordinate `(r, c)` (where `0 <= r < 5`, `0 <= c < 5`):\n    *   Check the input grid at `(r + 5, c)` (BL quadrant). If the color is not white (0), use this color for the output pixel `(r, c)`.\n    *   If the BL pixel is white, check the input grid at `(r + 5, c + 5)` (BR quadrant). If the color is not white (0), use this color for the output pixel `(r, c)`.\n    *   If the BR pixel is white, check the input grid at `(r, c)` (TL quadrant). If the color is not white (0), use this color for the output pixel `(r, c)`.\n    *   If the TL pixel is white, check the input grid at `(r, c + 5)` (TR quadrant). If the color is not white (0), use this color for the output pixel `(r, c)`.\n    *   If all four corresponding pixels in the input quadrants are white (0), the output pixel `(r, c)` is also white (0).\n    *   This implies a priority order for non-white colors: BL > BR > TL > TR.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
