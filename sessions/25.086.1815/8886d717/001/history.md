*   **Perception:** The task involves modifying a grid based on local pixel interactions. I observe that the primary change involves the azure (color 8) pixels influencing their neighbors. Specifically, azure pixels seem to "spread" or "overwrite" adjacent orange (color 7) pixels under certain conditions. The other colors (red - 2, maroon - 9) do not seem to be directly affected or participate in this spreading action. The transformation rule appears consistent across all examples, focusing on the relationship between an azure pixel and the pixel immediately to its right.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Modify the grid by changing specific orange pixels to azure based on their left neighbor.
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions_preserved: true # Output grid has the same height and width as the input.
      - relevant_colors: [azure (8), orange (7)] # Colors directly involved in the transformation rule.
      - other_colors: [red (2), maroon (9)] # Colors present but not directly changed by the rule.
    transformation_rule:
      - type: conditional_pixel_change
      - condition:
          - target_pixel_color: orange (7)
          - neighbor_pixel_position: immediate left (column - 1, same row)
          - neighbor_pixel_color: azure (8)
      - action:
          - change target_pixel_color to: azure (8)
      - scope: applied iteratively to all pixels meeting the condition.
      - non_matching_pixels: remain unchanged.
    examples_analysis:
      - All examples consistently show azure (8) pixels changing their immediate right orange (7) neighbors into azure (8).
      - Pixels other than orange (7) to the right of an azure (8) are unaffected.
      - Orange (7) pixels not immediately to the right of an azure (8) are unaffected.
      - Pixels in the leftmost column cannot be changed by this rule as they have no left neighbor.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the grid.
    3.  Within each row, iterate through each column starting from the second column (index 1) up to the last column.
    4.  For the current cell at `(row, column)`, check the color of the cell immediately to its left, at `(row, column - 1)`.
    5.  If the left cell's color is azure (8) and the current cell's color is orange (7), change the color of the current cell in the output grid to azure (8).
    6.  Otherwise, the color of the current cell in the output grid remains unchanged from the input grid.
    7.  After checking all applicable cells, the resulting output grid represents the final transformation.
