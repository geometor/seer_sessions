I observe that the primary change involves the azure (color 8) pixels influencing their neighbors. Specifically, azure pixels seem to \"spread\" or \"overwrite\" adjacent orange (color 7) pixels under certain conditions. The other colors (red - 2, maroon - 9) do not seem to be directly affected or participate in this spreading action. The transformation rule appears consistent across all examples, focusing on the relationship between an azure pixel and the pixel immediately to its right.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
