Specifically, the center of the green cross appears to be exactly at the midpoint between the two blue pixels.\n5.  **Midpoint Calculation:** If the blue pixels are at coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2), the center of the green cross is located at ((row1 + row2) / 2, (col1 + col2) / 2). The examples provided result in integer coordinates for the midpoint.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The green cross is drawn onto the grid. It appears to overwrite any white pixels in its path. The examples do not show overlap with the original blue pixels, but the most likely rule is that the green pixels are added after the input is copied, potentially overwriting any color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
