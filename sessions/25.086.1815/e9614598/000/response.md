Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid:** The input is a grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and exactly two blue pixels (1).
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, but with the addition of a green (3) shape.
3.  **Added Shape:** The added shape is consistently a green '+' or cross shape, 3 pixels high and 3 pixels wide.
4.  **Relationship:** The position of the green cross in the output grid seems directly related to the positions of the two blue pixels in the input grid. Specifically, the center of the green cross appears to be exactly at the midpoint between the two blue pixels.
5.  **Midpoint Calculation:** If the blue pixels are at coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2), the center of the green cross is located at ((row1 + row2) / 2, (col1 + col2) / 2). The examples provided result in integer coordinates for the midpoint.
6.  **Overwriting:** The green cross is drawn onto the grid. It appears to overwrite any white pixels in its path. The examples do not show overlap with the original blue pixels, but the most likely rule is that the green pixels are added after the input is copied, potentially overwriting any color.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors represented by integers 0-9.
    properties:
      - size: Variable height and width (up to 30x30).
      - background_color: Primarily white (0).

input_specifics:
  - object: blue_pixel
    count: 2
    color: 1 (blue)
    properties:
      - role: Marker points defining a location.
      - coordinates: (r1, c1), (r2, c2)

output_specifics:
  - object: blue_pixel
    count: 2
    color: 1 (blue)
    properties:
      - Unchanged from input. Position preserved.
  - object: green_cross
    color: 3 (green)
    shape: '+' sign (plus)
    size: 3x3 pixels (center pixel plus 4 orthogonal neighbors)
    properties:
      - Added to the input grid.
      - location: Centered at the midpoint between the two input blue pixels.

transformation:
  - action: identify_markers
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: coordinates of the two blue pixels [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]
  - action: calculate_midpoint
    inputs: coordinates [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]
    outputs: midpoint_coordinates (r_mid, c_mid)
    logic: r_mid = (r1 + r2) / 2, c_mid = (c1 + c2) / 2 (using integer division)
  - action: copy_grid
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: output_grid_base
  - action: draw_cross
    inputs:
      - output_grid_base
      - midpoint_coordinates (r_mid, c_mid)
      - color: 3 (green)
    outputs: final_output_grid
    logic: Change the color of the pixel at (r_mid, c_mid) and its four orthogonal neighbors (r_mid-1, c_mid), (r_mid+1, c_mid), (r_mid, c_mid-1), (r_mid, c_mid+1) to green (3). Overwrite existing colors if necessary.

relationships:
  - The location of the green_cross is determined solely by the locations of the two blue_pixels in the input.
  - The center of the green_cross is the geometric midpoint between the two blue_pixels.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the coordinates (row1, col1) and (row2, col2) of the two blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
3.  Calculate the midpoint coordinates (mid_row, mid_col) using integer division: `mid_row = (row1 + row2) // 2`, `mid_col = (col1 + col2) // 2`.
4.  Identify the five pixel locations that form the cross shape centered at (mid_row, mid_col):
    *   Center: (mid_row, mid_col)
    *   Top: (mid_row - 1, mid_col)
    *   Bottom: (mid_row + 1, mid_col)
    *   Left: (mid_row, mid_col - 1)
    *   Right: (mid_row, mid_col + 1)
5.  For each of these five locations, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to green (3). Ensure these locations are within the grid boundaries before changing the color.
