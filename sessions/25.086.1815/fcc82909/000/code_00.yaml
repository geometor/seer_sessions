Observations:
  - Grid_Structure: 2D array of integers (0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
      - Type: Contiguous 2x2 blocks.
      - Property: All four pixels within the block must be non-white (> 0).
  - Transformation: Addition of new pixels.
  - Added_Pixels:
      - Color: Green (3).
      - Shape: Form 2x2 blocks.
  - Relationship_Input_Output:
      - Preservation: Original non-white 2x2 blocks from input are preserved in the output.
      - Addition: For each input 2x2 non-white block located with its top-left corner at (row `r`, column `c`).
      - Placement: A new 2x2 block of green pixels is added to the output grid with its top-left corner at (row `r+2`, column `c`).
      - Overwriting: The new green blocks overwrite existing pixels (which are white background pixels in the examples) at their target locations.
