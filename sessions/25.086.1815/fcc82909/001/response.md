"""
Identifies all 2x2 blocks in the input grid where all four pixels are non-white (value > 0).
For each such block found with its top-left corner at (r, c), adds a 2x2 block of green pixels (value 3)
to the output grid, starting at position (r+2, c), provided this position is within the grid bounds.
The original grid content is preserved, except where overwritten by the new green blocks.
