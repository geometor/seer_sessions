Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of pixels, represented by numbers 0-9. The background is white (0).
2.  **Objects:** The prominent objects in the input grids appear to be 2x2 blocks where all four pixels are non-white (have values 1-9).
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding new pixels. Specifically, green pixels (value 3) are added to the grid.
4.  **Placement of New Pixels:** The green pixels always form new 2x2 blocks. These green blocks appear directly underneath the original 2x2 non-white blocks found in the input.
5.  **Consistency:** In all three examples, for every 2x2 block composed entirely of non-white pixels in the input, a corresponding 2x2 block of green pixels is placed exactly two rows below it, aligned in the same columns, in the output grid. The original non-white blocks remain unchanged in the output. The green blocks overwrite the white background pixels beneath the original blocks.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Observations:
  - Grid_Structure: 2D array of integers (0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Objects:
      - Type: Contiguous 2x2 blocks.
      - Property: All four pixels within the block must be non-white (> 0).
  - Transformation: Addition of new pixels.
  - Added_Pixels:
      - Color: Green (3).
      - Shape: Form 2x2 blocks.
  - Relationship_Input_Output:
      - Preservation: Original non-white 2x2 blocks from input are preserved in the output.
      - Addition: For each input 2x2 non-white block located with its top-left corner at (row `r`, column `c`).
      - Placement: A new 2x2 block of green pixels is added to the output grid with its top-left corner at (row `r+2`, column `c`).
      - Overwriting: The new green blocks overwrite existing pixels (which are white background pixels in the examples) at their target locations.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create the output grid by making an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all instances of 2x2 blocks where all four pixels have a color value greater than 0 (non-white).
3.  For each such 2x2 non-white block found:
    a.  Determine the row (`r`) and column (`c`) coordinates of its top-left pixel.
    b.  Calculate the target position for the new green block: top-left corner at (`r + 2`, `c`).
    c.  Verify that the target position (`r+2`, `c`) and the diagonally opposite corner (`r+3`, `c+1`) are within the bounds of the grid dimensions.
    d.  If the target position is within bounds, change the color of the pixels in the output grid at positions (`r+2`, `c`), (`r+2`, `c+1`), (`r+3`, `c`), and (`r+3`, `c+1`) to green (3).
