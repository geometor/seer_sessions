            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Grids:** The input grids are predominantly white (0), with one or more isolated colored pixels. The colors observed are red (2) and sometimes blue (1).\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids are based on the input grids but with additional red (2) pixels. The original non-white pixels (red and blue) from the input seem to persist in the output unless overwritten by the rule (though in these examples, only white pixels are overwritten).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves the red pixel(s) in the input. Each initial red pixel acts as a starting point for generating a diagonal pattern of red pixels extending upwards and to the right.\n4.  **Pattern:** The pattern generated from a starting red pixel at `(r, c)` seems to involve coloring three specific locations relative to each point along a diagonal path: the point itself `(r, c)`, the point to its right `(r, c+1)`, and the point diagonally up-right from it `(r-1, c+1)`.\n5.  **Path Generation:** The path starts at the initial red pixel `(r0, c0)` and progresses step-by-step to `(r-1, c+1)` until the path coordinate goes out of the grid bounds (specifically, row becomes negative or column exceeds the grid width).\n6.  **Interaction with other colors:** The generation rule appears to only change white (0) pixels to red (2). Existing non-white pixels (like the blue pixels in examples 1 and 3) are not overwritten and remain in their original positions in the output grid. They also do not appear to block the *calculation* of the path or the potential locations for new red pixels, only the *placement* if the target pixel is non-white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
