Task: Recolor blue objects based on shape-matching with other objects.

Elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (variable height and width)
      - contains pixels with colors 0-9
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: Object
    properties:
      - consists of connected pixels of the same color (non-white)
      - has a specific shape (relative pixel coordinates)
      - has a color
      - has a location (e.g., bounding box or centroid)
    subtypes:
      - Blue_Object: Objects with color blue (1). These are targets for recoloring.
      - Non_Blue_Object: Objects with colors other than blue (1) or white (0). These provide the target colors and shapes.

Relationships:
  - Shape_Matching: A Blue_Object can have the same shape as a Non_Blue_Object.
  - Color_Source: Non_Blue_Objects act as sources for the new colors applied to Blue_Objects.

Actions:
  - Identify_Objects: Find all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Categorize_Objects: Separate objects into Blue_Objects and Non_Blue_Objects.
  - Determine_Shape: Define the shape of each object (e.g., as a set of relative pixel coordinates).
  - Build_Shape_Color_Map: Create a mapping from shape to color based on Non_Blue_Objects. If multiple Non_Blue_Objects have the same shape, the color of the object encountered last (e.g., scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is used for that shape.
  - Match_and_Assign:
    - Iterate through Blue_Objects.
    - If a Blue_Object's shape exists in the Shape_Color_Map, assign the corresponding color to the Blue_Object and mark both the object and the shape map entry as used.
  - Assign_Remainder: If exactly one Blue_Object remains unassigned and exactly one color from the original set of Non_Blue_Object colors remains unused, assign that remaining color to the remaining Blue_Object.
  - Recolor_Grid: Update the grid by changing the color of the pixels belonging to the assigned Blue_Objects.

Result:
  - The output grid reflects the input grid with the specified Blue_Objects recolored according to the derived rules. Non_Blue_Objects and the background remain unchanged.
