Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

### Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (0-9).
2.  **Background:** The background color is white (0) and remains unchanged.
3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.
4.  **Color Focus:** The transformation specifically targets objects colored blue (1). Other colored objects seem to remain in their original positions and retain their original colors.
5.  **Transformation:** Blue objects change their color. The new color assigned to a blue object appears to be derived from the color of a non-blue object present in the *input* grid.
6.  **Shape Matching:** The core logic seems to involve matching the *shape* of a blue object to the shape of a non-blue object. When a match is found, the blue object adopts the color of the matched non-blue object.
7.  **Handling Multiple Matches/Conflicts:**
    *   In Example 3, there are two non-blue objects (Green Plus, Orange Plus) that have the same shape as a blue object (Blue Plus). The Blue Plus takes the color Orange (7). The Orange Plus object appears later in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan than the Green Plus object. This suggests a priority rule based on object position (last found takes precedence).
    *   Also in Example 3, one blue object (a 'T' or arrow shape) doesn't have an exact shape match among the non-blue objects. However, it changes color to Green (3). After the other blue objects are assigned colors based on shape matches (Plus->Orange, Dot->Magenta, L->Maroon), Green is the only remaining color from the initial set of non-blue object colors, and the T/Arrow is the only remaining blue object. This suggests a fallback rule: if exactly one blue object and one non-blue color remain unassigned after shape matching, they are paired.
8.  **Object Definition:** An object is a connected component of pixels of the same color (using 4-way or 8-way adjacency - typically 8-way in ARC). Its shape can be defined by the relative positions of its pixels.

### Facts


```yaml
Task: Recolor blue objects based on shape-matching with other objects.

Elements:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions (variable height and width)
      - contains pixels with colors 0-9
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row, column)
  - type: Object
    properties:
      - consists of connected pixels of the same color (non-white)
      - has a specific shape (relative pixel coordinates)
      - has a color
      - has a location (e.g., bounding box or centroid)
    subtypes:
      - Blue_Object: Objects with color blue (1). These are targets for recoloring.
      - Non_Blue_Object: Objects with colors other than blue (1) or white (0). These provide the target colors and shapes.

Relationships:
  - Shape_Matching: A Blue_Object can have the same shape as a Non_Blue_Object.
  - Color_Source: Non_Blue_Objects act as sources for the new colors applied to Blue_Objects.

Actions:
  - Identify_Objects: Find all connected components of non-white pixels in the input grid.
  - Categorize_Objects: Separate objects into Blue_Objects and Non_Blue_Objects.
  - Determine_Shape: Define the shape of each object (e.g., as a set of relative pixel coordinates).
  - Build_Shape_Color_Map: Create a mapping from shape to color based on Non_Blue_Objects. If multiple Non_Blue_Objects have the same shape, the color of the object encountered last (e.g., scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) is used for that shape.
  - Match_and_Assign:
    - Iterate through Blue_Objects.
    - If a Blue_Object's shape exists in the Shape_Color_Map, assign the corresponding color to the Blue_Object and mark both the object and the shape map entry as used.
  - Assign_Remainder: If exactly one Blue_Object remains unassigned and exactly one color from the original set of Non_Blue_Object colors remains unused, assign that remaining color to the remaining Blue_Object.
  - Recolor_Grid: Update the grid by changing the color of the pixels belonging to the assigned Blue_Objects.

Result:
  - The output grid reflects the input grid with the specified Blue_Objects recolored according to the derived rules. Non_Blue_Objects and the background remain unchanged.
```


### Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct, connected objects composed of non-white (0) pixels. Determine the color and shape (relative pixel coordinates) for each object.
2.  **Categorize Objects:** Separate the identified objects into two groups:
    *   `Blue_Objects`: Objects whose color is blue (1).
    *   `Non_Blue_Objects`: Objects whose color is not blue (1) and not white (0).
3.  **Create Target Shape-Color Mapping:**
    *   Initialize an empty map `Shape_To_Color_Map`.
    *   Initialize a set `Available_Non_Blue_Colors` with the colors of all `Non_Blue_Objects`.
    *   Iterate through the `Non_Blue_Objects` (e.g., in top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan order based on their top-left pixel). For each `Non_Blue_Object`, add or update an entry in `Shape_To_Color_Map` where the key is the object's shape and the value is the object's color. (This ensures that if multiple objects share a shape, the last one encountered dictates the color associated with that shape).
4.  **Match Blue Objects by Shape:**
    *   Initialize an empty list `Recolor_Assignments`.
    *   Create copies: `Unhandled_Blue_Objects` (copy of `Blue_Objects`) and `Available_Shapes` (copy of keys in `Shape_To_Color_Map`).
    *   Iterate through each `Blue_Object` in `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.
        *   If the `Blue_Object`'s shape exists in `Available_Shapes`:
            *   Get the corresponding `Target_Color` from `Shape_To_Color_Map`.
            *   Add a pair (`Blue_Object`, `Target_Color`) to `Recolor_Assignments`.
            *   Remove the `Blue_Object` from `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.
            *   Remove the shape from `Available_Shapes`.
5.  **Handle Remainder (If Necessary):**
    *   Count the number of objects remaining in `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.
    *   Determine the set of `Used_Colors` from `Recolor_Assignments`.
    *   Find the set of `Unused_Colors` by taking the difference between `Available_Non_Blue_Colors` and `Used_Colors`.
    *   If there is exactly one object left in `Unhandled_Blue_Objects` and exactly one color left in `Unused_Colors`:
        *   Add a pair (remaining `Blue_Object`, remaining `Unused_Color`) to `Recolor_Assignments`.
        *   Remove the `Blue_Object` from `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.
6.  **Generate Output Grid:**
    *   Create a copy of the input grid.
    *   For each pair (`Blue_Object`, `New_Color`) in `Recolor_Assignments`:
        *   For every pixel belonging to that `Blue_Object`, change its color in the copied grid to `New_Color`.
    *   The modified copied grid is the final output.
