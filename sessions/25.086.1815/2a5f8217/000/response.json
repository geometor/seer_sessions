            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (0-9).\n2.  **Background:** The background color is white (0) and remains unchanged.\n3.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color.\n4.  **Color Focus:** The transformation specifically targets objects colored blue (1). Other colored objects seem to remain in their original positions and retain their original colors.\n5.  **Transformation:** Blue objects change their color. The new color assigned to a blue object appears to be derived from the color of a non-blue object present in the *input* grid.\n6.  **Shape Matching:** The core logic seems to involve matching the *shape* of a blue object to the shape of a non-blue object. When a match is found, the blue object adopts the color of the matched non-blue object.\n7.  **Handling Multiple Matches/Conflicts:**\n    *   In Example 3, there are two non-blue objects (Green Plus, Orange Plus) that have the same shape as a blue object (Blue Plus). The Blue Plus takes the color Orange (7). The Orange Plus object appears later in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan than the Green Plus object. This suggests a priority rule based on object position (last found takes precedence).\n    *   Also in Example 3, one blue object (a 'T' or arrow shape) doesn't have an exact shape match among the non-blue objects. However, it changes color to Green (3). After the other blue objects are assigned colors based on shape matches (Plus->Orange, Dot->Magenta, L->Maroon), Green is the only remaining color from the initial set of non-blue object colors, and the T/Arrow is the only remaining blue object. This suggests a fallback rule: if exactly one blue object and one non-blue color remain unassigned after shape matching, they are paired.\n8.  **Object Definition:** An object is a connected component of pixels of the same color (using 4-way or 8-way adjacency - typically 8-way in ARC). Its shape can be defined by the relative positions of its pixels.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Determine the color and shape (relative pixel coordinates) for each object.\n2.  **Categorize Objects:** Separate the identified objects into two groups:\n    *   `Blue_Objects`: Objects whose color is blue (1).\n    *   `Non_Blue_Objects`: Objects whose color is not blue (1) and not white (0).\n3.  **Create Target Shape-Color Mapping:**\n    *   Initialize an empty map `Shape_To_Color_Map`.\n    *   Initialize a set `Available_Non_Blue_Colors` with the colors of all `Non_Blue_Objects`.\n    *   Iterate through the `Non_Blue_Objects` (e.g., in top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan order based on their top-left pixel). For each `Non_Blue_Object`, add or update an entry in `Shape_To_Color_Map` where the key is the object's shape and the value is the object's color. (This ensures that if multiple objects share a shape, the last one encountered dictates the color associated with that shape).\n4.  **Match Blue Objects by Shape:**\n    *   Initialize an empty list `Recolor_Assignments`.\n    *   Create copies: `Unhandled_Blue_Objects` (copy of `Blue_Objects`) and `Available_Shapes` (copy of keys in `Shape_To_Color_Map`).\n    *   Iterate through each `Blue_Object` in `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.\n        *   If the `Blue_Object`'s shape exists in `Available_Shapes`:\n            *   Get the corresponding `Target_Color` from `Shape_To_Color_Map`.\n            *   Add a pair (`Blue_Object`, `Target_Color`) to `Recolor_Assignments`.\n            *   Remove the `Blue_Object` from `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.\n            *   Remove the shape from `Available_Shapes`.\n5.  **Handle Remainder (If Necessary):**\n    *   Count the number of objects remaining in `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.\n    *   Determine the set of `Used_Colors` from `Recolor_Assignments`.\n    *   Find the set of `Unused_Colors` by taking the difference between `Available_Non_Blue_Colors` and `Used_Colors`.\n    *   If there is exactly one object left in `Unhandled_Blue_Objects` and exactly one color left in `Unused_Colors`:\n        *   Add a pair (remaining `Blue_Object`, remaining `Unused_Color`) to `Recolor_Assignments`.\n        *   Remove the `Blue_Object` from `Unhandled_Blue_Objects`.\n6.  **Generate Output Grid:**\n    *   Create a copy of the input grid.\n    *   For each pair (`Blue_Object`, `New_Color`) in `Recolor_Assignments`:\n        *   For every pixel belonging to that `Blue_Object`, change its color in the copied grid to `New_Color`.\n    *   The modified copied grid is the final output."
