The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. White pixels remain unchanged. Gray pixels in the input are transformed into either blue or red pixels in the output.\n3.  **Objects:** The gray pixels in the input form distinct contiguous objects (connected horizontally or vertically). Each gray object in the input corresponds to a uniformly colored object (either all blue or all red) in the output, occupying the exact same positions.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core task is to determine the rule that decides whether a gray object becomes blue or red. Analyzing the examples reveals a pattern related to the size (number of pixels) of each gray object.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n*   **Train 1:** Objects of size 5, 4, 2, 4 become blue (1). Objects of size 6, 6 become red (2).\n*   **Train 2:** Objects of size 6, 6 become red (2). Object of size 5 becomes blue (1).\n*   **Train 3:** Objects of size 7, 4, 3, 2, 7 become blue (1). Objects of size 6, 6 become red (2).\n\n**Conclusion:** Across all examples, gray objects with exactly 6 pixels are consistently transformed into red (2) objects. All other gray objects (sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 in the examples) are transformed into blue (1) objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
