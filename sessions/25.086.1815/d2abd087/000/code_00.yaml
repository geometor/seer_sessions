task_context:
  description: Transform gray objects in a grid based on their size.
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_preserved: True # Output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    - background_color: white (0) # Background color is white and remains unchanged.
input_elements:
  - element: object
    attributes:
      - color: gray (5)
      - structure: contiguous pixels (4-connectivity)
      - property: size (pixel count)
output_elements:
  - element: object
    attributes:
      - color: blue (1) or red (2)
      - structure: contiguous pixels (derived from input gray objects)
      - position: same as corresponding input gray object
transformation:
  actions:
    - identify_objects: Find all contiguous groups of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
    - analyze_objects:
        - for each gray object:
            - calculate: size (number of pixels)
    - recolor_objects:
        - based_on: size
        - rule:
            - condition: if size == 6
              action: change object color to red (2)
            - condition: if size != 6
              action: change object color to blue (1)
  unchanged_elements:
    - white (0) pixels remain white (0).
