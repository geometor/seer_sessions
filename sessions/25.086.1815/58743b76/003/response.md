"""
The transformation rule identifies a 2x2 key block of colors, typically located near a corner, distinct from the background (usually white 0) and a potential border (usually azure 8). It also identifies a single 'target' color present elsewhere in the grid (excluding background, border, and key). The rule then divides the bounding box of all target color pixels into four quadrants based on its center. Each target color pixel *that is not part of the key* is then replaced by one of the four key colors, depending on which quadrant the pixel falls into: top-left quadrant maps to the top-left key color, top-right quadrant to top-right key color, bottom-left quadrant to bottom-left key color, and bottom-right quadrant to bottom-right key color. Other pixels (background, border, key pixels, and any target color pixels outside the bounding box if any existed) remain unchanged.
