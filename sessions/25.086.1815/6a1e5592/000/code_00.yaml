# Color transformations
color_map:
  input: [0, 2, 5]  # white, red, gray
  output: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red

color_rules:
  - color: red (2)
    input_state: present
    output_state: preserved # Remains red (2) in the same location.
  - color: gray (5)
    input_state: present
    output_state: changed   # Changes to white (0).
  - color: white (0)
    input_state: present
    output_state: conditional_change # Can change to blue (1) or remain white (0).

# Conditions for white (0) transformation
white_to_blue_condition:
  type: adjacency
  target_color: red (2)
  adjacency_type: [horizontal, vertical, diagonal] # 8 neighbors
  rule: If an input white (0) pixel has at least one red (2) neighbor, it becomes blue (1) in the output.

white_remains_white_condition:
  type: adjacency
  target_color: red (2)
  adjacency_type: [horizontal, vertical, diagonal] # 8 neighbors
  rule: If an input white (0) pixel has no red (2) neighbors, it remains white (0) in the output.

# Objects/Structures - Less critical for this rule but observable
objects:
  - type: border
    color: red (2)
    location: top row (consistent)
  - type: distinct_shapes
    color: red (2)
    location: upper/middle grid area
  - type: distinct_shapes
    color: gray (5)
    location: lower grid area
    output_behavior: removed (become white)
