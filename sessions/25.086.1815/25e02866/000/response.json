This background color does not appear in the output grids.\n2.  **Container Shapes:** In each input, there are multiple distinct rectangular objects made of the *same* color (green=3 in train_1, red=2 in train_2). These act as containers.\n3.  **Inner Content:** Some of these container shapes enclose pixels of different colors (blue=1 and magenta=6 within green=3 in train_1; blue=1, yellow=4, and green=3 within red=2 in train_2). These inner pixels form patterns or single points within their respective containers.\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output grid seems to be a composite image. Its size matches the dimensions of the *largest* container shape found in the input. The output grid is filled primarily with the color of the container shapes.\n5.  **Content Consolidation:** The inner content (pixels of different colors) from *all* the container shapes in the input is transferred onto the single output grid. The relative position of each inner content pixel *within its original container* is preserved in the output grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all distinct connected groups of pixels (objects) that are *not* the `background_color`.\n3.  Group these objects by their color.\n4.  Find the color group that contains multiple objects OR whose objects contain pixels of other colors within their bounds. This identifies the `container_color`.\n5.  Isolate all objects made of the `container_color`.\n6.  For each `container_color` object, determine its bounding box (minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, maximum column).\n7.  Find the container object with the largest bounding box (maximum height and width). Let the dimensions of this largest bounding box be `output_height` and `output_width`.\n8.  Create a new output grid of size `output_height` x `output_width`, filled entirely with the `container_color`.\n9.  Iterate through each `container_color` object identified in step 5:\n    a.  Get its bounding box (`min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row`, `max_col`).\n    b.  Iterate through all pixels `(r, c)` within this bounding box in the *input* grid (where `min_row <= r <= max_row` and `min_col <= c <= max_col`).\n    c.
