# Facts derived from analyzing the task examples

Task: Combine content from multiple containers into the largest one.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: The most frequent color in the grid, typically surrounding other objects.
  - Container_Objects:
    - Multiple connected components (objects) made of the same, non-background color.
    - Often rectangular in shape.
    - Can vary in size.
    - Act as containers for other pixels.
  - Inner_Content_Pixels:
    - Pixels located spatially within the bounding box of a Container_Object.
    - Have colors different from both the Container_Object's color and the Background_Color.
    - Their positions relative to their specific container are important.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - Dimensions: Match the height and width of the largest Container_Object found in the input.
  - Base_Color: Filled with the color of the Container_Objects from the input.
  - Combined_Content: Contains all Inner_Content_Pixels from *all* input Container_Objects, placed according to their original relative positions within their respective containers.

Relationships_Actions:
  - Identification: Identify the background color.
  - Filtering: Ignore the background color.
  - Grouping: Group remaining objects by color. Identify the color that forms multiple container objects ('container_color').
  - Measurement: Find the bounding box for each object of 'container_color'.
  - Comparison: Determine the container object with the largest bounding box (maximum height and width).
  - Extraction: For each container object, extract its inner content pixels and their relative coordinates (relative to the container's top-left corner).
  - Construction: Create a new grid with the dimensions of the largest container's bounding box, filled with 'container_color'.
  - Placement/Overlay: Place the extracted inner content pixels onto the new grid at their calculated relative coordinates.
