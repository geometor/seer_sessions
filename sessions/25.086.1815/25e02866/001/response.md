"""
Identifies the background color (most frequent) and container objects (multiple objects of the same color, distinct from the background).
Determines the largest container object by bounding box size.
Creates an output grid matching the dimensions of the largest container, filled with the container color.
Iterates through all container objects in the input. For each container, it identifies pixels within its bounding box that are neither the background color nor the container color.
These 'inner content' pixels are then placed onto the output grid at positions relative to the top-left corner of their original container.
The final output grid is a composite of the base container color and the overlaid inner content from all containers.
