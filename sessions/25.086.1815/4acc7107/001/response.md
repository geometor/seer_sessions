    Applies a gravity-like effect to non-white pixels within each column of the input grid.

    1. Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initialized 
       with the background color (white, 0).
    2. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
    3. For the current column, collect all non-white pixels from top to bottom, 
       preserving their original color and relative vertical order.
    4. Place these collected non-white pixels into the corresponding column of the 
       output grid, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, maintaining 
       their collected relative order.
    5. Fill the remaining cells above the placed pixels in that column with the 
       background color (white, 0) (this is handled by the initial zero-filling).
    6. Repeat for all columns.
    7. The resulting grid is the final output.
