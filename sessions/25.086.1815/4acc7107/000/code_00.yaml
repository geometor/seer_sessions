Context:
  - The task operates on a 2D grid of pixels.
  - Pixels have a color attribute (represented by integers 0-9).
  - Pixels at value 0 (white) represent the background.
  - Pixels with values 1-9 represent colored elements.

Objects:
  - Colored Objects: Contiguous blocks of pixels with the same non-zero color.
  - Individual Colored Pixels: Can be considered the fundamental units affected by the transformation.

Properties:
  - Position: Each pixel has a row and column index.
  - Color: Each pixel has a color value.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. (Relevant for object definition, but less so for the core transformation logic).
  - Vertical Stacking: In the output, colored pixels within the same column are stacked vertically from the bottom upwards.

Action:
  - Apply Gravity: Non-white pixels move downwards within their column.
  - Stop Condition: A pixel stops moving when it reaches the bottom row of the grid or the row immediately above another non-white pixel in the same column.

Constraints:
  - Movement is strictly vertical (within the same column).
  - The relative vertical order of pixels originating from the same column is preserved.
  - White pixels (0) are unaffected and act as empty space.
