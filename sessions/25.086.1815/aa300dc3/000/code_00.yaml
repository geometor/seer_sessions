Observations:
  Grid_Properties:
    - Size: 10x10 (constant across examples)
    - Colors_Input: [Gray (5), White (0)]
    - Colors_Output: [Gray (5), White (0), Azure (8)]
  Objects:
    - Type: Pixel
      Properties:
        - Color: Gray(5), White(0), Azure(8)
        - Position: (row, column)
    - Type: Region
      Subtype: Border (Gray pixels)
        - Location: Outermost row and column.
      Subtype: Obstacles (Gray pixels)
        - Location: Internal to the grid.
      Subtype: Open Area (White pixels)
        - Connectivity: Forms one or more connected components (usually one main area in examples).
    - Type: Line Segment (Azure pixels in output)
      Properties:
        - Shape: Straight (Diagonal or Anti-diagonal)
        - Composition: Consists only of pixels that were White in the input.
        - Relationship_to_White_Area: Represents the longest possible straight diagonal/anti-diagonal path within the White area.
  Transformation:
    - Action: Color Change
    - Input_Color: White (0)
    - Output_Color: Azure (8)
    - Condition: The White pixel must be part of the identified longest diagonal/anti-diagonal segment within the White area.
    - Unchanged: Gray (5) pixels and White (0) pixels not part of the longest segment remain unchanged.
