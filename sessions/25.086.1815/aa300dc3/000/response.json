The output uses gray (5), white (0), and azure (8).\n3.  **Structure:** The gray pixels form a fixed border (outermost rows/columns) and sometimes internal \"walls\" or obstacles. The white pixels represent an open area or path within these gray structures.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* of the white (0) pixels to azure (8). The gray (5) pixels and the remaining white (0) pixels are unchanged.\n5.  **Pattern:** The azure (8) pixels in the output always form a single, straight line segment. This segment can be diagonal (like `r=c+k`) or anti-diagonal (like `r+c=k`).\n6.  **Rule:** The specific line segment chosen appears to be the *longest possible* straight diagonal or anti-diagonal line that can be drawn consisting entirely of white pixels from the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify all locations `(r, c)` containing white pixels (value 0) in the input grid.\n3.  Search among these white pixel locations to find the longest possible contiguous straight line segment that follows either a diagonal (where the difference `r-c` is constant) or an anti-diagonal (where the sum `r+c` is constant).\n4.  Keep track of the coordinates of the pixels belonging to the longest such segment found.\n5.  Iterate through the coordinates identified in the previous step (the longest segment). For each coordinate `(r, c)` in this segment, change the pixel value at `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).\n6.  Return the modified output grid."
