Return the modified output grid.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully solves 3 out of 4 training examples. It correctly identifies contiguous diagonal or anti-diagonal segments of white pixels and colors the longest one azure.\n\nThe failure occurs in Example 2, where the transformed output highlights a different segment than the expected output. Both the expected segment and the segment chosen by the code have the same maximum length (7 pixels). This indicates that the core logic of finding segments is likely correct, but the tie-breaking rule implemented (implicitly keeping the first segment found with max length) is incorrect.\n\nAnalysis of Example 2 reveals three distinct anti-diagonal segments of the maximum length 7. The expected output corresponds to the segment starting at (1, 8). The current code's output corresponds to the segment starting at (2, 8) based on the execution result provided, although a manual trace suggested it should have picked (1,8) or (1,7) depending on iteration order. Re-running the analysis with code execution confirmed there were three segments of length 7, starting at (1,7), (1,8), and (2,8). Applying a tie-breaking rule of \"minimum starting row, then maximum starting column\" correctly selects the segment starting at (1,8), matching the expected output.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the segment selection process:\n1.  Find *all* maximal diagonal and anti-diagonal segments.\n2.  Determine the maximum length.\n3.  Filter segments to keep only those with maximum length.\n4.  Implement an explicit tie-breaking rule: select based on the minimum starting row index, and then by the maximum starting column index among those tied for the minimum row.\n\n## Metrics\n\nMetrics gathered for Example 2:\n"
