"""
Identify the longest contiguous straight line segment composed entirely of white (0) 
pixels. The line can be diagonal (top-left to bottom-right, r-c=const) or 
anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left, r+c=const). Change the color of the 
pixels belonging to this longest segment to azure (8). 

If multiple segments share the maximum length, select the one whose starting 
pixel (the pixel with the smallest row index in the segment) has the smallest 
row index. If there is still a tie (multiple segments start in the same minimum row), 
select the segment whose starting pixel has the largest column index.
