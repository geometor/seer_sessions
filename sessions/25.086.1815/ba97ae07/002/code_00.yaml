task_description: Overwrite parts of one object with the color of another object where they intersect.
grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 (white)
  num_non_background_colors: 2
objects:
  - id: Object A
    color: Color A (varies per example)
    shape_description: Contiguous block of Color A pixels. Appears as either a predominantly vertical or horizontal line/rectangle.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - height: bounding_box height
      - width: bounding_box width
      - orientation: Derived from height/width (Vertical if height > width or width=1; Horizontal if width > height or height=1)
  - id: Object B
    color: Color B (varies per example, different from Color A)
    shape_description: Contiguous block of Color B pixels. Appears as either a predominantly vertical or horizontal line/rectangle, with the opposite orientation to Object A.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)
      - height: bounding_box height
      - width: bounding_box width
      - orientation: Derived from height/width (Vertical if height > width or width=1; Horizontal if width > height or height=1)
relationships:
  - type: Intersection
    objects: [Object A, Object B]
    conditions: Pixels of Object A are adjacent (including diagonally) to pixels of Object B.
    location: Set of coordinates where adjacency occurs.
transformation:
  action: Modify Color
  input_object: The object identified as having a 'Vertical' orientation.
  output_object: The object identified as having a 'Horizontal' orientation.
  rule: For every pixel belonging to the 'Vertical' object, if it has at least one neighbor (including diagonals) belonging to the 'Horizontal' object, change the pixel's color to the color of the 'Horizontal' object.
  unchanged: Pixels belonging to the 'Horizontal' object remain unchanged. Background pixels remain unchanged. Pixels of the 'Vertical' object not adjacent to the 'Horizontal' object remain unchanged.
