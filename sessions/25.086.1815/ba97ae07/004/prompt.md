Identify the two non-white colored objects in the input grid. Determine which object is primarily horizontal and which is primarily vertical based on their bounding box dimensions. Iterate through the pixels of the vertical object. If a pixel from the vertical object is adjacent (including diagonally) to any pixel from the horizontal object, change the color of that vertical object's pixel in the output grid to the color of the horizontal object.
