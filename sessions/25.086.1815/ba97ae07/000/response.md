Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels with different colors. The background is consistently white (0).
2.  **Key Elements:** In each input grid, there are exactly two distinct non-white colors forming two distinct objects (or potentially one object composed of two colors, though they appear separate except at intersections). One object tends to be oriented vertically, and the other horizontally.
3.  **Interaction:** The two colored objects intersect or touch each other.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation occurs specifically at the pixel(s) where the two colored objects meet or intersect. The color of the pixel(s) at the intersection point(s) changes.
5.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing inputs and outputs:
    *   In `train_1`, the pixel at (3, 2) is Orange (7) in the input, adjacent to Blue (1). In the output, it becomes Blue (1).
    *   In `train_2`, pixels at (3, 2) and (3, 3) are Blue (1) in the input, adjacent to Magenta (6). In the output, they become Magenta (6).
    *   In `train_3`, the pixel at (4, 1) is Green (3) in the input, adjacent to Red (2). In the output, it becomes Red (2).
    *   In `train_4`, pixels like (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), etc., are Azure (8) in the input, adjacent to Green (3). In the output, they become Green (3).
6.  **Conclusion:** The consistent pattern is: identify the pixels that belong to one non-white object but are adjacent (including diagonals) to the *other* non-white object. The color of these specific pixels is changed to the color of the adjacent, *different* non-white object.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
observations:
  - task_type: object_transformation
  - grid_properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions_vary: true
  - objects:
      - count: 2 (distinct non-white colors)
      - description: Two objects, each typically a contiguous or near-contiguous block of a single color. One object often oriented vertically, the other horizontally.
      - colors: Vary between examples, always two distinct non-white colors per example.
  - interaction:
      - type: adjacency / intersection
      - location: Pixels belonging to one object that are adjacent (including diagonal) to pixels of the other object.
  - transformation:
      - type: color_change
      - scope: applies only to pixels at the interaction points.
      - rule: A pixel belonging to object A, which is adjacent to object B, changes its color to the color of object B.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid (let them be Color A and Color B).
3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.
4.  Let the color of the current pixel be `CurrentColor = input[r][c]`.
5.  If `CurrentColor` is not white (i.e., it is either Color A or Color B):
    a.  Check all 8 neighbors (adjacent and diagonal) of the pixel `(r, c)`.
    b.  Search for a neighbor `(nr, nc)` whose color `NeighborColor = input[nr][nc]` is the *other* non-white color (i.e., `NeighborColor` is not white and `NeighborColor != CurrentColor`).
    c.  If such a neighbor is found:
        i.  This pixel `(r, c)` is an intersection point.
        ii. Update the color of the pixel in the output grid: `output[r][c] = NeighborColor`.
6.  Return the final output grid.
