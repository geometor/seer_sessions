observations:
  - task_type: object_transformation
  - grid_properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - dimensions_vary: true
  - objects:
      - count: 2 (distinct non-white colors)
      - description: Two objects, each typically a contiguous or near-contiguous block of a single color. One object often oriented vertically, the other horizontally.
      - colors: Vary between examples, always two distinct non-white colors per example.
  - interaction:
      - type: adjacency / intersection
      - location: Pixels belonging to one object that are adjacent (including diagonal) to pixels of the other object.
  - transformation:
      - type: color_change
      - scope: applies only to pixels at the interaction points.
      - rule: A pixel belonging to object A, which is adjacent to object B, changes its color to the color of object B.
