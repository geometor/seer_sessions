            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels with different colors. The background is consistently white (0).\n2.  **Key Elements:** In each input grid, there are exactly two distinct non-white colors forming two distinct objects (or potentially one object composed of two colors, though they appear separate except at intersections). One object tends to be oriented vertically, and the other horizontally.\n3.  **Interaction:** The two colored objects intersect or touch each other.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation occurs specifically at the pixel(s) where the two colored objects meet or intersect. The color of the pixel(s) at the intersection point(s) changes.\n5.  **Rule Discovery:** By comparing inputs and outputs:\n    *   In `train_1`, the pixel at (3, 2) is Orange (7) in the input, adjacent to Blue (1). In the output, it becomes Blue (1).\n    *   In `train_2`, pixels at (3, 2) and (3, 3) are Blue (1) in the input, adjacent to Magenta (6). In the output, they become Magenta (6).\n    *   In `train_3`, the pixel at (4, 1) is Green (3) in the input, adjacent to Red (2). In the output, it becomes Red (2).\n    *   In `train_4`, pixels like (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), etc., are Azure (8) in the input, adjacent to Green (3). In the output, they become Green (3).\n6.  **Conclusion:** The consistent pattern is: identify the pixels that belong to one non-white object but are adjacent (including diagonals) to the *other* non-white object. The color of these specific pixels is changed to the color of the adjacent, *different* non-white object.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
