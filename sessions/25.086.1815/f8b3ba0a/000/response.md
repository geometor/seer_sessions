**Perception**

The input consists of a grid with a white background (color 0) and several 2x1 horizontal rectangles of various colors (1-9). These rectangles are always separated by at least one row and one column of white pixels. The output is a vertical list (1D array) of color values.

The core task seems to involve analyzing the frequency of occurrence of the different colored rectangles within the input grid. Specifically, it identifies which color appears most often and then focuses on the remaining colors. The final output list represents these less frequent colors, ordered according to specific criteria related to their frequency and position in the grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
perception:
  input_grid:
    - background: white pixels (0)
    - objects:
        - type: rectangle
        - shape: 2x1 horizontal block
        - properties:
            - color: values 1-9
            - location: row, column coordinates
    - structure: rectangles separated by white pixels (rows and columns)
  output_grid:
    - type: 1D list (column vector)
    - content: color values (integers 1-9)

      description: Contiguous 2x1 horizontal blocks of pixels with the same non-white color.
      properties:
        - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in the rectangle.
        - count: The total number of rectangles of a specific color in the grid.
        - last_row: The maximum row index occupied by any part of any rectangle of a specific color.

      description: Comparing the counts of rectangles for different colors.
    - type: spatial_ordering
      description: Using the row index of the last appearance to order colors.
  actions:
    - identify_rectangles: Scan the grid to find all 2x1 horizontal non-white rectangles.
    - count_colors: Count the number of rectangles for each distinct color.
    - find_most_frequent: Determine the color associated with the maximum rectangle count.
    - filter_colors: Select all colors *except* the most frequent one.
    - determine_last_rows: For each selected color, find the maximum row index where a rectangle of that color appears.
    - sort_colors: Order the selected colors based on specific criteria.

transformation:
  rule: The output is a list of colors, excluding the most frequent color found in the input rectangles, sorted primarily by frequency (descending) and secondarily by the last row appearance (descending).
  sorting_criteria:
    - primary_key: rectangle_count (descending)
    - secondary_key: last_row_index (descending, used for tie-breaking counts)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Scan the input grid** to identify all distinct, non-white (color > 0), 2x1 horizontal rectangles.
2.  **Count the occurrences** of each distinct color present in these rectangles. Keep track of the color and its corresponding count (number of 2x1 rectangles).
3.  **Find the color** that has the highest count (the most frequent rectangle color).
4.  **Create a candidate list** containing all colors found in step 1, *excluding* the single most frequent color identified in step 3.
5.  **For each color in the candidate list**:
    *   Retrieve its count (calculated in step 2).
    *   Find the maximum row index (the bottom-most row) where any rectangle of this color appears in the input grid. Store this as the 'last row index' for the color.
6.  **Sort the candidate list** based on the following criteria:
    *   **Primary sort key:** Sort by the rectangle count in descending order (most frequent first).
    *   **Secondary sort key (tie-breaker):** If two colors have the same count, sort them by their 'last row index' in descending order (colors appearing lower in the grid come first).
7.  **Construct the output** as a vertical list (column vector) containing the sorted colors from step 6.
