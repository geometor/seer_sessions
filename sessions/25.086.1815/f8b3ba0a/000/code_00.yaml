perception:
  input_grid:
    - background: white pixels (0)
    - objects:
        - type: rectangle
        - shape: 2x1 horizontal block
        - properties:
            - color: values 1-9
            - location: row, column coordinates
    - structure: rectangles separated by white pixels (rows and columns)
  output_grid:
    - type: 1D list (column vector)
    - content: color values (integers 1-9)

analysis:
  objects:
    - id: colored_rectangles
      description: Contiguous 2x1 horizontal blocks of pixels with the same non-white color.
      properties:
        - color: The integer value (1-9) of the pixels in the rectangle.
        - count: The total number of rectangles of a specific color in the grid.
        - last_row: The maximum row index occupied by any part of any rectangle of a specific color.
  relationships:
    - type: frequency_comparison
      description: Comparing the counts of rectangles for different colors.
    - type: spatial_ordering
      description: Using the row index of the last appearance to order colors.
  actions:
    - identify_rectangles: Scan the grid to find all 2x1 horizontal non-white rectangles.
    - count_colors: Count the number of rectangles for each distinct color.
    - find_most_frequent: Determine the color associated with the maximum rectangle count.
    - filter_colors: Select all colors *except* the most frequent one.
    - determine_last_rows: For each selected color, find the maximum row index where a rectangle of that color appears.
    - sort_colors: Order the selected colors based on specific criteria.

transformation:
  rule: The output is a list of colors, excluding the most frequent color found in the input rectangles, sorted primarily by frequency (descending) and secondarily by the last row appearance (descending).
  sorting_criteria:
    - primary_key: rectangle_count (descending)
    - secondary_key: last_row_index (descending, used for tie-breaking counts)
