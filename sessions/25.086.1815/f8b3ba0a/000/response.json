These rectangles are always separated by at least one row and one column of white pixels. The output is a vertical list (1D array) of color values.\n\nThe core task seems to involve analyzing the frequency of occurrence of the different colored rectangles within the input grid. Specifically, it identifies which color appears most often and then focuses on the remaining colors. The final output list represents these less frequent colors, ordered according to specific criteria related to their frequency and position in the grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
