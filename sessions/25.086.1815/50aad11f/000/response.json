            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Contents:** The input grids contain scattered shapes made of magenta pixels (color 6) and a few isolated, non-magenta, non-white pixels. These isolated pixels act as \"markers\" or \"seeds\". The background is white (color 0).\n2.  **Marker Pixels:** In each example, there are 2 or 3 unique marker pixels with different colors (e.g., green (3) and red (2) in example 1; azure (8) and blue (1) in example 2; blue (1), green (3), and yellow (4) in example 3).\n3.  **Magenta Shapes:** The magenta pixels form distinct shapes, seemingly acting as templates. There are as many relevant magenta shapes as there are marker pixels in each input.\n4.  **Output Grid Contents:** The output grids contain shapes that visually match the magenta shapes from the input, but they are colored according to the marker pixels. The background is white (0).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the marker pixels and the magenta template shapes, associating each marker with a specific template, extracting the template shape, recoloring it with the marker's color, and arranging these recolored shapes in the output grid.\n6.  **Association:** The association between a marker pixel and a magenta shape appears to be based on proximity \u2013 each marker is associated with the spatially closest magenta shape.\n7.  **Extraction:** The associated magenta shape is extracted, likely within its minimal bounding box, preserving its internal structure relative to that box. The non-magenta pixels within the bounding box become white (0) in the extracted piece.\n8.  **Recoloring:** The extracted magenta pixels (6) are replaced with the color of the associated marker pixel.\n9.  **Arrangement:** The final arrangement (horizontal or vertical stacking) and order of the recolored shapes in the output grid depend on the relative positions of the original marker pixels in the input grid.\n    *   If the markers are spread more horizontally than vertically (comparing the range of their column indices vs. row indices), the shapes are arranged side-by-side (horizontally) in the output, ordered by the markers' column indices (left-to-right).\n    *   If the markers are spread more vertically than horizontally, the shapes are arranged one above the other (vertically) in the output, ordered by the markers' row indices (top-to-bottom).\n10. **Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are determined by the size of the extracted shapes and how they are arranged (stacked horizontally or vertically).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Record the color and position (row, column) of each marker pixel.\n2.  **Identify all distinct contiguous shapes** formed by magenta (6) pixels. These are the \"template shapes\". For each template shape, determine the set of coordinates it occupies.\n3.  **Associate each marker pixel with a template shape.** For each marker pixel, calculate the distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) from its position to every magenta pixel belonging to each template shape. Associate the marker pixel with the template shape that contains the closest magenta pixel. Ensure each marker is associated with one template shape.\n4.  **Process each marker-template pair:**\n    a.  Determine the minimal bounding box containing the associated template shape.\n    b.  Create a new, empty subgrid with the dimensions of this bounding box, filled with white (0).\n    c.  For each pixel within the bounding box of the template shape in the input grid: if the pixel belongs to the template shape (i.e., is magenta (6)), color the corresponding pixel in the new subgrid with the color of the associated marker pixel.\n    d.  Store this resulting colored subgrid (representing an \"output shape\") along with the position (row, column) of its associated marker pixel.\n5.  **Determine the arrangement strategy:**\n    a.  Consider the positions of all marker pixels identified in step 1.\n    b.  Calculate the range of row indices (`max_row - min_row`) and column indices (`max_col - min_col`) spanned by the marker pixels.\n    c.  If the column range is greater than the row range, the arrangement is **horizontal**.\n    d.  Otherwise (row range is greater than or equal to the column range), the arrangement is **vertical**.\n6.  **Assemble the output grid:**\n    a.  If the arrangement is **horizontal**:\n        i.  Sort the generated output shapes (from step 4d) based on the column index of their associated marker pixels in ascending order.\n        ii. Combine these sorted shapes by placing them side-by-side horizontally, aligned at the top, to form the final output grid.\n    b.  If the arrangement is **vertical**:\n        i.  Sort the generated output shapes based on the row index of their associated marker pixels in ascending order.\n        ii. Combine these sorted shapes by placing them one above the other vertically, aligned at the left edge, to form the final output grid.\n7.  **Return the assembled grid** as the final output."
