Objects:
  - type: Background
    color: white (0)
    role: Provides a canvas for other elements.
  - type: MarkerPixel
    properties:
      - color: Any color except white (0) and magenta (6).
      - count: Typically 2 or 3 per input grid.
      - spatial_role: Acts as a seed or identifier. Its color determines the output color, and its position influences association and final arrangement.
  - type: TemplateShape
    properties:
      - color: magenta (6)
      - structure: Contiguous blocks of pixels forming distinct shapes.
      - count: At least as many as MarkerPixels.
      - spatial_role: Provides the structural pattern for output shapes.
  - type: OutputShape
    properties:
      - color: Derived from an associated MarkerPixel's color.
      - structure: Derived from an associated TemplateShape's structure.
      - count: One for each MarkerPixel.
      - spatial_role: Constituent elements of the final output grid.

Relationships:
  - type: Association
    between: MarkerPixel, TemplateShape
    rule: Each MarkerPixel is associated with the spatially closest TemplateShape (e.g., based on minimum distance).
  - type: Derivation
    input: MarkerPixel, associated TemplateShape
    output: OutputShape
    rule: The OutputShape inherits its color from the MarkerPixel and its structure (within its bounding box) from the TemplateShape. Magenta pixels from the template become the marker's color; other pixels become white.
  - type: Arrangement
    based_on: Relative positions of MarkerPixels in the input grid.
    determines: The layout (horizontal or vertical stacking) and order of OutputShapes in the final output grid.
    rule:
      - Calculate row_range = max(marker_row) - min(marker_row).
      - Calculate col_range = max(marker_col) - min(marker_col).
      - If col_range > row_range: Arrange horizontally, ordered by marker column index.
      - Else (col_range <= row_range): Arrange vertically, ordered by marker row index.

Actions:
  - name: Identify
    target: MarkerPixels, TemplateShapes
    result: Lists of positions and colors (for markers), and pixel sets (for shapes).
  - name: Associate
    target: MarkerPixels, TemplateShapes
    rule: Calculate distances and find the closest pairs.
    result: Pairs of (MarkerPixel, TemplateShape).
  - name: Extract
    target: Associated TemplateShape
    result: A subgrid containing the shape within its minimal bounding box.
  - name: Recolor
    target: Extracted subgrid
    using: Color of the associated MarkerPixel
    rule: Replace magenta (6) pixels with the marker's color, other non-background pixels potentially become background (0).
    result: A colored OutputShape pattern.
  - name: ArrangeAndCombine
    target: Recolorored OutputShape patterns
    using: Arrangement rule derived from MarkerPixel positions.
    result: The final output grid.
