The rest of the input grid is white (0).\n    2.  Let the color of the line be `C` and its length be `N`. The width of the input grid is `W`.\n    3.  The output grid has the same width `W` as the input grid.\n    4.  The output grid contains pixels of color `C` interspersed with white (0) pixels.\n    5.  The pattern of `C` and `0` pixels in the output seems determined by the length `N`.\n    6.  A sequence of pixels is generated based on `N` and `C`. This sequence involves placing `k` pixels of color `C` followed by one white pixel (0), where `k` follows the pattern `1, 2, 3, ..., N, N-1, ..., 2, 1`.\n    7.  This generated sequence is then written into the output grid row by row, filling columns from left to right.\n    8.  The height of the output grid (`H`) is determined by the total length of the generated sequence and the width `W`. Specifically, `H` is the smallest integer such that `H * W` is greater than or equal to the sequence length.\n    9.  Any cells in the output grid not filled by the sequence are set to white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
