*   **Perception:**
    1.  Each input grid contains a single horizontal line of a non-white color starting at the top-left corner. The rest of the input grid is white (0).
    2.  Let the color of the line be `C` and its length be `N`. The width of the input grid is `W`.
    3.  The output grid has the same width `W` as the input grid.
    4.  The output grid contains pixels of color `C` interspersed with white (0) pixels.
    5.  The pattern of `C` and `0` pixels in the output seems determined by the length `N`.
    6.  A sequence of pixels is generated based on `N` and `C`. This sequence involves placing `k` pixels of color `C` followed by one white pixel (0), where `k` follows the pattern `1, 2, 3, ..., N, N-1, ..., 2, 1`.
    7.  This generated sequence is then written into the output grid row by row, filling columns from left to right.
    8.  The height of the output grid (`H`) is determined by the total length of the generated sequence and the width `W`. Specifically, `H` is the smallest integer such that `H * W` is greater than or equal to the sequence length.
    9.  Any cells in the output grid not filled by the sequence are set to white (0).

```yaml
    task_elements:
      - item: Input Grid
        properties:
          - Contains a single horizontal line of non-white pixels at the top-left.
          - The line has color C and length N.
          - The rest of the grid is white (0).
          - The grid has width W and height Hin.
      - item: Output Grid
        properties:
          - Has the same width W as the input grid.
          - Has height Hout, determined by the transformation.
          - Contains pixels of color C and white (0).
          - Filled based on a generated sequence.
          - Unfilled cells are white (0).
    parameters:
      - parameter: C
        description: The non-white color found in the input grid's top row.
      - parameter: N
        description: The number of consecutive pixels of color C in the input grid's top row, starting from the left.
      - parameter: W
        description: The width of the input and output grids.
    derived_sequences:
      - sequence: Skip Sequence (S)
        description: A sequence of integers [1, 2, ..., N, N-1, ..., 1]. If N=1, S=[1].
      - sequence: Pixel Sequence (P)
        description: Generated by iterating through the Skip Sequence S. For each number k in S, append k pixels of color C, followed by one white pixel (0).
    derived_dimensions:
      - dimension: Hout
        description: Output grid height. Calculated as ceil(length(P) / W).
    relationships:
      - The color C and length N are extracted from the input grid.
      - The Skip Sequence S is derived from N.
      - The Pixel Sequence P is derived from S and C.
      - The Output Grid dimensions (Hout, W) and content are derived from P and W.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single non-white color `C` present in the first row of the input grid.
    2.  Determine the length `N` of the continuous sequence of color `C` starting from the top-left corner (column 0) of the input grid.
    3.  Determine the width `W` of the input grid.
    4.  Generate a sequence of skip lengths `S`: start with 1, increment up to `N`, then decrement down to 1. (e.g., if `N=3`, `S = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`; if `N=1`, `S = [1]`).
    5.  Initialize an empty pixel sequence `P`.
    6.  For each skip length `k` in the sequence `S`:
        a.  Append `k` pixels of color `C` to the sequence `P`.
        b.  Append one pixel of white color (0) to the sequence `P`.
    7.  Calculate the required height `Hout` for the output grid: `Hout = ceiling(length(P) / W)`.
    8.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions `Hout` rows and `W` columns, initially filled with white (0).
    9.  Iterate through the generated pixel sequence `P` from beginning to end. For each pixel `p` at index `i` (0-based) in `P`:
        a.  Calculate the target row `r = floor(i / W)`.
        b.  Calculate the target column `c = i % W`.
        c.  Set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the value `p`.
    10. Return the generated output grid.
