Identify the non-white color C and its length N in the first row of the input grid.
Generate a 'skip sequence' S: [1, 2, ..., N, N-1, ..., 1].
Generate a 'pixel sequence' P: For each k in S, append k pixels of C, then one white (0) pixel.
Calculate the output grid height Hout based on the length of P and the input width W: Hout = ceil(len(P) / W).
Create an output grid of size Hout x W, initialized to white (0).
