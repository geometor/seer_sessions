"""
Identifies horizontal and vertical dividing lines of a unique color in the input grid. 
These lines partition the grid into four quadrants. Within each quadrant, 
locates a single contiguous object whose color is not the background (black, 0) 
and not the divider line color. Extracts the 3x3 minimal bounding box of each 
of these four objects. Assembles a 6x6 output grid by placing the extracted 
3x3 regions into the corresponding quadrants of the output grid (TL input -> TL output, etc.).

**Assessment & Strategy:**

The previous code failed because the `_find_divider_lines` function incorrectly assumed the dividing lines' color must appear at the start of the respective row or column (index 0). The metrics gathered using `tool_code` confirm that in all examples:
1.  There is exactly one unique color that forms both a complete horizontal line and a complete vertical line.
2.  These lines divide the grid into four quadrants.
3.  Each quadrant contains exactly one contiguous object whose color is neither black (background) nor the divider line color.
4.  The analysis strongly suggests (and manual inspection confirms) that the minimal bounding box of each of these objects is exactly 3x3.
5.  The output is constructed by taking the 3x3 bounding box content of the object from the top-left (TL), top-right (TR), bottom-left (BL), and bottom-right (BR) input quadrants and placing them into the TL, TR, BL, and BR 3x3 sections of a 6x6 output grid, respectively.

The primary error was the faulty divider line detection. The rest of the logic (quadrant definition, object identification within quadrants, 3x3 bounding box extraction, and output assembly) appears conceptually correct based on the examples, although the previous code's failure on Example 3 (where the faulty divider logic *should* have worked) suggests there might have been a secondary bug, possibly related to how the `ValueError` was handled or an edge case in the extraction/bounding box check.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the `_find_divider_lines` function to properly scan rows/columns for uniform, non-black lines.
2.  Ensure the rest of the code (especially `_find_and_extract` and `transform`) correctly implements the bounding box extraction and error handling.

**Metrics:**

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Divider Color | H Line Index | V Line Index | Quadrant Objects (Color) | Object BBox Size |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :----------- | :----------- | :----------------------- | :--------------- |

| 2       | (12, 13)    | (6, 6)       | 2 (Red)       | 3            | 7            | TL:1, TR:3, BL:4, BR:5   | 3x3 (confirmed)  |
| 3       | (16, 12)    | (6, 6)       | 3 (Green)     | 4            | 6            | TL:2, TR:1, BL:4, BR:5   | 3x3 (confirmed)  |

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Divider Lines:** Scan the input grid to find a unique, non-black color that forms exactly one complete horizontal line and exactly one complete vertical line. Record this divider color and the row index (`h`) of the horizontal line and the column index (`v`) of the vertical line.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new 6x6 grid filled with the background color (black, 0).
3.  **Define Quadrants:** Conceptually divide the input grid into four quadrants using the divider lines: Top-Left (TL: rows `0` to `h-1`, cols `0` to `v-1`), Top-Right (TR: rows `0` to `h-1`, cols `v+1` to end), Bottom-Left (BL: rows `h+1` to end, cols `0` to `v-1`), and Bottom-Right (BR: rows `h+1` to end, cols `v+1` to end).
4.  **Process Each Quadrant:** For each of the four quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR):
    a.  **Locate Object:** Find the single contiguous object within the quadrant's boundaries whose color is not black and not the divider color.
    b.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the minimal bounding box coordinates (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col) that enclose this object. (This box is guaranteed to be 3x3).
    c.  **Extract Region:** Extract the 3x3 block of pixels from the input grid corresponding to these bounding box coordinates.
    d.  **Place in Output:** Copy the extracted 3x3 region into the corresponding 3x3 section of the 6x6 output grid (TL input -> TL output, TR input -> TR output, BL input -> BL output, BR input -> BR output).
5.  **Return Output:** The completed 6x6 grid is the result.**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed on all examples, consistently producing an empty 6x6 grid. The root cause appears to be an incorrect assumption in the `_find_divider_lines` function, which required the divider color to be present at the very beginning (index 0) of the row and column. Analysis of the examples shows this is not always the case. The metrics gathered via `tool_code` confirm that each example *does* have unique horizontal and vertical divider lines of the same color, partitioning the grid as expected. The core logic of identifying objects within quadrants, extracting their 3x3 bounding boxes, and assembling them into a 6x6 output seems sound based on manual inspection and the gathered metrics.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Divider Identification:** Refactor the `_find_divider_lines` function to correctly identify rows and columns composed entirely of a single, non-black color, regardless of the color at index 0. Then, find the unique color that satisfies this condition for exactly one row and exactly one column.
2.  **Verify Extraction Logic:** Although the extraction logic (`_find_and_extract`) seems conceptually correct and the object bounding boxes were consistently 3x3 in the examples, the failure on Example 3 (where the original divider logic should have worked) warrants a careful review. Ensure the BFS, bounding box calculation, and the 3x3 size check are robust. Confirm that the `ValueError` handling in the main `transform` function doesn't mask other potential issues.
3.  **Re-Test:** Apply the corrected code to all training examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the unique non-black color (`divider_color`) and the specific row index (`h`) and column index (`v`) where the input grid contains a complete horizontal line and a complete vertical line of that `divider_color`.
2.  Create a target 6x6 output grid, initially filled with black (0).
3.  Define the four input quadrants relative to the divider lines: Top-Left (rows `0` to `h-1`, cols `0` to `v-1`), Top-Right (rows `0` to `h-1`, cols `v+1` to end), Bottom-Left (rows `h+1` to end, cols `0` to `v-1`), and Bottom-Right (rows `h+1` to end, cols `v+1` to end).
4.  For each of these four input quadrants:
    a.  Locate the single contiguous object within the quadrant's bounds whose color is neither black (0) nor the `divider_color`.
    b.  Determine the coordinates of the minimal 3x3 bounding box that encloses this object.
    c.  Extract the 3x3 pattern of pixels from the input grid defined by this bounding box.
    d.  Copy this extracted 3x3 pattern into the corresponding 3x3 section of the 6x6 output grid (Top-Left input object -> Top-Left output section, Top-Right input object -> Top-Right output section, etc.).
5.  Return the fully assembled 6x6 output grid.
