            "text": "*   **Perception**: The input grids contain a prominent dividing line (either a full row or a full column of a single non-background color) separating the grid into two main sections. Besides the dividing line, there are four distinct colored objects, typically two on each side of the line. The output grid is consistently a 6x6 grid, seemingly constructed by taking a representation of each of the four objects and arranging them in a 2x2 layout. The dividing line itself is absent in the output. The relative positioning of the objects in the output mirrors their relative positions (top/bottom, left/right) across the dividing line in the input. Specifically, the objects appear to be cropped to their top-left 3x3 portion and placed into corresponding 3x3 quadrants in the 6x6 output grid.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Scan the input grid to find a dividing line, defined as a complete row or column filled with a single color other than white. Record the divider's color, orientation (horizontal/vertical), and index (row or column number).\n    3.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects in the input grid that are neither the background color nor the divider color. There should be exactly four such objects.\n    4.  For each of the four objects:\n        a.  Determine its minimal bounding box (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).\n        b.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner of its bounding box (using the minimum row and minimum column indices). This is the object's \"crop\".\n    5.  Categorize the four objects based on their position relative to the dividing line:\n        a.  If the divider is vertical at column `d`:\n            i.  Identify the \"Left\" objects (bounding box entirely to the left of `d`).\n            ii. Identify the \"Right\" objects (bounding box entirely to the right of `d`).\n            iii.Among the \"Left\" objects, the one with the smaller minimum row index is \"Top-Left\", the other is \"Bottom-Left\".\n            iv. Among the \"Right\" objects, the one with the smaller minimum row index is \"Top-Right\", the other is \"Bottom-Right\".\n        b.  If the divider is horizontal at row `r`:\n            i.  Identify the \"Top\" objects (bounding box entirely above `r`).\n            ii. Identify the \"Bottom\" objects (bounding box entirely below `r`).\n            iii.Among the \"Top\" objects, the one with the smaller minimum column index is \"Top-Left\", the other is \"Top-Right\".\n            iv. Among the \"Bottom\" objects, the one with the smaller minimum column index is \"Bottom-Left\", the other is \"Bottom-Right\".\n    6.  Place the 3x3 crops into the 6x6 output grid:\n        a.  Copy the crop of the \"Top-Left\" object to the output grid region from row 0 to 2 and column 0 to 2.\n        b.  Copy the crop of the \"Top-Right\" object to the output grid region from row 0 to 2 and column 3 to 5.\n        c.  Copy the crop of the \"Bottom-Left\" object to the output grid region from row 3 to 5 and column 0 to 2.\n        d.  Copy the crop of the \"Bottom-Right\" object to the output grid region from row 3 to 5 and column 3 to 5.\n    7.  Return the completed 6x6 output grid."
