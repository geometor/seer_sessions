- task: Identify dividing lines and extract quadrant objects.
- grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (black)
    - divider_lines:
        - role: Partition the grid into four quadrants.
        - count: Exactly one horizontal and one vertical line.
        - properties:
            - Composed of a single, uniform color (not black).
            - Span the full width (horizontal) or height (vertical) of the grid.
            - The horizontal and vertical lines share the same color.
        - identification: Find the unique non-black color C such that `grid[h, :] == C` for exactly one `h` and `grid[:, v] == C` for exactly one `v`.
    - quadrants:
        - definition: Four rectangular regions defined by the divider lines.
            - TL: rows 0 to h-1, cols 0 to v-1
            - TR: rows 0 to h-1, cols v+1 to W-1
            - BL: rows h+1 to H-1, cols 0 to v-1
            - BR: rows h+1 to H-1, cols v+1 to W-1
        - content: Each quadrant contains exactly one significant object.
- objects:
    - definition: Contiguous areas of a single color, not matching the background or divider line color.
    - location: Exactly one object per quadrant.
    - properties:
        - The minimal bounding box of each object is exactly 3x3 pixels.
- transformation:
    - input: Grid with divider lines and four objects.
    - output: A 6x6 grid.
    - steps:
        1. Identify the unique divider color and the indices (h, v) of the horizontal and vertical divider lines.
        2. Define the four quadrants based on h and v.
        3. For each quadrant:
            a. Find the single contiguous object whose color is not black and not the divider color.
            b. Determine the minimal bounding box of this object (which will be 3x3).
            c. Extract the 3x3 pixel region defined by this bounding box from the input grid.
        4. Assemble the 6x6 output grid:
            - Place the extracted 3x3 region from the input TL quadrant into the output grid at rows 0-2, cols 0-2.
            - Place the extracted 3x3 region from the input TR quadrant into the output grid at rows 0-2, cols 3-5.
            - Place the extracted 3x3 region from the input BL quadrant into the output grid at rows 3-5, cols 0-2.
            - Place the extracted 3x3 region from the input BR quadrant into the output grid at rows 3-5, cols 3-5.
