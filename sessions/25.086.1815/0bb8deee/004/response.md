**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of extracting fixed 3x3 corners was incorrect. The provided examples and the subsequent analysis show a more complex pattern involving dividing lines and object extraction within quadrants. The code execution confirms the revised hypothesis: the transformation involves identifying dividing lines, locating specific objects within the resulting quadrants, extracting their 3x3 bounding boxes, and assembling these into a 6x6 output grid. The previous code failed because it didn't account for the dividing lines or the dynamic location of the relevant objects.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All input grids have different dimensions.
*   All output grids are consistently 6x6.
*   A single, complete horizontal line and a single, complete vertical line exist in each input grid, made of a single color (the 'divider color').
*   The divider color changes between examples (Blue, Red, Green).
*   These lines divide the input grid into four quadrants.
*   Each quadrant contains exactly one contiguous object of a color different from black (0) and the divider color.
*   The minimal bounding box for each of these target objects is exactly 3x3 in all observed cases.
*   The 3x3 regions extracted from the input correspond exactly to the four 3x3 quadrants of the expected output grid, maintaining the relative quadrant positions.

```yaml
Input:
  grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9)
  properties:
    height: variable (12-16 observed)
    width: variable (12-13 observed)
    contains_divider_lines: true
    divider_line_color: variable (1, 2, or 3 observed)
    divider_lines:
      - type: horizontal
        count: 1
        completeness: spans full width
      - type: vertical
        count: 1
        completeness: spans full height
    quadrants: defined by divider lines
      count: 4 (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
      content: each contains one target object

Target Objects:
  location: one per input quadrant
  color: non-black (0) and non-divider_line_color
  shape: contiguous block of pixels
  properties:
    minimal_bounding_box_size: 3x3 (observed in all examples)

Output:
  grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9)
  properties:
    height: 6 (constant)
    width: 6 (constant)
    structure: composed of four 3x3 quadrants

Actions:
  1. Identify: Find the unique color forming complete horizontal and vertical lines (divider_line_color).
  2. Locate Lines: Find the row index (h_row) of the horizontal line and column index (v_col) of the vertical line.
  3. Define Quadrants: Use h_row and v_col to partition the input grid into four subgrids (quadrants).
       - TL: input[0:h_row, 0:v_col]
       - TR: input[0:h_row, v_col+1:width]
       - BL: input[h_row+1:height, 0:v_col]
       - BR: input[h_row+1:height, v_col+1:width]
  4. Find Objects: In each quadrant, find the contiguous object whose color is not black (0) and not the divider_line_color.
  5. Extract Regions: Determine the minimal bounding box for each found object. Extract the corresponding 3x3 region from the input grid. (Note: All examples show exactly 3x3 minimal bounding boxes).
       - region_TL: 3x3 box for TL object
       - region_TR: 3x3 box for TR object
       - region_BL: 3x3 box for BL object
       - region_BR: 3x3 box for BR object
  6. Create Output: Initialize a 6x6 grid with black (0) pixels.
  7. Assemble Output: Copy the extracted regions into the output grid:
       - output[0:3, 0:3] = region_TL
       - output[0:3, 3:6] = region_TR
       - output[3:6, 0:3] = region_BL
       - output[3:6, 3:6] = region_BR
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the unique color that forms both a single, complete horizontal line and a single, complete vertical line spanning the input grid. This is the 'divider color'.
2.  Determine the row index of the horizontal divider line and the column index of the vertical divider line.
3.  These lines partition the input grid into four distinct quadrants: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right.
4.  Within each quadrant, locate the single contiguous object composed of a color that is neither the background color (black, 0) nor the 'divider color'.
5.  For each of these four objects, find its minimal bounding box within the input grid.
6.  Extract the 3x3 grid region corresponding to each object's minimal bounding box. (All observed examples have objects with exactly 3x3 minimal bounding boxes).
7.  Create a new 6x6 output grid.
8.  Assemble the output grid by placing the extracted 3x3 region from the Top-Left input quadrant's object into the Top-Left quadrant (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) of the output grid, the region from the Top-Right input quadrant's object into the Top-Right output quadrant (rows 0-2, columns 3-5), the region from the Bottom-Left input quadrant's object into the Bottom-Left output quadrant (rows 3-5, columns 0-2), and the region from the Bottom-Right input quadrant's object into the Bottom-Right output quadrant (rows 3-5, columns 3-5).
