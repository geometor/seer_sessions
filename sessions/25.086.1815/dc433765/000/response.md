Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of varying sizes, primarily filled with white pixels (0).
2.  **Key Objects:** Each grid contains exactly two non-white pixels: one green (3) and one yellow (4). These appear as single, isolated pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the green pixel. The yellow pixel remains in its original position. The background (white pixels) also remains unchanged, except for the original position of the green pixel which becomes white.
4.  **Movement Pattern:** The green pixel consistently moves one step (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) towards the yellow pixel.
5.  **Determining Movement Direction:**
    *   Find the coordinates (row, column) of the green pixel and the yellow pixel in the input grid.
    *   Calculate the difference in rows (YellowRow - GreenRow) and columns (YellowCol - GreenCol).
    *   Determine the sign of these differences:
        *   If the row difference is positive, the green pixel moves one step down (+1 row).
        *   If the row difference is negative, the green pixel moves one step up (-1 row).
        *   If the row difference is zero, the green pixel does not move vertically (0 row change).
        *   The same logic applies to the column difference for horizontal movement (+1 col for positive, -1 col for negative, 0 col for zero).
    *   The green pixel moves by this calculated (row_change, column_change) vector.
6.  **Final State:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except the green pixel is moved to its new location, and its original location is changed to white (0).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  description: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
  properties:
    size: Variable height and width (1x1 to 30x30).
    pixels: Primarily white (0).
  contains:
    - object: Green_Pixel
      color: 3
      count: 1
      shape: 1x1 pixel
    - object: Yellow_Pixel
      color: 4
      count: 1
      shape: 1x1 pixel

Output_Grid:
  description: A 2D array representing the transformed input grid.
  properties:
    size: Same as the input grid.
    pixels: Primarily white (0).
  contains:
    - object: Green_Pixel
      color: 3
      count: 1
      shape: 1x1 pixel
      position: Modified from input.
    - object: Yellow_Pixel
      color: 4
      count: 1
      shape: 1x1 pixel
      position: Same as input.

Transformation:
  action: Move Green_Pixel
  target: Yellow_Pixel
  rule:
    - description: Green_Pixel moves one step towards Yellow_Pixel.
    - step_1: Identify coordinates of Green_Pixel (Gr, Gc) and Yellow_Pixel (Yr, Yc).
    - step_2: Calculate row difference `dR = Yr - Gr` and column difference `dC = Yc - Gc`.
    - step_3: Determine movement vector `(moveR, moveC)` where `moveR = sign(dR)` and `moveC = sign(dC)`. (sign(x) is +1 if x>0, -1 if x<0, 0 if x=0).
    - step_4: New Green_Pixel coordinates are `(Gr + moveR, Gc + moveC)`.
    - step_5: Update the grid: place Green_Pixel at the new coordinates and change the original Green_Pixel location (Gr, Gc) to white (0).
  invariant: Position of Yellow_Pixel remains unchanged.
  invariant: All white pixels (0) remain unchanged, except for the original location of the Green_Pixel.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Locate the coordinates (row `Gr`, column `Gc`) of the green pixel (3) in the input grid.
3.  Locate the coordinates (row `Yr`, column `Yc`) of the yellow pixel (4) in the input grid.
4.  Calculate the difference in rows: `dR = Yr - Gr`.
5.  Calculate the difference in columns: `dC = Yc - Gc`.
6.  Determine the vertical movement step (`moveR`):
    *   If `dR` > 0, set `moveR = 1`.
    *   If `dR` < 0, set `moveR = -1`.
    *   If `dR` = 0, set `moveR = 0`.
7.  Determine the horizontal movement step (`moveC`):
    *   If `dC` > 0, set `moveC = 1`.
    *   If `dC` < 0, set `moveC = -1`.
    *   If `dC` = 0, set `moveC = 0`.
8.  Calculate the new coordinates for the green pixel: `newGr = Gr + moveR`, `newGc = Gc + moveC`.
9.  Set the pixel value at the original green pixel coordinates (`Gr`, `Gc`) in the output grid to white (0).
10. Set the pixel value at the new green pixel coordinates (`newGr`, `newGc`) in the output grid to green (3).
11. Return the modified output grid.
