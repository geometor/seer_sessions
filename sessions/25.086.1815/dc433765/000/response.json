            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are 2D grids of varying sizes, primarily filled with white pixels (0).\n2.  **Key Objects:** Each grid contains exactly two non-white pixels: one green (3) and one yellow (4). These appear as single, isolated pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the green pixel. The yellow pixel remains in its original position. The background (white pixels) also remains unchanged, except for the original position of the green pixel which becomes white.\n4.  **Movement Pattern:** The green pixel consistently moves one step (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) towards the yellow pixel.\n5.  **Determining Movement Direction:**\n    *   Find the coordinates (row, column) of the green pixel and the yellow pixel in the input grid.\n    *   Calculate the difference in rows (YellowRow - GreenRow) and columns (YellowCol - GreenCol).\n    *   Determine the sign of these differences:\n        *   If the row difference is positive, the green pixel moves one step down (+1 row).\n        *   If the row difference is negative, the green pixel moves one step up (-1 row).\n        *   If the row difference is zero, the green pixel does not move vertically (0 row change).\n        *   The same logic applies to the column difference for horizontal movement (+1 col for positive, -1 col for negative, 0 col for zero).\n    *   The green pixel moves by this calculated (row_change, column_change) vector.\n6.  **Final State:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except the green pixel is moved to its new location, and its original location is changed to white (0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
