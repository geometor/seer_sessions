The other three new pixels inherit the colors of the original three input pixels.\n    *   The positions of the new pixels seem related geometrically to the positions of the original three pixels. They appear to be derived from calculations involving the coordinates of the input pixels, specifically midpoints and points along vectors connecting midpoints to original points.\n    *   The three input pixels can be thought of as vertices of a triangle.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
