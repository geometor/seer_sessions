*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids contain exactly three non-white pixels, scattered sparsely across the grid.
    *   The output grids retain the original three pixels and add exactly four new non-white pixels.
    *   One of the new pixels is always gray (5). The other three new pixels inherit the colors of the original three input pixels.
    *   The positions of the new pixels seem related geometrically to the positions of the original three pixels. They appear to be derived from calculations involving the coordinates of the input pixels, specifically midpoints and points along vectors connecting midpoints to original points.
    *   The three input pixels can be thought of as vertices of a triangle.

*   **Facts:**

      - type: Geometric
        description: The positions of the four new pixels depend on the relative positions of the three input pixels.
        details:
          - Find the pair of input pixels (P_a, P_b) that are farthest apart (maximum Euclidean distance). Let the third pixel be P_c.
          - Calculate the midpoint M between P_a and P_b: M = ( (row_a + row_b)/2, (col_a + col_b)/2 ).
          - The new gray pixel N_gray is located at M.
          - The other three new pixels (N_a, N_b, N_c) are located at points 1/3 of the way along the vectors from M to P_a, P_b, and P_c, respectively.
            - N_a = M + (P_a - M) / 3
            - N_b = M + (P_b - M) / 3
            - N_c = M + (P_c - M) / 3
          - The colors of N_a, N_b, N_c match the colors of P_a, P_b, P_c, respectively.
    assumptions:
      - The input always contains exactly three non-white pixels.
      - The coordinates of the midpoint M calculated from the farthest pair will always be integers.
      - The vectors (P_a - M), (P_b - M), and (P_c - M) will always have components divisible by 3, resulting in integer coordinates for N_a, N_b, N_c.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Identify the coordinates and colors of the three non-white pixels in the input grid. Let them be P1=(r1, c1, color1), P2=(r2, c2, color2), and P3=(r3, c3, color3).
    3.  Calculate the squared Euclidean distances between each pair of points:
        *   d12_sq = (r1-r2)^2 + (c1-c2)^2
        *   d13_sq = (r1-r3)^2 + (c1-c3)^2
        *   d23_sq = (r2-r3)^2 + (c2-c3)^2
    4.  Identify the pair of points with the maximum squared distance. Let this pair be P_a and P_b, and let the remaining point be P_c.
    5.  Calculate the midpoint M of the segment connecting P_a and P_b:
        *   M_row = (P_a_row + P_b_row) / 2
        *   M_col = (P_a_col + P_b_col) / 2
        *   M = (M_row, M_col)
    6.  Place a gray (5) pixel at coordinates M in the output grid.
    7.  Calculate the coordinates for the three other new points N_a, N_b, and N_c:
        *   N_a_row = M_row + (P_a_row - M_row) / 3
        *   N_a_col = M_col + (P_a_col - M_col) / 3
        *   N_b_row = M_row + (P_b_row - M_row) / 3
        *   N_b_col = M_col + (P_b_col - M_col) / 3
        *   N_c_row = M_row + (P_c_row - M_row) / 3
        *   N_c_col = M_col + (P_c_col - M_col) / 3
    8.  Place a pixel with the color of P_a at coordinates (N_a_row, N_a_col) in the output grid.
    9.  Place a pixel with the color of P_b at coordinates (N_b_row, N_b_col) in the output grid.
    10. Place a pixel with the color of P_c at coordinates (N_c_row, N_c_col) in the output grid.
    11. Return the modified output grid.
