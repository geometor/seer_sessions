*   **Perception**:
    *   The task involves processing a 2D grid containing primarily white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6) pixels.
    *   The input grids have a consistent structure: a white top row, a blue region below it, and a magenta region typically originating from the bottom or bottom-left and extending upwards.
    *   The transformation introduces two vertical lines into the grid, one maroon (9) and one yellow (4). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.
    *   The position and length of these lines depend on the locations where the color transitions from blue (1) to magenta (6) in specific columns.
    *   Specifically, the lines mark the columns where this transition occurs earliest and latest (relative to the top of the grid, excluding the first row).
    *   The yellow line corresponds to the earliest transition (minimum row index), and the maroon line corresponds to the latest transition (maximum row index).
    *   If multiple columns share the minimum transition row, the rightmost column is chosen for the yellow line.
    *   If multiple columns share the maximum transition row, the leftmost column is chosen for the maroon line.
    *   The lines extend from the second row (index 1) down to the row immediately preceding the first magenta pixel in the selected column.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
      - background_color: white (0) appears primarily in the top row.
      - primary_colors: blue (1) and magenta (6) form distinct regions below the top row.
      - added_colors: maroon (9) and yellow (4) appear in the output but not the input.

    objects:
      - type: vertical_line
        color: maroon (9)
        location: Determined by the column with the latest blue-to-magenta transition (leftmost if tied).
        extent: Starts at row 1, ends just before the first magenta pixel in its column.
      - type: vertical_line
        color: yellow (4)
        location: Determined by the column with the earliest blue-to-magenta transition (rightmost if tied).
        extent: Starts at row 1, ends just before the first magenta pixel in its column.

    relationships:
      - The input grid contains transitions from blue (1) to magenta (6) within columns (below row 0).
      - The row index of the first magenta pixel in each column (below row 0) is critical.

    actions:
      - Identify columns containing a transition from blue (1) to magenta (6) below row 0.
      - For each such column, record the row index of the first magenta (6) pixel (the transition row).
      - Find the minimum transition row index across all identified columns.
      - Find the maximum transition row index across all identified columns.
      - Select the column for the yellow (4) line: Among columns with the minimum transition row, choose the one with the largest column index.
      - Select the column for the maroon (9) line: Among columns with the maximum transition row, choose the one with the smallest column index.
      - Modify a copy of the input grid: Draw the yellow line and the maroon line in their respective selected columns, from row 1 down to the row just before their corresponding transition row index.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the initial output grid.
    2.  Initialize variables to track the earliest transition row found so far (`min_transition_row`), the column associated with it (`min_transition_col`), the latest transition row found so far (`max_transition_row`), and the column associated with it (`max_transition_col`). Set initial `min_transition_row` to a very large number and `max_transition_row` to -1.
    3.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to width-1 of the input grid.
    4.  For the current column `c`, iterate through rows `r` from 1 to height-1.
    5.  Find the first row `r` in column `c` where the pixel value is magenta (6) and the pixel directly above it (at row `r-1`) is blue (1). This row `r` is the transition row for column `c`.
    6.  If a transition row `r` is found in column `c`:
        a.  Compare `r` with `min_transition_row`. If `r` is less than `min_transition_row`, update `min_transition_row` to `r` and `min_transition_col` to `c`. If `r` is equal to `min_transition_row`, update `min_transition_col` to the current column `c` (this ensures the rightmost column is selected in case of a tie, as we iterate left-to-right).
        b.  Compare `r` with `max_transition_row`. If `r` is greater than `max_transition_row`, update `max_transition_row` to `r` and `max_transition_col` to `c`. If `r` is equal to `max_transition_row`, do *not* update `max_transition_col` (this ensures the leftmost column is selected in case of a tie).
    7.  After checking all columns, if a valid `min_transition_col` was found (i.e., `min_transition_row` is not the initial large number):
        a.  Iterate from row `r` = 1 up to `min_transition_row - 1`.
        b.  Set the pixel value in the output grid at `(r, min_transition_col)` to yellow (4).
    8.  If a valid `max_transition_col` was found (i.e., `max_transition_row` is not -1):
        a.  Iterate from row `r` = 1 up to `max_transition_row - 1`.
        b.  Set the pixel value in the output grid at `(r, max_transition_col)` to maroon (9).
    9.  Return the modified output grid.
