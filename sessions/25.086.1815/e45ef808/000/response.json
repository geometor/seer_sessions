The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n    *   The position and length of these lines depend on the locations where the color transitions from blue (1) to magenta (6) in specific columns.\n    *   Specifically, the lines mark the columns where this transition occurs earliest and latest (relative to the top of the grid, excluding the first row).\n    *   The yellow line corresponds to the earliest transition (minimum row index), and the maroon line corresponds to the latest transition (maximum row index).\n    *   If multiple columns share the minimum transition row, the rightmost column is chosen for the yellow line.\n    *   If multiple columns share the maximum transition row, the leftmost column is chosen for the maroon line.\n    *   The lines extend from the second row (index 1) down to the row immediately preceding the first magenta pixel in the selected column.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

Initialize variables to track the earliest transition row found so far (`min_transition_row`), the column associated with it (`min_transition_col`), the latest transition row found so far (`max_transition_row`), and the column associated with it (`max_transition_col`). Set initial `min_transition_row` to a very large number and `max_transition_row` to -1.\n    3.  Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to width-1 of the input grid.\n    4.  For the current column `c`, iterate through rows `r` from 1 to height-1.\n    5.  Find the first row `r` in column `c` where the pixel value is magenta (6) and the pixel directly above it (at row `r-1`) is blue (1). This row `r` is the transition row for column `c`.\n    6.  If a transition row `r` is found in column `c`:\n        a.  Compare `r` with `min_transition_row`. If `r` is less than `min_transition_row`, update `min_transition_row` to `r` and `min_transition_col` to `c`. If `r` is equal to `min_transition_row`, update `min_transition_col` to the current column `c` (this ensures the rightmost column is selected in case of a tie, as we iterate left-to-right).\n        b.  Compare `r` with `max_transition_row`. If `r` is greater than `max_transition_row`, update `max_transition_row` to `r` and `max_transition_col` to `c`. If `r` is equal to `max_transition_row`, do *not* update `max_transition_col` (this ensures the leftmost column is selected in case of a tie).\n    7.  After checking all columns, if a valid `min_transition_col` was found (i.e., `min_transition_row` is not the initial large number):\n        a.  Iterate from row `r` = 1 up to `min_transition_row - 1`.\n        b.  Set the pixel value in the output grid at `(r, min_transition_col)` to yellow (4).\n    8.  If a valid `max_transition_col` was found (i.e., `max_transition_row` is not -1):\n        a.  Iterate from row `r` = 1 up to `max_transition_row - 1`.\n        b.  Set the pixel value in the output grid at `(r, max_transition_col)` to maroon (9).\n    9.  Return the modified output grid."
