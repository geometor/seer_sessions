Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background with several small, distinct clusters of colored pixels.
2.  **Object Identification:** These colored clusters appear to be distinct objects. In all examples, these objects are 3x3 squares composed of non-white pixels.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
4.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The output grid in each example perfectly matches one of the 3x3 colored objects present in the corresponding input grid.
5.  **Selection Criterion:** The key is to determine *which* of the multiple 3x3 objects in the input is selected for the output. Analyzing the objects:
    *   In `train_1`, the objects have the following unique non-white color counts: {Gray, Magenta, Azure} -> 3 unique colors; {Maroon, Yellow} -> 2 unique colors; {Green, Red} -> 2 unique colors; {Blue, Orange} -> 2 unique colors. The output is the object with 3 unique colors.
    *   In `train_2`, the objects have counts: {Maroon, Azure} -> 2; {Orange, Yellow} -> 2; {Blue, Green, Red} -> 3; {Green, Magenta} -> 2. The output is the object with 3 unique colors.
    *   In `train_3`, the objects have counts: {Orange, Gray} -> 2; {Blue, Magenta, Red} -> 3; {Azure, Green} -> 2; {Maroon, Yellow} -> 2. The output is the object with 3 unique colors.
6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule identifies all contiguous 3x3 objects composed entirely of non-white pixels within the input grid. It then selects the *one* object that contains exactly three distinct non-white colors. This selected 3x3 object becomes the output grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Extract a specific 3x3 object from the input grid.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains a background color: white (0).
  - Contains multiple distinct objects composed of non-white pixels.

Objects:
  - Properties:
    - Shape: Square
    - Size: 3x3 pixels
    - Composition: Contain only non-white pixels.
    - Colors: Each object contains 2 or 3 unique non-white colors.
    - Contiguity: Pixels within an object are contiguous.
    - Separation: Objects are separated by the background color (white).

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify all 3x3 non-white objects in the input grid.
  - Action: For each identified object, count the number of unique non-white colors it contains.
  - Selection: Choose the object that has exactly 3 unique non-white colors.
  - Output_Generation: Create the output grid using the pixels of the selected 3x3 object.

Output_Grid:
  - Size: 3x3 pixels.
  - Content: Identical to the selected 3x3 object from the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all separate, contiguous blocks (objects) composed entirely of non-white pixels.
2.  Filter these objects to keep only those that have dimensions of exactly 3x3 pixels.
3.  For each remaining 3x3 object, count the number of unique non-white pixel colors present within it.
4.  Select the single 3x3 object that contains exactly 3 unique non-white colors.
5.  The output grid is a copy of the pixels from the selected 3x3 object.
