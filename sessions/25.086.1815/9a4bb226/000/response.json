            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consist of a white (0) background with several small, distinct clusters of colored pixels.\n2.  **Object Identification:** These colored clusters appear to be distinct objects. In all examples, these objects are 3x3 squares composed of non-white pixels.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.\n4.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The output grid in each example perfectly matches one of the 3x3 colored objects present in the corresponding input grid.\n5.  **Selection Criterion:** The key is to determine *which* of the multiple 3x3 objects in the input is selected for the output. Analyzing the objects:\n    *   In `train_1`, the objects have the following unique non-white color counts: {Gray, Magenta, Azure} -> 3 unique colors; {Maroon, Yellow} -> 2 unique colors; {Green, Red} -> 2 unique colors; {Blue, Orange} -> 2 unique colors. The output is the object with 3 unique colors.\n    *   In `train_2`, the objects have counts: {Maroon, Azure} -> 2; {Orange, Yellow} -> 2; {Blue, Green, Red} -> 3; {Green, Magenta} -> 2. The output is the object with 3 unique colors.\n    *   In `train_3`, the objects have counts: {Orange, Gray} -> 2; {Blue, Magenta, Red} -> 3; {Azure, Green} -> 2; {Maroon, Yellow} -> 2. The output is the object with 3 unique colors.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule identifies all contiguous 3x3 objects composed entirely of non-white pixels within the input grid. It then selects the *one* object that contains exactly three distinct non-white colors. This selected 3x3 object becomes the output grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
