task_context:
  grid_representation: 2D array of integers 0-9 representing colors.
  colors:
    white: 0
    red: 2
    maroon: 9
  background_color: white (0)
  relevant_colors: white (0), red (2), maroon (9)

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: (white, red, etc.)
      - location: (row, column)
  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - location: (row, start_col, end_col)
      - length: number of pixels in the segment
  - type: horizontal_gap
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - location: (row, start_col, end_col)
      - length: number of pixels in the gap
      - bounding_segments: Pair of red segments immediately to the left and right.

actions:
  - name: identify_red_segments
    description: For each row, find all maximal contiguous horizontal sequences of red pixels.
  - name: identify_white_gaps
    description: For each row, find sequences of white pixels located strictly between two adjacent red segments.
  - name: fill_gap
    description: Change the color of all white pixels within an identified gap to maroon.
    condition: >
      The gap is filled UNLESS one of the two adjacent bounding red segments has a length of 1 AND the length of the white gap is 5 or greater.
  - name: copy_grid
    description: Create an output grid initially identical to the input grid.
  - name: preserve_pixels
    description: Pixels not part of a fillable white gap retain their original color.

transformation_goal: Modify the input grid by selectively filling horizontal white gaps between red segments with maroon color based on the specified condition.
