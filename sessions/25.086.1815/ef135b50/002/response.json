Matches expectation.\n*   Ex 1, Row 2: Segments `[0,1]` (len 2) and `[7,8,9]` (len 3). Gap `[2,6]` (len 5). Is white gap: True. Condition `(seg1_len == 1 or seg2_len == 1) and gap_len >= 5` is FALSE (because neither segment has length 1). -> Fill. Matches expectation.\n\nThe refined hypothesis holds.\n\nNow, structure the response.**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example: filling white pixels (0) with maroon (9) if they occurred horizontally between the minimum and maximum column index of red pixels (2) in a given row. This worked for the first two examples.\n\nHowever, the third example revealed a more nuanced condition. In the last row of the third example's input (`2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2`), the white pixels between the red pixels were *not* filled in the expected output, contrary to the initial rule's interpretation. The original code incorrectly filled these pixels.\n\nThe analysis indicates that the filling rule depends not just on the presence of bounding red pixels but also on the characteristics of the contiguous red \"segments\" and the white \"gap\" between them. Specifically, a gap of white pixels between two adjacent red segments is filled *unless* one of the red segments consists of only a single pixel AND the gap length is 5 or more pixels.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nMetrics gathered focus on Example 3, Row 9, where the error occurred, compared with similar rows where filling did occur.\n\n*   **Input Example 3, Row 9:** `[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`\n    *   Red Segment 1: Indices `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, Length = 4\n    *   Red Segment 2: Indices `[9]`, Length = 1\n    *   Gap: Indices `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, Length = 5, Contents = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (all white)\n    *   Expected Output: Gap remains white.\n    *   Condition Check: One segment has length 1, and the gap length is 5 (>= 5). The exception condition applies.\n\n*   **Input Example 3, Row 6:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2]`\n    *   Red Segment 1: Indices `[5, 6, 7]`, Length = 3\n    *   Red Segment 2: Indices `[9]`, Length = 1\n    *   Gap: Indices `[8]`, Length = 1, Contents = `[0]` (white)\n    *   Expected Output: Gap pixel `(6, 8)` becomes maroon (9).\n    *   Condition Check: One segment has length 1, but the gap length is 1 (< 5). The exception condition does not apply.\n\n*   **Input Example 1, Row 2:** `[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`\n    *   Red Segment 1: Indices `[0, 1]`, Length = 2\n    *   Red Segment 2: Indices `[7, 8, 9]`, Length = 3\n    *   Gap: Indices `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, Length = 5, Contents = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (all white)\n    *   Expected Output: Gap pixels become maroon (9).\n    *   Condition Check: Neither segment has length 1. The exception condition does not apply.\n\nThese metrics confirm the refined hypothesis that the fill operation is conditional based on segment lengths and gap length.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
