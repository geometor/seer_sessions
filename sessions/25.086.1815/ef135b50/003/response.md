"""
Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. For each row in the grid:
   a. Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal segments of red (2) pixels.
   b. For each pair of adjacent red segments in that row:
      i. Identify the sequence of pixels strictly between the end of the first segment and the start of the second segment (the "gap").
      ii. Check if all pixels in this gap are white (0).
      iii. If the gap consists entirely of white pixels:
          1. Get the length of the first red segment (`seg1_len`), the length of the second red segment (`seg2_len`), and the length of the white gap (`gap_len`).
          2. Determine if an exception condition applies: `(seg1_len == 1 or seg2_len == 1) and gap_len >= 5`.
          3. If the exception condition is FALSE, change the color of all pixels within the white gap in the output grid to maroon (9).
3. Pixels not part of a fillable white gap retain their original color.
4. Return the modified output grid.
