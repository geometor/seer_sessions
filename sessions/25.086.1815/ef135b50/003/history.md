"""
For each white pixel in the input grid, determine if it is horizontally bounded by red pixels
within its row. If it is, change its color to maroon in the output grid. Otherwise, keep its color.
All non-white pixels retain their original color in the output grid.

Specifically:
1. Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2. For each row in the grid:
   a. Find the column indices of all red (2) pixels within that row.
   b. If there are at least two red pixels in the row:
      i. Determine the minimum column index (`min_red_col`) and the maximum column index (`max_red_col`) of the red pixels in that row.
      ii. For each column index `col` strictly between `min_red_col` and `max_red_col`:
         1. If the pixel at (`row`, `col`) in the input grid is white (0), change the color of the pixel at (`row`, `col`) in the output grid to maroon (9).
3. Return the modified output grid.

The code execution confirms the analysis:
*   Ex 3, Row 9: Segments `[0,1,2,3]` (len 4) and `[9]` (len 1). Gap `[4,8]` (len 5). Is white gap: True. Condition `(seg1_len == 1 or seg2_len == 1) and gap_len >= 5` is TRUE. -> No fill. Matches expectation.
*   Ex 3, Row 6: Segments `[5,6,7]` (len 3) and `[9]` (len 1). Gap `[8]` (len 1). Is white gap: True. Condition `(seg1_len == 1 or seg2_len == 1) and gap_len >= 5` is FALSE (because gap_len is 1). -> Fill. Matches expectation.
*   Ex 1, Row 2: Segments `[0,1]` (len 2) and `[7,8,9]` (len 3). Gap `[2,6]` (len 5). Is white gap: True. Condition `(seg1_len == 1 or seg2_len == 1) and gap_len >= 5` is FALSE (because neither segment has length 1). -> Fill. Matches expectation.

The refined hypothesis holds.

Now, structure the response.**General Assessment**

The initial code successfully implemented the logic derived from the first example: filling white pixels (0) with maroon (9) if they occurred horizontally between the minimum and maximum column index of red pixels (2) in a given row. This worked for the first two examples.

However, the third example revealed a more nuanced condition. In the last row of the third example's input (`2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2`), the white pixels between the red pixels were *not* filled in the expected output, contrary to the initial rule's interpretation. The original code incorrectly filled these pixels.

The analysis indicates that the filling rule depends not just on the presence of bounding red pixels but also on the characteristics of the contiguous red "segments" and the white "gap" between them. Specifically, a gap of white pixels between two adjacent red segments is filled *unless* one of the red segments consists of only a single pixel AND the gap length is 5 or more pixels.

**Metrics**

Metrics gathered focus on Example 3, Row 9, where the error occurred, compared with similar rows where filling did occur.

*   **Input Example 3, Row 9:** `[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`
    *   Red Segment 1: Indices `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, Length = 4
    *   Red Segment 2: Indices `[9]`, Length = 1
    *   Gap: Indices `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, Length = 5, Contents = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (all white)
    *   Expected Output: Gap remains white.
    *   Condition Check: One segment has length 1, and the gap length is 5 (>= 5). The exception condition applies.

*   **Input Example 3, Row 6:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2]`
    *   Red Segment 1: Indices `[5, 6, 7]`, Length = 3
    *   Red Segment 2: Indices `[9]`, Length = 1
    *   Gap: Indices `[8]`, Length = 1, Contents = `[0]` (white)
    *   Expected Output: Gap pixel `(6, 8)` becomes maroon (9).
    *   Condition Check: One segment has length 1, but the gap length is 1 (< 5). The exception condition does not apply.

*   **Input Example 1, Row 2:** `[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`
    *   Red Segment 1: Indices `[0, 1]`, Length = 2
    *   Red Segment 2: Indices `[7, 8, 9]`, Length = 3
    *   Gap: Indices `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, Length = 5, Contents = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (all white)
    *   Expected Output: Gap pixels become maroon (9).
    *   Condition Check: Neither segment has length 1. The exception condition does not apply.

These metrics confirm the refined hypothesis that the fill operation is conditional based on segment lengths and gap length.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all maximal contiguous horizontal segments of red (2) pixels. Record their start column, end column, and length.
    b.  Iterate through pairs of adjacent red segments found in step 3a. Let the first segment end at `col_end1` and the second segment start at `col_start2`.
    c.  Check the pixels between `col_end1 + 1` and `col_start2 - 1`.
    d.  If this range exists (i.e., `col_start2 > col_end1 + 1`) and all pixels within this range in the input grid are white (0), then this range constitutes a "white gap".
    e.  Let `seg1_len` be the length of the first red segment and `seg2_len` be the length of the second red segment.
    f.  Let `gap_len` be the length of the white gap (i.e., `col_start2 - 1 - (col_end1 + 1) + 1`).
    g.  Define the exception condition: `(seg1_len == 1 or seg2_len == 1) and gap_len >= 5`.
    h.  If the white gap exists (step 3d) AND the exception condition (step 3g) is FALSE, then change the color of all pixels in the output grid from column `col_end1 + 1` to `col_start2 - 1` in the current row to maroon (9).
4.  Return the modified output grid.
