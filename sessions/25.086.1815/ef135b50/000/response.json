            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 2D grid containing primarily white (0) and red (2) pixels. The transformation introduces maroon (9) pixels into the output grid while preserving the original positions and shapes of the red (2) structures. The maroon pixels appear exclusively in locations that were originally white. Observing the placement of the new maroon pixels, they consistently appear in white areas that are horizontally \"sandwiched\" between red pixels on the same row. That is, a white pixel changes to maroon if and only if there is at least one red pixel somewhere to its left and at least one red pixel somewhere to its right within the same row. Vertical relationships between red pixels do not seem to influence the transformation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
