task_description: Recolor azure (8) objects based on geometric properties.
color_map:
  azure: 8
  blue: 1
  red: 2
  background: 0
objects:
  - type: contiguous pixel group
  - color: azure (8)
  - adjacency: 4-way (horizontal/vertical)
properties_observed:
  - size: number of pixels in the object
  - bounding_box: minimum enclosing rectangle
  - bounding_box_area: height * width of the bounding box
  - is_solid_block: true if size equals bounding_box_area, false otherwise
  - area_difference: bounding_box_area - size
  - size_parity: even or odd
actions:
  - identify: find all azure objects
  - calculate: size, bounding_box, bounding_box_area, area_difference, size_parity for each object
  - recolor: change the color of all pixels in each object based on rules
transformation_rule:
  - if is_solid_block is true:
      recolor object to red (2)
  - else (is_solid_block is false):
      if area_difference is 1 AND size_parity is even:
          recolor object to red (2)
      else:
          recolor object to blue (1)
