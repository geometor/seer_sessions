"""
Recolor azure (8) objects based on the relationship between the parity of the total number of azure pixels and the parity of the size of each individual object.

1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid, considering pixels connected horizontally or vertically (4-way adjacency) as part of the same object.
3. Calculate the `total_azure_pixels` by summing the number of pixels in all identified azure objects.
4. Determine the `total_parity` (Even or Odd) of the `total_azure_pixels`.
5. Iterate through each identified azure object:
    a. Calculate the `object_size` (number of pixels) for the current object.
    b. Determine the `object_parity` (Even or Odd) of the `object_size`.
    c. Compare the `total_parity` and `object_parity`:
        i. If `total_parity` is the SAME as `object_parity`, set the `output_color` for this object to Red (2).
        ii. If `total_parity` is DIFFERENT from `object_parity`, set the `output_color` for this object to Blue (1).
    d. Recolor all pixels belonging to the current azure object in the output grid with the determined `output_color`.
6. Return the modified output grid.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, based on observations from Example 1, correctly identified the transformation for that specific case but failed to generalize. The failure occurred in Example 2, and further analysis revealed the logic would also incorrectly handle Example 3, despite the provided report indicating success for Example 3. This suggests either the report was inaccurate or there was an issue in how the test was performed.

The core transformation involves identifying contiguous objects of azure (8) pixels and recoloring them based on a property. The initial hypothesis linked the output color to a comparison between the parity of the total number of azure pixels and the parity of each object's size. However, analyzing all three examples reveals a simpler, consistent rule: the output color depends *only* on the parity of the individual azure object's size.

**Strategy:**

1.  Discard the dependency on the total number of azure pixels.
2.  Refine the natural language program to state that azure objects are recolored based solely on the parity of their own size (pixel count).
3.  Update the facts and metrics based on this revised understanding.
4.  The Coder phase will need to implement this simpler logic.

**Correction:** My manual object identification/counting in the `thought` block was incorrect. The `tool_code` execution provides the accurate object sizes and counts.

Let's re-evaluate the rule based on the *correct* metrics from the tool code.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Objects (Sizes): [8 (E), 9 (O), 9 (O)]
    *   Total Pixels: 26 (Even)
    *   Expected Output (Visual): Object 1 -> Red(2), Object 2 -> Blue(1), Object 3 -> Blue(1)
    *   Rule Test (E->Red, O->Blue): [R, B, B]. **Matches.**
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Objects (Sizes): [8 (E), 10 (E), 10 (E)]
    *   Total Pixels: 28 (Even)
    *   Expected Output (Visual): Object 1 -> Red(2), Object 2 -> Red(2), Object 3 -> Red(2)
    *   Rule Test (E->Red, O->Blue): [R, R, R]. **Matches.**
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Objects (Sizes): [5 (O), 4 (E), 5 (O)]
    *   Total Pixels: 14 (Even)
    *   Expected Output (Visual): Object 1 -> Blue(1), Object 2 -> Red(2), Object 3 -> Blue(1)
    *   Rule Test (E->Red, O->Blue): [B, R, B]. **Matches.**

The simplified rule (Even size -> Red, Odd size -> Blue) holds true for all examples based on the accurate object identification and sizing from the tool code. The previous code failed because its logic involving total parity was incorrect for cases where the total parity was odd (although the test report claimed success, which is suspect). The core logic should solely depend on the individual object's size parity.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
  - Background color is consistently white (0).

Objects:
  - The primary objects of interest are contiguous areas of azure (8) pixels. Adjacency is 4-way (horizontal/vertical).
  - Other colors are absent or irrelevant to the transformation.
  - Azure objects vary in size and shape.
  - The number of azure objects varies per example.

Transformation:
  - Action: Recolor azure (8) objects.
  - Target Objects: All contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
  - Color Mapping Rule:
      - Determine the size (number of pixels) of each individual azure object.
      - Check the parity (Even or Odd) of the object's size.
      - If the object's size is Even, recolor all its pixels to Red (2).
      - If the object's size is Odd, recolor all its pixels to Blue (1).
  - Non-target Pixels: Pixels that are not part of an azure object remain unchanged.
  - Output Grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.

Derived Properties (Not Directly Used in Final Rule):
  - The total count of azure pixels across all objects varies.
  - The parity of the total count of azure pixels is not required for the transformation rule.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed solely of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. Use 4-way adjacency (pixels are connected if they share an edge horizontally or vertically).
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a. Calculate its size by counting the number of pixels it contains.
    b. Determine the parity of the object's size (whether the size is Even or Odd).
    c. If the object's size is Even, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to Red (2).
    d. If the object's size is Odd, change the color of all pixels belonging to this object in the output grid to Blue (1).
