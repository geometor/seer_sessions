The failure occurred in Example 2, and further analysis revealed the logic would also incorrectly handle Example 3, despite the provided report indicating success for Example 3. This suggests either the report was inaccurate or there was an issue in how the test was performed.\n\nThe core transformation involves identifying contiguous objects of azure (8) pixels and recoloring them based on a property. The initial hypothesis linked the output color to a comparison between the parity of the total number of azure pixels and the parity of each object's size. However, analyzing all three examples reveals a simpler, consistent rule: the output color depends *only* on the parity of the individual azure object's size.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Discard the dependency on the total number of azure pixels.\n2.  Refine the natural language program to state that azure objects are recolored based solely on the parity of their own size (pixel count).\n3.  Update the facts and metrics based on this revised understanding.\n4.  The Coder phase will need to implement this simpler logic.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nUsing `tool_code` to analyze object sizes and parities for all examples:\n"
