Grid Properties:
  - Grid dimensions vary across examples.
  - Background color is consistently white (0).

Objects:
  - The primary objects of interest are contiguous areas of azure (8) pixels. Adjacency is 4-way (horizontal/vertical).
  - Other colors are absent or irrelevant to the transformation.
  - Azure objects vary in size and shape.
  - The number of azure objects varies per example.

Transformation:
  - Action: Recolor azure (8) objects.
  - Target Objects: All contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels.
  - Color Mapping Rule:
      - Determine the size (number of pixels) of each individual azure object.
      - Check the parity (Even or Odd) of the object's size.
      - If the object's size is Even, recolor all its pixels to Red (2).
      - If the object's size is Odd, recolor all its pixels to Blue (1).
  - Non-target Pixels: Pixels that are not part of an azure object remain unchanged.
  - Output Grid: Same dimensions as the input grid.

Derived Properties (Not Directly Used in Final Rule):
  - The total count of azure pixels across all objects varies.
  - The parity of the total count of azure pixels is not required for the transformation rule.
