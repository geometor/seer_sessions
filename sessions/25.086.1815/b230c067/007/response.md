"""
Recolor azure (8) objects based on geometric properties: solidity and size/area difference.

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects composed of azure (8) pixels using 4-way adjacency.
3.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Calculate its size (number of pixels).
    b.  Determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing the object).
    c.  Calculate the area of the bounding box (height * width).
    d.  Compare the object's size to its bounding box area.
    e.  **Rule 1:** If the object's size is equal to its bounding box area (it's a "solid block"), recolor all pixels of the object to Red (2) in the output grid.
    f.  **Rule 2:** If the object's size is *not* equal to its bounding box area:
        i.  Calculate the difference: `diff = bounding_box_area - size`.
        ii. Check if the object's size is Even or Odd.
        iii. If the `diff` is exactly 1 AND the object's size is Even, recolor all pixels of the object to Red (2) in the output grid.
        iv. Otherwise (if `diff` is not 1, OR if the object's size is Odd), recolor all pixels of the object to Blue (1) in the output grid.
4.  Pixels not part of any azure object remain unchanged.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
