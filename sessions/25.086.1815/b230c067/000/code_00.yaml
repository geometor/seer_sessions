elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: azure_objects
  - type: object
    identifier: azure_object
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - contiguity: pixels are connected (sharing sides, not just corners)
      - shape: variable
      - location: fixed within the grid
      - pixel_count: integer > 0

derived_properties:
  - property: total_azure_pixels
    description: Sum of pixel_count for all azure_objects in the input grid.
    value_type: integer
  - property: total_azure_parity
    description: Parity (odd or even) of total_azure_pixels.
  - property: object_pixel_parity
    description: Parity (odd or even) of pixel_count for an individual azure_object.

transformations:
  - action: recolor_objects
    input: azure_objects
    output: blue_objects (1) or red_objects (2)
    rule: >
      The output color depends on two factors:
      1. The parity of the total number of azure pixels in the input grid (total_azure_parity).
      2. The parity of the number of pixels in the specific azure object being considered (object_pixel_parity).
    conditions:
      - if: total_azure_parity is EVEN
        then:
          - if: object_pixel_parity is ODD, output_color = blue (1)
          - if: object_pixel_parity is EVEN, output_color = red (2)
      - if: total_azure_parity is ODD
        then:
          - if: object_pixel_parity is ODD, output_color = red (2)
          - if: object_pixel_parity is EVEN, output_color = blue (1)

relationships:
  - The shape and position of each output colored object (blue or red) are identical to the corresponding input azure object.
  - White background pixels remain unchanged.
