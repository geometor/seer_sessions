Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples).
2.  **Colors Involved:** The input grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Background Preservation:** The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged between input and output.
4.  **Object Transformation:** The azure (8) pixels in the input form distinct, contiguous objects (shapes). In the output, these exact shapes reappear in the same locations but are colored either entirely blue (1) or entirely red (2). No azure pixels remain in the output.
5.  **Coloring Rule:** The core transformation logic determines whether an azure object becomes blue or red. Observing the examples, it seems related to the number of pixels (the size) of each object.
    *   In `train_1`, objects with 9 pixels become blue, and the object with 8 pixels becomes red.
    *   In `train_2`, objects with 10 pixels become blue, and the object with 7 pixels becomes red.
    *   In `train_3`, objects with 5 pixels become blue, and the object with 4 pixels becomes red.
6.  **Pattern Discovery:** The rule seems to involve the parity (odd/even) of the pixel count for each object.
    *   In `train_1` and `train_3`: Odd count -> Blue (1), Even count -> Red (2).
    *   In `train_2`: Odd count -> Red (2), Even count -> Blue (1). The rule appears inverted.
7.  **Refined Pattern:** The inversion in `train_2` suggests a higher-level condition might be influencing the primary rule. Let's examine the *total* number of azure pixels in each input grid.
    *   `train_1`: Total azure pixels = 26 (even). Rule: Odd->Blue, Even->Red.
    *   `train_2`: Total azure pixels = 27 (odd). Rule: Odd->Red, Even->Blue.
    *   `train_3`: Total azure pixels = 14 (even). Rule: Odd->Blue, Even->Red.
8.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies all azure objects. It then checks the parity of the *total* number of azure pixels in the grid. Based on this total parity, it applies one of two coloring rules to each individual object based on that object's own pixel count parity.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - contains: azure_objects
  - type: object
    identifier: azure_object
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - contiguity: pixels are connected (sharing sides, not just corners)
      - shape: variable
      - location: fixed within the grid
      - pixel_count: integer > 0

derived_properties:
  - property: total_azure_pixels
    description: Sum of pixel_count for all azure_objects in the input grid.
    value_type: integer
  - property: total_azure_parity
    description: Parity (odd or even) of total_azure_pixels.
  - property: object_pixel_parity
    description: Parity (odd or even) of pixel_count for an individual azure_object.

transformations:
  - action: recolor_objects
    input: azure_objects
    output: blue_objects (1) or red_objects (2)
    rule: >
      The output color depends on two factors:
      1. The parity of the total number of azure pixels in the input grid (total_azure_parity).
      2. The parity of the number of pixels in the specific azure object being considered (object_pixel_parity).
    conditions:
      - if: total_azure_parity is EVEN
        then:
          - if: object_pixel_parity is ODD, output_color = blue (1)
          - if: object_pixel_parity is EVEN, output_color = red (2)
      - if: total_azure_parity is ODD
        then:
          - if: object_pixel_parity is ODD, output_color = red (2)
          - if: object_pixel_parity is EVEN, output_color = blue (1)

relationships:
  - The shape and position of each output colored object (blue or red) are identical to the corresponding input azure object.
  - White background pixels remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all distinct contiguous objects formed by azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Keep track of the coordinates of the pixels belonging to each object.
3.  Calculate the total number of azure (8) pixels across all identified objects in the input grid.
4.  Determine the parity (odd or even) of this total count (`total_azure_parity`).
5.  For each identified azure object:
    a.  Count the number of pixels within that specific object.
    b.  Determine the parity (odd or even) of this object's pixel count (`object_pixel_parity`).
    c.  Apply the coloring rule:
        i.  If `total_azure_parity` is EVEN:
            *   If `object_pixel_parity` is ODD, set the color for this object's pixels in the output grid to blue (1).
            *   If `object_pixel_parity` is EVEN, set the color for this object's pixels in the output grid to red (2).
        ii. If `total_azure_parity` is ODD:
            *   If `object_pixel_parity` is ODD, set the color for this object's pixels in the output grid to red (2).
            *   If `object_pixel_parity` is EVEN, set the color for this object's pixels in the output grid to blue (1).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
