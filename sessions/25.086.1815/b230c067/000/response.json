            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10 in the examples).\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The input grids contain only white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The output grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Background Preservation:** The white (0) background pixels remain unchanged between input and output.\n4.  **Object Transformation:** The azure (8) pixels in the input form distinct, contiguous objects (shapes). In the output, these exact shapes reappear in the same locations but are colored either entirely blue (1) or entirely red (2). No azure pixels remain in the output.\n5.  **Coloring Rule:** The core transformation logic determines whether an azure object becomes blue or red. Observing the examples, it seems related to the number of pixels (the size) of each object.\n    *   In `train_1`, objects with 9 pixels become blue, and the object with 8 pixels becomes red.\n    *   In `train_2`, objects with 10 pixels become blue, and the object with 7 pixels becomes red.\n    *   In `train_3`, objects with 5 pixels become blue, and the object with 4 pixels becomes red.\n6.  **Pattern Discovery:** The rule seems to involve the parity (odd/even) of the pixel count for each object.\n    *   In `train_1` and `train_3`: Odd count -> Blue (1), Even count -> Red (2).\n    *   In `train_2`: Odd count -> Red (2), Even count -> Blue (1). The rule appears inverted.\n7.  **Refined Pattern:** The inversion in `train_2` suggests a higher-level condition might be influencing the primary rule. Let's examine the *total* number of azure pixels in each input grid.\n    *   `train_1`: Total azure pixels = 26 (even). Rule: Odd->Blue, Even->Red.\n    *   `train_2`: Total azure pixels = 27 (odd). Rule: Odd->Red, Even->Blue.\n    *   `train_3`: Total azure pixels = 14 (even). Rule: Odd->Blue, Even->Red.\n8.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies all azure objects. It then checks the parity of the *total* number of azure pixels in the grid. Based on this total parity, it applies one of two coloring rules to each individual object based on that object's own pixel count parity.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
