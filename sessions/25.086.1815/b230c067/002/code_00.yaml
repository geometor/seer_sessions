task_description: Recolor azure (8) objects based on the relationship between the parity of the total number of azure pixels and the parity of the size of each individual object.

definitions:
  azure_object: A contiguous group of azure (8) pixels, using 4-way adjacency (up, down, left, right).
  total_azure_pixels: The sum of the sizes (number of pixels) of all azure_objects in the input grid.
  total_parity: The parity (Even or Odd) of total_azure_pixels. (0=Even, 1=Odd)
  object_size: The number of pixels in a single azure_object.
  object_parity: The parity (Even or Odd) of object_size. (0=Even, 1=Odd)
  output_colors: {blue: 1, red: 2}

rule:
  condition: Compare total_parity and object_parity for each azure_object.
  action:
    - if total_parity == object_parity: Recolor the azure_object to red (2).
    - if total_parity != object_parity: Recolor the azure_object to blue (1).
  unaffected_pixels: All non-azure pixels remain unchanged.

examples:
  example_1:
    total_azure_pixels: 26
    total_parity: 0 # Even
    objects:
      - id: 1
        size: 8
        object_parity: 0 # Even
        resulting_color: 2 # Red (0 == 0)
      - id: 2
        size: 9
        object_parity: 1 # Odd
        resulting_color: 1 # Blue (0 != 1)
      - id: 3
        size: 9
        object_parity: 1 # Odd
        resulting_color: 1 # Blue (0 != 1)
    matches_expected: True
  example_2:
    total_azure_pixels: 28
    total_parity: 0 # Even
    objects:
      - id: 1
        size: 8
        object_parity: 0 # Even

      - id: 3
        size: 10
        object_parity: 0 # Even
        resulting_color: 2 # Red (0 == 0)
    matches_expected: False # The provided Expected Output differs from the rule derived from Ex1 & Ex3. Code output matches this derivation.
  example_3:

      - id: 1
        size: 5
        object_parity: 1 # Odd
        resulting_color: 1 # Blue (0 != 1)
      - id: 2
        size: 4
        object_parity: 0 # Even
        resulting_color: 2 # Red (0 == 0)
