"""
Identifies all distinct contiguous objects formed by azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
Calculates the total number of azure pixels in the grid to determine the 'total parity' (odd or even).
For each individual azure object, calculates its pixel count to determine its 'object parity' (odd or even).
Recolors each azure object based on a rule combining the 'total parity' and the 'object parity':
- If total parity is EVEN: Objects with ODD pixel counts become blue (1), objects with EVEN pixel counts become red (2).
- If total parity is ODD: Objects with ODD pixel counts become red (2), objects with EVEN pixel counts become blue (1).
White (0) background pixels remain unchanged.
