task_description: Analyze input grid to identify non-background objects, sort them by height, and represent their color and relative height in the output grid.

definitions:
  - object: A contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color. Contiguity includes diagonals (8-way connectivity).
  - background_color: white (0).
  - object_color: The color (1-9) of the pixels forming an object.
  - object_height: The number of rows spanned by the object (maximum row index - minimum row index + 1).

input_features:
  - grid: A 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - objects: Multiple non-white objects exist within the grid.

output_features:
  - grid: A 2D array representing object properties.
  - grid_dimensions:
      height: Equals the maximum height found among all input objects.
      width: Equals the total number of distinct non-white objects found in the input.
  - columns: Each column corresponds to one input object.
  - column_order: Objects are assigned to columns from left to right based on descending object_height. (Tie-breaking rules are not explicitly defined by examples but could be based on color or original position if needed).
  - column_content: The j-th column (0-indexed) contains the color of the j-th object (in the sorted list) in its top H_j cells, where H_j is the height of that object. Remaining cells below are background_color (0).

transformations:
  - 1_find_objects: Identify all distinct contiguous non-white objects in the input grid.
  - 2_calculate_properties: For each object, determine its color and height.
  - 3_sort_objects: Sort the identified objects in descending order based on their height.
  - 4_determine_output_size: Find the maximum height (H_max) among all objects and the total number of objects (N). Output grid size is H_max x N.
  - 5_populate_output: Create an H_max x N grid initialized with white (0). For each object j (from 0 to N-1) in the sorted list, fill the top H_j cells of column j with the object's color C_j.
