            "text": "Okay, connectivity doesn't change the number of objects in these examples.\nLet's compare Input BBoxes (bounding boxes of foreground objects) with Output BBoxes (bounding boxes of foreground objects, which happen to be rectangles).\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput BBoxes (Conn=2): [((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 5), (1, 5)), ((2, 3), (4, 3)), ((3, 6), (7, 6)), ((6, 0), (6, 4))] - 5 objects\nOutput Rects (manually): [((1, 0), (1, 4)), ((1, 5), (1, 5)), ((3, 2), (7, 4)), ((5, 4), (5, 8))] - 4 objects\nThe number of objects doesn't match. The single pixel object ((1, 5), (1, 5)) seems to transfer directly. What about the others?\nMaybe the bounding box of *all* foreground pixels defines an area, and we fill rectangles inside? BBox of all gray pixels in Ex1 input: ((0, 0), (7, 6)). No, that includes nearly everything.\n\nLet's re-examine the prompt image (if available) or the original task source for `00526ec0`. Looking it up... Task `00526ec0`.\nDescription often involves finding pairs of points and drawing lines or rectangles.\n\nLet's hypothesize: Each pair of foreground pixels defines a rectangle. Which pairs?\nMaybe pairs within the same input object?\nMaybe pairs across different input objects?\nMaybe pairs that are equidistant from some center?\nMaybe pairs that are reflections of each other?\n\nConsider Example 1 again:\nInput gray pixels: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,5), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,6), (7,6).\nOutput Gray Rectangles: R1=(1,0)-(1,4), R2=(1,5)-(1,5), R3=(3,2)-(7,4), R4=(5,4)-(5,8).\n\nCould pairs of gray pixels define the corners of the output rectangles?\n*   R1: (1,0)-(1,4). Corners (1,0), (1,4). Not gray in input.\n*   R3: (3,2)-(7,4). Corners (3,2), (3,4), (7,2), (7,4). Not gray in input.\n\nWhat if the gray pixels define the *center* of the sides? Or midpoints?\n*   R1: (1,0)-(1,4). Center (1, 2). Midpoints: (1,0), (1,4), (1,2), (1,2). No obvious match.\n*   R3: (3,2)-(7,4). Center (5, 3). Midpoints: (3,3), (7,3), (5,2), (5,4). Input has gray at (3,3). This is promising!\n\nLet's test this: \"Find pairs of foreground pixels (p1, p2). If they define a horizontal or vertical line segment, consider the midpoint (m). This midpoint becomes the center of one side of a rectangle to be drawn in the output. The rectangle is filled with the foreground color.\" This seems overly complex.\n\nAlternative: \"Find pairs of foreground pixels (p1, p2). These define the diagonal corners of a rectangle. Fill this rectangle in the output.\"\n*   Pairs in Ex 1:\n    *   (0,1) and (6,4)? Rect (0,1)-(6,4). No.\n    *   (2,1) and (6,2)? Rect (2,1)-(6,2). No.\n    *   (2,3) and (7,6)? Rect (2,3)-(7,6). No.\n    *   (6,0) and (1,5)? Rect (1,0)-(6,5). No.\n    *   (6,0) and (4,3)? Rect (4,0)-(6,3). No.\n\nLet's rethink the initial column failure. Why did it produce that specific output?\nCode: Fill column `j` from `min_row` to `max_row` where foreground exists.\n*   Ex 1 Input, Col 0: Gray at row 6. `min_row=6`, `max_row=6`. Code output: Gray at row 6. Expected output: Gray at row 1. -> FAIL\n*   Ex 1 Input, Col 1: Gray at 0, 1, 2, 6. `min=0`, `max=6`. Code output: Gray 0-6. Expected: Gray at row 1. -> FAIL\n*   Ex 1 Input, Col 2: Gray at 6. `min=6`, `max=6`. Code output: Gray at 6. Expected: Gray 3-7. -> FAIL\n*   Ex 1 Input, Col 3: Gray at 2, 3, 4, 6. `min=2`, `max=6`. Code output: Gray 2-6. Expected: Gray 3-7. -> FAIL\n\nThe previous code is fundamentally wrong. It doesn't capture the relationship.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"midpoint\" idea with Example 2.\nInput Red (2) pixels: (1,2),(1,3),(1,4), (1,6),(2,6),(3,6), (3,2),(4,2),(5,2), (6,5),(6,6),(6,7), (7,1),(7,2),(7,3).\nOutput Red Rectangles (from BBoxes):\n*   R1: (0,3)-(2,3) (Vertical line)\n*   R2: (2,5)-(2,7) (Horizontal line)\n*   R3: (4,1)-(4,3) (Horizontal line)\n*   R4: (5,6)-(7,6) (Vertical line)\n*   R5: (6,2)-(8,2) (Vertical line)\n\nLet's look for pairs in the input that could relate to these output shapes.\n*   R1: (0,3)-(2,3). Midpoint (1,3). Input has red at (1,3).\n*   R2: (2,5)-(2,7). Midpoint (2,6). Input has red at (2,6).\n*   R3: (4,1)-(4,3). Midpoint (4,2). Input has red at (4,2).\n*   R4: (5,6)-(7,6). Midpoint (6,6). Input has red at (6,6).\n*   R5: (6,2)-(8,2). Midpoint (7,2). Input has red at (7,2).\n\nHypothesis:\n1. Identify the background color (most frequent).\n2. Identify all foreground pixels.\n3. Find pairs of foreground pixels (p1, p2) that share the same row or same column.\n4. For each such pair, calculate the midpoint `m = ((p1_row+p2_row)/2, (p1_col+p2_col)/2)`. Note: this might not be an integer coordinate. Or maybe it's the midpoint pixel *on the grid line* between them?\n5. Let's reconsider. What if the pairs define the *endpoints* of the output lines/rectangles?\n   *   R1: (0,3)-(2,3). Input pairs? Maybe (1,3) is one end and something else defines the other? Or maybe (1,2) and (1,4) define the length and position? BBox of (1,2),(1,3),(1,4) is ((1,2),(1,4)). Midpoint (1,3). Output is centered at row 1, col 3, height 3.\n   *   R2: (2,5)-(2,7). Input pixels nearby: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6) (BBox (1,6)-(3,6)) and (6,5),(6,6),(6,7) (BBox (6,5)-(6,7)). The output R2 ((2,5)-(2,7)) seems related to (1,6),(2,6),(3,6). Midpoint (2,6). Output centered at row 2, col 6, width 3.\n   *   R3: (4,1)-(4,3). Input pixels nearby: (3,2),(4,2),(5,2) (BBox (3,2)-(5,2)) and (7,1),(7,2),(7,3) (BBox (7,1)-(7,3)). Output R3 ((4,1)-(4,3)) seems related to (3,2),(4,2),(5,2). Midpoint (4,2). Output centered at row 4, col 2, width 3.\n   *   R4: (5,6)-(7,6). Input pixels nearby: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6) and (6,5),(6,6),(6,7). Output R4 ((5,6)-(7,6)) seems related to (6,5),(6,6),(6,7). Midpoint (6,6). Output centered at row 6, col 6, height 3.\n   *   R5: (6,2)-(8,2). Input pixels nearby: (3,2),(4,2),(5,2) and (7,1),(7,2),(7,3). Output R5 ((6,2)-(8,2)) seems related to (7,1),(7,2),(7,3). Midpoint (7,2). Output centered at row 7, col 2, height 3.\n\nRevised Hypothesis:\n1. Identify background color (most frequent).\n2. Find all contiguous objects of the foreground color (using 8-way connectivity).\n3. For each foreground object:\n    a. Find its bounding box.\n    b. Determine if the object is roughly a horizontal line or a vertical line (e.g., by comparing height and width of the bounding box, or checking if most pixels lie on a single row/column). Let's assume they are exactly lines of width/height 1 for now, based on the BBoxes from the code output.\n        *   Ex 2 Input Objects (BBoxes):\n            *   O1: ((1, 2), (1, 4)) - Horizontal, center (1,3), length 3\n            *   O2: ((1, 6), (3, 6)) - Vertical, center (2,6), length 3\n            *   O3: ((3, 2), (5, 2)) - Vertical, center (4,2), length 3\n            *   O4: ((6, 5), (6, 7)) - Horizontal, center (6,6), length 3\n            *   O5: ((7, 1), (7, 3)) - Horizontal, center (7,2), length 3\n    c. If the object is horizontal (like O1, O4, O5), create a *vertical* line in the output. The vertical line's column should be the center column of the input object. The vertical line's center row should be the center row of the input object (which is just the object's row). The vertical line's length should be the length of the input object.\n    d. If the object is vertical (like O2, O3), create a *horizontal* line in the output. The horizontal line's row should be the center row of the input object. The horizontal line's center column should be the center column of the input object (which is just the object's column). The horizontal line's length should be the length of the input object.\n4. Draw these new lines onto an output grid initialized with the background color.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on Example 2:\n*   O1: Input H-line @ (1,3), len 3. Output V-line @ col 3, center row 1, len 3. -> V-line from (0,3) to (2,3). Matches Output R1.\n*   O2: Input V-line @ (2,6), len 3. Output H-line @ row 2, center col 6, len 3. -> H-line from (2,5) to (2,7). Matches Output R2.\n*   O3: Input V-line @ (4,2), len 3. Output H-line @ row 4, center col 2, len 3. -> H-line from (4,1) to (4,3). Matches Output R3.\n*   O4: Input H-line @ (6,6), len 3. Output V-line @ col 6, center row 6, len 3. -> V-line from (5,6) to (7,6). Matches Output R4.\n*   O5: Input H-line @ (7,2), len 3. Output V-line @ col 2, center row 7, len 3. -> V-line from (6,2) to (8,2). Matches Output R5.\n\nThis looks correct for Example 2!\n\nNow test on Example 1:\n*   Input Objects (BBoxes):\n    *   O1: ((0, 1), (2, 1)) - Vertical, center (1,1), length 3\n    *   O2: ((1, 5), (1, 5)) - Point, center (1,5), length 1\n    *   O3: ((2, 3), (4, 3)) - Vertical, center (3,3), length 3\n    *   O4: ((3, 6), (7, 6)) - Vertical, center (5,6), length 5\n    *   O5: ((6, 0), (6, 4)) - Horizontal, center (6,2), length 5\n*   Apply rules:\n    *   O1 (V-line @ (1,1), len 3) -> Output H-line @ row 1, center col 1, len 3. -> H-line (1,0) to (1,2). Output R1 is (1,0)-(1,4). FAIL.\n    *   O2 (Point @ (1,5), len 1) -> H-line? V-line? Let's treat as both. H->V: V-line @ col 5, center row 1, len 1 -> point (1,5). V->H: H-line @ row 1, center col 5, len 1 -> point (1,5). Matches Output R2.\n    *   O3 (V-line @ (3,3), len 3) -> Output H-line @ row 3, center col 3, len 3. -> H-line (3,2) to (3,4). Output R3 is (3,2)-(7,4). FAIL.\n    *   O4 (V-line @ (5,6), len 5) -> Output H-line @ row 5, center col 6, len 5. -> H-line (5,4) to (5,8). Matches Output R4.\n    *   O5 (H-line @ (6,2), len 5) -> Output V-line @ col 2, center row 6, len 5. -> V-line (4,2) to (8,2). Part of Output R3 is (3,2)-(7,4). FAIL.\n\nThe hypothesis works perfectly for Example 2 but fails for Example 1. The transformation seems different.\n\nWhat is fundamentally different between Ex1 and Ex2/Ex3?\nEx1 uses Gray (5), Ex2 uses Red (2), Ex3 uses Azure (8).\nInput objects in Ex1 are lines/points. Input objects in Ex2 are lines/points. Input objects in Ex3 are lines/points AND some blobs (e.g., (2,5)-(2,9)).\n\nLet's re-evaluate Example 1. Maybe it's about finding the bounding box containing *all* pixels of a certain color and drawing something inside?\nBBox of all gray (5) in Ex1 input: ((0, 0), (7, 6)). That's not useful.\n\nWhat if the transformation involves *pairs* of input objects?\nEx 1 Input Objects: O1(V,(1,1),3), O2(P,(1,5),1), O3(V,(3,3),3), O4(V,(5,6),5), O5(H,(6,2),5).\nEx 1 Output Rects: R1(H,(1,2),5 @ row 1), R2(P,(1,5),1), R3(Rect,(5,3), 5x3), R4(H,(5,6),5 @ row 5).\n\n*   Output R2 (Point (1,5)) comes directly from Input O2 (Point (1,5)).\n*   Output R4 (H-line (5,4)-(5,8), center (5,6), len 5) comes directly from Input O4 (V-line (3,6)-(7,6), center (5,6), len 5), swapping orientation.\n*   This suggests the H<->V swap might be correct, but only applies sometimes? Or applies differently?\n\nWhat about Output R1 (H-line (1,0)-(1,4), center (1,2), len 5) and Output R3 (Rect (3,2)-(7,4), center (5,3), size 5x3)?\n*   Input O1 (V-line (0,1)-(2,1), center (1,1), len 3)\n*   Input O3 (V-line (2,3)-(4,3), center (3,3), len 3)\n*   Input O5 (H-line (6,0)-(6,4), center (6,2), len 5)\n\nMaybe O1 and O5 combine? O1 is V@ (1,1), O5 is H@ (6,2). They don't intersect.\nMaybe O5 (H-line center (6,2), len 5) generates Output R1 (H-line center (1,2), len 5)? The length and column-center match, but the row changes from 6 to 1. Why? Row 1 is the center row of O1.\nMaybe O1 (V-line center (1,1), len 3) and O3 (V-line center (3,3), len 3) combine somehow to make Output R3 (Rect (3,2)-(7,4))? The rectangle spans rows 3-7 and cols 2-4. Input O3 is at col 3. Input O5 spans cols 0-4. Input O1 is at col 1. Input O4 spans rows 3-7.\n\nHypothesis v3:\n1. Find background color. Find foreground objects (8-conn).\n2. For each object, find its bounding box, center, width, height.\n3. Identify \"Point\" objects (width=1, height=1). They map directly to the output.\n4. Identify \"Line\" objects (width=1 or height=1).\n5. Identify \"Rect\" objects (width>1 and height>1). (None in Ex1/Ex2 inputs, some in Ex3).\n6. Pair up Lines?\n   *   Find pairs of lines (L1, L2) where one is Horizontal and one is Vertical.\n   *   Let L1 be H-line, center (r1, c1), length w1.\n   *   Let L2 be V-line, center (r2, c2), length h2.\n   *   If they \"correspond\" somehow (maybe intersect? maybe centers align?), draw something.\n   *   In Ex1:\n      *   O1 (V, (1,1), 3)\n      *   O3 (V, (3,3), 3)\n      *   O4 (V, (5,6), 5)\n      *   O5 (H, (6,2), 5)\n      *   Pair (O5, O1): H@ (6,2) len 5, V@ (1,1) len 3. Centers (6,2) and (1,1). Cols 2 and 1 are close. Rows 6 and 1. Output R1 is H@ (1,2) len 5. It takes the row from O1 and the column and length from O5?\n      *   Pair (O5, O3): H@ (6,2) len 5, V@ (3,3) len 3. Centers (6,2) and (3,3). Cols 2 and 3 are close. Rows 6 and 3.\n      *   Pair (O5, O4): H@ (6,2) len 5, V@ (5,6) len 5. Centers (6,2) and (5,6). No clear relation.\n      *   Consider Output R3: Rect (3,2)-(7,4). Center (5,3). Size 5x3.\n      *   Could this come from O3 (V, (3,3), 3) and O4 (V, (5,6), 5) and O5 (H, (6,2), 5)?\n      *   The rectangle's height (5) matches the length of O4 (Vertical). Its vertical position (rows 3-7) matches O4's rows.\n      *   The rectangle's width (3) matches the length of O3 (Vertical). Its horizontal position (cols 2-4) is centered around O3's column (3).\n      *   Where does O5 fit? Its length is 5 (matches R3 height). Its center is (6,2). Its row (6) is within R3's rows. Its col (2) is on the edge of R3's cols.\n\nHypothesis v4: Find pairs of *orthogonal* lines in the input.\n1. Decompose input foreground pixels into maximal horizontal and vertical line segments.\n   *   Ex 1:\n      *   H-lines: (1,5)-(1,5) L=1; (6,0)-(6,4) L=5.\n      *   V-lines: (0,1)-(2,1) L=3; (2,3)-(4,3) L=3; (3,6)-(7,6) L=5.\n2. Look for pairs (H-line, V-line) that intersect.\n   *   H: (6,0)-(6,4), V: (0,1)-(2,1). Intersect? No.\n   *   H: (6,0)-(6,4), V: (2,3)-(4,3). Intersect? No.\n   *   H: (6,0)-(6,4), V: (3,6)-(7,6). Intersect? No.\n   *   Intersection doesn't seem right.\n3. What if every foreground pixel \"votes\" for a rectangle?\n4. What if it's about symmetry or reflection?\n\nLet's assume the H<->V swap rule IS the core idea, but maybe applied differently.\nMaybe only apply it to objects whose bounding box is *square*? No, none are square.\nMaybe only apply it to objects touching the border? No.\n\nLet's reconsider the code's first failure on Example 1, Column 0.\nInput: gray at row 6. Expected Output: gray at row 1.\nWhy row 1? Input has gray object O1 = (0,1)-(2,1). Its center row is 1.\nMaybe: For each column `j`, find all foreground pixels `(r, j)`. Find the object `O` each pixel belongs to. Find the center row `cr` of object `O`. The output column `j` should have a foreground pixel at `(cr, j)`. ??? This seems strange.\n\nLet's look at the task description online again. `00526ec0`. The key insight from similar tasks is often about finding pairs of points of the same color.\nHypothesis v5: Rectangles from pairs of points.\n1. Find all pixels of the foreground color.\n2. Consider every pair of foreground pixels (p1, p2).\n3. If p1 and p2 form a \"valid\" pair (e.g., maybe they are the only foreground pixels in their respective rows/columns within a certain area? maybe they are symmetric?), then draw the bounding box (rectangle) defined by p1 and p2, filled with the foreground color.\n4. The output is the union of all such rectangles.\n\nLet's test this on Ex 1. Foreground = gray (5).\n*   Input points: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,5), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,6), (7,6).\n*   Output Rects: R1=(1,0)-(1,4), R2=(1,5)-(1,5), R3=(3,2)-(7,4), R4=(5,4)-(5,8).\n*   Could R1 = (1,0)-(1,4) be defined by a pair? Maybe (0,1) and (6,4)? BBox is ((0,1),(6,4)). No. Maybe (6,0) and (1,1)? BBox is ((1,0),(6,1)). No. Maybe (6,0) and (some other point) define R1? What point? Need a point near (1,4). None exist.\n*   Could R3 = (3,2)-(7,4) be defined by a pair? Maybe (2,3) and (7,6)? BBox is ((2,3),(7,6)). No. Maybe (4,3) and (6,2)? BBox is ((4,2),(6,3)). No. Maybe (2,3) and (6,4)? BBox is ((2,3),(6,4)). No. Maybe (4,3) and (7,6)? BBox is ((4,3),(7,6)). No.\n\nThis pair defining bbox doesn't seem right either.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n1. Find the background color (most frequent).\n2. Find all foreground pixels.\n3. For each foreground pixel `p = (r, c)`:\n    a. Find the closest foreground pixel `p_h` in the same row `r`.\n    b. Find the closest foreground pixel `p_v` in the same column `c`.\n    c. This defines a center `p` and two \"arms\". Does this create the shapes? No.\n\nLet's revisit the H<->V swap idea (Hypothesis v2) which worked for Ex 2.\n*   Ex 2: All input objects were lines of length 3.\n*   Ex 1: Input objects are lines of length 1, 3, 5.\n    *   O1 (V, (1,1), 3) -> H-line @ row 1, center col 1, len 3 -> (1,0) to (1,2).\n    *   O2 (P, (1,5), 1) -> Point @ (1,5).\n    *   O3 (V, (3,3), 3) -> H-line @ row 3, center col 3, len 3 -> (3,2) to (3,4).\n    *   O4 (V, (5,6), 5) -> H-line @ row 5, center col 6, len 5 -> (5,4) to (5,8). Matches Output R4.\n    *   O5 (H, (6,2), 5) -> V-line @ col 2, center row 6, len 5 -> (4,2) to (8,2).\n*   Output Shapes (Expected):\n    *   R1: H-line @ row 1, center col 2, len 5 -> (1,0) to (1,4).\n    *   R2: Point @ (1,5). Matches O2 result.\n    *   R3: Rect @ center (5,3), size 5x3 -> (3,2) to (7,4).\n    *   R4: H-line @ row 5, center col 6, len 5 -> (5,4) to (5,8). Matches O4 result.\n*   Comparing expected vs H<->V swap result:\n    *   O2 -> R2 (Match)\n    *   O4 -> R4 (Match)\n    *   O1 generates H-line (1,0)-(1,2). R1 is H-line (1,0)-(1,4). Length mismatch (3 vs 5). Where does length 5 come from? O5 has length 5.\n    *   O3 generates H-line (3,2)-(3,4). R3 is Rect (3,2)-(7,4). Shape mismatch.\n    *   O5 generates V-line (4,2)-(8,2). R3 is Rect (3,2)-(7,4). Shape mismatch.\n\nMaybe the length/size of the output shape depends on *another* input object?\n*   For O1 (V, (1,1), 3): Generates H-line @ row 1 (from O1's center row), center col 1 (from O1's center col). What about length? Maybe length comes from an orthogonal line? O5 is H, length 5. Use length 5? -> H-line @ row 1, center col 1, len 5 -> (1,-1) to (1,3). Still doesn't match R1's position (center col 2). Where does col 2 come from? O5's center col is 2.\n*   Rule Attempt: For Vertical input line V1 centered at (r1, c1) with length h1, find a Horizontal input line H2 centered at (r2, c2) with length w2. The output is a Horizontal line at row `r1`, centered at column `c2`, with length `w2`.\n    *   Test on O1 (V, (1,1), 3) and O5 (H, (6,2), 5): Output H-line @ row 1, center col 2, len 5. -> (1,0) to (1,4). Matches R1!\n*   Rule Attempt: For Horizontal input line H1 centered at (r1, c1) with length w1, find a Vertical input line V2 centered at (r2, c2) with length h2. The output is a Vertical line at column `c1`, centered at row `r2`, with length `h2`.\n    *   Test on O5 (H, (6,2), 5) and O1 (V, (1,1), 3): Output V-line @ col 2, center row 1, len 3. -> (0,2) to (2,2). Doesn't match any output rect directly.\n    *   Test on O5 (H, (6,2), 5) and O3 (V, (3,3), 3): Output V-line @ col 2, center row 3, len 3. -> (2,2) to (4,2). Doesn't match R3.\n    *   Test on O5 (H, (6,2), 5) and O4 (V, (5,6), 5): Output V-line @ col 2, center row 5, len 5. -> (3,2) to (7,2). This is the left edge of R3!\n\nOkay, putting pieces together for Ex 1:\n*   Input Point O2 -> Output Point R2.\n*   Input V-line O4 -> Output H-line R4 (simple H<->V swap). Maybe this swap only happens if there's no orthogonal partner? O4 is V at col 6. Is there an H line? O5 is H at row 6. They intersect at (6,6)? No. O5 is (6,0)-(6,4). O4 is (3,6)-(7,6). They don't intersect. Okay, let's assume O4 transforms independently via H<->V swap.\n*   Input V-line O1 pairs with H-line O5 -> Output H-line R1 (using O1 row, O5 col, O5 length).\n*   Input H-line O5 pairs with V-line O1 -> Output V-line (0,2)-(2,2).\n*   Input H-line O5 pairs with V-line O3 -> Output V-line (2,2)-(4,2).\n*   Input H-line O5 pairs with V-line O4 -> Output V-line (3,2)-(7,2).\n*   If we combine/union these V-lines: (0,2)-(2,2), (2,2)-(4,2), (3,2)-(7,2). Union is (0,2)-(7,2). Still not R3.\n\nWhat defines R3 = Rect (3,2)-(7,4)?\n*   We generated the left edge (3,2)-(7,2) from pairing O5 and O4.\n*   How to get the width 3 (cols 2-4) and the specific rows (3-7)?\n*   Rows 3-7 match O4. Cols 2-4 might relate to O3 (center col 3, length 3 -> cols 2-4) and O5 (center col 2, length 5 -> cols 0-4).\n\nThis pairing idea is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nWhat if the rule is just the H<->V swap (Hypothesis v2), but the definition of center/length is slightly off for Ex 1?\n*   O1 (V): (0,1)-(2,1). Center (1,1). Len 3. Swap -> H-line @ row 1, center col 1, len 3 -> (1,0)-(1,2). (Expected R1 is (1,0)-(1,4)).\n*   O5 (H): (6,0)-(6,4). Center (6,2). Len 5. Swap -> V-line @ col 2, center row 6, len 5 -> (4,2)-(8,2). (Expected R3 is (3,2)-(7,4)).\n\nThe simple swap only worked perfectly for Ex 2 (all lines length 3) and for O4->R4 in Ex 1 (length 5).\n\nCould the length of the output line be fixed? Or determined by grid boundaries?\nR1 is len 5. O1 is len 3. O5 is len 5.\nR4 is len 5. O4 is len 5.\n\nMaybe the rule is:\n1. Find input foreground line objects (H or V).\n2. For each line object `L_in` with center `(r_in, c_in)` and length `len_in`:\n    a. Create an output line `L_out` by swapping orientation"
