            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 10x10. They contain a background of white (0) pixels. There is always a single 2x2 square object composed of azure (8) pixels. Additionally, there are exactly four other single, non-white, non-azure pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are also 10x10 and predominantly white (0). The only non-white pixels form a 2x2 square located at the *same position* as the azure (8) square was in the input grid.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The colors of the four pixels within the 2x2 output square correspond exactly to the colors of the four scattered, non-azure, non-white pixels from the input grid.\n4.  **Positional Mapping:** The key transformation involves mapping the four scattered input pixels to the four positions within the 2x2 output square. Observing the examples suggests a quadrant-based mapping:\n    *   The input grid can be divided into four equal 5x5 quadrants: Top-Left (rows 0-4, cols 0-4), Top-Right (rows 0-4, cols 5-9), Bottom-Left (rows 5-9, cols 0-4), and Bottom-Right (rows 5-9, cols 5-9).\n    *   Each of the four scattered input pixels resides in a unique quadrant.\n    *   The pixel from the input's Top-Left quadrant maps to the Top-Left position of the 2x2 output square.\n    *   The pixel from the input's Top-Right quadrant maps to the Top-Right position of the 2x2 output square.\n    *   The pixel from the input's Bottom-Left quadrant maps to the Bottom-Left position of the 2x2 output square.\n    *   The pixel from the input's Bottom-Right quadrant maps to the Bottom-Right position of the 2x2 output square.\n5.  **Central Object Role:** The 2x2 azure (8) square in the input acts solely as a marker to determine the location of the 2x2 colored square in the output. Its color (azure) does not appear in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
