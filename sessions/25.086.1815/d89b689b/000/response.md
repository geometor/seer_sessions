Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 10x10. They contain a background of white (0) pixels. There is always a single 2x2 square object composed of azure (8) pixels. Additionally, there are exactly four other single, non-white, non-azure pixels scattered throughout the grid.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are also 10x10 and predominantly white (0). The only non-white pixels form a 2x2 square located at the *same position* as the azure (8) square was in the input grid.
3.  **Color Transformation:** The colors of the four pixels within the 2x2 output square correspond exactly to the colors of the four scattered, non-azure, non-white pixels from the input grid.
4.  **Positional Mapping:** The key transformation involves mapping the four scattered input pixels to the four positions within the 2x2 output square. Observing the examples suggests a quadrant-based mapping:
    *   The input grid can be divided into four equal 5x5 quadrants: Top-Left (rows 0-4, cols 0-4), Top-Right (rows 0-4, cols 5-9), Bottom-Left (rows 5-9, cols 0-4), and Bottom-Right (rows 5-9, cols 5-9).
    *   Each of the four scattered input pixels resides in a unique quadrant.
    *   The pixel from the input's Top-Left quadrant maps to the Top-Left position of the 2x2 output square.
    *   The pixel from the input's Top-Right quadrant maps to the Top-Right position of the 2x2 output square.
    *   The pixel from the input's Bottom-Left quadrant maps to the Bottom-Left position of the 2x2 output square.
    *   The pixel from the input's Bottom-Right quadrant maps to the Bottom-Right position of the 2x2 output square.
5.  **Central Object Role:** The 2x2 azure (8) square in the input acts solely as a marker to determine the location of the 2x2 colored square in the output. Its color (azure) does not appear in the output.

    output: coordinates (top-left row, top-left column) of the marker_square.
  - action: define_quadrants
    input: input_grid_dimensions (10x10)
    output: Four quadrant regions (TL, TR, BL, BR).
      - TL: rows 0-4, cols 0-4
      - TR: rows 0-4, cols 5-9
      - BL: rows 5-9, cols 0-4
      - BR: rows 5-9, cols 5-9
  - action: locate_source_pixels
    input: input_grid
    output: List of four tuples, each containing (color, row, column) for a source_pixel.
  - action: assign_pixels_to_quadrants
    input: source_pixels coordinates, quadrant definitions
    output: Mapping of each source_pixel color to its quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR). Assumes one pixel per quadrant.
  - action: construct_output
    steps:
      - Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white/0).
      - Get the location (r, c) of the input marker_square.
      - Place the color from the TL source_pixel at output grid position (r, c).
      - Place the color from the TR source_pixel at output grid position (r, c+1).
      - Place the color from the BL source_pixel at output grid position (r+1, c).
      - Place the color from the BR source_pixel at output grid position (r+1, c+1).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling all cells with the background color white (0).
2.  Find the 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. Record the row and column index of its top-left corner, let's call them `target_row` and `target_col`.
3.  Identify the four pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* azure (8). These are the source pixels.
4.  Determine the quadrant for each source pixel based on its row and column index within the 10x10 grid:
    *   Top-Left Quadrant (TL): row < 5 and column < 5
    *   Top-Right Quadrant (TR): row < 5 and column >= 5
    *   Bottom-Left Quadrant (BL): row >= 5 and column < 5
    *   Bottom-Right Quadrant (BR): row >= 5 and column >= 5
5.  Retrieve the color of the source pixel located in the Top-Left quadrant and place this color in the output grid at position (`target_row`, `target_col`).
6.  Retrieve the color of the source pixel located in the Top-Right quadrant and place this color in the output grid at position (`target_row`, `target_col` + 1).
7.  Retrieve the color of the source pixel located in the Bottom-Left quadrant and place this color in the output grid at position (`target_row` + 1, `target_col`).
8.  Retrieve the color of the source pixel located in the Bottom-Right quadrant and place this color in the output grid at position (`target_row` + 1, `target_col` + 1).
9.  Return the completed output grid.
