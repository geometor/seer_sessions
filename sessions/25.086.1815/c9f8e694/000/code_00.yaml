task_type: color_replacement
grid_properties:
  - dimensions_preserved: True # Input and output grids have the same height and width.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: gray (5)
      - color: various (1-9, found primarily in column 0) # Blue, Red, Green, Yellow in examples
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels exist within rows and columns. The first column (index 0) plays a special role.
  - type: dependency
    description: The output color of a pixel depends on its input color and its row's corresponding color in the first column of the input grid.
actions:
  - name: identify_row_color
    inputs:
      - input_grid
      - row_index
    outputs:
      - color_value (from input_grid[row_index][0])
    description: Determine the color present in the first column of a specific row.
  - name: replace_color_in_row
    inputs:
      - input_grid_row
      - target_color: gray (5)
      - replacement_color: (determined by identify_row_color for that row)
    outputs:
      - modified_grid_row
    description: For a given row, replace all pixels of the target color (gray) with the replacement color.
constants:
  - name: background_color
    value: white (0)
    description: This color is unchanged.
  - name: target_color
    value: gray (5)
    description: This is the color to be replaced.
  - name: reference_column_index
    value: 0
    description: The column index used to determine the replacement color for each row.
rules:
  - description: If an input pixel is white (0), the output pixel remains white (0).
  - description: If an input pixel is in the first column (index 0), its color remains unchanged in the output.
  - description: If an input pixel at `(r, c)` is gray (5), its output color becomes the color of the input pixel at `(r, 0)`.
  - description: All other input pixels (non-white, non-gray, not in the first column) seem to retain their color, although the examples primarily focus on white, gray, and the first column colors. Assuming based on the pattern that any other color would also be replaced if it were gray, or remain unchanged otherwise. (Focus is on gray replacement).
