            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids in both examples maintain the same dimensions (12x12).\n2.  **Color Preservation:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged between input and output. The colored pixels in the very first column (column index 0) also remain unchanged.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The key transformation involves the gray pixels (5) present in the input grids. These gray pixels are consistently replaced in the output grids.\n4.  **Transformation Source:** The color used to replace the gray pixels in any given row appears to be determined by the color present in the first cell (column 0) of that same row in the *input* grid.\n5.  **Row-Based Operation:** The transformation operates independently on each row. The color replacement within a row is dictated solely by the color in the first column of that specific row. For instance, if `input[r][0]` is green (3), all gray (5) pixels in row `r` (i.e., `input[r][c] == 5`) become green (3) in the output (`output[r][c] = 3`). This pattern holds true for all non-zero colors found in the first column across both examples (green, yellow, blue, red).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
