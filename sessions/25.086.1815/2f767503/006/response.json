It is immediately to the *right* of the gray line, not the left. Its row (7) is within the gray line's row span (6-8).\n*   Changes occur at: (7, 0), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5).\n*   Relationship?\n    *   The changes are all Yellow -> Orange.\n    *   The changed rows (7, 8) correspond to the maroon row and the row below it.\n    *   The changed columns (0, 3, 4, 5) have no obvious relation to the gray (col 6) or maroon (col 7) columns.\n    *   What if the maroon pixel's *position relative to the gray line* defines the transformation area, but not in the way the original code assumed?\n    *   Gray line height = 3. Maroon is in the middle row of the gray line (row 7 out of 6,7,8).\n    *   Maybe the transformation affects a region *relative* to the maroon pixel?\n    *   Look at relative coordinates from the maroon pixel (7, 7):\n        *   (7, 0) -> (0, -7)\n        *   (7, 4) -> (0, -3)\n        *   (8, 0) -> (+1, -7)\n        *   (8, 3) -> (+1, -4)\n        *   (8, 4) -> (+1, -3)\n        *   (8, 5) -> (+1, -2)\n    *   This doesn't form a simple rectangle or shape.\n    *   Let's rethink the bounding box idea from the original code, but adapt it.\n        *   Original `r_start_box = r_min_gray` (6)\n        *   Original `r_end_box = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1)` = 8 + (7 - 6 + 1) = 8 + 2 = 10\n        *   Original `c_start_box = c_gray + 2` (using corrected formula if `c_m == c_gray - 1`) - N/A here.\n        *   Original `c_end_box = c_gray + height_gray * 2` = 6 + 3 * 2 = 12\n    *   What if the trigger is different? Maybe `c_m == c_gray + 1` (maroon to the right)?\n        *   For Ex 2: `7 == 6 + 1` -> True. And `r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray` -> `6 <= 7 <= 8` -> True. So, Ex 2 *would* trigger if the condition was maroon to the right.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate Ex 1 with this potential trigger: Gray line is horizontal `(7,1)-(7,3)`. Maroon is `(8,2)`. This doesn't fit the \"maroon to the right of a vertical gray line\" pattern.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate Ex 3 with this potential trigger:\n            Input: Vertical gray line `(1,4)-(3,4)`. Maroon `(2,3)`.\n            `c_gray=4`, `r_min=1`, `r_max=3`. `r_m=2`, `c_m=3`.\n            Trigger `c_m == c_gray + 1`: `3 == 4 + 1` -> `3 == 5` (False).\n            Original trigger `c_m == c_gray - 1`: `3 == 4 - 1` -> `3 == 3` (True).\n            Row alignment `r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`: `1 <= 2 <= 3` (True).\n            So Ex 3 matches the original trigger (maroon left), and the code worked.\n\n    *   This suggests there might be *two* distinct cases or a more general rule:\n        1.  Maroon is LEFT of Vertical Gray Line (Ex 3 worked).\n        2.  Maroon is RIGHT of Vertical Gray Line (Ex 2 failed, but maybe should trigger).\n        3.  Gray line is HORIZONTAL (Ex 1 failed, maybe needs different rule).\n\n    *   Let's focus on the \"Maroon Right\" case (Ex 2) and see if we can define a transformation that matches the 6 changed pixels.\n        *   Gray: col 6, rows 6-8. Maroon: (7, 7).\n        *   Changes: (7, 0), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5). All Yellow -> Orange.\n        *   Maybe the transformation isn't a bounding box, but reflects or copies something?\n        *   Look at the area to the *left* of the gray line. Columns 0-5.\n        *   Row 7 left of gray: `4 7 7 7 4 7`\n        *   Row 8 left of gray: `4 7 7 4 4 4`\n        *   Compare with changed pixels' original colors (Yellow=4):\n            *   (7, 0) was 4. Corresponds to (7, 0) left of gray.\n            *   (7, 4) was 4. Corresponds to (7, 4) left of gray.\n            *   (8, 0) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 0) left of gray.\n            *   (8, 3) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 3) left of gray.\n            *   (8, 4) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 4) left of gray.\n            *   (8, 5) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 5) left of gray.\n        *   Hypothesis: If the maroon pixel is to the RIGHT of the vertical gray line, find all YELLOW pixels in the rows spanned by the gray line, located to the LEFT of the gray line. Change these yellow pixels to orange.\n        *   Let's test this hypothesis on Example 2:\n            *   Gray rows: 6, 7, 8. Gray col: 6. Maroon (7,7) is right (`c_m == c_gray + 1`).\n            *   Find yellow pixels where `r in [6, 7, 8]` and `c < 6`.\n            *   Row 6, c < 6: `(6, 1)=4`, `(6, 2)=4`.\n            *   Row 7, c < 6: `(7, 0)=4`, `(7, 4)=4`.\n            *   Row 8, c < 6: `(8, 0)=4`, `(8, 3)=4`, `(8, 4)=4`, `(8, 5)=4`.\n            *   This identifies 8 yellow pixels: `(6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,4), (8,0), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)`.\n            *   The actual changed pixels were: `(7,0), (7,4), (8,0), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)`. 6 pixels.\n            *   This hypothesis identified the correct 6 pixels *plus* two extra ones in row 6: `(6,1)` and `(6,2)`.\n            *   Why are rows 7 and 8 affected, but not row 6?\n            *   The maroon pixel is in row 7. Maybe only rows from the maroon pixel down to the bottom of the gray line are considered? `r >= r_m` and `r <= r_max_gray`. In Ex 2, this means rows 7 and 8.\n            *   Let's refine: Hypothesis 2: If maroon is RIGHT of vertical gray line (`c_m == c_gray + 1` and row aligned), find all YELLOW pixels where `r_m <= r <= r_max_gray` and `c < c_gray`. Change these yellow pixels to orange.\n            *   Test on Ex 2: `r_m=7`, `r_max_gray=8`. `c_gray=6`. Find yellow pixels with `r in [7, 8]` and `c < 6`.\n                *   Row 7, c < 6: `(7, 0)=4`, `(7, 4)=4`.\n                *   Row 8, c < 6: `(8, 0)=4`, `(8, 3)=4`, `(8, 4)=4`, `(8, 5)=4`.\n                *   These are exactly the 6 pixels that change in the expected output! This looks promising for the \"Maroon Right\" case.\n\n    *   **Example 3 (Success):**\n        *   Vertical gray line: col 4, rows 1-3. `c_gray=4`, `r_min=1`, `r_max=3`. Height=3.\n        *   Maroon pixel: (2, 3). `r_m=2`, `c_m=3`.\n        *   Trigger: Maroon is LEFT of Vertical Gray Line (`c_m == c_gray - 1` and row aligned). `3 == 4 - 1` (True), `1 <= 2 <= 3` (True).\n        *   The original code worked. Let's analyze its transformation for this case.\n        *   Bounding Box Calculation:\n            *   `height_gray = 3`\n            *   `r_start_box = r_min_gray = 1`\n            *   `r_end_box = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1) = 3 + (2 - 1 + 1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n            *   `c_start_box = c_gray + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6` (Since `c_m = c_gray - 1`)\n            *   `c_end_box = c_gray + height_gray * 2 = 4 + 3 * 2 = 10`\n        *   Box: rows 1-5, columns 6-10.\n        *   Input Grid:\n            "

Yellow pixels (color 4) are changed to orange (color 7) based on this relationship.\n        *   **Case 1: Vertical Gray Line, Maroon Left**\n            *   Trigger: A single contiguous vertical gray line exists, and a single maroon pixel exists immediately to its left (`c_m == c_gray - 1`) and vertically aligned (`r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`).\n            *   Action: Define a bounding box:\n                *   `r_start = r_min_gray`\n                *   `r_end = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1)`\n                *   `c_start = c_gray + 2`\n                *   `c_end = c_gray + (r_max_gray - r_min_gray + 1) * 2` (gray height * 2)\n            *   Change all yellow pixels within this bounding box (inclusive, respecting grid boundaries) to orange. (Matches Example 3's success).\n        *   **Case 2: Vertical Gray Line, Maroon Right**\n            *   Trigger: A single contiguous vertical gray line exists, and a single maroon pixel exists immediately to its right (`c_m == c_gray + 1`) and vertically aligned (`r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`).\n            *   Action: Identify the region defined by rows `r_m` to `r_max_gray` (inclusive) and columns strictly less than `c_gray`.\n            *   Change all yellow pixels within this region to orange. (Matches refined analysis of Example 2).\n        *   **Case 3: Horizontal Gray Line?**\n            *   Trigger: A single contiguous horizontal gray line exists, and a single maroon pixel exists immediately below it (`r_m == r_gray + 1`) and horizontally aligned (`c_min_gray <= c_m <= c_max_gray`). (This fits Example 1: Gray at y=7, x=1-3; Maroon at y=8, x=2).\n            *   Action: Unknown based on Example 1. The changes `(2,1), (2,2), (5,2)` don't have a clear relationship derived from the gray/maroon positions using simple geometry or bounding boxes found so far. Perhaps this case involves finding specific yellow pixel patterns elsewhere in the grid?\n        *   **Other Cases:** What if no gray line, only maroon? What if gray line but no maroon? What if multiple gray lines or maroon pixels? The examples only show one of each. Assume the transformation only applies if exactly one contiguous gray line (vertical or horizontal?) and exactly one maroon pixel exist with the specified spatial relationships. If conditions aren't met, return input unchanged.\n\n4.  **Develop Metrics:**\n    *   Need to verify the number of gray pixels/lines and maroon pixels in each input.\n    *   Verify the relative positions.\n    *   Verify the number and location of yellow pixels changed in the expected output.\n\n5.  **Structure the YAML and NL Program:** Based on the refined hypotheses, focusing on the two clearer vertical line cases first. Acknowledge the uncertainty regarding the horizontal case (Example 1).\n\n**Metrics Gathering Code:**\n"
