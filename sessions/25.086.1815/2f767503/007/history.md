"""
The transformation rule applies conditionally based on the presence and relative positioning of specific structures: a vertical contiguous gray line (color 5) and a single maroon pixel (color 9).

1.  **Identify Structures:**
    *   Search for a contiguous vertical line composed solely of gray pixels (color 5). Determine its column index (`c_gray`), top row index (`r_min_gray`), and bottom row index (`r_max_gray`).
    *   Search for a maroon pixel (color 9) and determine its coordinates (`r_m`, `c_m`).

2.  **Check Trigger Condition:**
    *   The transformation is triggered *only if* both the vertical gray line and the maroon pixel exist, *and* the maroon pixel is located immediately to the left of the gray line (i.e., `c_m == c_gray - 1`) and its row index `r_m` is within the vertical span of the gray line (i.e., `r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`).

3.  **Apply Transformation (if Triggered):**
    *   If the trigger condition is met, calculate a bounding box using parameters derived from the gray line and maroon pixel:
        *   `height_gray = r_max_gray - r_min_gray + 1`
        *   `r_start = r_min_gray`
        *   `r_end = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1)`
        *   `c_start = c_gray + (c_gray - c_m + 1)`
        *   `c_end = c_gray + height_gray * 2`
    *   Iterate through all pixels within this calculated bounding box (inclusive of boundaries).
    *   Change any yellow pixel (color 4) found within this bounding box to orange (color 7).
    *   All other pixels remain unchanged.

4.  **No Transformation (if Not Triggered):**
    *   If the trigger condition is not met (e.g., no vertical gray line, no maroon pixel, or incorrect relative positioning), the input grid is returned completely unchanged.

Okay, the tool code shows 6 differences, not 5 or 7. Let's re-examine the grids and my manual comparison based on the tool output:
Expected Output (from results):

```
...
[7 4 4 7 7 7 5 7 7 4 4 7]
[7 7 7 7 7 7 5 9 7 7 7 4]  <- Row 7
[7 7 7 7 7 7 5 7 7 7 4 4]  <- Row 8
...
```

Input Grid (Transformed Output):

```
...
[7 4 4 7 7 7 5 7 7 4 4 7]
[4 7 7 7 4 7 5 9 7 7 7 4]  <- Row 7
[4 7 7 4 4 4 5 7 7 7 4 4]  <- Row 8
...
```

Diff indices: `(array([7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8]), array([0, 4, 0, 3, 4, 5]))`
This translates to:
*   (7, 0): Expected=7, Input=4 -> Diff 1
*   (7, 4): Expected=7, Input=4 -> Diff 2
*   (8, 0): Expected=7, Input=4 -> Diff 3
*   (8, 3): Expected=7, Input=4 -> Diff 4
*   (8, 4): Expected=7, Input=4 -> Diff 5
*   (8, 5): Expected=7, Input=4 -> Diff 6

There are indeed 6 different pixels. The results message "Pixels Off: 7" is incorrect. All 6 pixels change from Yellow (4) to Orange (7).

Now, let's reconsider Example 2's transformation rule:
*   Vertical gray line: col 6, rows 6-8. Height=3.
*   Maroon pixel: (7, 7). It is immediately to the *right* of the gray line, not the left. Its row (7) is within the gray line's row span (6-8).
*   Changes occur at: (7, 0), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5).
*   Relationship?
    *   The changes are all Yellow -> Orange.
    *   The changed rows (7, 8) correspond to the maroon row and the row below it.
    *   The changed columns (0, 3, 4, 5) have no obvious relation to the gray (col 6) or maroon (col 7) columns.
    *   What if the maroon pixel's *position relative to the gray line* defines the transformation area, but not in the way the original code assumed?
    *   Gray line height = 3. Maroon is in the middle row of the gray line (row 7 out of 6,7,8).
    *   Maybe the transformation affects a region *relative* to the maroon pixel?
    *   Look at relative coordinates from the maroon pixel (7, 7):
        *   (7, 0) -> (0, -7)
        *   (7, 4) -> (0, -3)
        *   (8, 0) -> (+1, -7)
        *   (8, 3) -> (+1, -4)
        *   (8, 4) -> (+1, -3)
        *   (8, 5) -> (+1, -2)
    *   This doesn't form a simple rectangle or shape.
    *   Let's rethink the bounding box idea from the original code, but adapt it.
        *   Original `r_start_box = r_min_gray` (6)
        *   Original `r_end_box = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1)` = 8 + (7 - 6 + 1) = 8 + 2 = 10
        *   Original `c_start_box = c_gray + 2` (using corrected formula if `c_m == c_gray - 1`) - N/A here.
        *   Original `c_end_box = c_gray + height_gray * 2` = 6 + 3 * 2 = 12
    *   What if the trigger is different? Maybe `c_m == c_gray + 1` (maroon to the right)?
        *   For Ex 2: `7 == 6 + 1` -> True. And `r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray` -> `6 <= 7 <= 8` -> True. So, Ex 2 *would* trigger if the condition was maroon to the right.
        *   Let's re-evaluate Ex 1 with this potential trigger: Gray line is horizontal `(7,1)-(7,3)`. Maroon is `(8,2)`. This doesn't fit the "maroon to the right of a vertical gray line" pattern.
        *   Let's re-evaluate Ex 3 with this potential trigger:
            Input: Vertical gray line `(1,4)-(3,4)`. Maroon `(2,3)`.
            `c_gray=4`, `r_min=1`, `r_max=3`. `r_m=2`, `c_m=3`.
            Trigger `c_m == c_gray + 1`: `3 == 4 + 1` -> `3 == 5` (False).
            Original trigger `c_m == c_gray - 1`: `3 == 4 - 1` -> `3 == 3` (True).
            Row alignment `r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`: `1 <= 2 <= 3` (True).
            So Ex 3 matches the original trigger (maroon left), and the code worked.

    *   This suggests there might be *two* distinct cases or a more general rule:
        1.  Maroon is LEFT of Vertical Gray Line (Ex 3 worked).
        2.  Maroon is RIGHT of Vertical Gray Line (Ex 2 failed, but maybe should trigger).
        3.  Gray line is HORIZONTAL (Ex 1 failed, maybe needs different rule).

    *   Let's focus on the "Maroon Right" case (Ex 2) and see if we can define a transformation that matches the 6 changed pixels.
        *   Gray: col 6, rows 6-8. Maroon: (7, 7).
        *   Changes: (7, 0), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5). All Yellow -> Orange.
        *   Maybe the transformation isn't a bounding box, but reflects or copies something?
        *   Look at the area to the *left* of the gray line. Columns 0-5.
        *   Row 7 left of gray: `4 7 7 7 4 7`
        *   Row 8 left of gray: `4 7 7 4 4 4`
        *   Compare with changed pixels' original colors (Yellow=4):
            *   (7, 0) was 4. Corresponds to (7, 0) left of gray.
            *   (7, 4) was 4. Corresponds to (7, 4) left of gray.
            *   (8, 0) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 0) left of gray.
            *   (8, 3) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 3) left of gray.
            *   (8, 4) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 4) left of gray.
            *   (8, 5) was 4. Corresponds to (8, 5) left of gray.
        *   Hypothesis: If the maroon pixel is to the RIGHT of the vertical gray line, find all YELLOW pixels in the rows spanned by the gray line, located to the LEFT of the gray line. Change these yellow pixels to orange.
        *   Let's test this hypothesis on Example 2:
            *   Gray rows: 6, 7, 8. Gray col: 6. Maroon (7,7) is right (`c_m == c_gray + 1`).
            *   Find yellow pixels where `r in [6, 7, 8]` and `c < 6`.
            *   Row 6, c < 6: `(6, 1)=4`, `(6, 2)=4`.
            *   Row 7, c < 6: `(7, 0)=4`, `(7, 4)=4`.
            *   Row 8, c < 6: `(8, 0)=4`, `(8, 3)=4`, `(8, 4)=4`, `(8, 5)=4`.
            *   This identifies 8 yellow pixels: `(6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,4), (8,0), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)`.
            *   The actual changed pixels were: `(7,0), (7,4), (8,0), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)`. 6 pixels.
            *   This hypothesis identified the correct 6 pixels *plus* two extra ones in row 6: `(6,1)` and `(6,2)`.
            *   Why are rows 7 and 8 affected, but not row 6?
            *   The maroon pixel is in row 7. Maybe only rows from the maroon pixel down to the bottom of the gray line are considered? `r >= r_m` and `r <= r_max_gray`. In Ex 2, this means rows 7 and 8.
            *   Let's refine: Hypothesis 2: If maroon is RIGHT of vertical gray line (`c_m == c_gray + 1` and row aligned), find all YELLOW pixels where `r_m <= r <= r_max_gray` and `c < c_gray`. Change these yellow pixels to orange.
            *   Test on Ex 2: `r_m=7`, `r_max_gray=8`. `c_gray=6`. Find yellow pixels with `r in [7, 8]` and `c < 6`.
                *   Row 7, c < 6: `(7, 0)=4`, `(7, 4)=4`.
                *   Row 8, c < 6: `(8, 0)=4`, `(8, 3)=4`, `(8, 4)=4`, `(8, 5)=4`.
                *   These are exactly the 6 pixels that change in the expected output! This looks promising for the "Maroon Right" case.

    *   **Example 3 (Success):**
        *   Vertical gray line: col 4, rows 1-3. `c_gray=4`, `r_min=1`, `r_max=3`. Height=3.
        *   Maroon pixel: (2, 3). `r_m=2`, `c_m=3`.
        *   Trigger: Maroon is LEFT of Vertical Gray Line (`c_m == c_gray - 1` and row aligned). `3 == 4 - 1` (True), `1 <= 2 <= 3` (True).
        *   The original code worked. Let's analyze its transformation for this case.
        *   Bounding Box Calculation:
            *   `height_gray = 3`
            *   `r_start_box = r_min_gray = 1`
            *   `r_end_box = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1) = 3 + (2 - 1 + 1) = 3 + 2 = 5`
            *   `c_start_box = c_gray + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6` (Since `c_m = c_gray - 1`)
            *   `c_end_box = c_gray + height_gray * 2 = 4 + 3 * 2 = 10`
        *   Box: rows 1-5, columns 6-10.
        *   Input Grid:
            
```
            7 4 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
            4 4 7 7 5 7 7 4 7 7 7 7 7  <- Gray (1,4), Yellow (1,1), (1,7)
            4 4 7 9 5 7 7 4 7 4 4 7 7  <- Maroon(2,3), Gray(2,4), Yellow(2,1),(2,7),(2,9),(2,10)
            7 7 7 7 5 7 7 4 7 4 7 7 4  <- Gray(3,4), Yellow(3,7),(3,9),(3,12)
            7 7 7 7 7 7 7 4 7 7 7 7 7  <- Yellow (4,7)
            7 7 7 7 7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7 7  <- Yellow (5,6),(5,7),(5,8)
            ...
            ```

        *   Find Yellow (4) within box (rows 1-5, cols 6-10):
            *   (1, 7)
            *   (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 10)
            *   (3, 7), (3, 9)
            *   (4, 7)
            *   (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
        *   Total: 10 yellow pixels inside the box.
        *   Expected Output:
            
```
            7 4 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
            4 4 7 7 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7  <- (1,7) changed 4->7
            4 4 7 9 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7  <- (2,7) 4->7, (2,9) 4->7, (2,10) 4->7
            7 7 7 7 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 4  <- (3,7) 4->7, (3,9) 4->7
            7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7  <- (4,7) changed 4->7
            7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7  <- (5,6) 4->7, (5,7) 4->7, (5,8) 4->7
            ...
            ```

        *   Indeed, all 10 yellow pixels identified within the bounding box are changed to orange. The bounding box logic seems correct for the "Maroon Left" case.

    *   **Example 1 (Revisited):**
        *   Gray line is horizontal: `(7,1)-(7,3)`. Length 3.
        *   Maroon pixel: `(8,2)`. Below the center of the gray line.
        *   Changes: `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(5,2)`. Yellow -> Orange.
        *   This doesn't fit the "Maroon Left" or "Maroon Right" vertical line cases.
        *   Could there be a third case for horizontal gray lines?
        *   Maybe the transformation depends only on the maroon pixel if the gray line is horizontal? Or maybe the gray line isn't relevant here?
        *   What if the trigger is simply the presence of a maroon pixel?
            *   Ex 1: Maroon at (8,2). Changes at (2,1), (2,2), (5,2).
            *   Ex 2: Maroon at (7,7). Changes at (7,0), (7,4), (8,0), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5).
            *   Ex 3: Maroon at (2,3). Changes at (1,7), (2,7), (2,9), (2,10), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8).
        *   No clear pattern emerges just based on the maroon pixel position relative to the changes.
        *   Let's reconsider Example 1. Gray line (horizontal) `(7,1)-(7,3)`. Maroon `(8,2)`. Changes `(2,1), (2,2), (5,2)`. All are Yellow -> Orange.
        *   Is there something special about column 2 (maroon column)? Changes happen in cols 1 and 2.
        *   Is there something special about row 8 (maroon row)? Changes happen in rows 2 and 5.
        *   What if the concept is "reflection"?
            *   Reflecting the maroon pixel (8,2) across the gray line (y=7)? Would land at (6,2). Doesn't seem helpful.
        *   Look at the structure near the changes in Ex 1.
            *   Row 2: `7 4 4 7 7 7 4 7 7 7` -> `7 7 7 7 7 7 4 7 7 7` (changed `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`)
            *   Row 5: `4 7 4 7 7 7 7 7 7 7` -> `4 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7` (changed `(5,2)`)
        *   Maybe the gray line / maroon pixel isn't the key, but just indicates *that* a transformation occurs, and the transformation itself is about something else?
        *   In Ex 1, the changed pixels `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(5,2)` are all yellow.
        *   Are there other yellow pixels? Yes: `(0,0), (0,1), (0,5), (0,6), (0,8), (1,0), (1,6), (1,8), (4,5), (5,0), (6,3), (6,5), (7,6), (9,9)`. Why are only `(2,1), (2,2), (5,2)` changed?
        *   What if the rule involves finding *all* yellow pixels and filtering them based on some condition?
        *   The condition might relate to the gray/maroon structure after all.
        *   Let's reconsider the grid structure relative to the gray line `(7,1)-(7,3)` and maroon `(8,2)`.
        *   Maybe the transformation is related to finding specific patterns of yellow pixels? The changed pixels `(2,1), (2,2)` are adjacent. `(5,2)` is isolated from them.
        *   This example is tricky. Let's stick to refining the rules for Examples 2 and 3, which seem clearer.

3.  **Refine Hypotheses and NL Program:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** The transformation depends on the relative position of a single maroon pixel (color 9) and a contiguous gray line (color 5). Yellow pixels (color 4) are changed to orange (color 7) based on this relationship.
        *   **Case 1: Vertical Gray Line, Maroon Left**
            *   Trigger: A single contiguous vertical gray line exists, and a single maroon pixel exists immediately to its left (`c_m == c_gray - 1`) and vertically aligned (`r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`).
            *   Action: Define a bounding box:
                *   `r_start = r_min_gray`
                *   `r_end = r_max_gray + (r_m - r_min_gray + 1)`
                *   `c_start = c_gray + 2`
                *   `c_end = c_gray + (r_max_gray - r_min_gray + 1) * 2` (gray height * 2)
            *   Change all yellow pixels within this bounding box (inclusive, respecting grid boundaries) to orange. (Matches Example 3's success).
        *   **Case 2: Vertical Gray Line, Maroon Right**
            *   Trigger: A single contiguous vertical gray line exists, and a single maroon pixel exists immediately to its right (`c_m == c_gray + 1`) and vertically aligned (`r_min_gray <= r_m <= r_max_gray`).
            *   Action: Identify the region defined by rows `r_m` to `r_max_gray` (inclusive) and columns strictly less than `c_gray`.
            *   Change all yellow pixels within this region to orange. (Matches refined analysis of Example 2).
        *   **Case 3: Horizontal Gray Line?**
            *   Trigger: A single contiguous horizontal gray line exists, and a single maroon pixel exists immediately below it (`r_m == r_gray + 1`) and horizontally aligned (`c_min_gray <= c_m <= c_max_gray`). (This fits Example 1: Gray at y=7, x=1-3; Maroon at y=8, x=2).
            *   Action: Unknown based on Example 1. The changes `(2,1), (2,2), (5,2)` don't have a clear relationship derived from the gray/maroon positions using simple geometry or bounding boxes found so far. Perhaps this case involves finding specific yellow pixel patterns elsewhere in the grid?
        *   **Other Cases:** What if no gray line, only maroon? What if gray line but no maroon? What if multiple gray lines or maroon pixels? The examples only show one of each. Assume the transformation only applies if exactly one contiguous gray line (vertical or horizontal?) and exactly one maroon pixel exist with the specified spatial relationships. If conditions aren't met, return input unchanged.

4.  **Develop Metrics:**
    *   Need to verify the number of gray pixels/lines and maroon pixels in each input.
    *   Verify the relative positions.
    *   Verify the number and location of yellow pixels changed in the expected output.

5.  **Structure the YAML and NL Program:** Based on the refined hypotheses, focusing on the two clearer vertical line cases first. Acknowledge the uncertainty regarding the horizontal case (Example 1).
