Comparing the examples, the transformation seems conditional. The condition appears related to the configuration of the gray line and the adjacent maroon pixel.\n7.  **Nature of Change:** In Example 3, *some* yellow pixels (4) are changed to orange (7). The gray line, the maroon pixel, and other yellow pixels remain unchanged.\n8.  **Condition Analysis:**\n    *   Example 1: Horizontal gray line. Maroon pixel below it. No change.\n    *   Example 2: Vertical gray line. Maroon pixel to its right. No change.\n    *   Example 3: Vertical gray line. Maroon pixel to its left. Change occurs.\n9.  **Rule Identification:** The transformation happens *if and only if* there is a vertical gray line and the maroon pixel is located immediately to the *left* of any part of that vertical gray line.\n10. **Transformation Detail:** When the condition is met (Example 3), the vertical gray line is located in column 4. The yellow pixels that change to orange are all located in columns *greater than* 4 (i.e., to the right of the vertical gray line). Yellow pixels in column 4 or less remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
