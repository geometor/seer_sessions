    property: fills most of the grid
  - object: gray_line

transformation_trigger:
  condition: A gray_line exists AND it is vertical AND the maroon_pixel is located in the cell immediately to the left (column index - 1) of any cell occupied by the vertical gray_line.

action_if_triggered:
  target: yellow_pixels
  condition: Only applies to yellow_pixels whose column index is greater than the column index of the vertical gray_line.
  effect: Change the color of the targeted yellow_pixels to orange (7).

action_if_not_triggered:
  effect: The output grid is identical to the input grid.
