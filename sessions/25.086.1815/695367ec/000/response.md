Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The inputs are square grids (2x2, 3x3, 4x4) completely filled with a single, non-white color (azure, green, red).
2.  **Output:** The outputs are always 15x15 grids.
3.  **Transformation:** The output grid is a pattern formed by horizontal and vertical lines using the color from the input grid. The background (non-line area) is white (color 0).
4.  **Pattern Logic:** The spacing of the lines is determined by the size of the input grid. If the input grid is NxN, the lines appear at rows and columns whose index `k` (0-based) satisfies `(k + 1) % (N + 1) == 0`.
5.  **Color Mapping:** The color of the lines in the output grid is the same as the uniform color of the input grid.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the size `N` of the input grid (it has dimensions NxN).
2.  Identify the uniform color `C` present in the input grid.
3.  Calculate the grid line spacing interval `I` by adding 1 to `N` (i.e., `I = N + 1`).
4.  Create a new 15x15 grid, initially filled entirely with white (color 0).
5.  Iterate through each cell of the new 15x15 grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to 14) and column index `c` (from 0 to 14).
6.  For each cell at `(r, c)`, check if `(r + 1)` is divisible by `I` OR if `(c + 1)` is divisible by `I`.
7.  If the condition in step 6 is true, set the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the new grid to the input color `C`.
8.  The resulting 15x15 grid is the output.
