The background (non-line area) is white (color 0).\n4.  **Pattern Logic:** The spacing of the lines is determined by the size of the input grid. If the input grid is NxN, the lines appear at rows and columns whose index `k` (0-based) satisfies `(k + 1) % (N + 1) == 0`.\n5.  **Color Mapping:** The color of the lines in the output grid is the same as the uniform color of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each cell of the new 15x15 grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to 14) and column index `c` (from 0 to 14).\n6.  For each cell at `(r, c)`, check if `(r + 1)` is divisible by `I` OR if `(c + 1)` is divisible by `I`.\n7.  If the condition in step 6 is true, set the color of the cell at `(r, c)` in the new grid to the input color `C`.\n8.  The resulting 15x15 grid is the output."
