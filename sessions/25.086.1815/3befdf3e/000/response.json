This object consists of an outer frame of one color and an inner rectangular region of another color. The output grid is the same size as the input grid but contains a larger version of the object. The output object is constructed by expanding the original object outwards by one pixel layer. The colors within this expanded object are derived from the input object's colors, but their positions are swapped: the area corresponding to the original inner content now takes the original frame's color, and the area corresponding to the original frame now takes the original inner content's color. A new frame, using the original frame's color, is added around this transformed inner region.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
