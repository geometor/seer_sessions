            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\nThe task requires analyzing an input grid containing several distinct, non-overlapping, solid-colored objects on a white background. The goal is to determine a single specific color from the input grid based on the properties and relationships of these objects. The output is always a 1x1 grid containing this single color value.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n1.  The input grid has objects of colors Azure (8), Gray (5), Red (2), Yellow (4), and Orange (7). The output is Gray (5).\n2.  The input grid has objects of colors Magenta (6), Green (3), Blue (1), Orange (7), Red (2), Yellow (4), and Azure (8). The output is Magenta (6).\n3.  The input grid has objects of colors Blue (1), Green (3), Red (2), and Orange (7). The output is Red (2).\n\nThe core logic seems to involve identifying objects, analyzing their adjacency to other objects (specifically, how many *other* colored objects they touch), and potentially using object properties like internal holes or color index as tie-breakers.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Object Identification:** Objects are contiguous blocks of the same non-white color.\n*   **Adjacency:** The critical relationship seems to be cardinal adjacency (sharing a side, not just a corner) between objects of *different* colors.\n*   **Target Property:** The transformation focuses on objects that touch exactly one other distinct colored object.\n*   **Tie-breaking:** When multiple objects satisfy the primary condition (touching exactly one neighbor), secondary properties are needed:\n    *   **Holes:** The presence of internal \"holes\" (white pixels completely enclosed by the object) seems to be the first tie-breaker. Objects with holes are prioritized.\n    *   **Color Index:** If the \"hole\" property doesn't resolve the tie (either multiple candidates have holes or none have holes), the object with the highest color index (numerical value) is chosen.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If the list of candidates contains multiple objects, apply the following tie-breaking rules in order:\n    a.  Filter the candidates to keep only those that contain one or more internal holes. If this results in a non-empty list, use this filtered list for the next step. If it results in an empty list, use the original list of candidates from step 3 for the next step.\n    b.  From the current list of candidates (potentially filtered by holes), select the single object whose color has the highest numerical value (index).\n6.  The final output is a 1x1 grid containing the color of the selected object."
