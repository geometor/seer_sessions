task_description: Identify the color of a specific object within the input grid.
observations:
  - The input grid contains multiple distinct, contiguous objects of different colors (non-white) on a white background.
  - Each object is composed of pixels of a single color.
  - Some objects may contain internal "holes" consisting of white pixels entirely surrounded by the object's pixels.
criteria:
  - Identify all distinct, non-white objects in the grid.
  - For each object, determine if it contains any internal white holes.
  - There is exactly one object per grid that contains an internal white hole.
transformation:
  - Select the object that contains an internal white hole.
  - The output is a 1x1 grid containing the color of the selected object.
hole_definition: A white pixel (color 0) is considered a hole within an object if it is cardinally unreachable from the grid's background (white area outside any object) without passing through a pixel belonging to that object. (This is consistent with `scipy.ndimage.binary_fill_holes`).
