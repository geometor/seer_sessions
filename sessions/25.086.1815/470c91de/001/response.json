Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (Orange=7).\n2. Identify all contiguous shapes in the input grid that are *not* the background color (Orange=7) and *not* the marker color (Azure=8).\n3. For each identified shape:\n    a. Find the single Azure (8) pixel that is adjacent (shares an edge or corner) to any pixel of this shape.\n    b. Determine the direction of translation (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) from the shape towards the adjacent Azure pixel. This is a one-step move.\n    c. Apply this one-step translation to all pixels belonging to the current shape.\n    d. Draw the translated shape onto the output grid using its original color.\n4. Return the completed output grid.
