Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Analysis:** Each input grid contains multiple disconnected groups of colored pixels (objects) scattered on a white background (color 0). The objects vary in size, shape, and color composition.
2.  **Output Analysis:** Each output grid is a smaller grid, representing a cropped section of the corresponding input grid. The output grid itself forms a distinct object or a collection of closely arranged objects from the input.
3.  **Transformation Clues:**
    *   In all examples, the shape presented in the output grid can be found exactly within the input grid.
    *   In examples 2 and 3, the specific shape shown in the output appears *twice* within the input grid. In example 1, the output shape appears once.
    *   Crucially, in all three examples, the shape selected for the output contains gray pixels (color 5). Other shapes present in the inputs (like the blue/red/azure shape in example 1, the orange/red shape in example 2, or the red/azure, magenta, green, yellow shapes in example 3) do *not* contain gray pixels.
4.  **Hypothesis:** The task seems to involve identifying a specific object or composite shape within the input grid based on a unique characteristic â€“ the presence of gray pixels (color 5). Once this target shape is identified, its bounding box is extracted from the input grid to form the output grid. If the target shape appears multiple times, any instance seems valid as they are identical.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Input: 2D grid of pixels (integers 0-9)
  Output: 2D grid of pixels (integers 0-9)

InputGridProperties:
  - Contains multiple distinct Objects (contiguous groups of non-white pixels).
  - Objects have properties: ColorComposition, Shape, Size, Location.
  - Background is white (color 0).

TargetObjectCriteria:
  - Must contain at least one gray pixel (color 5).
  - May appear one or more times in the InputGrid.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify all Objects in the InputGrid.
  - Action: Filter Objects to find the one(s) meeting the TargetObjectCriteria (containing gray pixels).
  - Action: Select one instance of the identified TargetObject.
  - Action: Determine the minimum bounding box containing the selected TargetObject.
  - Action: Extract (crop) the portion of the InputGrid corresponding to the bounding box.

OutputGridProperties:
  - Represents the cropped bounding box of the TargetObject from the InputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to locate all distinct groups of connected, non-white pixels (these are the objects).
2.  Examine each identified object to check if it includes any gray pixels (color 5).
3.  Select the object that contains gray pixels. (Note: Based on the examples, there appears to be only one *unique* shape containing gray pixels, although it might appear multiple times. Select any one instance of this shape).
4.  Calculate the smallest rectangular area (bounding box) that fully encloses the selected object instance.
5.  Create the output grid by copying all pixels from the input grid that fall within this calculated bounding box.
