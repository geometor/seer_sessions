            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Analysis:** Each input grid contains multiple disconnected groups of colored pixels (objects) scattered on a white background (color 0). The objects vary in size, shape, and color composition.\n2.  **Output Analysis:** Each output grid is a smaller grid, representing a cropped section of the corresponding input grid. The output grid itself forms a distinct object or a collection of closely arranged objects from the input.\n3.  **Transformation Clues:**\n    *   In all examples, the shape presented in the output grid can be found exactly within the input grid.\n    *   In examples 2 and 3, the specific shape shown in the output appears *twice* within the input grid. In example 1, the output shape appears once.\n    *   Crucially, in all three examples, the shape selected for the output contains gray pixels (color 5). Other shapes present in the inputs (like the blue/red/azure shape in example 1, the orange/red shape in example 2, or the red/azure, magenta, green, yellow shapes in example 3) do *not* contain gray pixels.\n4.  **Hypothesis:** The task seems to involve identifying a specific object or composite shape within the input grid based on a unique characteristic \u2013 the presence of gray pixels (color 5). Once this target shape is identified, its bounding box is extracted from the input grid to form the output grid. If the target shape appears multiple times, any instance seems valid as they are identical.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
