Data:
  Input: 2D grid of pixels (integers 0-9)
  Output: 2D grid of pixels (integers 0-9)

InputGridProperties:
  - Contains multiple distinct Objects (contiguous groups of non-white pixels).
  - Objects have properties: ColorComposition, Shape, Size, Location.
  - Background is white (color 0).

TargetObjectCriteria:
  - Must contain at least one gray pixel (color 5).
  - May appear one or more times in the InputGrid.

Transformation:
  - Action: Identify all Objects in the InputGrid.
  - Action: Filter Objects to find the one(s) meeting the TargetObjectCriteria (containing gray pixels).
  - Action: Select one instance of the identified TargetObject.
  - Action: Determine the minimum bounding box containing the selected TargetObject.
  - Action: Extract (crop) the portion of the InputGrid corresponding to the bounding box.

OutputGridProperties:
  - Represents the cropped bounding box of the TargetObject from the InputGrid.
