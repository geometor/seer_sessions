            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code successfully solved Example 2 (Orange trigger) but failed on Example 1 (Red trigger). The failure in Example 1 was due to an incorrect cleanup step. The initial hypothesis was that a Red trigger causes *all* Magenta (6) and Maroon (9) pixels to be removed. However, comparing the input and expected output for Example 1 shows that only *one specific* Maroon pixel was removed, while others remained.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Precisely identify the differences between the input and expected output in Example 1, focusing on the Magenta and Maroon pixels.\n2.  Analyze the relationship between the removed pixel(s), the trigger location, the moved pattern, and other grid elements.\n3.  Formulate a revised hypothesis for the cleanup rule associated with the Red trigger.\n4.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the refined understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n"

            "text": "**Analysis Findings:**\n\n1.  **Trigger:** The first trigger pixel encountered is Orange (7) at (0, 1). However, its corresponding pattern (Magenta L + Orange) is *not* present in the input grid.\n2.  **Active Trigger:** The next trigger is Red (2) at (1, 6). Its corresponding pattern (Green L + Azure) *is* present at (9, 0). Therefore, the Red trigger at (1, 6) becomes the *active* trigger.\n3.  **Pattern Movement:** The Green L pattern is correctly erased from (9, 0) and redrawn starting at (1, 8) (trigger row 1 + offset 0, trigger col 6 + offset 2). This matches the expected output.\n4.  **Cleanup:** The only difference between the Magenta/Maroon pixels in the input and expected output is the removal of the Maroon (9) pixel at `(8, 9)`.\n5.  **Cleanup Hypothesis Refinement:**\n    *   The initial simple hypothesis (remove Maroon below the *lowest* Magenta in the same column) predicted removing `(6, 8, 9)`, `(7, 8, 9)`, and `(8, 9, 9)`, which is incorrect.\n    *   The corrected hypothesis (remove Maroon strictly below *any* Magenta in the same column) also predicted removing `(6, 8, 9)`, `(7, 8, 9)`, and `(8, 9, 9)`, which is still incorrect. It only removed `(8, 9, 9)`.\n    *   Let's re-examine `(8, 9, 9)`:\n        *   Color: Maroon (9)\n        *   Location: (8, 9)\n        *   Magenta pixels in the same column (column 9): `(7, 9, 6)`.\n        *   This Maroon pixel `(8, 9)` *is* strictly below the Magenta pixel `(7, 9)`.\n    *   What about the other Maroon pixels that *weren't* removed?\n        *   `(6, 8, 9)`: Magenta in column 8 is at `(5, 8, 6)`. This Maroon pixel is strictly below the Magenta. Why wasn't it removed?\n        *   `(6, 9, 9)`: Magenta in column 9 is at `(7, 9, 6)`. This Maroon pixel is *above* the Magenta.\n        *   `(7, 8, 9)`: Magenta in column 8 is at `(5, 8, 6)`. This Maroon pixel is strictly below the Magenta. Why wasn't it removed?\n    *   The rule \"remove Maroon strictly below Magenta in the same column\" doesn't hold universally.\n    *   **New Hypothesis:** Maybe the cleanup only removes Maroon (9) pixels that are *immediately* below a Magenta (6) pixel in the same column (i.e., `(r+1, c)` is Maroon and `(r, c)` is Magenta)?\n        *   Check `(7, 9, 6)`: The pixel below it is `(8, 9, 9)`. Yes, this matches the pixel that was removed.\n        *   Check `(5, 8, 6)`: The pixel below it is `(6, 8, 9)`. This pixel was *not* removed.\n    *   This hypothesis also fails.\n    *   **Final Attempt Hypothesis:** The cleanup rule for the Red trigger removes only Maroon (9) pixels. It removes a Maroon pixel if and only if there is a Magenta (6) pixel located exactly one row above it *and* one column to its left (i.e., at `(r-1, c-1)` relative to the Maroon pixel at `(r, c)`).\n        *   Check the removed pixel `(8, 9, 9)`: Is there a Magenta (6) at `(8-1, 9-1) = (7, 8)`? Input `input1[7, 8]` is 9 (Maroon). No.\n    *   **Revisit Simplest Idea:** What if the cleanup *only* removes Maroon (9) pixels, and *only* the Maroon pixel that is furthest down and right? In Example 1, `(8, 9, 9)` is the Maroon pixel with the maximum row index (8) and, among those with row 8, the maximum column index (9).\n        *   Input Maroon pixels: `(6, 8, 9)`, `(6, 9, 9)`, `(7, 8, 9)`, `(8, 9, 9)`.\n        *   Max row index is 8, which corresponds to `(8, 9, 9)`.\n        *   This matches the removed pixel `(8, 9, 9)`. This seems the most plausible rule given only one example.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts**\n\n"
