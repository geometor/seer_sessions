Identifies all 'trigger' pixels (Red=2 or Orange=7).
For each trigger, identifies its associated 'mover' pattern (Red -> Green L + Azure, Orange -> Magenta L + Orange) and placement offset (Red -> (0, 2), Orange -> (0, 0)).
Searches the grid for the mover pattern corresponding to the trigger.
The *first* trigger found (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) for which its corresponding mover pattern *also exists* in the grid determines the transformation.
If such a trigger/pattern pair is found:
    1. Erases the original 'mover' pattern from the grid (setting its pixels to white=0).
    2. Redraws the 'mover' pattern at a new location, calculated by adding the placement offset to the location of the *trigger* pixel that initiated the transformation. The new location defines the top-left corner for drawing the pattern.
If no trigger pixel has its corresponding mover pattern present in the grid, the original grid is returned unchanged.

## General Assessment

The provided code successfully implemented the core logic identified from the first example: finding a trigger pixel (Red or Orange), locating its associated pattern (Green L or Magenta L), erasing the pattern from its original location, and redrawing it relative to the trigger pixel using a specific offset.

Example 2 executed correctly, validating this core logic for the Orange trigger and Magenta L pattern.

Example 1 failed. The code correctly identified the Red trigger and Green L pattern and performed the move operation (erase and redraw) accurately. However, the comparison with the expected output failed because the expected output had *additional* changes: specifically, several Magenta (6) and Maroon (9) pixels present in the input were removed in the expected output. These pixels were *not* part of the moved Green L pattern. The code's transformed output correctly left these unrelated pixels untouched.

This indicates an additional rule associated specifically with the Red trigger activation: besides moving the Green L pattern, all Magenta and Maroon pixels should be removed from the grid. The logic for the Orange trigger seems correct as is (only move the associated pattern).

## Metrics Gathering

task_context:
  description: The task involves identifying specific trigger pixels and associated patterns, then moving the pattern based on the trigger's location and type, potentially with additional grid modifications based on the trigger type.
  input_type: 2D grid of integers (colors)
  output_type: 2D grid of integers (colors)
  background_color: 0 (white)

identified_objects:
  - object: trigger_pixel
    properties:
      - color: Red (2) or Orange (7)
      - role: Initiates the transformation. The first trigger (scan order) whose associated pattern exists is the active one.
  - object: mover_pattern
    properties:
      - type: Green L with Azure (associated with Red trigger)
        color_composition: Green (3), Azure (8)
        shape: L-like, 3x4 bounding box
        definition: [(0,0,3), (0,1,3), (0,2,3), (0,3,3), (1,2,8), (1,3,3), (2,3,3)]
        role: Is moved (erased and redrawn) when the Red trigger is active.
      - type: Magenta L with Orange (associated with Orange trigger)
        color_composition: Magenta (6), Orange (7)
        shape: L-like, 3x3 bounding box
        definition: [(0,0,6), (0,1,6), (0,2,6), (1,0,6), (1,1,7), (2,0,6)]
        role: Is moved (erased and redrawn) when the Orange trigger is active.
  - object: removable_pixels
    properties:
      - color: Magenta (6) or Maroon (9)
      - role: Pixels to be removed (set to white/0) ONLY if the active trigger is Red (2). These pixels are distinct from the mover_pattern pixels.

transformation_rules:
  - rule: find_active_trigger_and_pattern
    steps:
      - Scan the input grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right to find all trigger pixels (Red=2 or Orange=7).
      - For each trigger found, check if its associated mover pattern exists anywhere in the grid.
      - The *first* trigger (in scan order) for which the corresponding mover pattern is found becomes the 'active trigger'. Its associated pattern becomes the 'active pattern'.
      - Record the location (top-left corner) of the active trigger and the active pattern.
      - If no such trigger/pattern pair is found, the transformation stops, and the input grid is returned unchanged.
  - rule: perform_move
    steps:
      - Erase the active pattern from its original location by setting its pixels to the background color (white=0).
      - Determine the 'placement offset' based on the active trigger's color: (0, 2) for Red, (0, 0) for Orange.
      - Calculate the new top-left location for the pattern: (active_trigger_row + offset_row, active_trigger_col + offset_col).
      - Redraw the active pattern at the calculated new location.
  - rule: conditional_cleanup (NEW)
    condition: The active trigger color is Red (2).
    steps:
      - After performing the move, iterate through the entire grid.
      - Set any pixel that is Magenta (6) or Maroon (9) to the background color (white=0). This removal happens *after* the pattern has been moved and redrawn.

execution_order:
  - find_active_trigger_and_pattern
  - If an active pair is found:
    - perform_move
    - conditional_cleanup (only if trigger was Red)
  - Return the modified grid.

edge_cases:
  - No trigger pixel found: Return input grid unchanged.
  - Trigger pixel(s) found, but corresponding pattern(s) not found: Return input grid unchanged.
  - Mover pattern overlaps with trigger pixel: Rules still apply as written.
  - Redrawing pattern goes out of bounds: Pixels outside bounds are ignored.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Potential Actions:** Scan the input grid (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to find all 'trigger' pixels, which are either Red (2) or Orange (7). Keep track of their locations and the order found.
2.  **Determine the Active Action:**
    *   For each trigger pixel found, in order:
        *   Identify the 'mover' pattern associated with the trigger's color:
            *   Red (2) trigger is associated with the "Green L with Azure" pattern.
            *   Orange (7) trigger is associated with the "Magenta L with Orange" pattern.
        *   Search the entire grid for the first occurrence (scan order) of this associated mover pattern.
        *   If the associated mover pattern is found, this trigger pixel and its corresponding pattern become the 'active' pair. Stop searching for other trigger/pattern pairs. Record the trigger's location, the pattern's original location (top-left corner), the pattern's definition, and the trigger color.
3.  **Execute Transformation (if an active pair was found):**
    *   Create a copy of the input grid to modify.
    *   **Erase:** Set the pixels belonging to the active mover pattern at its *original* location to the background color (white=0).
    *   **Calculate New Position:** Determine the placement offset based on the active trigger's color: (row\_offset=0, col\_offset=2) for Red, (row\_offset=0, col\_offset=0) for Orange. Calculate the new top-left corner for the pattern by adding the offset to the active trigger pixel's location: `new_row = trigger_row + row_offset`, `new_col = trigger_col + col_offset`.
    *   **Draw:** Draw the active mover pattern at the calculated new position, overwriting any existing pixels. Handle boundary conditions (do not draw outside the grid).
    *   **Conditional Cleanup:** If the active trigger's color was Red (2), iterate through the entire grid *after* the move and set *all* remaining Magenta (6) and Maroon (9) pixels to the background color (white=0). This step is skipped if the active trigger was Orange (7).
4.  **Output:** If an active trigger/pattern pair was found and the transformation executed, return the modified grid. Otherwise (if no active pair was found in step 2), return the original input grid unchanged.
