"""
Identifies all 'trigger' pixels (Red=2 or Orange=7).
For each trigger, identifies its associated 'mover' pattern (Red -> Green L + Azure, Orange -> Magenta L + Orange) and placement offset (Red -> (0, 2), Orange -> (0, 0)).
Searches the grid for the mover pattern corresponding to the trigger.
The *first* trigger found (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right) for which its corresponding mover pattern *also exists* in the grid determines the transformation. This trigger becomes the 'active trigger'.
If such a trigger/pattern pair is found:
    1. Erases the original 'mover' pattern from the grid (setting its pixels to white=0).
    2. Redraws the 'mover' pattern at a new location, calculated by adding the placement offset to the location of the *active trigger* pixel. The new location defines the top-left corner for drawing the pattern.
    3. **Conditional Cleanup:** If the active trigger was Red (2), *after* the pattern move, all remaining Magenta (6) and Maroon (9) pixels in the entire grid are set to white (0). This cleanup does not occur if the active trigger was Orange (7).
If no trigger pixel has its corresponding mover pattern present in the grid, the original grid is returned unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation logic.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code successfully solved Example 2 (Orange trigger) but failed on Example 1 (Red trigger). The failure in Example 1 was due to an incorrect cleanup step. The initial hypothesis was that a Red trigger causes *all* Magenta (6) and Maroon (9) pixels to be removed. However, comparing the input and expected output for Example 1 shows that only *one specific* Maroon pixel was removed, while others remained.

The strategy is to:
1.  Precisely identify the differences between the input and expected output in Example 1, focusing on the Magenta and Maroon pixels.
2.  Analyze the relationship between the removed pixel(s), the trigger location, the moved pattern, and other grid elements.
3.  Formulate a revised hypothesis for the cleanup rule associated with the Red trigger.
4.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the refined understanding.

**Analysis Findings:**

1.  **Trigger:** The first trigger pixel encountered is Orange (7) at (0, 1). However, its corresponding pattern (Magenta L + Orange) is *not* present in the input grid.
2.  **Active Trigger:** The next trigger is Red (2) at (1, 6). Its corresponding pattern (Green L + Azure) *is* present at (9, 0). Therefore, the Red trigger at (1, 6) becomes the *active* trigger.
3.  **Pattern Movement:** The Green L pattern is correctly erased from (9, 0) and redrawn starting at (1, 8) (trigger row 1 + offset 0, trigger col 6 + offset 2). This matches the expected output.
4.  **Cleanup:** The only difference between the Magenta/Maroon pixels in the input and expected output is the removal of the Maroon (9) pixel at `(8, 9)`.
5.  **Cleanup Hypothesis Refinement:**
    *   The initial simple hypothesis (remove Maroon below the *lowest* Magenta in the same column) predicted removing `(6, 8, 9)`, `(7, 8, 9)`, and `(8, 9, 9)`, which is incorrect.
    *   The corrected hypothesis (remove Maroon strictly below *any* Magenta in the same column) also predicted removing `(6, 8, 9)`, `(7, 8, 9)`, and `(8, 9, 9)`, which is still incorrect. It only removed `(8, 9, 9)`.
    *   Let's re-examine `(8, 9, 9)`:
        *   Color: Maroon (9)
        *   Location: (8, 9)
        *   Magenta pixels in the same column (column 9): `(7, 9, 6)`.
        *   This Maroon pixel `(8, 9)` *is* strictly below the Magenta pixel `(7, 9)`.
    *   What about the other Maroon pixels that *weren't* removed?
        *   `(6, 8, 9)`: Magenta in column 8 is at `(5, 8, 6)`. This Maroon pixel is strictly below the Magenta. Why wasn't it removed?
        *   `(6, 9, 9)`: Magenta in column 9 is at `(7, 9, 6)`. This Maroon pixel is *above* the Magenta.
        *   `(7, 8, 9)`: Magenta in column 8 is at `(5, 8, 6)`. This Maroon pixel is strictly below the Magenta. Why wasn't it removed?
    *   The rule "remove Maroon strictly below Magenta in the same column" doesn't hold universally.
    *   **New Hypothesis:** Maybe the cleanup only removes Maroon (9) pixels that are *immediately* below a Magenta (6) pixel in the same column (i.e., `(r+1, c)` is Maroon and `(r, c)` is Magenta)?
        *   Check `(7, 9, 6)`: The pixel below it is `(8, 9, 9)`. Yes, this matches the pixel that was removed.
        *   Check `(5, 8, 6)`: The pixel below it is `(6, 8, 9)`. This pixel was *not* removed.
    *   This hypothesis also fails.
    *   **Final Attempt Hypothesis:** The cleanup rule for the Red trigger removes only Maroon (9) pixels. It removes a Maroon pixel if and only if there is a Magenta (6) pixel located exactly one row above it *and* one column to its left (i.e., at `(r-1, c-1)` relative to the Maroon pixel at `(r, c)`).
        *   Check the removed pixel `(8, 9, 9)`: Is there a Magenta (6) at `(8-1, 9-1) = (7, 8)`? Input `input1[7, 8]` is 9 (Maroon). No.
    *   **Revisit Simplest Idea:** What if the cleanup *only* removes Maroon (9) pixels, and *only* the Maroon pixel that is furthest down and right? In Example 1, `(8, 9, 9)` is the Maroon pixel with the maximum row index (8) and, among those with row 8, the maximum column index (9).
        *   Input Maroon pixels: `(6, 8, 9)`, `(6, 9, 9)`, `(7, 8, 9)`, `(8, 9, 9)`.
        *   Max row index is 8, which corresponds to `(8, 9, 9)`.
        *   This matches the removed pixel `(8, 9, 9)`. This seems the most plausible rule given only one example.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1. Identify Active Trigger and Pattern
    action: Scan the grid top-to-bottom, left-to-right for trigger pixels (Red or Orange).
    condition: For each trigger found, check if its corresponding mover pattern (from trigger_mapping) exists elsewhere in the grid.
    result: The *first* trigger pixel found for which its associated pattern also exists is the 'active trigger'. Store its color, location (r_trig, c_trig), its pattern, the pattern's original location (r_orig, c_orig), and the offset (dr_off, dc_off).
    fallback: If no such trigger/pattern pair is found, return the input grid unchanged.
  - step: 2. Erase Original Pattern
    action: Set all pixels belonging to the mover pattern at its original location (r_orig, c_orig) to White (0).
  - step: 3. Draw Pattern at New Location
    action: Calculate the new top-left corner (r_new, c_new) = (r_trig + dr_off, c_trig + dc_off).
    action_details: Draw the mover pattern starting at (r_new, c_new).
  - step: 4. Conditional Cleanup (if active trigger was Red)
    condition: The active trigger's color was Red (2).
    action: Identify all Maroon (9) pixels in the grid.
    action_details: Find the Maroon pixel(s) with the maximum row index. Among those, find the pixel(s) with the maximum column index. Set this specific Maroon pixel (the one furthest down and right) to White (0).
    rationale: Based on Example 1, only the single Maroon pixel at (8,9) was removed. This pixel had the highest row index (8) and highest column index (9) among all Maroon pixels.
  - step: 5. Return Grid
    action: Return the modified grid.

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Define Patterns and Triggers:**
    *   Identify two specific object patterns: a "Green L" pattern (made of green and azure) and a "Magenta L" pattern (made of magenta and orange).
    *   Identify two "trigger" colors: Red (2) and Orange (7).
    *   Associate the Red trigger with the Green L pattern and a placement offset of (0 rows, +2 columns).
    *   Associate the Orange trigger with the Magenta L pattern and a placement offset of (0 rows, 0 columns).
2.  **Find Active Transformation:**
    *   Scan the input grid (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to find all trigger pixels (Red or Orange).
    *   For each trigger pixel found, check if its associated pattern exists anywhere in the grid.
    *   The *first* trigger pixel encountered (in scan order) whose corresponding pattern is also found determines the transformation. This is the "active trigger".
    *   If no trigger pixel has its corresponding pattern present, stop and return the original grid.
3.  **Execute Transformation:**
    *   Record the location of the active trigger pixel `(r_trig, c_trig)`.
    *   Record the original location (top-left corner) of the associated pattern `(r_orig, c_orig)`.
    *   Record the placement offset `(dr_off, dc_off)` associated with the active trigger's color.
    *   Erase the pattern from its original location `(r_orig, c_orig)` by setting its pixels to white (0).
    *   Calculate the new top-left location for the pattern: `(r_new, c_new) = (r_trig + dr_off, c_trig + dc_off)`.
    *   Draw the pattern at the new location `(r_new, c_new)`.
4.  **Apply Conditional Cleanup:**
    *   If the active trigger's color was Red (2):
        *   Find all Maroon (9) pixels currently in the grid.
        *   Identify the Maroon pixel that is located furthest down (maximum row index). If there's a tie, choose the one among them that is furthest to the right (maximum column index).
        *   Set only this specific Maroon pixel to white (0).
    *   If the active trigger's color was Orange (7), do nothing extra.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
