Task: Move a specific object pattern based on a trigger pixel.

Input_Grid:
  - Contains a background (white, 0).
  - Contains multiple distinct colored objects.
  - Objects_Types:
      - Single_Pixels: Act as triggers. Color determines action. (e.g., Red(2), Orange(7))
      - Composite_Patterns: Specific arrangements of pixels, potentially multi-colored. Some are mobile, others static. (e.g., Green-L+Azure, Magenta-L+Orange, Orange-L, Yellow-L+Gray, etc.)
  - Key_Features:
      - Presence of a unique, single trigger pixel.
      - Presence of a unique instance of the 'mover' pattern corresponding to the trigger.

Output_Grid:
  - Mostly identical to Input_Grid.
  - Differences:
      - The 'mover' pattern is absent from its original location (replaced by white 0).
      - The 'mover' pattern is drawn at a new location.

Transformation:
  - Action: Move (erase and redraw) a specific composite object pattern.
  - Trigger: A single pixel of a specific color.
  - Target_Object: The composite pattern associated with the trigger color.
  - Destination: Determined by the trigger pixel's location plus a color-specific offset.
  - Overwrite: The redrawn pattern overwrites existing pixels at the destination.

Relationships:
  - Trigger_Color -> Mover_Pattern_Type:
      - Red(2) -> Green-L+Azure Pattern
      - Orange(7) -> Magenta-L+Orange Pattern
  - Trigger_Color -> Placement_Offset (relative to trigger pixel location):
      - Red(2) -> (Row_Offset=0, Col_Offset=2)
      - Orange(7) -> (Row_Offset=0, Col_Offset=0)
  - Rule: New_Pattern_TopLeft = Trigger_Location + Placement_Offset
