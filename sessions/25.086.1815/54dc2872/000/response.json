            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The background is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The grids contain distinct objects:\n    *   Some objects are single pixels of a specific color (e.g., the Red pixel in `train_1`, the lone Orange pixel in `train_2`).\n    *   Other objects are composite shapes made of multiple pixels, sometimes involving more than one color in close proximity (e.g., the Green 'L' with an adjacent Azure pixel in `train_1`, the Magenta 'L' with an internal Orange pixel in `train_2`).\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be the movement of one specific composite object pattern. Other objects remain in their original positions.\n4.  **Trigger:** The movement seems to be triggered by the presence of a specific single, isolated pixel. The color of this trigger pixel determines *which* composite object pattern moves.\n    *   In `train_1`, the single Red (2) pixel seems to trigger the movement of the Green/Azure pattern.\n    *   In `train_2`, the single Orange (7) pixel seems to trigger the movement of the Magenta/Orange pattern.\n5.  **Movement Rule:**\n    *   The original instance of the moving pattern is erased (set to white 0).\n    *   The pattern is then redrawn (stamped) at a new location.\n    *   The new location seems related to the trigger pixel's location.\n    *   In `train_2`, the Magenta/Orange pattern's top-left corner moves exactly to the location of the Orange trigger pixel (offset 0, 0).\n    *   In `train_1`, the Green/Azure pattern's top-left corner moves to a location that is offset by (0 rows, +2 columns) relative to the Red trigger pixel's location.\n6.  **Hypothesis:** There's a mapping between trigger pixel colors and specific object patterns + placement offsets. When a trigger pixel is found, its corresponding pattern is located, erased from its original position, and redrawn relative to the trigger pixel using the associated offset.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Scan the input grid to find a single pixel that is isolated (not connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to another pixel of the same color). This is the \"trigger pixel\". Record its color, `C_trigger`, and location, `(R_trigger, C_trigger)`.\n3.  Determine the corresponding \"mover shape pattern\", `P_mover`, and the \"placement offset\", `(dR, dC)`, based on `C_trigger`:\n    *   If `C_trigger` is Red (2), `P_mover` is the pattern consisting of a Green (3) 'L' shape with an adjacent Azure (8) pixel, and the offset `(dR, dC)` is (0, 2).\n    *   If `C_trigger` is Orange (7), `P_mover` is the pattern consisting of a Magenta (6) 'L' shape with an internal Orange (7) pixel, and the offset `(dR, dC)` is (0, 0).\n    *   *(Assumption: The task definition implies these are the only relevant trigger/pattern mappings needed based on the examples).*\n4.  Locate the occurrence of `P_mover` in the input grid. Identify its bounding box and specifically its top-left corner coordinates, `(R_original, C_original)`.\n5.  Erase `P_mover` from the output grid by changing all pixels within its original bounding box that belong to the pattern back to the background color (white, 0).\n6.  Calculate the destination top-left corner for redrawing the pattern: `(R_new, C_new) = (R_trigger + dR, C_trigger + dC)`.\n7.  Draw the `P_mover` pattern onto the output grid, starting at `(R_new, C_new)`. For each pixel in `P_mover` at a relative position `(r, c)` from its own top-left corner, set the pixel at `(R_new + r, C_new + c)` in the output grid to the corresponding color from the pattern, overwriting any previous value at that location.\n8.  Return the final output grid."
