            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully implemented the core logic identified from the first example: finding a trigger pixel (Red or Orange), locating its associated pattern (Green L or Magenta L), erasing the pattern from its original location, and redrawing it relative to the trigger pixel using a specific offset.\n\nExample 2 executed correctly, validating this core logic for the Orange trigger and Magenta L pattern.\n\nExample 1 failed. The code correctly identified the Red trigger and Green L pattern and performed the move operation (erase and redraw) accurately. However, the comparison with the expected output failed because the expected output had *additional* changes: specifically, several Magenta (6) and Maroon (9) pixels present in the input were removed in the expected output. These pixels were *not* part of the moved Green L pattern. The code's transformed output correctly left these unrelated pixels untouched.\n\nThis indicates an additional rule associated specifically with the Red trigger activation: besides moving the Green L pattern, all Magenta and Maroon pixels should be removed from the grid. The logic for the Orange trigger seems correct as is (only move the associated pattern).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's compare the input, expected output, and the code's transformed output for Example 1 to confirm the differences.\n"
