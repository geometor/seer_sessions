task_description: Extract all instances of a repeating 3x3 pattern from the input and arrange them vertically or horizontally in the output based on their spatial distribution in the input.

elements:
  - element: background
    color: white
    value: 0
  - element: pattern
    description: A 3x3 shape composed of a single non-white color and white pixels. The specific arrangement within the 3x3 grid is consistent for all patterns within a single input example but can vary between examples.
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - composition: single non-white color + white pixels
      - repetition: Multiple instances appear in the input, differing only by color.
  - element: input_grid
    contains:
      - background
      - multiple pattern instances
  - element: output_grid
    description: A grid formed by arranging the extracted pattern instances adjacently.
    properties:
      - composition: Contains only the extracted 3x3 patterns, no background spacing between them.
      - arrangement: Either vertical stacking or horizontal stacking of patterns.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_distribution
    description: The relative positions of the pattern instances in the input grid determine the output arrangement.
    properties:
      - Calculate bounding box enclosing all pattern instances' top-left corners.
      - If bounding_box_height > bounding_box_width, arrangement is vertical.
      - If bounding_box_height <= bounding_box_width, arrangement is horizontal.
  - type: ordering
    description: The order of patterns in the output depends on their input position and the arrangement type.
    properties:
      - If arrangement is vertical, sort patterns by their top-row coordinate (ascending).
      - If arrangement is horizontal, sort patterns by their left-column coordinate (ascending).
