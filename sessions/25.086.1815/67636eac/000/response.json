            "text": "**Perception:**\n\nThe input grids contain multiple small, isolated 3x3 patterns scattered on a white background. Each pattern is characterized by a specific arrangement of a single color against a white background within its 3x3 area. Within a single input grid, all patterns share the *same* structural arrangement but differ in their primary color. The specific pattern structure (e.g., 'hollow cross', 'plus', 'X') can vary between different task examples.\n\nThe output grid is constructed by extracting these 3x3 patterns from the input and arranging them adjacent to each other, either vertically or horizontally.\n\nThe key steps appear to be:\n1.  Identify the non-white objects in the input.\n2.  Filter for objects that precisely occupy a 3x3 bounding box. These are the target patterns.\n3.  Extract the 3x3 grid for each target pattern.\n4.  Determine the overall spatial arrangement of these patterns in the input grid (predominantly vertical or horizontal spread).\n5.  Sort the extracted 3x3 patterns based on their original position (top-to-bottom for vertical spread, left-to-right for horizontal spread).\n6.  Concatenate the sorted patterns into the output grid (stack vertically or horizontally based on the determined spread).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

For each identified object, determine its bounding box.\n3.  Filter these objects, keeping only those whose bounding box dimensions are exactly 3x3. These are the target patterns.\n4.

Determine the overall spatial arrangement of the target patterns:\n    a.  Find the minimum and maximum row indices among the top-left corners of all patterns. Calculate the height of the span: `height = max_row - min_row + 1`.\n    b.  Find the minimum and maximum column indices among the top-left corners of all patterns. Calculate the width of the span: `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.\n    c.  Compare height and width. If `height > width`, the arrangement is 'vertical'. Otherwise (if `height <= width`), the arrangement is 'horizontal'.\n7.  Sort the list of recorded patterns:\n    a.  If the arrangement is 'vertical', sort the patterns primarily based on their top-left row coordinate (ascending).\n    b.  If the arrangement is 'horizontal', sort the patterns primarily based on their top-left column coordinate (ascending).\n8.  Construct the output grid:\n    a.  If the arrangement is 'vertical', concatenate the sorted 3x3 pattern grids vertically. The output grid width will be 3, and the height will be `3 * number_of_patterns`.\n    b.  If the arrangement is 'horizontal', concatenate the sorted 3x3 pattern grids horizontally. The output grid height will be 3, and the width will be `3 * number_of_patterns`.\n9.
