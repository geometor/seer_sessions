Let's call this modified version the \"base tile\".\n    *   The base tile has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    *   Comparing the input grid to the top-left subgrid (base tile) of the output grid reveals two main changes:\n        1.  All non-white pixels from the input grid are preserved in their original positions in the base tile.\n        2.  New red (color 2) pixels are introduced into the base tile at specific locations. These locations were originally white (color 0) in the input grid.\n    *   The position of the new red pixels relative to the original non-white pixels seems crucial.\n    *   Observing examples 1, 2, 3, and 5 (colors Gray-5, Magenta-6, Azure-8, Orange-7), the red pixel appears diagonally up-left (row-1, col-1) relative to the original non-white pixel, provided this position is within the grid bounds and was originally white.\n    *   Observing example 4 (color Blue-1), the red pixel appears at a different relative position: up 1 and right 3 (row-1, col+3), again provided the position is within bounds and was originally white.\n    *   This suggests a rule where each non-white pixel in the input potentially generates a red pixel in the base tile at a relative offset, but only if the target location is valid (within bounds) and was originally white. The specific offset depends on the color of the original non-white pixel. Blue (1) uses (-1, 3), while the other observed non-white colors (5, 6, 7, 8) use (-1, -1).\n    *   The final output is constructed by repeating the generated base tile in a 3x3 arrangement.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
