Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    6.  Fill the rectangle defined by the calculated starting row/column and the calculated height/width with azure color (8) in the output grid.\n\n    *Self-Correction during NL Program generation:* My initial YAML logic for size was slightly off. Re-examining train_1 (3x3 azure for 3-wide gap), train_2 (3x2 azure for 3-high gap), and train_3 (5x4 azure for 5-high gap) suggests the size of the new block in the *overlap* dimension might not simply be equal to the size of the gap dimension.\n    *   Train 1: Gap width 3, Overlap height 5 -> Azure 3x3. Height is `gap_width`. Centered in 5.\n    *   Train 2: Gap height 3, Overlap width 4 -> Azure 3x2. Width is NOT `gap_height`. Width is centered (size 2) in 4.\n    *   Train 3: Gap height 5, Overlap width 6 -> Azure 5x4. Width is NOT `gap_height`. Width is centered (size 4) in 6.\n\n    *Revised Natural Language Program:*\n    1.  Identify the two distinct non-white, solid rectangular objects and their bounding boxes.\n    2.  Determine if separation is horizontal (row overlap, column gap) or vertical (column overlap, row gap).\n    3.  **If separated horizontally:**\n        *   Identify `gap_columns` and `overlap_rows`.\n        *   The new block's columns are `gap_columns`.\n        *   The new block's height is the width of `gap_columns`.\n        *   The new block's rows are determined by centering a block of this height within `overlap_rows`.\n    4.  **If separated vertically:**\n        *   Identify `gap_rows` and `overlap_columns`.\n        *   The new block's rows are `gap_rows`.\n        *   The new block's width is the height of `gap_rows`.\n        *   The new block's columns are determined by centering a block of this width within `overlap_columns`.\n    5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    6.  Fill the calculated rectangular area for the new block with azure color (8).\n\n    *Final check on revised logic:*\n    *   Train 1: Horiz sep. Gap cols 4-6 (width 3). Overlap rows 3-7 (height 5). -> Azure cols 4-6. Azure height = gap width = 3. Center height 3 in rows 3-7: offset (5-3)//2=1. Start row 3+1=4. Rows 4-6. -> Azure block (4,4) to (6,6). Correct.\n    *   Train 2: Vert sep. Gap rows 4-6 (height 3). Overlap cols 1-4 (width 4). -> Azure rows 4-6. Azure width = gap height = 3. Center width 3 in cols 1-4: offset (4-3)//2=0 (integer division). Start col 1+0=1. Cols 1-3. -> Azure block (4,1) to (6,3). **Incorrect.** Output is (4,2) to (6,3), width 2.\n    *   Train 3: Vert sep. Gap rows 3-7 (height 5). Overlap cols 3-8 (width 6). -> Azure rows 3-7. Azure width = gap height = 5. Center width 5 in cols 3-8: offset (6-5)//2=0. Start col 3+0=3. Cols 3-7. -> Azure block (3,3) to (7,7). **Incorrect.** Output is (3,4) to (7,7), width 4.\n\n    Let's rethink the size calculation in the overlap dimension. It's not equal to the gap dimension size. It seems related to centering.\n    *   Train 1: Center 3x? in rows 3-7 (height 5), cols 4-6 (width 3). Fills cols -> width=3. Center height 3 in 5 rows -> rows 4-6. Size 3x3.\n    *   Train 2: Center ?x? in rows 4-6 (height 3), cols 1-4 (width 4). Fills rows -> height=3. Center width ? in 4 cols. Output width is 2. Center 2 in 4 -> offset 1 -> cols 2-3. Size 3x2.\n    *   Train 3: Center ?x? in rows 3-7 (height 5), cols 3-8 (width 6). Fills rows -> height=5. Center width ? in 6 cols. Output width is 4. Center 4 in 6 -> offset 1 -> cols 4-7. Size 5x4.\n\n    Okay, the dimension *along* the gap is filled completely. The dimension *across* the gap (the overlap dimension) seems to be centered, but what determines its size? It's not constant, not related to the gap size. Could it be related to the overlap size?\n    *   Train 1: Overlap height 5. Azure height 3. Center 3 in 5.\n    *   Train 2: Overlap width 4. Azure width 2. Center 2 in 4.\n    *   Train 3: Overlap width 6. Azure width 4. Center 4 in 6.\n\n    It looks like the size in the overlap dimension is `overlap_size - 2`?\n    *   Train 1: Overlap height 5 -> Azure height 5-2=3. Correct.\n    *   Train 2: Overlap width 4 -> Azure width 4-2=2. Correct.\n    *   Train 3: Overlap width 6 -> Azure width 6-2=4. Correct.\n\n    *Final Revised Natural Language Program:*\n    1.  Identify the two distinct non-white, solid rectangular objects and their bounding boxes.\n    2.  Determine if separation is horizontal (row overlap, column gap) or vertical (column overlap, row gap).\n    3.  **If separated horizontally:**\n        *   Identify `gap_columns` and `overlap_rows`.\n        *   The new block's columns span the `gap_columns`.\n        *   The new block's height is `height(overlap_rows) - 2`.\n        *   The new block's rows are determined by centering a block of this calculated height within `overlap_rows`.\n    4.  **If separated vertically:**\n        *   Identify `gap_rows` and `overlap_columns`.\n        *   The new block's rows span the `gap_rows`.\n        *   The new block's width is `width(overlap_columns) - 2`.\n        *   The new block's columns are determined by centering a block of this calculated width within `overlap_columns`.\n    5.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    6.  Fill the calculated rectangular area for the new block with azure color (8)."
