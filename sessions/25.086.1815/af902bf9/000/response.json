There can be multiple such rectangles within a single input grid.\n    The output grid retains the original yellow pixels and the white background but fills the area *strictly inside* the boundaries defined by each set of four yellow corner pixels with red (2) pixels.\n    The size and location of the rectangles vary across examples. The area to be filled is the bounding box defined by the yellow corners, excluding the corners themselves.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
