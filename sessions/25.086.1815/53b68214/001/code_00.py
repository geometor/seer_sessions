    """
    Transforms the input grid by creating a square output grid where the side length 
    is equal to the input grid's width. Each column in the output grid is filled 
    by repeating the vertical pattern found in the corresponding column of the 
    input grid.

    1. Determine the height (H_in) and width (W_in) of the input grid.
    2. Calculate the dimensions of the output grid: height H_out = W_in, width W_out = W_in.
    3. Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions H_out x W_out.
    4. Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to W_out - 1.
    5. For the current column `c`, extract the vertical sequence of pixel values 
       from the input grid: `pattern = [input_grid[row][c] for row in range(H_in)]`.
    6. Iterate through each row index `r` from 0 to H_out - 1.
    7. Calculate the index within the `pattern` to use for the current output cell: 
       `pattern_index = r % H_in`.
    8. Set the pixel value at `output_grid[r][c]` to the value found at 
       `pattern[pattern_index]`.
    9. After iterating through all columns and rows, return the completed output grid.
