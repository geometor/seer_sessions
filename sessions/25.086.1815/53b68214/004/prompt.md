```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the following rules:

    1. Determine the height (H_in) and width (W_in) of the input grid.
    2. The output grid will be a square grid with dimensions W_in x W_in.
    3. Create a new grid (the output grid) initialized, for example, with zeros.
    4. Iterate through each column index `c` from 0 to W_in - 1.
    5. For the current column `c`, extract the vertical sequence of pixel values 
       from the input grid: `pattern = input_grid[:, c]`.
    6. Copy this `pattern` into the first H_in rows of the corresponding output column `c`.
    7. For the remaining rows `r` in the output column (from index H_in to W_in - 1):
       a. Calculate the index `pattern_index` to sample from the original `pattern`. This index is determined by starting at index 2 of the pattern and wrapping around modulo H_in. The formula is `(2 + (r - H_in)) % H_in`.
       b. Set the pixel value at `output_grid[r, c]` to the value found at `pattern[pattern_index]`.
    8. Return the completed output grid.
