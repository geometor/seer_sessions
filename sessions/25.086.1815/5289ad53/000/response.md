*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a grid containing a dominant background color.
    *   Scattered within the grid are several horizontal line segments (objects) composed of colors different from the background. In the examples, these colors are green (3) and red (2).
    *   The output is always a small, fixed-size 2x3 grid.
    *   The output grid seems to represent a summary of the non-background horizontal line objects found in the input. Specifically, it visualizes the *count* of objects for each unique color.
    *   The output grid is filled row by row, left to right. The order in which colors are represented seems to depend on the color value itself (higher value first).
    *   The number of cells filled with a specific color in the output grid corresponds to the number of horizontal line objects of that color found in the input grid.
    *   Any cells in the 2x3 output grid not filled by representing object counts are left as white (0).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: summarization
    input_features:
      - grid: 2D array of pixels
      - background_color: the single most frequent color in the grid
      - objects: contiguous horizontal segments of non-background colors
      - object_colors: the set of unique colors forming the objects (e.g., green, red)
      - object_counts: the number of distinct horizontal segments for each unique object color
    output_features:
      - grid: fixed size 2x3
      - content: represents object counts using their respective colors
      - fill_order: row-major (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
      - color_order: colors are placed in the output grid based on a specific order (descending color value based on examples: green (3) before red (2))
      - padding: remaining cells filled with white (0)
    transformation:
      1. Identify background color.
      2. Identify all horizontal line objects of non-background colors.
      3. Count the occurrences of objects for each unique color.
      4. Sort the unique colors found based on their value (descending).
      5. Fill a 2x3 grid (initialized to white) row-by-row, placing N pixels of color C for each color C with count N, following the sorted color order.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the background color by finding the most frequent pixel value in the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid row by row to identify all distinct horizontal segments (objects) made of non-background colors.
    3.  Create a count for each unique non-background color found in these objects.
    4.  Create a list of the unique non-background colors identified.
    5.  Sort this list of colors in descending order based on their numerical value (e.g., Green (3) comes before Red (2)).
    6.  Initialize a 2x3 output grid with all cells set to white (0).
    7.  Iterate through the sorted list of colors. For each color:
        a.  Retrieve its count (the number of objects found for that color).
        b.  Fill the next available cells in the 2x3 output grid (proceeding left-to-right, then top-to-bottom) with this color, repeating the color according to its count.
    8.  The final state of the 2x3 grid is the output.
