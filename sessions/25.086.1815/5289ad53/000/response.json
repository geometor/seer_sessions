In the examples, these colors are green (3) and red (2).\n    *   The output is always a small, fixed-size 2x3 grid.\n    *   The output grid seems to represent a summary of the non-background horizontal line objects found in the input. Specifically, it visualizes the *count* of objects for each unique color.\n    *   The output grid is filled row by row, left to right. The order in which colors are represented seems to depend on the color value itself (higher value first).\n    *   The number of cells filled with a specific color in the output grid corresponds to the number of horizontal line objects of that color found in the input grid.\n    *   Any cells in the 2x3 output grid not filled by representing object counts are left as white (0).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
