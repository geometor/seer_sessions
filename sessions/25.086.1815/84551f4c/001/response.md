"""
This program transforms an input grid based on the presence and arrangement of 
vertical lines of height 3.

1. Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
2. Identify all vertical lines of height 3 in the input grid. Record their color (blue=1 or red=2) and column index.
3. Separate the identified lines into blue lines and red lines, storing their column indices.
4. Count the total number of red lines ('N').
5. Determine the rank ('R', 1-based) of each red line based on its left-to-right column position.
6. Process Blue Lines: For each blue line at column 'X', draw a horizontal blue line of length 3 in the bottom row (row index 2) of the output grid, starting at column 'X'. Specifically, set output[2, X], output[2, X+1], output[2, X+2] to blue (1).
7. Process Red Lines: For each red line at column 'X' with rank 'R':
    a. If N = 1: Draw a horizontal red line (length 3) in the bottom row starting at column 'X'. (Transform)
    b. If N = 2:
        i. If R = 1: Keep the original vertical red line at column 'X' in the output. (Keep)
        ii. If R = 2: Draw a horizontal red line (length 3) in the bottom row starting at column 'X'. (Transform)
    c. If N >= 3:
        i. If R <= N - 2: Draw a horizontal red line (length 3) in the bottom row starting at column 'X'. (Transform)
        ii. If R > N - 2: Keep the original vertical red line at column 'X' in the output. (Keep)
8. Return the resulting output grid.
