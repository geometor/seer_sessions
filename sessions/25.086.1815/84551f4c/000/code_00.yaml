Grid:
  - Type: 2D Array
  - Cell Values: Integers 0-9 (representing colors)
  - Colors Present: white (0), blue (1), red (2)
  - Input Dimensions: Height=3, Width=Variable
  - Output Dimensions: Same as input

Objects:
  - Type: Vertical Line
  - Properties:
      - Height: 3 (equal to grid height)
      - Width: 1
      - Color: blue (1) or red (2)
      - Column Index: The column where the line exists.

Relationships:
  - Red Line Count: The total number of red vertical lines ('N').
  - Red Line Rank: The ordinal position ('R') of a red line when sorted by column index (1st, 2nd, ..., Nth).

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all vertical lines of height 3.
  - Count: Determine the total number of red lines ('N').
  - Rank: Determine the rank ('R') for each red line.
  - Process Blue Lines: Always perform the "Transform" action.
  - Process Red Lines (Conditional):
      - Condition Set 1 (N=1): Perform "Transform" action.
      - Condition Set 2 (N=2):
          - If R=1: Perform "Keep" action.
          - If R=2: Perform "Transform" action.
      - Condition Set 3 (N>=3):
          - If R <= N-2: Perform "Transform" action.
          - If R > N-2: Perform "Keep" action.
  - Action "Keep": Copy the original vertical line (3x1) to the output grid at the same column index.
  - Action "Transform": Draw a horizontal line (1x3) of the original line's color in the bottom row (row 2) of the output grid, starting at the original line's column index.
  - Output Generation: Start with a white grid and draw the results of the "Keep" and "Transform" actions.
