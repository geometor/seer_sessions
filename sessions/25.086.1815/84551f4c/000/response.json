            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n### Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids in all examples have a height of 3. The width varies between examples. The background color is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** The primary objects are vertical lines of height 3, consisting of either blue (1) or red (2) pixels. These lines are always separated by at least one column of white pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Overview:** The transformation involves processing these vertical lines. Some lines maintain their original vertical form and position in the output, while others are \"transformed\".\n4.  **Transformation Detail:** The \"transformation\" consists of two steps:\n    *   The original vertical line is erased (replaced with white pixels).\n    *   A horizontal line of length 3, using the color of the original vertical line, is drawn in the *bottom row* (row index 2) of the output grid, starting at the same column index as the original vertical line.\n5.  **Conditional Transformation:** Not all lines are transformed.\n    *   All blue vertical lines appear to be transformed in all examples.\n    *   Red vertical lines are sometimes transformed and sometimes kept in their original vertical state.\n6.  **Rule for Red Lines:** The decision to transform or keep a red line depends on the *total number* of red lines in the input grid and the *positional order* (from left to right) of the specific red line.\n    *   If there is only 1 red line, it is transformed (Example 3).\n    *   If there are 2 red lines, the first (leftmost) is kept, and the second is transformed (Example 2).\n    *   If there are 4 red lines (Example 1), the first two are transformed, and the last two (3rd and 4th) are kept.\n7.  **Generalizing the Red Line Rule:** It appears that if `N` is the total number of red lines:\n    *   If `N=1`, transform the red line.\n    *   If `N=2`, keep the 1st red line, transform the 2nd.\n    *   If `N>=3`, transform the first `N-2` red lines, and keep the last two red lines.\n8.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is initially white. The kept vertical lines and the new horizontal lines (from transformed lines) are drawn onto this grid.\n\n### Facts\n\n"

Identify all vertical lines of height 3 in the input grid. For each line, record its color and column index.\n3.  Separate the identified lines into two lists: one for blue lines and one for red lines, keeping track of their original column indices.\n4.  Count the total number of red lines found (`N`).\n5.  Assign a rank (`R`) from 1 to `N` to each red line based on its left-to-right column position.\n6.  Process each identified blue line: For a blue line originally at column `X`, set the pixels in the output grid at `output[2, X]`, `output[2, X+1]`, and `output[2, X+2]` to blue (1).\n7.  Process each identified red line: Let the red line be at column `X` with rank `R`.\n    *   If `N == 1`: Set `output[2, X]`, `output[2, X+1]`, `output[2, X+2]` to red (2).\n    *   If `N == 2`:\n        *   If `R == 1`: Set `output[0, X]`, `output[1, X]`, `output[2, X]` to red (2).
