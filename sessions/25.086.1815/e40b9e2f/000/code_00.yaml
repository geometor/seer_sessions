task_description: Add pixels of a 'seed' color to empty cells adjacent to the largest object.
definitions:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array of integers 0-9
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: object
    type: contiguous group of non-background pixels of the same color
  - name: largest_object
    criteria: The object with the highest pixel count.
  - name: main_color
    source: The color of the largest_object.
  - name: seed_pixel
    criteria: Any non-background pixel not belonging to the largest_object.
  - name: seed_color
    source: The color of a seed_pixel. (Assumption based on examples: only one seed_color per task instance).
  - name: adjacency
    type: Cardinal (up, down, left, right neighbors).
actions:
  - identify:
      target: all non-background colors present in the input grid.
  - identify:
      target: the largest_object in the input grid.
      result: main_object, main_color.
  - identify:
      target: the color(s) of all seed_pixels.
      result: seed_color(s).
  - iterate:
      target: each pixel in the input grid.
      condition: If the pixel color is background_color (0).
      sub_actions:
        - check_neighbors:
            target: the current background pixel.
            condition: If any cardinal neighbor belongs to the main_object (has main_color).
            effect: Change the color of the current pixel in the output grid to the seed_color.
  - preserve:
      target: All original pixels from the input grid remain in the output grid unless modified by the adjacency rule.
relationships:
  - The placement of new pixels (of seed_color) depends on the location of the main_object.
  - New pixels are placed only in background_color cells.
  - New pixels are placed adjacent (cardinally) to the main_object.
