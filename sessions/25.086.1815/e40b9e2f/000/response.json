Typically, one color forms a larger contiguous object, while the other color(s) appear as smaller objects, often single pixels.\n    *   Example 1: A magenta (6) object and a green (3) pixel.\n    *   Example 2: An orange (7) object and several yellow (4) pixels (some connected, one separate).\n    *   Example 3: An azure (8) object and a maroon (9) pixel.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding new pixels. The color of the newly added pixels matches the color of the smaller, non-dominant object(s) in the input. The position of these new pixels is determined by the location of the largest object. Specifically, new pixels are added to white cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the largest object.\n4.  **Invariance:** The original objects (both the largest one and the smaller 'seed' ones) remain unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
