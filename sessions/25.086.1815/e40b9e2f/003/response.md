"""
Identifies the largest contiguous object (main_object) and its color (main_color).
Identifies the color of other non-background pixels (seed_color).
Iterates through all background (white, 0) pixels in the grid.
If a background pixel is diagonally adjacent (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) to any pixel belonging to the main_object,
change the color of that background pixel in the output grid to the seed_color.
Preserve all original non-background pixels.
