            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Both input examples feature a large grid (14x14) primarily filled with the background color white (0). Within this background, there is a hollow rectangle constructed from red (2) pixels. Inside this red rectangle, there are various other colored pixels arranged in small blocks or individually.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids. They consist of a central area containing colored pixels, surrounded by a 1-pixel thick border of red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Color Mapping:** The colors inside the red rectangle in the input (excluding white and red itself) appear in the central area of the output grid. The background white (0) pixels from the input's inner region do not seem to map directly to the output's central area, except possibly influencing spacing or scaling. The red (2) pixels forming the rectangle in the input correspond to the border color in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve:\n    *   **Identifying Content:** Locating the pixels *inside* the red rectangle in the input grid that are *not* white (0) and *not* red (2).\n    *   **Extraction:** Determining the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that contains all these identified \"content\" pixels. Extracting this subgrid.\n    *   **Scaling:** Enlarging this extracted subgrid. In `train_1`, a 2x2 content area becomes a 4x4 area in the output (before the border). In `train_2`, a 4x4 content area becomes an 8x8 area. This suggests each pixel in the extracted content subgrid is scaled up to a 2x2 block in the output's central area.\n    *   **Framing:** Adding a 1-pixel thick border of red (2) pixels around the scaled-up content area to form the final output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Populate the scaled grid: For each pixel at `(row, col)` with color `C` in the source pattern, fill a 2x2 block of pixels in the scaled grid starting at `(row * 2, col * 2)` with the color `C`.\n6.  Create the final output grid by adding a 1-pixel thick border of red (2) color around the entire scaled grid.
