Specifically, row 3, row 7, column 3, and column 7 are entirely gray. These lines divide the grid into nine 3x3 subgrids.\n3.  **Objects/Colors:** Within the 3x3 subgrids, there are pixels of white (0) and one other distinct color per example (Red=2 in train\\_1, Blue=1 in train\\_2, Green=3 in train\\_3). Let's call this the \"dominant color\".\n4.  **Input State:** In the input grids, the dominant color pixels are scattered across various positions within the nine subgrids.\n5.  **Output State:** In the output grids, the gray scaffolding remains unchanged. All pixels within one or two specific 3x3 subgrids are replaced entirely by the dominant color found in the input. All other subgrids (excluding the scaffolding) are filled with white (0).\n6.  **Transformation:** The task involves identifying the dominant color, determining a target subgrid (or subgrids) based on the input configuration, and then consolidating all instances of the dominant color into those target subgrid(s) in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

This is the target subgrid. The subgrids are defined by the gray lines (indices 0-2, 4-6, 8-10 for both rows and columns).\n5.
