Grid_Dimensions:
  Input: [11, 11]
  Output: [11, 11]
Structural_Elements:
  - Type: Scaffolding
    Color: Gray (5)
    Location:
      Rows: [3, 7]
      Columns: [3, 7]
    Persistence: Unchanged between input and output
  - Type: Subgrids
    Quantity: 9
    Dimensions: [3, 3]
    Definition: Areas partitioned by the Gray scaffolding
Dynamic_Elements:
  - Type: Pixel_Set
    Name: Dominant_Color_Pixels
    Properties:
      Color: Varies per example (Red=2, Blue=1, Green=3), but only one type per grid (excluding Gray and White).
      Location_Input: Scattered within various Subgrids.
      Location_Output: Consolidated into one or two specific Subgrids, filling them completely.
    Relationships:
      - The specific Dominant_Color determines the transformation rule variation.
      - The location of the *last* instance (read-order) of a Dominant_Color pixel in the input determines the target Subgrid(s) for consolidation in the output, potentially modified by the color itself.
  - Type: Pixel_Set
    Name: Background_Pixels
    Properties:
      Color: White (0)
      Location_Input: Fills Subgrid areas not occupied by Dominant_Color_Pixels.
      Location_Output: Fills Subgrid areas not targeted for consolidation and not part of the scaffolding.
Transformation_Rule_Dependency:
  - Condition: Dominant_Color is Red (2)
    Action: Fills Subgrids TR (Top-Right) and ML (Middle-Left) in the output.
  - Condition: Dominant_Color is NOT Red (2)
    Action: Finds the Subgrid containing the last occurring pixel (read-order) of the Dominant_Color in the input, and fills that specific Subgrid in the output.
