"""
Identify the dominant color (non-white, non-gray) in the input grid.
Find the last occurrence (read-order: top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of this dominant color.
The grid is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids by gray lines (rows 3, 7 and columns 3, 7).

Transformation logic:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Identify the dominant color (the single color other than gray (5) and white (0)).
3. Find the row and column of the last pixel containing the dominant color.
4. Determine the target subgrid(s):
   - If the dominant color is Red (2), the targets are the Top-Right (rows 0-2, cols 8-10) and Middle-Left (rows 4-6, cols 0-2) subgrids.
   - Otherwise, the target is the single subgrid containing the last found dominant color pixel.
5. Iterate through all nine 3x3 subgrids:
   - Fill the target subgrid(s) entirely with the dominant color.
   - Fill all non-target subgrids entirely with white (0).
6. The gray scaffolding lines remain unchanged.
