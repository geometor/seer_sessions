"""
Transforms an input grid by moving non-white pixels found in the first column (index 0) 
to a specific target column based on the pixel's color. The row remains unchanged. 
The specific color-to-column mapping is: Red(2) -> Col 2, Green(3) -> Col 4, 
Yellow(4) -> Col 3, Azure(8) -> Col 1. The rest of the grid, including the original 
positions in the first column, is filled with white (0).
