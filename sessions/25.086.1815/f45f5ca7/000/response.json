            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids in all examples are 10x10.\n2.  **Background Color:** The predominant color in both input and output grids is white (0).\n3.  **Input Objects:** In the input grids, non-white pixels (Red-2, Green-3, Yellow-4, Azure-8) appear *only* in the first column (index 0). Each non-white pixel seems to be an independent object.\n4.  **Output Objects:** In the output grids, the same non-white pixels from the input's first column appear, but they have been moved horizontally to different columns. The original positions in the first column become white.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the horizontal movement (translation) of each non-white pixel found in the first column. The row of the pixel remains unchanged. The destination column seems to depend solely on the *color* of the pixel.\n6.  **Color-Column Mapping:** By comparing the input color in column 0 with its output column position across all examples, we can deduce the following mapping:\n    *   Red (2) moves to column index 2.\n    *   Azure (8) moves to column index 1.\n    *   Green (3) moves to column index 4.\n    *   Yellow (4) moves to column index 3.\n7.  **Consistency:** This color-to-column mapping rule is consistent across all three training examples. Pixels in rows that start with white (0) in the input remain white in the output, and no new colors are introduced.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
