            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous Python code successfully identified the core transformation rule: input pixels determine the placement of full-width horizontal lines (Blue, Green) or full-height vertical lines (Red) in the output grid. However, it failed on examples 1 and 3 because it did not correctly handle the interaction/overlap between these lines. The errors occurred specifically where vertical Red lines intersected horizontal Blue or Green lines. The transformed output incorrectly showed Red pixels at these intersections, while the expected output maintained the Blue or Green color of the horizontal line.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the drawing process or the order of operations to ensure that horizontal lines (Blue and Green) take precedence over vertical lines (Red) at points of intersection.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples and the code's behavior:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 10x8\n    *   Output Size: 10x8\n    *   Input Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)\n    *   Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)\n    *   Failure Points: The vertical Red line at column 5 overwrites the horizontal Green line at row 1, the horizontal Green line at row 4, and the horizontal Blue line at row 6. Expected output keeps these pixels Green (row 1 & 4) and Blue (row 6).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x9\n    *   Output Size: 9x9\n    *   Input Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)\n    *   Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)\n    *   Success: The vertical Red line (col 2) does not intersect the horizontal Blue (row 6) or Green (row 4) lines. The code's implicit handling (last horizontal line drawn wins for a row) worked correctly for horizontal-horizontal overlaps if they existed, and there were no vertical-horizontal overlaps.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 10x11\n    *   Output Size: 10x11\n    *   Input Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)\n    *   Output Colors: White(0), Blue(1), Red(2), Green(3)\n    *   Failure Points: The vertical Red lines (columns 3 and 9) overwrite the horizontal Blue line (row 1) and the horizontal Green lines (rows 3 and 6) at their intersections. Expected output keeps these intersection pixels Blue or Green.\n\n**Key Observation:** The rule appears to be: draw all the lines dictated by the input pixels, but if a horizontal line (Blue or Green) and a vertical line (Red) intersect, the pixel at the intersection should take the color of the horizontal line.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"

Identify all locations `(r, c)` of Red (2) pixels in the input grid. For each unique column `c` containing a Red pixel, draw a vertical Red line spanning the full height of the output grid at that column `c`.\n3.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` of Blue (1) pixels in the input grid. For each unique row `r` containing a Blue pixel, draw a horizontal Blue line spanning the full width of the output grid at that row `r`. *This line will overwrite any existing pixels, including parts of vertical Red lines.*\n4.  Identify all locations `(r, c)` of Green (3) pixels in the input grid. For each unique row `r` containing a Green pixel, draw a horizontal Green line spanning the full width of the output grid at that row `r`. *This line will overwrite any existing pixels, including parts of vertical Red lines or previously drawn horizontal Blue lines.*\n5.  Return the final output grid.\n\n*(Alternative phrasing for steps 2-4 emphasizing the precedence rule)*\n\n1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with White (0) pixels.\n2.  Create a list of lines to draw based on input pixels:\n    *   For each Red (2) pixel at `(r, c)` in the input, add a \"vertical Red line at column `c`\" instruction.\n    *   For each Blue (1) pixel at `(r, c)` in the input, add a \"horizontal Blue line at row `r`\" instruction.\n    *   For each Green (3) pixel at `(r, c)` in the input, add a \"horizontal Green line at row `r`\" instruction.\n3.  Remove duplicate line instructions (e.g., if two Red pixels are in the same column, only one instruction is needed).\n4.  Draw all specified *vertical* Red lines onto the output grid first.\n5.  Draw all specified *horizontal* Blue and Green lines onto the output grid next, overwriting any pixels previously set by the vertical lines. If both Blue and Green lines are specified for the same row, the Green line takes precedence (based on the order in the original description, Green was processed last). *Correction: Let's re-examine if Blue/Green precedence matters. Example 1 has Blue at (6,1) and Green at (1,1), (4,3). No overlap needed to resolve Blue vs Green. Example 3 has Blue at (1,1) and Green at (3,8), (6,2). No overlap. It seems we only need to ensure horizontal lines overwrite vertical lines. The order between Blue and Green might not matter, or the last one processed for a given row simply wins.* Let's stick with the simpler interpretation for now: Draw Vertical Red, then Horizontal Blue, then Horizontal Green.\n6.  Return the final output grid."
