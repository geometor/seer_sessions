task_context:
  description: "Transform sparse colored pixels in an input grid into full horizontal or vertical lines in an output grid of the same size, resolving intersections based on line orientation."
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions_match: Input and output grids have identical height and width.
    - background_color: White (0) is the background color.
  input_objects:
    - object_type: Pixel
      properties:
        - color: Blue (1), Red (2), or Green (3)
        - location: Row and column index (r, c)
  output_objects:
    - object_type: Line
      properties:
        - color: Determined by the input pixel color.
        - orientation: Horizontal or Vertical.
        - extent: Full width or full height of the grid.
  transformation_rules:
    - rule: "Input Blue (1) pixel at (r, c) generates a full-width horizontal Blue line at row r."
    - rule: "Input Green (3) pixel at (r, c) generates a full-width horizontal Green line at row r."
    - rule: "Input Red (2) pixel at (r, c) generates a full-height vertical Red line at column c."
  interaction_rules:
    - rule: "If multiple input pixels map to the same output line (e.g., two Green pixels in the same row), the line is still drawn just once with the corresponding color."
    - precedence: "At points where a horizontal line (Blue or Green) intersects a vertical line (Red), the pixel color is determined by the horizontal line (Blue or Green)."
