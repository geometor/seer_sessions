        *   Draw a vertical line of Red pixels (2) in the output grid at that column index, spanning the entire height of the grid.

        *   Identify its row index.
        *   Draw a horizontal line of Blue pixels (1) in the output grid at that row index, spanning the entire width of the grid.
    5.  If an input pixel is Green (3):
        *   Identify its row index.
