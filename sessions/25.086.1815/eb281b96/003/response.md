"""
Transforms an input grid by vertically stacking blocks of rows derived from the input.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Let the input grid be I with height H and width W.
2. Define Block A as the complete input grid I (rows 0 to H-1).
3. Define Block B:
   a. Select rows 0 to H-2 from I (all rows except the last). If H=1, this block is empty.
   b. Perform a vertical *upward* cycle shift on these selected rows: Row 0 moves to the last position in this block (index H-2), Row 1 moves to position 0, Row 2 to position 1, etc.
4. Define Block C by selecting rows 1 to H-1 from I (all rows except the first). If H=1, this block is empty.
5. Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the blocks in the following order: Block A, Block B, Block C, Block B. Only include non-empty blocks.
6. The final output grid will have height H_out = H + 3 * max(0, H-1) and width W.
   Simplified: If H > 1, H_out = H + 3*(H-1) = 4*H - 3. If H = 1, H_out = 1.
