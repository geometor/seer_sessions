Input:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: H_in (variable, e.g., 4 or 3)
      width: W_in (constant, 17 in examples)
      content: rows of pixels (integers 0-9)

Output:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: H_out (calculated based on H_in)
      width: W_out (W_out = W_in)
      content: rows of pixels derived from input rows

Transformation:
  - name: Generate Row Blocks
    actions:
      - description: Define Block A as the complete input grid.
        input: input_grid
        output: block_A (list of rows)
      - description: Define Block B by taking input grid rows except the last, then cycling these rows vertically downwards by one position.
        input: input_grid
        output: block_B (list of rows)
      - description: Define Block C by taking input grid rows except the first.
        input: input_grid
        output: block_C (list of rows)
  - name: Construct Output
    actions:
      - description: Vertically concatenate Block A, Block B, Block C, and Block B in that order.
        inputs: [block_A, block_B, block_C]
        output: output_grid

Relationships:
  - Output width is identical to input width.
  - Output height depends on input height (H_out = H_in + (H_in - 1) + (H_in - 1) + (H_in - 1) = 4 * H_in - 3).
  - Output content is composed solely of rows found in the input grid, potentially rearranged or selected.
