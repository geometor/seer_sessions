            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples take a 2D grid (matrix) as input and produce a 2D grid as output. The grids contain integer values representing colors (white and red/azure).\n2.  **Dimensions:**\n    *   Example 1: Input is 4x17, Output is 13x17.\n    *   Example 2: Input is 3x17, Output is 9x17.\n    *   Observation: The width of the grid remains constant (17 columns). The height increases significantly.\n3.  **Content:** The colors present in the input are the only colors present in the output. No new colors are introduced. The spatial arrangement of colors within rows seems preserved. The transformation primarily involves rearranging or repeating rows.\n4.  **Pattern Repetition:** Both input grids exhibit a repeating horizontal pattern.\n    *   Example 1: A 4x4 pattern is repeated horizontally 4 times, followed by the first column of the pattern, making up the 17 columns.\n    *   Example 2: A 3x4 pattern is repeated horizontally 4 times, followed by the first column of the pattern, making up the 17 columns.\n    *   Observation: This horizontal structure seems preserved in the output grid for both examples. The core transformation appears to be vertical.\n5.  **Vertical Transformation (Example 1):**\n    *   Input Height (H_in) = 4. Output Height (H_out) = 13.\n    *   The first 4 rows of the output are identical to the 4 input rows. Let Input Rows be `R0, R1, R2, R3`.\n    *   Output Rows: `R0, R1, R2, R3, R1, R2, R0, R1, R2, R3, R1, R2, R0`.\n    *   This sequence can be broken down: `[R0, R1, R2, R3]` + `[R1, R2, R0]` + `[R1, R2, R3]` + `[R1, R2, R0]`.\n6.  **Vertical Transformation (Example 2):**\n    *   Input Height (H_in) = 3. Output Height (H_out) = 9. (H_out = 3 * H_in).\n    *   Let Input Rows be `R0, R1, R2`.\n    *   Output Rows: `R0, R1, R2, R1, R0, R1, R2, R1, R0`.\n    *   This sequence can be broken down: `[R0, R1, R2]` + `[R1, R0]` + `[R1, R2]` + `[R1, R0]`.\n7.  **General Rule Derivation:** Let the input grid be `I`.\n    *   Define Block A = `I` (all rows of the input).\n    *   Define Block B: Take all rows of `I` *except the last one*. Perform a vertical cycle shift downwards by one position on these rows (i.e., the first row moves to the last position, the second row moves to the first, etc.).\n    *   Define Block C: Take all rows of `I` *except the first one*.\n    *   The output grid is formed by vertically concatenating Block A, Block B, Block C, and Block B again. (Output = A + B + C + B).\n    *   Let's verify this rule:\n        *   Example 1 (H_in=4):\n            *   A = `[R0, R1, R2, R3]` (4 rows)\n            *   Rows for B = `[R0, R1, R2]`. Cycle -> `[R1, R2, R0]` (3 rows)\n            *   Rows for C = `[R1, R2, R3]` (3 rows)\n            *   Concatenate A, B, C, B: `[R0..R3] + [R1, R2, R0] + [R1, R2, R3] + [R1, R2, R0]`. Total rows = 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13. Matches observed sequence and height.\n        *   Example 2 (H_in=3):\n            *   A = `[R0, R1, R2]` (3 rows)\n            *   Rows for B = `[R0, R1]`. Cycle -> `[R1, R0]` (2 rows)\n            *   Rows for C = `[R1, R2]` (2 rows)\n            *   Concatenate A, B, C, B: `[R0, R1, R2] + [R1, R0] + [R1, R2] + [R1, R0]`. Total rows = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9. Matches observed sequence and height.\n    *   The rule holds for both examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
