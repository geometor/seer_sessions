Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both examples take a 2D grid (matrix) as input and produce a 2D grid as output. The grids contain integer values representing colors (white and red/azure).
2.  **Dimensions:**
    *   Example 1: Input is 4x17, Output is 13x17.
    *   Example 2: Input is 3x17, Output is 9x17.
    *   Observation: The width of the grid remains constant (17 columns). The height increases significantly.
3.  **Content:** The colors present in the input are the only colors present in the output. No new colors are introduced. The spatial arrangement of colors within rows seems preserved. The transformation primarily involves rearranging or repeating rows.
4.  **Pattern Repetition:** Both input grids exhibit a repeating horizontal pattern.
    *   Example 1: A 4x4 pattern is repeated horizontally 4 times, followed by the first column of the pattern, making up the 17 columns.
    *   Example 2: A 3x4 pattern is repeated horizontally 4 times, followed by the first column of the pattern, making up the 17 columns.
    *   Observation: This horizontal structure seems preserved in the output grid for both examples. The core transformation appears to be vertical.
5.  **Vertical Transformation (Example 1):**
    *   Input Height (H_in) = 4. Output Height (H_out) = 13.
    *   The first 4 rows of the output are identical to the 4 input rows. Let Input Rows be `R0, R1, R2, R3`.
    *   Output Rows: `R0, R1, R2, R3, R1, R2, R0, R1, R2, R3, R1, R2, R0`.
    *   This sequence can be broken down: `[R0, R1, R2, R3]` + `[R1, R2, R0]` + `[R1, R2, R3]` + `[R1, R2, R0]`.
6.  **Vertical Transformation (Example 2):**
    *   Input Height (H_in) = 3. Output Height (H_out) = 9. (H_out = 3 * H_in).
    *   Let Input Rows be `R0, R1, R2`.
    *   Output Rows: `R0, R1, R2, R1, R0, R1, R2, R1, R0`.
    *   This sequence can be broken down: `[R0, R1, R2]` + `[R1, R0]` + `[R1, R2]` + `[R1, R0]`.
7.  **General Rule Derivation:** Let the input grid be `I`.
    *   Define Block A = `I` (all rows of the input).
    *   Define Block B: Take all rows of `I` *except the last one*. Perform a vertical cycle shift downwards by one position on these rows (i.e., the first row moves to the last position, the second row moves to the first, etc.).
    *   Define Block C: Take all rows of `I` *except the first one*.
    *   The output grid is formed by vertically concatenating Block A, Block B, Block C, and Block B again. (Output = A + B + C + B).
    *   Let's verify this rule:
        *   Example 1 (H_in=4):
            *   A = `[R0, R1, R2, R3]` (4 rows)
            *   Rows for B = `[R0, R1, R2]`. Cycle -> `[R1, R2, R0]` (3 rows)
            *   Rows for C = `[R1, R2, R3]` (3 rows)
            *   Concatenate A, B, C, B: `[R0..R3] + [R1, R2, R0] + [R1, R2, R3] + [R1, R2, R0]`. Total rows = 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13. Matches observed sequence and height.
        *   Example 2 (H_in=3):
            *   A = `[R0, R1, R2]` (3 rows)
            *   Rows for B = `[R0, R1]`. Cycle -> `[R1, R0]` (2 rows)
            *   Rows for C = `[R1, R2]` (2 rows)
            *   Concatenate A, B, C, B: `[R0, R1, R2] + [R1, R0] + [R1, R2] + [R1, R0]`. Total rows = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9. Matches observed sequence and height.
    *   The rule holds for both examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
Input:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: H_in (variable, e.g., 4 or 3)
      width: W_in (constant, 17 in examples)
      content: rows of pixels (integers 0-9)

Output:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: H_out (calculated based on H_in)
      width: W_out (W_out = W_in)
      content: rows of pixels derived from input rows

Transformation:
  - name: Generate Row Blocks
    actions:
      - description: Define Block A as the complete input grid.
        input: input_grid
        output: block_A (list of rows)
      - description: Define Block B by taking input grid rows except the last, then cycling these rows vertically downwards by one position.
        input: input_grid
        output: block_B (list of rows)
      - description: Define Block C by taking input grid rows except the first.
        input: input_grid
        output: block_C (list of rows)
  - name: Construct Output
    actions:
      - description: Vertically concatenate Block A, Block B, Block C, and Block B in that order.
        inputs: [block_A, block_B, block_C]
        output: output_grid

Relationships:
  - Output width is identical to input width.
  - Output height depends on input height (H_out = H_in + (H_in - 1) + (H_in - 1) + (H_in - 1) = 4 * H_in - 3).
  - Output content is composed solely of rows found in the input grid, potentially rearranged or selected.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid. Let its height be `H` and width be `W`.
2.  Create Block A, which is simply a copy of the input grid (Rows 0 to H-1).
3.  Create Block B:
    a.  Select rows 0 to H-2 from the input grid (all rows except the last).
    b.  Perform a vertical cycle shift downwards on these selected rows: Row 0 moves to the last position in this block, Row 1 moves to position 0, Row 2 moves to position 1, and so on.
4.  Create Block C by selecting rows 1 to H-1 from the input grid (all rows except the first).
5.  Construct the output grid by vertically stacking the blocks in the following order: Block A, Block B, Block C, Block B.
6.  The final output grid will have height `H + (H-1) + (H-1) + (H-1) = 4*H - 3` and width `W`.
