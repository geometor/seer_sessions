*   **Perception:**
    The task involves recoloring specific regions within a grid based on proximity to certain "source" colors located in the first row. The input grid contains several rectangular blocks composed of gray pixels (color 5). The first row of the input grid contains a few distinct non-white colored pixels, which act as sources. The transformation identifies each gray block and determines which source color pixel in the top row is horizontally closest to it. Each gray block is then entirely replaced with the color of its nearest source pixel. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context: Color replacement based on horizontal proximity.
    elements:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - size: 10x10 (consistent across examples)
          - background: white (color 0)
      - type: object
        identifier: source_pixels
        properties:
          - location: fixed in the top row (row 0)
          - color: non-white (variable colors, e.g., blue, red, yellow, magenta, orange, azure)
          - role: determine replacement color
      - type: object
        identifier: gray_blocks
        properties:
          - shape: rectangular
          - color: gray (color 5)
          - location: variable, below the top row
          - role: target for recoloring
    actions:
      - identify: Locate all contiguous gray blocks.
      - identify: Locate all non-white source pixels in the top row.
      - calculate: For each gray block, find the minimum horizontal distance to each source pixel.
          - definition: Horizontal distance between a block (spanning columns c_start to c_end) and a source pixel (at column c_source) is the minimum absolute difference `abs(c - c_source)` for all `c` from `c_start` to `c_end`.
      - determine: Assign the color of the horizontally closest source pixel to each gray block.
      - replace: Change the color of all pixels within each gray block to its assigned source color.
    relationships:
      - proximity: Each gray block is associated with the source pixel that has the minimum horizontal distance to any part of the block.
      - transformation: Gray blocks are recolored based on this proximity relationship.
      - invariance: Pixels not part of a gray block, including the source pixels in the top row, remain unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify all distinct contiguous regions (blocks) composed entirely of gray pixels (color 5) in the input grid.
    2.  Identify all pixels in the first row (row 0) that are not white (color 0). Record their colors and column indices. These are the "source pixels".
    3.  For each identified gray block:
        a.  Determine the range of columns the block occupies (from `min_col` to `max_col`).
        b.  For each source pixel (with color `source_color` at column `source_col`):
            i.  Calculate the minimum horizontal distance between the block and the source pixel. This is the minimum value of `abs(c - source_col)` for all `c` from `min_col` to `max_col`.
        c.  Find the source pixel that yields the overall minimum horizontal distance to the block.
        d.  Assign the color of this closest source pixel to the gray block.
    4.  Create the output grid by copying the input grid.
    5.  For each gray block identified in step 1, change the color of all its constituent pixels in the output grid to the color assigned in step 3d.
    6.  Return the modified output grid.
