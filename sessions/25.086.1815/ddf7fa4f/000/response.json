The input grid contains several rectangular blocks composed of gray pixels (color 5). The first row of the input grid contains a few distinct non-white colored pixels, which act as sources. The transformation identifies each gray block and determines which source color pixel in the top row is horizontally closest to it. Each gray block is then entirely replaced with the color of its nearest source pixel. All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
