Transforms the input grid by:
1. Identifying the background color as the color of the pixel at the top-left corner (0,0).
2. Identifying the foreground color as the other color present in the grid (assuming only two significant colors).
3. Extracting the set of coordinates `P` of all foreground pixels.
4. Calculating the set of points `S = { Pi + Pj - Pk | Pi, Pj, Pk in P }`. This set `S` represents the smallest centrally symmetric point set containing the original foreground points `P`. Geometrically, this means generating points `Ps` such that the vector from `Pk` to `Pj` is the same as the vector from `Pi` to `Ps`.
5. Creating an output grid sized to the minimal bounding box containing all points in `S`.
6. Filling the output grid with the background color.
7. Drawing the foreground color at the coordinates defined by `S`, shifted so the minimum coordinate point aligns with the origin (0,0) of the output grid.
