Calculating the set of points `S = { Pi + Pj - Pk | Pi, Pj, Pk in P }`. This set `S` represents the smallest centrally symmetric point set containing the original foreground points `P`. Geometrically, this means generating points `Ps` such that the vector from `Pk` to `Pj` is the same as the vector from `Pi` to `Ps`.\n5. Creating an output grid sized to the minimal bounding box containing all points in `S`.\n6. Filling the output grid with the background color.\n7.
