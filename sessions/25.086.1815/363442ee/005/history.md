"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0).
2. Copy all gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the corresponding coordinates in the output grid.
3. Extract the 3x3 'source pattern' from the top-left corner (0,0 to 2,2) of the input grid.
4. Copy this 'source pattern' to the top-left corner (0,0 to 2,2) of the output grid, but do not overwrite any gray pixels already placed.
5. Find the coordinates of all blue (1) 'marker' pixels in the input grid.
6. For each marker coordinate, stamp the 'source pattern' onto the output grid, anchored at the marker's coordinate (top-left of pattern aligns with marker).
7. During stamping, ensure coordinates are within grid bounds and do not overwrite any gray (5) pixels in the output grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified several key components of the task:
*   The background color (white).
*   The 'preserved' color (gray) and the need to copy it first.
*   The 'source pattern' as the top-left 3x3 area of the input.
*   The 'marker' color (blue).
*   The concept of 'stamping' the source pattern at locations related to the markers.

However, the code failed because the interpretation of *how* the marker position relates to the stamp location was incorrect based only on the first example. The outputs show that the pattern is not anchored by its top-left corner at the marker location.

Comparing the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` across all examples reveals a consistent discrepancy in the placement of the stamped patterns. The `Expected Output` places the patterns such that the blue marker pixel in the input corresponds to the *center* of the 3x3 stamped pattern in the output.

**Strategy:**
1.  Verify the "center" hypothesis by examining the coordinates in all examples.
2.  Update the natural language program to reflect this centered stamping logic.
3.  Maintain the rules regarding preserving gray pixels and handling boundary conditions.
4.  Confirm that the initial copy of the pattern to the top-left corner is still a necessary and distinct step.

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's confirm the details:

*   **Grid Size:** All examples use a 9x13 grid.
*   **Source Pattern:** Always the top-left 3x3 block of the input grid.
*   **Preserved Pixels:** Gray (5) pixels exist in all inputs, primarily in column 3. These are correctly transferred to the output in all `Expected Output` grids.
*   **Marker Pixels:** Blue (1) pixels appear at various locations in the input grids.
*   **Stamping Logic:**
    *   **Example 1:** Input marker at (1, 8). Expected output has the source pattern centered at (1, 8), covering rows 0-2 and columns 7-9. The previous code placed it starting at (1, 8), covering rows 1-3 and columns 8-10 (partially).
    *   **Example 2:** Input marker at (1, 5). Expected output has the source pattern centered at (1, 5), covering rows 0-2 and columns 4-6.
    *   **Example 3:** Input marker at (4, 8). Expected output has the source pattern centered at (4, 8), covering rows 3-5 and columns 7-9.
*   **Top-Left Copy:** In all examples, the `Expected Output` shows the source pattern copied to the top-left (0,0 to 2,2), *independent* of whether a marker exists near that location (e.g., no marker near (1,1)). This confirms Step 4 is a separate rule.
*   **Overlap/Preservation:** The gray column (column 3) is never overwritten by the stamped patterns in the `Expected Output`, confirming the preservation rule.

The key insight is that a blue marker at `(r, c)` triggers a stamp centered at `(r, c)`, meaning the stamp covers `(r-1, c-1)` to `(r+1, c+1)`.

grid_properties:

  - object: source_pattern

  - action: find_markers
    description: Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all 'marker_pixels' (blue, 1) in the input grid.
  - action: stamp_pattern
    description: For each 'marker_pixel' coordinate (r_marker, c_marker) found:
      - Define the target area as a 3x3 region centered at (r_marker, c_marker). The top-left of this area is (r_marker-1, c_marker-1), and the bottom-right is (r_marker+1, c_marker+1).
      - Iterate through the 3x3 'source_pattern' pixels (from relative coords dr=0..2, dc=0..2).
      - Calculate the target output coordinate: (r_out = r_marker + dr - 1, c_out = c_marker + dc - 1).
      - Place the source pattern pixel source_pattern[dr, dc] at the target coordinate (r_out, c_out) in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Only stamp if the target coordinate (r_out, c_out) is within the grid boundaries.
      - Do not stamp if the target coordinate (r_out, c_out) in the output grid already contains a 'preserved_pixel' (gray, 5).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid having the same height and width as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color, white (0).
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are gray (5). For each gray pixel, set the pixel at the corresponding coordinates in the output grid to gray (5). These gray pixels will not be overwritten in subsequent steps.
3.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner (coordinates 0,0 through 2,2) of the input grid. This is the 'source pattern'.
4.  Copy the 'source pattern' to the top-left corner (coordinates 0,0 through 2,2) of the output grid. However, if a pixel in this target area of the output grid is already gray (5) (from step 2), do not change its color; otherwise, copy the color from the corresponding source pattern pixel.
5.  Find the coordinates `(r_marker, c_marker)` of every blue (1) pixel in the input grid. These are the 'marker coordinates'.
6.  For each 'marker coordinate' `(r_marker, c_marker)` identified:
    a.  Iterate through each pixel of the 3x3 'source pattern', using relative row offsets `dr` (from 0 to 2) and relative column offsets `dc` (from 0 to 2).
    b.  Calculate the target coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid as `(r_marker + dr - 1, c_marker + dc - 1)`. This effectively centers the pattern placement around the marker coordinate.
    c.  Check if the calculated target coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` is within the valid boundaries of the output grid (i.e., `0 <= r_out < height` and `0 <= c_out < width`).
    d.  If the target coordinate is within bounds, check if the pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid is currently gray (5).
    e.  If the target coordinate is within bounds AND the pixel at that location in the output grid is NOT gray (5), then set the color of the output grid pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` to the color of the source pattern pixel at `(dr, dc)`.
7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.
