Create a new output grid having the same height and width as the input grid, and fill it entirely with the background color, white (0).\n2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are gray (5). For each gray pixel, set the pixel at the corresponding coordinates in the output grid to gray (5). These gray pixels will not be overwritten in subsequent steps.\n3.  Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner (coordinates 0,0 through 2,2) of the input grid. This is the 'source pattern'. Handle cases where the grid is smaller than 3x3.\n4.  Copy the 'source pattern' to the top-left corner (coordinates 0,0 through 2,2) of the output grid. However, if a pixel in this target area of the output grid is already gray (5) (from step 2), do not change its color; otherwise, copy the color from the corresponding source pattern pixel.\n5.  Find the coordinates `(r_marker, c_marker)` of every blue (1) pixel in the input grid. These are the 'marker coordinates'.\n6.  For each 'marker coordinate' `(r_marker, c_marker)` identified:\n    a.  Iterate through each pixel of the 3x3 'source pattern', using relative row offsets `dr` (from 0 to pattern_height-1) and relative column offsets `dc` (from 0 to pattern_width-1).\n    b.  Calculate the target coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid as `(r_marker + dr - 1, c_marker + dc - 1)`. This effectively centers the pattern placement around the marker coordinate.\n    c.  Check if the calculated target coordinate `(r_out, c_out)` is within the valid boundaries of the output grid (i.e., `0 <= r_out < height` and `0 <= c_out < width`).\n    d.  If the target coordinate is within bounds, check if the pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` in the output grid is currently gray (5).\n    e.  If the target coordinate is within bounds AND the pixel at that location in the output grid is NOT gray (5), then set the color of the output grid pixel at `(r_out, c_out)` to the color of the source pattern pixel at `(dr, dc)`.\n7.  The final state of the output grid is the result.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates of all pixels with a specific color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n        color (int): The color value to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is (row, col) coordinate.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)\n    return list(zip(rows, cols))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rules to the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    grid_height, grid_width = input_grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Define colors used in the transformation\n    background_color = 0 # white\n    preserve_color = 5   # gray\n    marker_color = 1     # blue\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Initialize output grid with background color ---\n    output_grid = np.full((grid_height, grid_width), background_color, dtype=int)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Identify and copy 'preserve' color pixels (gray) ---\n    preserve_coords = find_pixels(input_grid_np, preserve_color)\n    for r, c in preserve_coords:\n        # Check bounds just in case, though coordinates come from the grid itself\n        if 0 <= r < grid_height and 0 <= c < grid_width:\n            output_grid[r, c] = preserve_color\n\n    # --- Step 3: Extract the 3x3 source pattern from the top-left corner ---\n    # Ensure pattern extraction does not go out of bounds for small grids\n    pattern_height = min(3, grid_height)\n    pattern_width = min(3, grid_width)\n    source_pattern = input_grid_np[0:pattern_height, 0:pattern_width]\n\n    # --- Step 4: Copy the source pattern to the top-left of the output grid ---\n    # Avoid overwriting preserved (gray) pixels.\n    for dr in range(pattern_height):\n        for dc in range(pattern_width):\n             r_out, c_out = dr, dc # Target coordinates are same as relative pattern coords\n             # Check bounds (redundant here as pattern dims <= grid dims, but good practice)\n             if 0 <= r_out < grid_height and 0 <= c_out < grid_width:\n                 # Check if the target pixel is NOT the preserved color before overwriting\n                 if output_grid[r_out, c_out] != preserve_color:\n                     output_grid[r_out, c_out] = source_pattern[dr, dc]\n\n    # --- Step 5: Find the coordinates of all marker pixels (blue) ---\n    marker_coords = find_pixels(input_grid_np, marker_color)\n\n    # --- Step 6: For each marker coordinate, stamp the source pattern (centered) ---\n    for r_marker, c_marker in marker_coords:\n        # a.
