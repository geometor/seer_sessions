task_description: Stamp a 3x3 pattern onto a grid based on marker locations, preserving certain pixels.

grid_properties:
  background_color: 0 # white
  output_dimensions: Same as input

objects:
  - object: source_pattern
    definition: The 3x3 subgrid at the top-left corner (0,0 to 2,2) of the input grid.
    properties:
      - size: 3x3 (potentially smaller if grid dimensions < 3)
  - object: preserved_pixels
    definition: All pixels in the input grid with a specific color.
    properties:
      - color: 5 # gray
  - object: marker_pixels
    definition: All pixels in the input grid with a specific color, used as anchors for stamping.
    properties:
      - color: 1 # blue

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - action: copy_preserved
    description: Copy all 'preserved_pixels' (gray, 5) from their input coordinates to the same coordinates in the output grid.
  - action: copy_initial_pattern
    description: Copy the 'source_pattern' to the top-left corner (0,0 to 2,2) of the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Do not overwrite 'preserved_pixels' already placed in the output grid.
  - action: find_markers
    description: Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all 'marker_pixels' (blue, 1) in the input grid.
  - action: stamp_pattern
    description: For each 'marker_pixel' coordinate (r_marker, c_marker) found:
      - Define the target area as a 3x3 region centered at (r_marker, c_marker). The top-left of this area is (r_marker-1, c_marker-1), and the bottom-right is (r_marker+1, c_marker+1).
      - Iterate through the 3x3 'source_pattern' pixels (from relative coords dr=0..2, dc=0..2).
      - Calculate the target output coordinate: (r_out = r_marker + dr - 1, c_out = c_marker + dc - 1).
      - Place the source pattern pixel source_pattern[dr, dc] at the target coordinate (r_out, c_out) in the output grid.
    constraints:
      - Only stamp if the target coordinate (r_out, c_out) is within the grid boundaries.
      - Do not stamp if the target coordinate (r_out, c_out) in the output grid already contains a 'preserved_pixel' (gray, 5).

order_of_operations:
  1. initialize_output
  2. copy_preserved
  3. copy_initial_pattern
  4. find_markers
  5. stamp_pattern (repeated for each marker)
