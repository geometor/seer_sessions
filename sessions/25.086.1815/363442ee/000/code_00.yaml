task_context:
  grid_dimensions:
    - input_shape: [9, 13] # based on examples
    - output_shape: [9, 13] # same as input
  persistent_elements:
    - object: source_pattern
      description: A 3x3 subgrid of non-white pixels.
      location: Top-left corner (rows 0-2, cols 0-2).
      role: Template to be copied.
    - object: vertical_divider
      description: A vertical line of pixels.
      color: gray (5)
      location: Column index 3.
      role: Static background element, separates source pattern area from target area.
  variable_elements:
    - object: marker_pixels
      description: Individual pixels indicating target locations.
      color: blue (1)
      location: Variable coordinates (row, col), always to the right of the vertical_divider (col > 3).
      role: Trigger points for pattern placement.
transformation:
  action: copy_paste_pattern
  source_object: source_pattern
  target_locations: Determined by the coordinates of marker_pixels.
  placement_rule: The top-left corner of the source_pattern is placed at the exact coordinates of each marker_pixel.
  modification: The marker_pixels are replaced/overwritten during the paste operation.
  boundary_handling: If the pasted pattern exceeds grid boundaries, it is clipped.
  result: Output grid contains the original persistent elements plus copies of the source_pattern placed at marker_pixel locations.
