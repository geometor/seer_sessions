Let's call this the \"source pattern\".\n    *   A vertical line of gray pixels (color 5) consistently appears in the 4th column (index 3).\n3.  **Variable Elements (Input):**\n    *   Blue pixels (color 1) appear sporadically in the area to the right of the gray line. Their positions vary between examples.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The output grid largely resembles the input grid initially.\n    *   The key change is that wherever a blue pixel (1) existed in the input, a copy of the \"source pattern\" is placed in the output grid.\n    *   The top-left corner of the copied pattern corresponds exactly to the location of the original blue pixel.\n    *   The blue pixels themselves are *replaced* by the top-left pixel of the copied source pattern.\n    *   If placing the 3x3 source pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries (specifically, the right edge in these examples), the pattern is clipped; only the parts that fit within the grid are drawn.\n    *   The original source pattern in the top-left and the gray line remain unchanged in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
