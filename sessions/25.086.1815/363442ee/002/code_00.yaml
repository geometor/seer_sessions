task_description: Stamp a 3x3 pattern onto a grid based on marker locations, preserving specific elements.

input_grid:
  properties:
    height: variable (9 in examples)
    width: variable (13 in examples)
    pixels:
      - color: blue (1)
        role: marker
        location: variable coordinates
        count: variable
      - color: gray (5)
        role: structure_to_preserve
        location: variable coordinates (forms a vertical line at column 3 in examples)
        count: variable
      - color: various (0-9, excluding blue/gray in specific roles)
        role: pattern_source / background
        location: variable

output_grid:
  properties:
    height: same as input
    width: same as input
    derivation:
      - step: Initialize with background color (white, 0).
      - step: Copy gray (5) pixels from input to output at same coordinates.
      - step: Copy the 3x3 top-left pattern from input to output at top-left (0,0), respecting preserved gray pixels (do not overwrite gray).
      - step: Identify blue (1) markers in the input grid.
      - step: For each marker, copy the 3x3 top-left input pattern onto the output grid, anchored at the marker's coordinates. This copy respects boundary clipping and preserved gray pixels (do not overwrite gray).

source_pattern:
  source: input_grid[0:3, 0:3]
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3

actions:
  - action: initialize_grid
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      fill_color: white (0)
      dimensions: same as input_grid
  - action: copy_pixels
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      color_to_copy: gray (5)
      condition: copy only gray pixels to their identical coordinates.
  - action: copy_pattern
    source: source_pattern (derived from input_grid[0:3, 0:3])
    target: output_grid[0:3, 0:3]
    properties:
      condition: do not overwrite existing gray pixels in the target area.
  - action: find_markers
    source: input_grid
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
    output: list of marker coordinates (r, c)
  - action: stamp_pattern
    source: source_pattern
    target: output_grid
    properties:
      anchor_points: list of marker coordinates from find_markers
      placement: top-left of pattern at anchor point
      clipping: apply boundary clipping
      condition: do not overwrite existing gray pixels in the target area.
