Stamp pattern `P` at marker locations.\n\nLet's simulate this for Example 1:\nStart with 9x13 white grid.\nCopy gray line at col 3.\nStamp P at (1, 8): Output[1:4, 8:11] = P\nStamp P at (4, 5): Output[4:7, 5:8] = P\nStamp P at (4, 11): Output[4:7, 11:13] = P[:, 0:2] (clipped)\nStamp P at (7, 5): Output[7:9, 5:8] = P[0:2, :] (clipped)\nStamp P at (7, 8): Output[7:9, 8:11] = P[0:2, :] (clipped)\n\nLet's see where this differs from the expected output.\nExpected Output has the *original pattern* at (0,0) to (2,2). My hypothesis wiped that out.\n\n**Third Hypothesis:**\n1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Identify the 3x3 source pattern from the top-left corner (0,0).\n3. Find the coordinates of all blue (1) marker pixels.\n4. Create a *temporary* copy of the output grid or use a separate layer for stamping.\n5. For each marker coordinate (r_target, c_target):\n    a. Iterate through the source pattern (dr, dc).\n    b. Calculate destination coordinates (r_out, c_out).\n    c. If within bounds, update the *temporary grid* at (r_out, c_out) with the pattern pixel `source_pattern[dr, dc]`.\n6. Find all coordinates that were *not* part of the source pattern location (0:3, 0:3) and were *not* overwritten by stamping any pattern in the temporary grid.\n7. Set the pixels at these coordinates in the *final* output grid to white (0), *unless* they are gray (5). Gray pixels should always be preserved from the input.\n\nLet's rethink step 6 & 7. Maybe it's simpler.\n\n**Fourth Hypothesis (Refining the Initialization):**\n1. Initialize the output grid to be the same size as the input, filled with white (0).\n2. Copy *only* the gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the output grid at their original locations.\n3. Copy *only* the 3x3 source pattern from the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid to the output grid at (0,0).\n4. Find the coordinates of all blue (1) marker pixels in the *input* grid.\n5. For each marker coordinate (r_target, c_target):\n    a. Iterate through the source pattern pixels (dr, dc).\n    b. Calculate destination coordinates (r_out, c_out).\n    c. If within bounds, update the output grid at (r_out, c_out) with the pattern pixel `source_pattern[dr, dc]`. (This will overwrite parts of the initial pattern copy if markers are close, and potentially overwrite gray pixels if the pattern overlaps, which needs verification).\n\nLet's check this hypothesis against Example 1:\n1. White 9x13 grid.\n2. Copy gray line at col 3.\n   "

The key seems to be correctly handling the background and the preservation of specific elements.\n\nLet's reconsider the difference between the initial state (Hypothesis 4: white + gray + pattern) and the expected output.\nExpected Output = White Base + Gray Line (preserved) + Original Pattern (preserved) + Stamped Patterns (at markers)\n\n**Final Hypothesis (Hypothesis 6):**\n1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white (0).\n2.  **Preserve Gray:** Copy all gray (5) pixels from their positions in the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.\n3.  **Preserve Original Pattern:** Copy the 3x3 block from the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid (let's call this the `source_pattern`) to the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid.\n4.  **Identify Markers:** Find the coordinates (r_target, c_target) of all blue (1) pixels in the *input* grid.\n5.  **Stamp Patterns:** For each marker coordinate (r_target, c_target):\n    a.  Iterate through the `source_pattern` using relative indices (dr, dc) from 0 to 2.\n    b.  Calculate the destination coordinates in the output grid: (r_out, c_out) = (r_target + dr, c_target + dc).\n    c.  Check if the destination coordinates (r_out, c_out) are within the bounds of the output grid.\n    d.  If the coordinates are within bounds, update the output grid pixel: `output_grid[r_out, c_out] = source_pattern[dr, dc]`. This overwrite takes precedence over the initial white background but happens *after* the gray line and original pattern have been placed. Gray pixels might be overwritten by this step if a pattern placement overlaps them (Need to confirm if this is intended - let's assume simple overwrite for now, as restoring gray later failed). Let's re-evaluate the gray overwrite. Looking at the expected outputs, the gray line seems inviolate. It's always present. So, the stamping should *not* overwrite gray pixels.\n\n**Final Hypothesis (Hypothesis 7 - Refined Stamping):**\n1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white (0).\n2.  **Preserve Gray:** Copy all gray (5) pixels from their positions in the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.\n3.  **Preserve Original Pattern:** Copy the 3x3 block from the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid (let's call this the `source_pattern`) to the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid. This step should *not* overwrite any gray pixels already placed.\n4.  **Identify Markers:** Find the coordinates (r_target, c_target) of all blue (1) pixels in the *input* grid.\n5.  **Stamp Patterns:** For each marker coordinate (r_target, c_target):\n    a.  Iterate through the `source_pattern` using relative indices (dr, dc) from 0 to 2.\n    b.  Calculate the destination coordinates in the output grid: (r_out, c_out) = (r_target + dr, c_target + dc).\n    c.  Check if the destination coordinates (r_out, c_out) are within the bounds of the output grid.\n    d.  If the coordinates are within bounds **and** the pixel at `output_grid[r_out, c_out]` is **not gray (5)**, update the output grid pixel: `output_grid[r_out, c_out] = source_pattern[dr, dc]`.\n\nLet's test this mentally on Example 1.\n1.

Overwrite occurs (clipped).\n\nThis process seems to construct the expected output exactly.\n\n## General Assessment\n\nThe initial code failed because it incorrectly assumed the output grid should be initialized as a copy of the input grid. The analysis reveals that the output grid should start mostly white, preserving only specific elements from the input: a gray (color 5) structure and the 3x3 pattern from the top-left corner. The core logic of identifying blue markers and stamping the pattern seems correct, but the interaction with the background and preserved elements was flawed. The key insight is that the gray pixels are never overwritten, and the original pattern in the top-left is also preserved, while the rest of the background becomes white unless overwritten by a stamped pattern.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution and analysis (Hypothesis 7):\n\n**Common Properties:**\n*   Grid Shape: All examples use 9x13 grids for input and output.\n*   Source Pattern: A 3x3 pattern is always extracted from the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid.\n*   Marker Color: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid indicate where the pattern should be stamped.\n*   Preserved Color: Gray (5) pixels from the input grid are always preserved in their original locations in the output grid. Gray pixels are never overwritten by stamped patterns.\n*   Background Color: The default background color for the output grid is white (0).\n*   Stamping Anchor: The top-left corner of the source pattern is placed at the coordinate of the blue marker pixel.\n*   Stamping Overwrite: Stamping overwrites any existing pixel in the output grid *except* for gray pixels. This includes overwriting the initial white background, parts of the initially copied source pattern (if a marker is near the top-left), and potentially parts of other stamped patterns if markers are close together.\n\n**Example Specifics (from previous `tool_code` output):**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 13)\n    *   Pattern: `[[2, 7, 3], [2, 3, 3], [3, 7, 7]]`\n    *   Markers: `((1, 8), (4, 5), (4, 11), (7, 5), (7, 8))`\n    *   Gray Coords: `((0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3))` (Vertical line)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 13)\n    *   Pattern: `[[4, 2, 2], [2, 6, 2], [6, 4, 4]]`\n    *   Markers: `((1, 5), (4, 8), (7, 8))`\n    *   Gray Coords: `((0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3))` (Vertical line)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (9, 13)\n    *   Pattern: `[[3, 8, 6], [9, 8, 2], [9, 9, 9]]`\n    *   Markers: `((1, 5), (1, 11), (4, 8), (7, 8), (7, 11))`\n    *   Gray Coords: `((0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3))` (Vertical line)\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
