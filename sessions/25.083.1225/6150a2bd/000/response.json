The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example and 3x2 in the second). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color changes, but rather a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. The order of the rows appears reversed, as well.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
