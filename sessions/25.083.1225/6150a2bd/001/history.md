## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example and 3x2 in the second). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color changes, but rather a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. The order of the rows appears reversed, as well.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x2 (example 2)
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Rearranges grid elements.
    details: Appears to involve a combination of reflection/flipping and row reversal.

relationships:
  - input_grid: original arrangement of elements
  - output_grid: transformed arrangement of elements
  - element_positions:  Mapping between element positions in input and output grids.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse the order of the rows:**  The bottom row of the input grid becomes the top row of the output grid, the middle row stays in the middle, and the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output.
2.  **Mirror the elements across a vertical axis (Flip horizontally):** Within each row, the order of elements is reversed. The last element becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on.

In essence, the transformation is a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid (or equivalently, a horizontal flip followed by a vertical flip).
