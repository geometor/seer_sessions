Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are 3x3 grids.
*   The outputs are smaller grids with variable dimensions (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2).
*   Each grid cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color.
*   The '0' (white) color seems to act as a background or empty space.
*   The non-zero colors in the input grid appear to be the focus of the transformation.
*   The output grid seems to be a compressed representation of the non-zero colors from the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cell_values: [0-9]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      cell_values: [0-9]
  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: pixels
    properties:
      color: [1-9]
      locations: variable

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: non_zero_pixels
  - name: compress
    input: non_zero_pixels
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_zero_pixels
  - output_grid represents compressed non_zero_pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with values other than '0' (white).
2.  **Extract and Count:** Extract these non-zero pixels and count how many instances of each color exist.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid. For each non-zero color found, create the number of non_zero pixel in the output. The number of cells should be the number of instances of the non zero colour. Order does not matter, as long as the counts of the color are correct.

Essentially, the rule is to extract all the non-zero pixels from input and create them in the output and repeating them the number of times they appear.
