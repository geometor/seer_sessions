            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program and the Python code accordingly.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying azure (8) objects and placing blue (1) cells adjacent to them based on their shape and orientation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) cells.\n\n2.  **Classify Object Shape:** Determine the shape of each azure object:\n    *   **Vertical Line:** A straight line where all cells have the same column index.\n    *   **Horizontal Line:** A straight line where all cells have the same row index.\n    *  **L-Shape:** Consists of three cells forming an \"L\" shape.\n    *  **Other shape**: There might be other shapes.\n\n3.  **Place Blue Cell Based on Shape:**\n    *   **Vertical Line:** Place a blue (1) cell to the *right* of the *topmost* azure cell.\n    *   **Horizontal Line:** Place a blue (1) cell to the *left* of the *rightmost* azure cell.\n    *   **L-Shape:** Place a blue (1) cell *above* the corner cell if the corner is at the top.\n    * **Other shapes:** *Do nothing (important!)*\n\n4. **Edge cases:**\n    - Ensure the blue cell would be placed within the bounds of the grid, do nothing otherwise.\n\n**Analysis of Previous Errors and Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The previous code failed because it didn't place any blue cells. The conditions for placing blue cells were not correctly implemented, and the placement logic was incomplete/incorrect, especially for the horizontal line.\n*   **Example 2:** The previous code failed because it didn't have correct logic to determine the position of the blue cell. The code has an L-shape corner detector that is not generic. The placement logic needs to be applied in a way, where the correct direction is considered.\n\n**Revised Python Code:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, color):\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= grid.shape[0] or c < 0 or c >= grid.shape[1] or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)\n\n    for obj in azure_objects:\n        obj.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n        rows = [cell[0] for cell in obj]\n        cols = [cell[1] for cell in obj]\n\n        if len(set(cols)) == 1 and len(obj) > 1:  # Vertical Line\n            top_cell = obj[0]\n            if top_cell[1] + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]: # Boundary Check\n              output_grid[top_cell[0], top_cell[1] + 1] = 1\n\n        elif len(set(rows)) == 1 and len(obj) > 1:  # Horizontal Line\n            right_cell = obj[-1]\n            if right_cell[1] - 1 >= 0:  # Boundary check\n                output_grid[right_cell[0], right_cell[1] - 1] = 1\n\n        elif len(obj) == 3: # L-shape\n            # Find corner\n            row_counts = {}\n            col_counts = {}\n            for r in rows:\n                row_counts[r] = row_counts.get(r,0) + 1\n            for c in cols:\n                col_counts[c] = col_counts.get(c,0) + 1\n\n            corner_row = [r for r, count in row_counts.items() if count > 1][0]\n            corner_col = [c for c, count in col_counts.items() if count > 1][0]\n            \n            # Determine corner direction and check boundaries\n            if corner_row > min(rows) and corner_row -1 >= 0:\n              output_grid[corner_row - 1, corner_col] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nKey Changes in the Code:\n\n1.  **Clearer Shape Classification:** Explicitly checks for vertical and horizontal lines using `set` operations on row and column indices.\n2.  **Corrected Placement Logic:**  The placement of blue cells is now strictly based on the topmost (vertical) and rightmost (horizontal) cells, and the corner of the \"L\".\n3.  **Boundary Checks:** Added boundary checks to avoid `IndexError`.\n4.  **L-shape corner:** The L-shape corner is detected correctly by counting the number of times that the rows and columns appear.\n5. **Other shapes:** The code does nothing with other shapes, it doesn't modify them.\n"
