elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - structure: 2D array of pixels
      - content: contains pixels of various colors, predominantly white (0) and one other non-white color.
      - size: variable (examples are 3x3)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - structure: 1D array (single row) of pixels
      - content: contains only pixels of the non-white color found in the input_grid.
      - size: 1 row, number of columns equals the count of non-white pixels in the input_grid.
  - object: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - type: pixel
      - color: a single color value from 1-9 in each example.
      - location: specific coordinates within the input_grid.
relationships:
  - type: extraction
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    details: Non-white pixels are extracted from the input grid.
  - type: composition
    of: output_grid
    using: non_white_pixel
    details: The output grid is composed solely of the non-white pixels extracted from the input grid.
  - type: count_equality
    element1: non_white_pixel (count in input_grid)
    element2: pixels (count in output_grid)
    details: The total number of non-white pixels in the input equals the total number of pixels in the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_non_white
    target: input_grid
    result: collection of non-white pixels (color and potentially original location).
  - action: create_output_row
    using: collection of non-white pixels
    result: output_grid (1xN) where N is the count of non-white pixels.
    details: The colors from the collection are placed into the output row. The order appears preserved based on reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) from the input grid.
