Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input is always a 3x3 grid containing mostly white pixels (0) and a few pixels of another single color.
*   The output is always a 1xN grid (a single row).
*   The color of the non-white pixels in the input is the same as the color of the pixels in the output.
*   The number of pixels in the output grid is equal to the number of non-white pixels in the input grid.
*   The task seems to involve extracting all the non-white pixels from the input grid and arranging them horizontally into a single row in the output grid.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - structure: 2D array of pixels
      - content: contains pixels of various colors, predominantly white (0) and one other non-white color.
      - size: variable (examples are 3x3)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: grid
      - structure: 1D array (single row) of pixels
      - content: contains only pixels of the non-white color found in the input_grid.
      - size: 1 row, number of columns equals the count of non-white pixels in the input_grid.
  - object: non_white_pixel
    properties:
      - type: pixel
      - color: a single color value from 1-9 in each example.
      - location: specific coordinates within the input_grid.
relationships:
  - type: extraction
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    details: Non-white pixels are extracted from the input grid.
  - type: composition
    of: output_grid
    using: non_white_pixel
    details: The output grid is composed solely of the non-white pixels extracted from the input grid.
  - type: count_equality
    element1: non_white_pixel (count in input_grid)
    element2: pixels (count in output_grid)
    details: The total number of non-white pixels in the input equals the total number of pixels in the output.
actions:
  - action: identify_non_white
    target: input_grid
    result: collection of non-white pixels (color and potentially original location).
  - action: create_output_row
    using: collection of non-white pixels
    result: output_grid (1xN) where N is the count of non-white pixels.
    details: The colors from the collection are placed into the output row. The order appears preserved based on reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid row by row, from top to bottom. Within each row, scan from left to right.
2.  Identify every pixel that is not white (color 0).
3.  Collect the colors of these non-white pixels in the order they were encountered during the scan.
4.  Create a new output grid with 1 row and a number of columns equal to the total count of non-white pixels found.
5.  Populate the output grid's single row with the collected non-white pixel colors, maintaining the order from step 3.
