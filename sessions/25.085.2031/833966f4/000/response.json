This can be interpreted as an Nx1 grid or a simple list of numbers.\n    *   In both examples, the input list has a length of 5. The output list also has a length of 5.\n    *   The colors present in the output list are exactly the same as the colors in the input list; only their positions have changed.\n    *   The transformation appears to involve swapping pairs of adjacent elements based on their position (index) in the list.\n    *   Specifically, in both examples, the elements at indices (0, 1) are swapped, and the elements at indices (3, 4) are swapped. The element at index 2 remains in its original position. This suggests a pattern where swaps occur for pairs starting at indices that are multiples of 3.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
