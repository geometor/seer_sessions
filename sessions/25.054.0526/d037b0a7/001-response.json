Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation seems to involve filling or overwriting certain pixels based on the values of other pixels within the grid. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is maintained in the transformation. The colors used are white(0), magenta(6), yellow(4), and green(3).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
