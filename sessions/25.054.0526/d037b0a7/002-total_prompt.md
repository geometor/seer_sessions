## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191A943E20>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191ABABC70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation seems to involve filling or overwriting certain pixels based on the values of other pixels within the grid. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is maintained in the transformation. The colors used are white(0), magenta(6), yellow(4), and green(3).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer
    value_range: 0-9
  - object: pixel_6
    color: magenta
    initial_location: [0,2]
    final_location: [0,2]
  - object: pixel_4
    color: yellow
    initial_location: [1,1]
    final_location: [1,1]
 - object: pixel_3
    color: green
    initial_location: [2,0]
    final_location: [2,0]
  - action: fill_downward
    source: pixel_6
    target: all pixels below, including diagonals
    fill_value: 6
  - action: fill_downward_from_4
    source: pixel_4
    target: pixels directly below pixel_4
    fill_value: 4
  - observation: All non-zero color are maintained
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the pixel with the value '6' (magenta) and the pixel with the value '4' (yellow) and the pixel with the value 3 (green).
2.  **Preserve Key Pixels and other non-zero pixels:** The original colored values are unchanged in terms of location.
3.  **Propagate Magenta (6):** All pixels below the magenta pixel, including diagonal pixels, are changed to the value '6'.
4. **Propagate Yellow (4)**: All pixels below the yellow pixel are change to the value '4'.
5. **Preserve the rest:** Leave all the rest of the original grid intact.

Essentially this could be described a cascading fill down operation, where, starting from color 6, then color 4, each pixel value propagates downward changing the 0's to its value. The 3 in the bottom corner does not participate.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
