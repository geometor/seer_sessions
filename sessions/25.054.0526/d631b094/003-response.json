            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was overly specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the pattern (counting a specific color and creating a new grid based on that count) but failed to generalize. It assumed the counted color was blue (1) and that the output grid should *always* be filled with blue. The subsequent examples demonstrate that the color to be counted and used for the output changes, and corresponds to the non-black, non-white pixel in the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Color:** Instead of hardcoding blue (1), the program needs to dynamically determine the relevant color from the input grid. This color is the one that isn't black (0) or white (background in most cases).\n\n2.  **Count and Replicate:** Count the occurrences of the identified key color.\n\n3.  **Output Grid:** Create an output grid of height 1 and width equal to the count, and fill it with the identified key color.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis using Code Execution:**\n\nSince I can't directly execute code here, I'll outline what *would* be done and the expected insights:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code worked as expected because the target color happened to be blue. Metrics would confirm a perfect match.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    -   Input analysis would show Red (2) is the non-zero, non-background color.  A count of 3 should be determined.\n    -   The expected output confirms a 1x3 grid of red.\n    -   Current code fails because it's looking for blue.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    -   Input analysis: Orange (7), count of 1.\n    -   Expected output: 1x1 grid of orange.\n    -   Code fails: looking for blue.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    -   Input analysis: Azure (8), count of 4.\n    -   Expected output: 1x4 grid of azure.\n    -   Code fails: looking for blue.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: 002\n    example_set: train\n  - example: 1\n    input_grid_dims: [3, 3]\n    output_grid_dims: [1, 2]\n    key_color: blue # blue is the color that appears other than background (0)\n    key_color_count: 2\n    output_color: blue\n  - example: 2\n    input_grid_dims: [3, 3]\n    output_grid_dims: [1, 3]\n    key_color: red\n    key_color_count: 3\n    output_color: red\n  - example: 3\n    input_grid_dims: [3, 3]\n    output_grid_dims: [1, 1]\n    key_color: orange\n    key_color_count: 1\n    output_color: orange\n  - example: 4\n    input_grid_dims: [3, 3]\n    output_grid_dims: [1, 4]\n    key_color: azure\n    key_color_count: 4\n    output_color: azure\n\nobjects:\n  - object_type: grid\n    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.\n  - object_type: pixel\n    description: Each cell in the grid, represented by a color value.\n  - object_type: key_color\n    description: The non-background, non-white color in the input grid.\n\nactions:\n  - action_type: identify_key_color\n    description: Determine the unique color that is not 0 in the input grid.\n  - action_type: count_color\n    description: Count the occurrences of the key color.\n  - action_type: create_output\n    description: Generate a new grid with a width equal to the color count and fill it with the key color.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the Key Color:** Examine the input grid and identify the single color value that is present and not equal to 0 (background). This is the \"key color\". If there are multiple colors besides zero consider the lowest one.\n2.  **Count the Key Color:** Count the number of pixels in the input grid that have the key color.\n3.  **Create the Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a height of 1 and a width equal to the count from step 2.\n4.  **Fill the Output Grid:** Fill every pixel of the output grid with the key color identified in step 1.\n"
