## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191A943D90>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7B191A943F10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The positions of the 1s in the input grid seem relevant. The output grid's dimensions are smaller than the input grid's. The transformation involves a reduction in size and seems to be summarizing or extracting information about the blue pixels in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: blue
        value: 1
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
  - action: size_reduction
    description: The grid dimensions change from 3x3 to 1x2.
  - action: color_filtering_or_counting
    description:  Only the 'blue' color (value 1) from the input is present in the output, suggesting counting or presence check.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe:** Examine the input grid, a 3x3 matrix of pixels.
2.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels with the value 1 (blue color).
3.  **Count/Existence**: There are two blue pixels.
4. **Construct**: create a 1x2 grid
5.  **Populate:** Fill each cell of the output grid with the value 1 (blue). The dimensions of the output array is related to the number of blue pixels.

In essence, the program detects blue pixels in the input grid, then creates new blue grid with the width equal to number of the blue pixels detected.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
