The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid appears to be entirely filled with a single color, specifically the color corresponding to the integer '4' (yellow). The dimensions of the grid are 3x3. The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific color within the input and then flood-filling the entire output grid with that color. It is highly probable that the selected color '4' is the most frequent color of the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
