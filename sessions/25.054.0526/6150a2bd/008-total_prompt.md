## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191ABABFA0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191ABABC70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input and output grids seem to have a mirrored and inverted relationship with respect to content, and colors are maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    representation: integers (0-9)
    color_map:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      5: gray

  - object1:
      type: pixel_set
      description: Original arrangement of colored pixels in the input grid.
      properties:
          - color
          - position

  - object2:
       type: pixel_set
       description: transformed arrangement in output
       properties:
         - color
         - position

  - action:
      type: transformation
      description: Inverts and mirrors the spatial arrangement of pixels.
      details:  The transformation swaps elements across both diagonals creating a combined horizontal and vertical mirroring. The colors of corresponding elements are preserved.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Inversion and Mirroring:** The positions of elements are transformed by swapping indices (i,j) for (n-1-j,n-1-i).
3.  **Color Preservation**: Copy the colors of input pixels directly to the corresponding transformed positions in the output.

In short: The transformation takes input grid, inverts positions of pixels across both axes, and creates the output, preserving pixel colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
