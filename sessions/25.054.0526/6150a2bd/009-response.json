            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a 180-degree rotation (inverting across both axes) is incorrect. While it works partially for some symmetrical cases, it fails to accurately capture the transformation in the provided examples.  The \"Transformed Output\" consistently shows discrepancies compared to the \"Expected Output.\" A key observation is that the error isn't simply a misapplication of the 180-degree rotation; the positions of pixels are incorrectly calculated and the colors are incorrect. The strategy should be to re-examine the input-output pairs, focusing on individual pixel movements and color preservation to deduce the *correct* underlying transformation rule, rather than trying to adjust the existing, flawed rotation concept.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI will use a more visual way to assess the transformation, comparing the input and output grids. Because the current python code is incorrect, it is not helpful in discerning the pattern, so I will represent the transformations manually.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n```\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n```\n\nTransformation:\n```\n3(0,0) -> 3(2,1)\n3(0,1) -> 3(2,2)\n8(0,2) -> 8(2,0)\n3(1,0) -> 3(1,2)\n7(1,1) -> 7(1,1)\n0(1,2) -> 0(1,0)\n5(2,0) -> 5(0,2)\n0(2,1) -> 0(0,1)\n0(2,2) -> 0(0,0)\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput:\n```\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n```\n\nTransformation:\n```\n5(0,0) -> 5(2,1)\n5(0,1) -> 5(2,2)\n2(0,2) -> 2(2,0)\n1(1,0) -> 1(1,2)\n0(1,1) -> 0(1,1)\n0(1,2) -> 0(1,0)\n0(2,0) -> 0(0,2)\n0(2,1) -> 0(0,1)\n0(2,2) -> 0(0,0)\n\n```\n\nObservations after manual mapping: The transformation is a horizontal reflection (flipping the grid along the central vertical axis). The previous code incorrectly assumed 180 degree rotation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 008\nobjects:\n  - description: Grid of pixels\n    properties:\n      dimensions: 3x3\n      elements: Integers representing colors (0-9)\n\ntransformations:\n  - type: Reflection\n    axis: Horizontal (across the central vertical axis)\n    details: Each pixel at position (row, col) moves to (row, 2 - col).\n  - type: Color Preservation\n    details: The color of each pixel remains unchanged during the reflection.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule involves reflecting the input grid horizontally across its vertical axis.  For a 3x3 grid, this means that the first column swaps with the third column, while the middle column remains in place. The color of each pixel is preserved during this reflection.  Specifically, the pixel at `input[row][col]` moves to `output[row][2 - col]`.\n"
