Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (two instances)
        positions:
          - top-left corner: [1,1] (2x2 block with one cell removed)
          - bottom-right corner: [3,4] (2x2 block with one cell removed)
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        position: fills the remaining cells
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (two instances)
        positions:
          - top-left corner: [1,1] (2x2 block with one cell removed)
          - bottom-right corner: [3,4] (2x2 block with one cell removed)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        positions:
          - [1,2] #next to the top object
          - [4,5] #next to the bottom object
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        position: fills the remaining cells
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all instances of color 8 (azure) objects in the input grid. Note their positions. These objects form an "L" shape, consisting of a 2x2 block with one cell removed.

2.  **Preserve Objects:** Keep every object of color 8 in its original position in the output grid.

3.  **Introduce New Objects:** Add new objects to the grid.
    *    To the right of the top left object 8, introduce a single cell of color 1 (blue) if and only if the cell to the right of the object is color 0.
    *    To the left of the bottom right object 8, introduce a single cell of color 1 (blue) if and only if the cell to the left of the object is color 0.

In summary, the transformation preserves the azure "L" shaped objects and adds a blue cell adjacent to each, based on the initial positions of these shapes, with the added blue cells located on opposite sides.
