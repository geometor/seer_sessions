Also, one cell to the left and one to the right.\n\n4.  **Create Orange Surroundings:** For *each* blue cell (color 1), create an L-shape pattern with orange cells (color 7) around it. Specifically one position above, one position down, one position to the left and one to the right of the corner of the L. The corner cell of the L is the cell with the same coordinates as the original blue cell.\n\n5. **Azure cells unchanged**: The azure cell (color 8) at (0,3) is unchanged, it is an object that should not generate a transformation.\n\nThis refined rule now accounts for multiple instances of red and blue cells and correctly describes the transformation observed in both examples.\n\nThe python code provided in the previous turn should perform this new transformation.\n"
