In this case, we have a red cell (color 2) at (3, 2) and a blue cell (color 1) at (6, 6).\n\n2.  **Create Yellow Surroundings:** For the red cell, we will create two yellow cells, one two rows above and one column to the left. The same two rows above and one column to the right.\n    \n3.  **Create Orange Surroundings:** For the blue cell, create an L shape with orange color surrounding the identified blue cell. It is placed one row above.\n    The corner of the L shape is in (6,6).\n\n4.  **Preserve Original Cells:** Keep the original red and blue single-cell objects in their original positions.\n\n**Python Implementation**\nI will implement the python code in the next turn.\n"
