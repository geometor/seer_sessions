They are contiguous blocks of cells with color 5 (gray), surrounded by cells of color 0 (white).\n\n2.  **Color Transformation (Gray to Azure):** Every gray (5) cell in the input grid is changed to an azure (8) cell in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Red Filling between Gray Objects:** Now look at the azure objects. The red objects are related with them. For each pair of vertically or horizontally adjacent azure, draw the largest possible red rectangle so that:\n    - It starts from the edge of the first azure object.\n    - It ends at the edge of the second azure object.\n    - It's thickness is equal to one cell.\n\n4.   The bounding box of the objects formed by gray objects must be equal to the bounding box formed by azure and red objects.\n\n**Summary of the Rule**\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   Replace all gray (5) cells with azure (8) cells.\n*   Fill the one-cell-thick spaces between azure objects with red (2).\n*   Ensure that the bounding box of the gray regions in the input is conserved.\n\n"
