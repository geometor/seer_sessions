            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input to the output grid in the second example.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:**\n    *   We have a 3x7 grid.\n    *   Colors present: 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (gray).\n    *   There are distinct vertical lines formed by the blue (1) and gray (5) colors. The gray (5) color forms a central vertical line.\n*   **Output Grid:**\n    *   We have a 3x3 grid.\n    *   Colors: 0 (white), 2 (red)\n    *   There are three red pixels (2), one in the center of each row.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 3x7\n  colors:\n    0: white\n    1: blue\n    5: gray\n  objects:\n    - type: vertical_line\n      color: 1\n      positions: [(0,0), (1,2), (0,5), (1,5)]\n    - type: vertical_line\n      color: 5\n      positions: [(0,3), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  colors:\n     0: white\n     2: red\n  objects:\n     - type: single_pixel\n       color: 2\n       positions: [(0,1), (1,2) ,(2,1)]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, locate all vertical lines of color 1 (blue) and color 5 (gray). The gray line is crucial as it's in the center.\n2. **Determine Output Size and Background:** The output is a 3x3 grid and will be filled with the color 0 (white) as background.\n3.  **Extract and Transform Central Column:** Examine the central vertical line (color 5) in the input grid. For each cell in this central column, place a pixel of color 2 (red) in the center column of each corresponding row in the output grid.\n\n**In essence,** the transformation focuses on the central vertical line of the input grid. Each element of this line triggers the creation of a red pixel in the middle of each row in the output grid. The output grid is always 3x3, with a white background.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation extracts the central vertical line from the input grid.\nEach element of this line triggers the creation of a red pixel (color 2) in the\nmiddle of each row (center column) of the output grid. The output grid is always\n3x3 and filled mainly with color 0 (white).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms an input grid to a 3x3 output grid.\n    It focuses on the central vertical line.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a 3x3 array filled with 0s.\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Find the center column of the input grid.\n    center_col = cols // 2\n\n    # Iterate through each row and check the center column.\n    for i in range(min(rows, 3)):  # Ensure we don't exceed output grid bounds\n      if input_grid[i,center_col] == 5:\n        output_grid[i, 1] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
