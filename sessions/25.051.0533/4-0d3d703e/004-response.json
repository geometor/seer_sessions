The output grid mirrors this structure with three horizontal lines, but the colors are transformed according to a consistent mapping:\n\n1.  Color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.\n2.  Color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.\n3.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is replaced by color 9 (maroon) in the output.\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the transformation involves only a color change. The spatial characteristics\u2014positions, sizes, and shapes of the horizontal lines\u2014are preserved. The operation is a straightforward color substitution based on the defined mapping. No geometric transformations are applied.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid to the output grid based on a color mapping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Define the color mapping.\n    color_map = {\n        2: 6,  # red -> magenta\n        3: 4,  # green -> yellow\n        8: 9   # azure -> maroon\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid and apply the color mapping.\n    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n            if output_grid[i, j] in color_map:\n                output_grid[i, j] = color_map[output_grid[i, j]]\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
