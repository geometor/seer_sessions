Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Block for Observations:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [5, 8, 6]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (5, 8, 6).
output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    horizontal_lines:
      color_sequence: [1, 9, 2]
      count: 3
      description: Three horizontal lines, each with the same color sequence (1, 9, 2).
transformation:
  type: color_mapping
  details: Each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement remains identical.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**

The input grid is composed of three horizontal lines, each characterized by the color sequence 5, 8, 6. The output grid maintains the same structure of three horizontal lines but exhibits a different color sequence, determined by a specific color mapping:

1.  Color 5 (gray) in the input is transformed to color 1 (blue) in the output.
2.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is transformed to color 9 (maroon) in the output.
3.  Color 6 (magenta) in the input is transformed to color 2 (red) in the output.

The transformation is purely a color substitution. The spatial attributes of the objects—the horizontal lines—remain consistent between the input and output grids. There are no changes in position, size, or shape; only the colors of the constituent elements are altered according to the defined mapping.
