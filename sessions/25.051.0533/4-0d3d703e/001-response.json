The spatial arrangement remains identical.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe input grid consists of three horizontal lines, each with the color sequence 3, 1, 2. The output grid also has three horizontal lines. However, the colors have been transformed according to a specific mapping:\n\n1.  Color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.\n2.  Color 1 (blue) in the input is replaced by color 5 (gray) in the output.\n3.  Color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.\n\nThe positions, sizes, and shapes of the objects (horizontal lines) remain unchanged; only the colors are altered based on the above mapping. There are no rotations, reflections or translations. The transformation consists on a color mapping.\n"
