The spatial arrangement remains identical.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe input grid consists of three horizontal lines, each displaying the color sequence 2, 3, 8.  The output grid mirrors this structure with three horizontal lines, but the colors are transformed according to a consistent mapping:\n\n1.  Color 2 (red) in the input is replaced by color 6 (magenta) in the output.\n2.  Color 3 (green) in the input is replaced by color 4 (yellow) in the output.\n3.  Color 8 (azure) in the input is replaced by color 9 (maroon) in the output.\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the transformation involves only a color change. The spatial characteristics\u2014positions, sizes, and shapes of the horizontal lines\u2014are preserved. The operation is a straightforward color substitution based on the defined mapping. No geometric transformations are applied.\n"
