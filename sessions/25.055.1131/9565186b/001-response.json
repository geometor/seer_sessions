The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to have a specific pattern of colors, and the output grid seems to be a modified version of this pattern. The most notable change is the replacement of certain colors with the color gray (5). The transformation doesn't seem to involve any geometric manipulations like rotations or reflections, it focuses on color replacement.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
