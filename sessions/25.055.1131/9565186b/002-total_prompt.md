## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D2BB566C580>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D2BB566DAB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to have a specific pattern of colors, and the output grid seems to be a modified version of this pattern. The most notable change is the replacement of certain colors with the color gray (5). The transformation doesn't seem to involve any geometric manipulations like rotations or reflections, it focuses on color replacement.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: color_replacement
    description: Specific colors in the input grid are replaced with gray (5).

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains initial color arrangement.
  - output_grid: Result of applying color replacement rules to the input grid.
  - color_mapping: original color values of the pixels
    new_color: 5 (grey)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Examine the input grid. Identify pixels that are NOT red (2).
2.  **Replace with Gray:** Change the color of all identified non-red pixels to gray (5).
3.  **Preserve Red Pixels:**  Red (2) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

In essence, the rule is to replace all non-red pixels with gray, while leaving the red pixels untouched.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
