The input grid contains the digits '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The output grid is a modified version of the input grid. The primary change appears to be a shift or rotation of certain elements within the grid. Specifically, the '9's and '0's seem to have swapped positions, but not in a simple, whole-grid rotation. The top left '9' has changed to '0'.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
