## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D2BB566DAB0>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D2BB5582BC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains the digits '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The output grid is a modified version of the input grid. The primary change appears to be a shift or rotation of certain elements within the grid. Specifically, the '9's and '0's seem to have swapped positions, but not in a simple, whole-grid rotation. The top left '9' has changed to '0'.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
    output_values: [0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
  - type: object
    value: 9
    color: maroon
    initial_positions: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] # Indices in the flattened grid
    final_positions:   [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  - type: object
    value: 0
    color: white
    initial_positions: [1, 2]
    final_positions: [0, 3]
  - type: transformation
    description: "Top-left maroon pixel changes to white, and first two white cells change to maroon."
    rule: columnar shift/ specific element swap

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the pixel in the top-left corner (position 0,0) of the input grid.
2.  **Transform:** Change the color of that pixel to white (0).
3. **Identify:** Locate first two white pixels in input.
4. **Transform:** Change the first of these white pixels to maroon, and the second of these white pixels to maroon

In simpler terms: the top-left '9' becomes a '0', and the two zeroes in the first row becomes '9'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
