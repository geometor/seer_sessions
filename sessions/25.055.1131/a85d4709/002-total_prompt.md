## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D2BB57CE770>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D2BB566DAB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid where some cells contain the number '0' (white) and some contain '5' (gray). It appears the gray pixels form a diagonal.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid where all cells are filled with numbers that seem to have a direct color relationship, but they have been filled in the reverse order relative to where they are in the original input. The values are '3' (green), '4' (yellow), and '2' (red).
*  The background of input is filled, background of the output grid is filled, so filling the background is part of the task.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: [0, 5] # Input grid
      - contains_pixels: [3, 4, 2] # Output grid
  - type: pixel
    properties:
        input:
            values: [0, 5]
            colors: [white, gray]
        output:
            values: [3,4,2]
            colors: [green, yellow, red]

actions:
  - name: replace_pixels
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is replaced with a new pixel value in the output grid.
    mapping:
      0: [2,3,4]
      5: [2,3,4]

relationships:
  - type: spatial_inversion
    description:  The placement of colored pixels is rotated relative to the input to output transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Begin with a 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Inverted Replacement**
    *   Observe the diagonal from top right to bottom left of the input.
        If a cell is gray (5) in the input diagonal (from top-right), fill the corresponding cell from the output grid top left to bottom right with values 3, 4, and 2 in that order.
        If a cell is white (0) in the input, fill corresponding cell with values, 3, 4, and 2, in that order from output diagonal top left.
3. **Fill** Complete filling the output grid based on step 2.

In summary, the transformation involves inverting and mapping the input grid's pixel colors (0 and 5) to a new set of colors (2, 3, and 4) in the output grid. The inversion occurs at a diagonal.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
