It appears the gray pixels form a diagonal.\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid where all cells are filled with numbers that seem to have a direct color relationship, but they have been filled in the reverse order relative to where they are in the original input. The values are '3' (green), '4' (yellow), and '2' (red).\n*  The background of input is filled, background of the output grid is filled, so filling the background is part of the task.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
