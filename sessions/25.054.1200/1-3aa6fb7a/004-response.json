An isolated azure pixel is its own group.\n2.  **Output Analysis:** Locate the single blue pixel (value 1) in the output.\n3. **Relation Rule:**\n    The position of the blue pixel in the *output* grid indicates which of the azure pixels in the *input* should be turned blue. There seems to be a direct correlation. It's either one to the left, or it's overwriting.\n4. **Transformation:** For example, if the output blue is at [r,c], and the input has an azure at the same location, then turn that azure blue. If there is no azure, then check the location to the west [r, c-1]. If there is an azure there in the input, change that pixel to blue in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Get the location of the blue pixel in the *output* examples.
