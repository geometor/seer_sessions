"""
1.  **Identify Azure Groups:** In the input grid, locate all azure pixels (value 8). Group them into contiguous horizontal sequences. An isolated azure pixel is its own group.
2.  **Output Analysis:** Locate the single blue pixel (value 1) in the output.
3. **Relation Rule:**
    The position of the blue pixel in the *output* grid indicates which of the azure pixels in the *input* should be turned blue. There seems to be a direct correlation. It's either one to the left, or it's overwriting.
4. **Transformation:** For example, if the output blue is at [r,c], and the input has an azure at the same location, then turn that azure blue. If there is no azure, then check the location to the west [r, c-1]. If there is an azure there in the input, change that pixel to blue in the output.
