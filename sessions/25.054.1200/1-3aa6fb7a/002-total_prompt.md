## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7814F1416080>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, primarily 0, with some 8s. The transformation seems to involve the introduction of 1s. The spatial arrangement of the 8s appears crucial. The 1s appear adjacent to the 8s.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: [0, 8, 1]
  - object: azure_pixels
    description: Pixels with the value 8
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - initial_positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  - object: blue_pixels
    description: Pixels with value 1
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - final_positions: [(1, 2), (4, 4)]
  - action: introduce_blue
    description: Place blue pixels (value 1) adjacent to existing azure pixels.
    details: >
      Blue pixels appear to be placed on the "east" side of isolated azure
      pixels, when they are on the edge.
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: Spatial proximity between azure and blue pixels after the transformation.
    type: one-to-one
    details: >
      Each new blue pixel is horizontally or vertically adjacent to at
      least one existing azure pixel. No blue pixel is created if a azure
      pixel does not exist in that place.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate all azure pixels (value 8) in the input grid.
2.  **Check Adjacency and Insert**: For each azure pixel moving from west to east across the grid, and if the azure pixel does not have a azure neighbor to its right, create a blue pixel on the east edge.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
