Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of identifying "strategic points" (endpoints, corners, and inside bends) within clusters of '8' and replacing them with '1' is partially correct. However, the current implementation is overly aggressive in placing '1's. It's placing them *within* the '8' clusters, effectively breaking the clusters apart, instead of placing them *adjacent* to the clusters in a way that outlines the overall shape.  It's also missing key shapes. The program needs to distinguish between filling and outlining, and it needs to consider the *overall shape* formed by the '8's, not just local neighborhoods.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine "Strategic Point" Definition:** Instead of replacing '8's *within* clusters, we want to place '1's *adjacent* to the clusters, essentially creating an outline.
2.  **Consider Shape:** We want to maintain the overall shape, so think about how the new blue pixels would trace around the azure regions.
3. **Boundary Conditions:** Handle edge and isolated azure regions.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**
I will focus on gathering metrics to quantify the issues and guide the revisions.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes an example and returns metrics."""
    
    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, transformed_output)
    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    size_correct = expected_output.shape == transformed_output.shape
    
    # Flatten the arrays for easier comparison
    expected_flat = expected_output.flatten()
    transformed_flat = transformed_output.flatten()
    
    # Get unique colors and their counts in expected output
    expected_colors, expected_counts = np.unique(expected_flat, return_counts=True)
    expected_color_counts = dict(zip(expected_colors, expected_counts))
    
    # Get unique colors and their counts in transformed output
    transformed_colors, transformed_counts = np.unique(transformed_flat, return_counts=True)
    transformed_color_counts = dict(zip(transformed_colors, transformed_counts))
    
    color_palette_correct = set(expected_colors) == set(transformed_colors)
    
    #compare counts.
    correct_pixel_counts=True
    for color in expected_color_counts.keys():
       if expected_color_counts[color]!=transformed_color_counts.get(color, -1):
            correct_pixel_counts=False

    return {
        "match": match,
        "pixels_off": pixels_off,
        "size_correct": size_correct,
        "color_palette_correct": color_palette_correct,
        "correct_pixel_counts": correct_pixel_counts,
        "expected_color_counts": expected_color_counts,
        "transformed_color_counts": transformed_color_counts,
    }
def get_grid_from_text(grid_text):
    lines = grid_text.strip().split('\n')
    return np.array([[int(val) for val in line.split()] for line in lines])

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_clusters
    type: connected_component
    value: 8
    properties:
      - shape: variable  # Can be L-shape, line, etc.
      - size: variable
    actions:
      - name: outline
        method: place_adjacent
        new_value: 1

  - name: blue_pixels
    type: outline
    value: 1
    properties:
       - adjacent_to: azure_clusters
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Locate all connected regions (clusters) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Orthogonal connectivity defines a cluster.
2. **Outline with Blue:** For each azure cluster, place blue (1) pixels *around* the cluster.  The blue pixels should be placed orthogonally adjacent to azure pixels, effectively forming an outline of the azure shape. The blue pixels *do not* replace azure pixels *within* a continuous region, they only trace the exterior boundary.
3. **Preserve Azure Regions**: Do not modify regions without azure.
4. **One Pixel Outline:** Ensure the outline is one pixel wide where possible.
