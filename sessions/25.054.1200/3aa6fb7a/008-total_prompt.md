## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7814F1437CD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary change seems to involve the introduction of the digit '1' (blue) within the input grid, specifically in proximity to existing '8' (azure) clusters. The overall structure/shape defined by '8's is mostly preserved. '0' (white) acts as a background.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    elements: integers (0-9)
    size: 7x7
  - type: cluster
    element: 8
    color: azure
  - type: background
    element: 0
    color: white
  - type: inserted_element
    element: 1
    color: blue

actions:
  - type: insertion
    description: Insert '1's into the grid.

relationships:
  - type: proximity
    description:  '1's are inserted near '8's.
  - type: adjacency
    description: '1's are often, but not always, directly adjacent to '8's.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Clusters:** Locate all clusters of '8' (azure) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Insert '1':** For some of the '8' pixels, especially at changes of direction of edges. replace with a `1`.
3. The overall shape of the 8's is preserved.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
