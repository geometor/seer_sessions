The grid dimensions remain constant during the transformation.\n2.  **Colors**: A variety of colors are present (Gray, Red, Blue, White in example 1; Green, Azure, Orange, Gray, White in example 2). All colors present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, and vice versa. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed (except potentially White, which acts as a background). The counts of each non-white color remain the same between input and output.\n3.  **Content**: The non-white pixels in the input seem to form distinct small objects or individual pixels.\n4.  **Transformation**: Comparing the input and output grids, the arrangement of the colored pixels is significantly different. In both examples, the output grid appears to be the input grid rotated by 180 degrees around its center.\n    *   Example 1 Input:\n        "
