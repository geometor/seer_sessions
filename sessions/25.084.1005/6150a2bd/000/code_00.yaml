grid_properties:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
    attributes:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors_present: [Gray, Red, Blue, White] in example 1; [Green, Azure, Orange, Gray, White] in example 2.
  - type: output_grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels resulting from transforming the input grid.
    attributes:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors_present: Same as corresponding input grid.
transformation:
  type: geometric
  action: rotation
  details:
    - The entire input grid is rotated.
    - The angle of rotation is 180 degrees.
    - The center of rotation is the center of the grid.
    - All pixels, including the background (White) pixels, participate in the rotation.
relationship:
  - The output grid is a 180-degree rotation of the input grid.
