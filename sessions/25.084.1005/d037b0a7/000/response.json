The color seen higher up in a column dictates the color fill below it.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

If the pixel's color is not white (not 0), update `current_paint_color` to this pixel's color.\n8.  If the pixel's color is white (0) and `current_paint_color` is not white (not 0), change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to `current_paint_color`.\n9.
