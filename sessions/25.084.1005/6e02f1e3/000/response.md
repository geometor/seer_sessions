Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 3x3.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Input grids use green (3), yellow (4), and red (2). White (0) is not present in the inputs shown.
    *   Output grids exclusively use gray (5) and white (0).
3.  **Input Patterns:**
    *   Some inputs are monochromatic (Examples 1, 3).
    *   Some inputs are polychromatic (Examples 2, 4, 5).
4.  **Output Patterns:**
    *   Outputs consist of gray pixels placed on a white background.
    *   In Examples 2, 4, and 5 (polychromatic inputs), the gray pixels in the output precisely map to the locations of a *specific* color from the input.
        *   Example 2: Gray maps to input green (3).
        *   Example 4: Gray maps to input yellow (4).
        *   Example 5: Gray maps to input red (2).
        *   Crucially, in these cases, the color being mapped is the one found in the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid.
    *   In Examples 1 and 3 (monochromatic inputs), the output pattern is different: the top row is gray, and the rest is white. This special pattern occurs when the input is entirely green (3) or entirely yellow (4).

**Hypothesis:** The transformation rule depends on whether the input grid is monochromatic or polychromatic.

*   **Polychromatic Case:** Identify the color at the top-left corner (0,0). Create an output grid where cells corresponding to this color in the input are marked gray (5), and all other cells are white (0).
*   **Monochromatic Case:**
    *   If the single color is green (3) or yellow (4), the output has a gray (5) top row and white (0) elsewhere.
    *   If the single color is something else (e.g., red (2), based on extrapolating the polychromatic rule), the output might mark *all* cells as gray (5), since the top-left color is the only color present.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the color distribution and the top-left color."
grid_properties:
  size: "3x3 for both input and output"
input_colors_observed: [green(3), yellow(4), red(2)]
output_colors_observed: [gray(5), white(0)]
transformation_rules:
  - condition: "Input grid contains multiple distinct colors (polychromatic)"
    steps:
      - "Identify the color C at the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid."
      - "Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0)."
      - "For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:"
      - "  If input[r, c] equals color C, set output[r, c] to gray (5)."
  - condition: "Input grid contains only one distinct color (monochromatic)"
    sub_conditions:
      - color: "green(3)"
        steps:
          - "Create a 3x3 output grid."
          - "Set the top row (row 0) to gray (5)."
          - "Set the remaining rows (rows 1, 2) to white (0)."
      - color: "yellow(4)"
        steps:
          - "Create a 3x3 output grid."
          - "Set the top row (row 0) to gray (5)."
          - "Set the remaining rows (rows 1, 2) to white (0)."
      - color: "any other single color (e.g., red(2))"
        assumption: "Applies the same logic as the polychromatic rule, using the single color as the target."
        steps:
          - "Identify the single color C present in the input grid."
          - "Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0)."
          - "For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:"
          - "  If input[r, c] equals color C, set output[r, c] to gray (5). (Resulting in an all-gray grid)."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input 3x3 grid to identify all unique colors present.
2.  Count the number of unique colors.
3.  **If** the count of unique colors is greater than 1 (the grid is polychromatic):
    a.  Determine the color (`target_color`) located at the top-left cell (row 0, column 0).
    b.  Create a new 3x3 output grid filled entirely with white (0).
    c.  Iterate through each cell (row `r`, column `c`) of the input grid.
    d.  If the color of the input cell `input[r, c]` matches the `target_color`, set the corresponding output cell `output[r, c]` to gray (5).
4.  **Else** (the grid is monochromatic, containing only one unique color):
    a.  Identify the single color (`mono_color`) present in the grid.
    b.  **If** `mono_color` is green (3) or yellow (4):
        i.  Create a new 3x3 output grid.
        ii. Set all cells in the first row (row 0) to gray (5).
        iii. Set all cells in the remaining rows (rows 1 and 2) to white (0).
    c.  **Else** (if `mono_color` is any other color):
        i.  Create a new 3x3 output grid filled entirely with gray (5).
5.  Return the generated output grid.
