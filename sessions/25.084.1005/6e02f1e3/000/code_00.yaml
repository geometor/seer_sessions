task_description: "Transform a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the color distribution and the top-left color."
grid_properties:
  size: "3x3 for both input and output"
input_colors_observed: [green(3), yellow(4), red(2)]
output_colors_observed: [gray(5), white(0)]
transformation_rules:
  - condition: "Input grid contains multiple distinct colors (polychromatic)"
    steps:
      - "Identify the color C at the top-left corner (0,0) of the input grid."
      - "Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0)."
      - "For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:"
      - "  If input[r, c] equals color C, set output[r, c] to gray (5)."
  - condition: "Input grid contains only one distinct color (monochromatic)"
    sub_conditions:
      - color: "green(3)"
        steps:
          - "Create a 3x3 output grid."
          - "Set the top row (row 0) to gray (5)."
          - "Set the remaining rows (rows 1, 2) to white (0)."
      - color: "yellow(4)"
        steps:
          - "Create a 3x3 output grid."
          - "Set the top row (row 0) to gray (5)."
          - "Set the remaining rows (rows 1, 2) to white (0)."
      - color: "any other single color (e.g., red(2))"
        assumption: "Applies the same logic as the polychromatic rule, using the single color as the target."
        steps:
          - "Identify the single color C present in the input grid."
          - "Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0)."
          - "For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:"
          - "  If input[r, c] equals color C, set output[r, c] to gray (5). (Resulting in an all-gray grid)."
