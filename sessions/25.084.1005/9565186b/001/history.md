Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements**

1.  **Grid Size:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples (3x3).
2.  **Colors:** The input grids use a variety of colors (blue, red, green, yellow, azure). The output grids use the color gray (5) and one other color that was present in the input.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing some pixels to gray (5) while keeping others unchanged. It appears selective based on the original color.
4.  **Color Preservation:** In each example, exactly one of the input colors is preserved in the output grid. All pixels of that specific color remain unchanged.
    *   Example 1: Red (2) is preserved.
    *   Example 2: Blue (1) is preserved.
    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) is preserved.
    *   Example 4: Red (2) is preserved.
5.  **Color Replacement:** All pixels whose color is *not* the preserved color are changed to gray (5).
6.  **Identifying the Preserved Color:** Let's examine the frequency of colors in the input grids:
    *   Example 1: red (7), azure (2). Preserved: red (highest count).
    *   Example 2: blue (4), azure (2), red (2), green (1). Preserved: blue (highest count).
    *   Example 3: yellow (3), blue (2), green (2), azure (2). Preserved: yellow (highest count).
    *   Example 4: red (5), azure (3), blue (1). Preserved: red (highest count).
    The color that is preserved in the output is consistently the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: conditional_color_replacement
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
components:
  - pixels: Cells with color values 1 through 8 observed in inputs.
  - stable_color: The single color from the input grid that appears most frequently.
  - replacement_color: gray (5), used for non-stable pixels.
relationships:
  - frequency_rule: The color with the highest count in the input grid becomes the 'stable_color'.
actions:
  - count_pixel_colors: Determine the frequency of each color in the input grid.
  - identify_stable_color: Select the color with the maximum frequency count.
  - generate_output_grid: Create a new grid where:
      - Pixels matching the 'stable_color' retain their color.
      - All other pixels are changed to the 'replacement_color' (gray, 5).
assumptions:
  - unique_maximum_frequency: It is assumed that there will always be a single color with the highest frequency. The behavior for ties is not defined by the examples.
  - no_background_involvement: Color 0 (white) is not present and does not participate in the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Analyze the input grid to count the occurrences of each color present.
2.  Identify the color that has the highest frequency (count). This is the "stable color".
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    a.  If the color of the current input pixel is the same as the stable color, copy this color to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
    b.  Otherwise (if the color is not the stable color), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
