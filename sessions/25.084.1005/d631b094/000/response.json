The output grid contains only pixels of that single non-white color found in the input.\n4.  **Relationship:** The width of the output grid (N) corresponds directly to the *count* of non-white pixels in the input grid. The color filling the output grid is the same non-white color present in the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
