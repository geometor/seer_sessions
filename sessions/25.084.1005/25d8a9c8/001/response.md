Transforms an input grid based on the number of distinct colors in each row.
If a row in the input grid contains only one distinct color, the corresponding 
row in the output grid is filled entirely with gray (5). 
If a row contains more than one distinct color, the corresponding output row is 
filled entirely with white (0).
