**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid. The input grids contain various colors, while the output grids consist solely of white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis. Each row in the input grid corresponds to a row in the output grid, and the content of the output row depends on the colors present in the input row. Specifically, if an input row contains pixels of only one distinct color, the corresponding output row becomes entirely gray (5). If an input row contains pixels of two or more distinct colors, the corresponding output row becomes entirely white (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_size:
  input: 3x3
  output: 3x3
input_colors_present: [red, maroon, yellow, orange, green, magenta, blue] # Based on examples
output_colors_present: [white, gray]
transformation_scope: row-wise
rules:
  - condition: Input row contains only one distinct color.
    action: Fill the corresponding output row entirely with gray (5).
  - condition: Input row contains more than one distinct color.
    action: Fill the corresponding output row entirely with white (0).
objects:
  - type: grid_row
    properties:
      - colors: list of pixel colors in the row
      - distinct_color_count: count of unique colors in the row
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_grid_row
    to: output_grid_row
    based_on: distinct_color_count in input_grid_row
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  For each row in the input grid:
    a.  Identify all the distinct colors present in that row.
    b.  Count the number of distinct colors identified.
    c.  If the count of distinct colors is exactly 1, fill the corresponding row in the output grid entirely with gray (color 5).
    d.  If the count of distinct colors is greater than 1, fill the corresponding row in the output grid entirely with white (color 0).
3.  Return the completed output grid.
