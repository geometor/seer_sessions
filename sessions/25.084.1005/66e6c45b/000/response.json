            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size**: Both input and output grids are 4x4 in the examples.\n2.  **Background Color**: The background color is white (0) in both input and output.\n3.  **Input Objects**: The input grids contain four distinct non-white pixels arranged in a 2x2 square. In `train_1`, these are gray (5), magenta (6), azure (8), and green (3). In `train_2`, they are green (3), yellow (4), orange (7), and magenta (6). This 2x2 block appears centered within the 4x4 grid.\n4.  **Output Objects**: The output grids contain the same four non-white pixels as the corresponding input, but their positions have changed.\n5.  **Transformation**: The four non-white pixels from the input's 2x2 block are moved to the four corners of the output grid.\n    *   The pixel at the top-left of the input block moves to the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output.\n    *   The pixel at the top-right of the input block moves to the top-right corner (0, 3) of the output.\n    *   The pixel at the bottom-left of the input block moves to the bottom-left corner (3, 0) of the output.\n    *   The pixel at the bottom-right of the input block moves to the bottom-right corner (3, 3) of the output.\n6.  **General Rule**: It seems the task involves identifying a 2x2 block of colored pixels and mapping these pixels to the corners of the output grid while preserving their relative orientation (top-left to top-left, top-right to top-right, etc.). The rest of the output grid is filled with the background color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
