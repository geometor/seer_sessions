Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** All examples involve a square grid, specifically 3x3.
2.  **Color Palette:** Various colors (maroon, gray, azure, red, green, blue, yellow) are used across the examples.
3.  **Transformation Nature:** Comparing each input grid to its corresponding output grid reveals a consistent spatial rearrangement of the pixels. The value at position (row, column) in the input appears at position (column, row) in the output.
4.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true for all four examples. The transformation doesn't depend on the specific colors present but only on their positions.
5.  **Operation:** This specific rearrangement corresponds to a matrix transposition, which is equivalent to reflecting the grid across its main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - shape: square (3x3 in examples)
  - element_type: color_pixels (integers 0-9)
transformation:
  - type: geometric
  - operation: transposition (reflection across the main diagonal)
  - mapping: input_pixel(row, col) -> output_pixel(col, row)
  - preservation:
      - grid_dimensions (if square)
      - pixel_values (colors)
      - pixel_count
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H` and width `W`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions swapped: height `W` and width `H`.
3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` of the input grid.
4.  Get the color value `V` from the input grid at position (`r`, `c`).
5.  Place the color value `V` into the output grid at position (`c`, `r`).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
