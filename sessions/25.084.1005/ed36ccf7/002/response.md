**General Assessment**

The previous attempt incorrectly identified the transformation as a 270-degree clockwise rotation in the documentation but implemented a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The generated code failed on all training examples, producing outputs that consistently differed from the expected ones. Analysis revealed that the required transformation is actually a 270-degree clockwise rotation (or 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation). The strategy is to correct the transformation logic in the code to match this finding.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  - description: "The task requires rotating the input grid by a fixed angle."
    grid_properties:
      - shape: "All training examples use 3x3 input and output grids."
      - content: "Grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to specific colors."
      - objects: "The grid itself is the primary object undergoing a transformation."

transformation:
  - type: "Geometric Rotation"
  - details: "The entire input grid is rotated 270 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to 90 degrees counter-clockwise)."
  - pixel_mapping:
      rationale: "Comparing input pixels Input[r][c] with expected output pixels Output[r'][c'] across all examples reveals a consistent pattern corresponding to a 270-degree clockwise rotation."
      input_pixel_coords: "(r, c)" # row r, column c
      output_pixel_coords: "(W-1-c, r)" # where W is the width of the input grid
  - output_grid_dimensions:
      height: "Width of the input grid (W)"
      width: "Height of the input grid (H)"
      note: "For the given square grids (W=H=3), the output dimensions remain 3x3."

validation_failure_analysis:
  - previous_code_issue: "The previous code implemented a 90-degree clockwise rotation (mapping Input[r][c] to Output[c][H-1-r]) instead of the required 270-degree clockwise rotation."
  - result: "This incorrect rotation caused mismatches in pixel positions, leading to failure on all training examples, as confirmed by the metrics (Pixels Off > 0)."

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid, which is a 2D array of pixel values.
2.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with `W` rows and `H` columns.
4.  For each row `r` from 0 to `H-1` and each column `c` from 0 to `W-1` in the input grid:
    a.  Get the pixel value `value = input_grid[r][c]`.
    b.  Calculate the corresponding coordinates `(output_r, output_c)` in the output grid using the 270-degree clockwise rotation formula: `output_r = W - 1 - c` and `output_c = r`.
    c.  Place the pixel value at the calculated position in the output grid: `output_grid[output_r][output_c] = value`.
5.  Return the fully constructed output grid.
