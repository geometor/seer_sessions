task_context:
  - description: "The task requires rotating the input grid by a fixed angle."
    grid_properties:
      - shape: "All training examples use 3x3 input and output grids."
      - content: "Grids contain pixels represented by integers 0-9, corresponding to specific colors."
      - objects: "The grid itself is the primary object undergoing a transformation."

transformation:
  - type: "Geometric Rotation"
  - details: "The entire input grid is rotated 270 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to 90 degrees counter-clockwise)."
  - pixel_mapping:
      rationale: "Comparing input pixels Input[r][c] with expected output pixels Output[r'][c'] across all examples reveals a consistent pattern corresponding to a 270-degree clockwise rotation."
      input_pixel_coords: "(r, c)" # row r, column c
      output_pixel_coords: "(W-1-c, r)" # where W is the width of the input grid
  - output_grid_dimensions:
      height: "Width of the input grid (W)"
      width: "Height of the input grid (H)"
      note: "For the given square grids (W=H=3), the output dimensions remain 3x3."

validation_failure_analysis:
  - previous_code_issue: "The previous code implemented a 90-degree clockwise rotation (mapping Input[r][c] to Output[c][H-1-r]) instead of the required 270-degree clockwise rotation."
  - result: "This incorrect rotation caused mismatches in pixel positions, leading to failure on all training examples, as confirmed by the metrics (Pixels Off > 0)."
