This indicates a rearrangement or permutation task.\n*   Comparing the positions in Example 1:\n    *   Input: `[9, 0, 1, 6, 8]`\n    *   Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n    *   The first two elements (9 and 0) swap positions.\n    *   The middle element (1) stays in the same position.\n    *   The last two elements (6 and 8) swap positions.\n*   Comparing the positions in Example 2:\n    *   Input: `[4, 3, 6, 2, 8]`\n    *   Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n    *   The first two elements (4 and 3) swap positions.\n    *   The middle element (6) stays in the same position.\n    *   The last two elements (2 and 8) swap positions.\n*   The pattern observed is consistent across both examples: swap the elements at indices 0 and 1, leave the element at index 2 unchanged, and swap the elements at indices 3 and 4.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
