task_type: rearrangement
input_description: A vertical list of 5 colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9).
output_description: A vertical list of 5 colored pixels, which is a rearrangement of the input list.
elements:
  - type: list
    description: The input is treated as a list of 5 elements.
    properties:
      length: 5
  - type: pixel
    description: Each element in the list is a single colored pixel.
actions:
  - type: swap
    description: Pairs of elements are swapped based on their position (index) in the list.
    details:
      - Swap the element at index 0 with the element at index 1.
      - Swap the element at index 3 with the element at index 4.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: The transformation rule depends on the index of each element within the input list.
    details:
      - Index 0 <-> Index 1
      - Index 2 remains unchanged.
      - Index 3 <-> Index 4
invariants:
  - The number of elements remains constant (5).
  - The set of elements (colors/digits) remains the same; only their order changes.
  - The element at index 2 always stays in its position.
