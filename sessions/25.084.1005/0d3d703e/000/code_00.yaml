    details: |
      A static, bidirectional mapping exists between pairs of colors:
      - 1 (Blue) <-> 5 (Gray)
      - 2 (Red) <-> 6 (Magenta)
      - 3 (Green) <-> 4 (Yellow)
      - 8 (Azure) <-> 9 (Maroon)
      Colors 0 (White) and 7 (Orange) are assumed to map to themselves as they were not observed in the examples.
