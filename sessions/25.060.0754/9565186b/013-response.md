Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two colors: red (2) and azure (8). The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5). The azure pixels in the input are replaced by gray pixels in the output, while the red pixels remain unchanged. The transformation seems to be a simple color replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          input: [red, azure]
          output: [red, gray]

actions:
  - type: color_replacement
    details:
      - from: azure
        to: gray

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details: The relative positions of the pixels remain constant.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** each identified azure pixel with a gray (5) pixel.
3.  **Keep** all other pixels (red - 2) unchanged.
4. The grid structure should remain the same (3x3)
