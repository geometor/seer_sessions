      transformation: |
          Pixels in the top row remain unchanged.  All other
          pixels that are not blue are changed to gray.

            shape: fills_remaining_space
      transformation: |
          Pixels that are part of the blue rectangle
          remain unchanged.  Pixels that are not
          part of the blue rectangle are
          changed to gray.

          position: spans_multiple_rows, top_left
        - color: gray
          shape: fills_remaining_space

      transformation: |
          Pixels that are part of the blue
          connected component remain unchanged. Pixels not part of this component are changed to gray.
