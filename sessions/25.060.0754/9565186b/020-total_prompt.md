**input:**
```
3 3 8
4 4 4
8 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C75CDD0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
4 4 4
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540FBF50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3 in this example). The most prominent change is the color of certain pixels, while some colors are preserved. There appears to be some kind of selective replacement of colors. It looks like any color which is not yellow changes to gray, and yellow is preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3)."
  - objects:
      - type: "Grid"
        properties:
          - dimensions: "3x3"
          - cells: "pixels with color values (0-9)"
      - type: "Pixel"
        properties:
          - color: "integer value (0-9), representing a color"
  - actions:
    - name: "color_change"
      description: "Certain pixel colors are replaced based on a rule."
  - relationships:
      - type: color_preservation
        from: 4 #yellow
        to: 4 #yellow
      - type: color_replacement
        from: [1,3,8] # blue, green, azure
        to: 5 #grey
  - transformation_rule: "if the input pixel is not yellow, output gray, else yellow."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color value of the current pixel.
3. **If** value is 4 (yellow): output a pixel with a color of 4 (yellow).
4. **Else** output pixel with a color of 5 (gray).
5.  **Maintain** the original grid structure and dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
