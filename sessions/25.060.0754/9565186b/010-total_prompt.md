**input:**
```
1 1 1
8 1 3
8 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174D298D50>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
5 1 5
5 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input grid contains a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors, predominantly using blue and gray. The top row of the input and output grids remain identical (all blue). The transformation appears to focus on the lower two rows.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are 3x3."
  - object: "Pixels"
    properties:
      color: "Represented by digits 0-9"
  - observation: "Top row remains unchanged (all blue/1)."
  - observation: "Colors in the lower two rows are transformed."
  - specific_change: "Azure (8) and green (3) in the input become gray (5) in the output."
  - specific_change: "Red (2) in the input becomes gray (5) in the output."
  - relationship: "The transformation seems to consolidate colors to blue (1) and gray (5)."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve the Top Row:** Copy the top row of the input grid directly to the output grid.
2.  **Transform other colors to Gray:** For the remaining rows (middle and bottom), change any pixel that is not blue (1) to gray (5).

In essence, the program simplifies the lower part of the grid by replacing any color that is not the blue from the first row with the gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
