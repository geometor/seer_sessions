The transformation seems to selectively change some of these cells to the color gray (5), while leaving others unchanged. The selection criteria for changing to gray is not immediately obvious but seems related to the colors present and possibly their positions. It appears non-gray colors that get replaced can be either at corners, edge centers, or in the middle of the grids. It also appears that different non-gray values are replaced by gray.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
