The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3 in this example). The most prominent change is the color of certain pixels, while some colors are preserved. There appears to be some kind of selective replacement of colors. It looks like any color which is not yellow changes to gray, and yellow is preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
