**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540FBAD0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540FBA50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors change from input to output. The most notable change is the replacement of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels with gray (5) pixels, while red (2) pixels remain unchanged. It seems like a color substitution based on location.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: |
      Input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Output grid contains red (2) and gray (5) pixels.
  - observation: |
       The central pixel in the input (blue) has become the central pixel of a new color (gray), and its two adjacent pixels on it's right that where of an other color (azure) have been replaced by the color of the center (gray).
  - action: |
      Blue (1) and azure(8) pixels are replaced with gray (5).
  - action: |
      Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.
  - relationship: |
      Colors in specific locations are transformed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify target colors:** Locate all pixels that are blue (1) or azure (8).
2.  **Replace colors:** Change the color of all identified pixels to gray (5).
3.  **Preserve other colors:** All other pixels, specifically red (2) in this example, should retain their original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
