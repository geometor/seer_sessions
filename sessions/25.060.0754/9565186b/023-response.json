            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very simple observation: turn non-yellow pixels to gray. This worked for the first training example but failed on subsequent examples. This indicates that the initial observation was incomplete and did not capture the full complexity of the transformation rule. The core issue is that the transformation rule is not simply about changing non-yellow pixels to gray. There's a more specific condition related to yellow and adjacent colors. We need to revise the approach from basic color replacement to a more contextual, rule-based one, likely examining the neighboring pixels of each yellow pixel.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Neighboring Pixels:** The key to solving this problem is to analyze the relationship of yellow pixels and those pixels that are immediately next to it, which could be to the North, South, East or West of the yellow pixels.\n2.  **Identify the Conditional Rule:** Determine the specific rule connecting a yellow pixel to a neighboring pixel.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to precisely describe this rule.\n4. **Develop a new transform function** to implement the revised natural language program.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo understand the patterns, let's manually inspect each input-output pair and the results of the existing code. I will focus on the differences (errors) between the current code's output and the expected output to deduce the actual transformation rule. I will start with the example input-output, then compare the correct output with the result from running the code.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A grid with a mix of colors.\n*   **Expected Output:** Yellow pixels remain yellow, some other pixels are gray, and some remain original colors.\n*   **Code Output:** All non-yellow pixels are turned to gray.\n* **Differences reported by VerifyResult:**\n```\ninput_grid:\n[[1 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\noutput_grid:\n[[1 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\ncurrent_output:\n[[5 5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 5 4 4 4 5]\n [5 5 4 4 4 5]\n [5 5 4 4 4 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5 5]]\nDifferences:\nRow 0: Columns 0-5 differ.\nRow 1: Columns 0-5 differ.\nRow 2: Columns 0, 1, 5 differ.\nRow 3: Columns 0, 1, 5 differ.\nRow 4: Columns 0, 1, 5 differ.\nRow 5: Columns 0-5 differ.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Different color arrangement.\n*   **Expected Output:** Similar pattern to Example 1: Yellow, Gray, and original colors.\n*   **Code Output:** All non-yellow pixels are turned to gray.\n* **Differences reported by VerifyResult:**\n```\ninput_grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 4 4 4 0]\n [0 4 4 2 4 0]\n [0 4 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\noutput_grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 4 4 4 0]\n [0 4 4 2 4 0]\n [0 4 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\ncurrent_output:\n[[5 5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 4 4 4 4 5]\n [5 4 4 5 4 5]\n [5 4 4 4 4 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5 5]]\nDifferences:\nRow 0: Columns 0-5 differ.\nRow 1: Columns 0, 5 differ.\nRow 2: Columns 0, 3, 5 differ.\nRow 3: Columns 0, 5 differ.\nRow 4: Columns 0-5 differ.\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Different color arrangement.\n*   **Expected Output:** Similar pattern.\n*   **Code Output:** All non-yellow pixels are turned to gray.\n\n* **Differences reported by VerifyResult:**\n```\ninput_grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 4 1 4 0]\n [0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\noutput_grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 4 1 4 0]\n [0 4 4 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\ncurrent_output:\n[[5 5 5 5 5]\n [5 4 4 4 5]\n [5 4 5 4 5]\n [5 4 4 4 5]\n [5 5 5 5 5]]\nDifferences:\nRow 0: Columns 0-4 differ.\nRow 1: Columns 0, 4 differ.\nRow 2: Columns 0, 2, 4 differ.\nRow 3: Columns 0, 4 differ.\nRow 4: Columns 0-4 differ.\n\n```\n\n**Observations and Pattern Recognition:**\n\nAfter carefully reviewing these examples a clear pattern emerges that only includes the colors of the non-yellow pixels immediately adjacent to the yellow pixels:\n\n-   If a non-yellow pixel is immediately adjacent to a yellow pixel, change the pixel to gray.\n-   If a non-yellow pixel is NOT immediately adjacent to a yellow pixel, return the pixel to its original value.\n-   Yellow pixels remain yellow.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        - yellow\n        - gray\n        - other # Represents any color other than yellow and gray\n      position:\n        - row\n        - column\n      adjacency:\n        - adjacent_to_yellow: boolean # True if adjacent to a yellow pixel, False otherwise\n\nactions:\n  - name: change_to_gray\n    condition: pixel.color != yellow AND pixel.adjacency.adjacent_to_yellow == True\n    result: pixel.color = gray\n  - name: keep_original_color\n    condition: pixel.color != yellow AND pixel.adjacency.adjacent_to_yellow == False\n    result: no change\n  - name: keep_yellow\n    condition: pixel.color == yellow\n    result: no change\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  If the pixel is yellow (color 4), keep it unchanged.\n3.  If the pixel is not yellow, check if it is adjacent to any yellow pixel (horizontally or vertically).\n4.  If the non-yellow pixel IS adjacent to a yellow pixel, change it to gray (color 5).\n5.  If the non-yellow pixel is NOT adjacent to a yellow pixel, keep original color.\n6.  Return the modified grid.\n"
