Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 23x23 grids.
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are yellow (4), blue (1), and white (0).
*   **Shapes:** There are scattered yellow (4) pixels and a concentrated block of blue (1) and yellow(4) pixels in the input. The output seems to replicate this, and create a new object in a differnt part of the scene.
*    **Spatial Relationships:** The yellow pixels are scattered seemingly randomly. The blue/yellow block is a 3x4 rectangle of blue with a single yellow pixel in the center.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: single pixels
    arrangement: scattered
    count: variable
  - id: blue_block
    color: blue (1)
    shape: rectangle
    dimensions: 3x4 (mostly)
    internal_features:
      - id: central_yellow
        color: yellow (4)
        shape: single pixel
        location: center of blue_block
  - id: white_background
    color: white(0)
    shape: grid
    role: background

actions:
  - type: replication
    description: The yellow pixels and the blue/yellow block are mostly replicated from input to output.
  - type: creation
    description: a blue/yellow block is added to the output.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Yellow pixels maintain their relative positions.
  - type: containment
    description: The central yellow pixel is contained within the blue block.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Replicate all the yellow pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.

2.  **Copy:** Copy any blue pixels to the same location in the output grid.

3.  **Locate Center:**
    *   Scan the lower half of the grid to find the largest horizontal distance between yellow pixels.
4.  **Create new Object**
    *   Starting directly below the horizontal center of the two farthest apart yellow pixels, create a 3x4 block of blue (1) pixels.
    * Place a yellow pixel in the location, 2 down and two to the right.

In summary the task requires almost complete replication of the input data, with
one specific element added based on a rule applied to the location of existing
data.
