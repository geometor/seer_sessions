The output seems to replicate this, and create a new object in a differnt part of the scene.\n*    **Spatial Relationships:** The yellow pixels are scattered seemingly randomly. The blue/yellow block is a 3x4 rectangle of blue with a single yellow pixel in the center.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
