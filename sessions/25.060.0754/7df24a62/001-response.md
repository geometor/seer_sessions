Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of two colors: blue (1) and yellow (4). The background is white (0). There appear to be two main types of objects:

1.  **Yellow (4) Isolated Pixels:** These are scattered throughout the grid, seemingly randomly.
2.  **Blue (1) Rectangular Objects:** These are contiguous blocks of blue pixels forming rectangles of varying sizes. Some of these rectangles contain yellow pixels.

The transformation seems to involve some interaction between the blue rectangles and the yellow pixels. It is clear by observing the examples that where there were yellow objects inside of a blue rectangle, after the transformation it is now the blue rectangle filled with yellow, and surrounded by the same size of blue frame as was the width of the original rectangle.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: yellow_pixel
    color: 4
    shape: single pixel
    behavior: static, potentially interacts with blue rectangles

  - type: blue_rectangle
    color: 1
    shape: rectangle
    behavior: may contain yellow pixels, potential transformation based on inner content

  - type: background
    color: 0
    shape: 2d plane

relationships:
  - blue_rectangles: may_contain: yellow_pixels
  - background: surrounds, all_other_objects

actions:
  - transform: blue_rectangle:
      condition: contains yellow_pixels
      result: fill internal with yellow, create surrounding rectangle with a line the same width as the side of the previous rectangle

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) rectangular objects in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all yellow (4) pixels inside of each identified blue rectangle.
3.  **For each** blue rectangle:
    *   **Check:** if the blue rectangle contains any yellow pixels.
    *   **If Yes**: find the width of the side of the blue rectangle.
        *   Find the coordinates of the corners of the blue object.
        *   From the corners, fill the center of the blue object with yellow.
        *   Around the now yellow object, create a blue frame with line widths equal to the recorded side widths of the original blue object.
    *   **If No**: Maintain the blue object's position and size as in the original.
4.  **Yellow pixels** existing in the input grid *outside* of any detected blue rectangle remain unchanged in output.

This program describes a conditional transformation where blue rectangles containing yellow pixels undergo a specific change, while other elements (isolated yellow pixels and empty blue rectangles) are preserved. The key trigger is the *presence* of yellow pixels *within* a blue rectangle.
