Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves a color change based on a fixed mapping. The input consists of nested squares of different colors. The output has the same structure, but the colors of the squares are changed according to this mapping:

*   Yellow (4) becomes Azure (8)
*   Red (2) becomes Grey (5)
*   Blue (1) becomes Green (3)
*   Green (3) becomes Blue (1)

The spatial arrangement of the squares is preserved. The transformation can be considered as applying the color map to each pixel in the input grid. The examples are consistent - each case uses a subset of the same colors.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # color mapping dictionary
    color_map = {
        4: 8,
        2: 5,
        1: 3,
        3: 1,
    }

    # change output pixels based on the color map
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            input_color = input_grid[i, j]
            output_grid[i, j] = color_map.get(input_color, input_color) # Use .get() to handle potential missing keys (colors not in the map)

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
