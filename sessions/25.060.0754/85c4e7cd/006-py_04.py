"""
The transformation involves a color change based on a fixed mapping. The input consists of nested squares of different colors. The output has the same structure, but the colors of the squares are changed according to this mapping:

*   Yellow (4) becomes Azure (8)
*   Red (2) becomes Grey (5)
*   Blue (1) becomes Green (3)
*   Green (3) becomes Blue (1)

The spatial arrangement of the squares is preserved. The transformation can be considered as applying the color map to each pixel in the input grid. The examples are consistent - each case uses a subset of the same colors.
