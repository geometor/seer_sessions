Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids are the same size (8x8). There's a clear symmetrical pattern in both the input and output. The colors in the input seem to map to different colors in the output.  The outer border color changes, and the inner colors seem to be inverted based on their position relative to the center. The central 2x2 block's color in the input becomes the border color of the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 8x8
      elements: pixels
      properties:
        color: integer (0-9)

  - pixel:
      properties:
          color: integer
          position: (row, column)

relations:
  - spatial:
      type: symmetry
      description: Both input and output grids exhibit symmetry around the center.
  - color_mapping:
    - input: 8 (azure)
      output: 4 (yellow)
    - input: 1 (blue)
      output: 2 (red)
    - input: 2 (red)
      output: 1 (blue)
    - input: 4 (yellow)
      output: 8 (azure)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central 2x2 block** in the input grid. The color of these pixels will become the new border color in the output grid.

2.  **Create an output grid** of the same dimensions as the input grid.

3.  **Set border pixels**: For all pixels in the output grid that correspond to the outermost border (first row, last row, first column, last column), set their color to the color found in the central 2x2 block of the *input* grid.

4.  **Invert Colors:** Invert the colors of the inner pixels. For all non-border pixels:
    *   If the input pixel color is 8, change it to 4 in the output.
    *   If the input pixel color is 1, change it to 2 in the output.
    *   If the input pixel color is 2, change it to 1 in the output.
    *    If the input pixel color is 4, change it to 8 in the output.

5.  The resulting grid is the output. The transformation essentially swaps the colors of diagonally opposite "layers" around the center and switches the outer most layer color with the inner most layer color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
