Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation inverts the color layers of the nested squares. The outermost color in the input becomes the outermost color in the output, and so on. The color mapping is as follows:

- Yellow (4) -> Azure (8)
- Red (2) -> Grey (5)
- Blue (1) -> Green (3)
- Green (3) -> Blue (1)
- Grey (5) -> Red (2)
- Azure (8) -> Yellow (4)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training set results, and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a simple color mapping, which correctly transforms the first training example. However, the core concept of "nested squares" and inverting color "layers" is not explicitly implemented in the code, resulting in the strategy being incomplete. The code simply replaces colors irrespective of their spatial context or arrangement. The provided results have validated that the code works for more than the first example, but we still must be mindful of possible spatial issues.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Focus on *why* the code either successfully transformed each example or failed.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update YAML facts to include color and spatial properties of all objects and their relationships and behaviors.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:**
    *   Make the program capture the nesting (if necessary) and inverting of layers.
    *   Ensure the program clearly specifies the general process and which inputs it works on.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand what's happening, let's manually inspect the result from the `transform` function.

```python
def get_task_examples_and_predictions(task_data, transform_func):
    """
    Applies the transformation function to each input grid in the training set of a task and zips it together with input, output, predicted output

    Args:
        task_data (dict): The task data loaded from the JSON file.
        transform_func (function): The transformation function to apply.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the 'input', 'output', and 'predicted' grids.
    """
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_grid = transform_func(input_grid)
        results.append({
            'input': input_grid,
            'output': output_grid,
            'predicted': predicted_grid
        })
    return results

# import the json
import json
with open('data/training/d515c40f.json', 'r') as f:
    task_data = json.load(f)
results = get_task_examples_and_predictions(task_data, transform)

for i,result in enumerate(results):
  print(f"Example {i+1}:")
  print(f"Input:\n{result['input']}")
  print(f"Expected Output:\n{result['output']}")
  print(f"Predicted Output:\n{result['predicted']}")
  print(f"Matches Expected: {np.array_equal(result['output'], result['predicted'])}\n")
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation involves a color change based on a fixed mapping. The input consists of nested squares of different colors. The output has the same structure, but the colors of the squares are changed according to this mapping:

*   Yellow (4) becomes Azure (8)
*   Red (2) becomes Grey (5)
*   Blue (1) becomes Green (3)
*   Green (3) becomes Blue (1)

The spatial arrangement of the squares is preserved. The transformation can be considered as applying the color map to each pixel in the input grid. The examples are consistent - each case uses a subset of the same colors.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
