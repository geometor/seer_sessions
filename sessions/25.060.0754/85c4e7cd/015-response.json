The input and output grids are the same size (8x8). There's a clear symmetrical pattern in both the input and output. The colors in the input seem to map to different colors in the output.  The outer border color changes, and the inner colors seem to be inverted based on their position relative to the center. The central 2x2 block's color in the input becomes the border color of the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The color of these pixels will become the new border color in the output grid.\n\n2.  **Create an output grid** of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\n3.  **Set border pixels**: For all pixels in the output grid that correspond to the outermost border (first row, last row, first column, last column), set their color to the color found in the central 2x2 block of the *input* grid.\n\n4.  **Invert Colors:** Invert the colors of the inner pixels. For all non-border pixels:\n    *   If the input pixel color is 8, change it to 4 in the output.\n    *   If the input pixel color is 1, change it to 2 in the output.\n    *   If the input pixel color is 2, change it to 1 in the output.\n    *    If the input pixel color is 4, change it to 8 in the output.\n\n5.  The resulting grid is the output. The transformation essentially swaps the colors of diagonally opposite \"layers\" around the center and switches the outer most layer color with the inner most layer color.\n"
