The colors, from outside in, are yellow (4), red (2), blue (1), green (3), grey (5), and azure (8).\n*   The output grid seems to mirror the structure, but the colors change. The new colors are azure (8), grey (5), green(3), blue (1), red(2) and yellow(4)\n*   The transformation appears to be a one-to-one color mapping, an inversion or reflection of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Return the new, color mapped grid\n\nEssentially, the transformation inverts the color layers of the nested squares. The outermost color in the input becomes the outermost color in the output, etc, with the relationship being a shift by +4 steps around the circle [1,2,3,4,5,8].\n"
