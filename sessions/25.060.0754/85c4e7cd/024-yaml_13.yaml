observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows, cols)
      - layers: concentric, starting from 0 at the outermost edge
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors
    actions:
      - transform: changes cell colors based on layer and original color
  - object: layer
    properties:
      - index: integer, starting from 0
      - color_mapping_rules: specific to each layer and input color
    actions:
      - determine_color: maps input color to output color based on rules
