**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The output grids consistently appear to be 3x3. There's a strong emphasis on the central 3x3 area of the larger input grid. It appears that a single color and its surrounding pixels are extracted. White (0) seems to act as a background or null value. The dominant color within the input (excluding white) appears to be the basis for the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are of variable size.
  - observation: Output grids are consistently 3x3.
  - observation: Pixels are represented by integer values 0-9, corresponding to colors.
  - observation: White (0) appears to function as a background/filler.
  - observation: A non-white color and its surrounding pixels are preserved.
  - observation: The output grid often contains white (0) and one other color.
  - observation: The 3x3 output is centered on a color of interest.
  - observation: The output seems to take the bottom most non zero color object when there are multiple of them.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:** Scan the input grid to find the bottom-most, non-zero color.
2.  **Extract Central Region:** If this color is present, center a 3x3 window around instances of the last most occurrence of that color, taking boundary into account.
3. **Form output grid** Return the 3x3 sub-grid derived in the last step, using the 3x3 subgrid content as the output.

Essentially, the transformation identifies the most prominent non-white color and its immediate neighbors, forming a 3x3 output grid centered on instances of this color. The bottom most non-zero object is used.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
