**input:**
```

2 0 0 3 0 0 0 7 0 1 0 0

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x192 at 0x7A17540FBF50>

**output:**
```

7 0 7
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 3x12 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid.
*   The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified, patterned extraction.
*   The color orange (7) appears to be a key element in the transformation.
*   The output pattern is symmetric, an "X" shape made by 7

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x12
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - id: orange_pixels
    type: object
    color: orange (7)
    locations: variable within input_grid

actions:
  - type: extract
    agent: system
    target: orange_pixels and some white pixels
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
  - type: arrange
    agent: system
    target: extracted_pixels
    pattern: symmetric 'X' shape with orange and white between

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid appears to be a centered extraction based on the locations of the orange pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color orange (value 7) within the input grid.
2.  **Locate** the minimum and maximum row and column of the orange pixels.
3.  **Create** an empty 3x3 output grid.
4. **Fill** the corner and center pixels of output grid with orange (7) and the others with white (0).

Essentially, the transformation identifies the color orange in the input then creates a new, smaller grid forming an 'X' shaped pattern centered by orange color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
