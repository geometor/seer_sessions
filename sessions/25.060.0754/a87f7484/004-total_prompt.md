<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7A174C6BB650>

**output:**

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger and contains multiple colored regions, while the output grid is smaller and focuses on a specific color (azure, represented by the number 8). The output appears to be a sub-grid extracted from the input. The center of both grids seems important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 9x3
      center_pixel: 0 (white)
      regions:
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          location: top rows
        - color: 4 (yellow)
          location: middle rows
        - color: 8 (azure)
          location: bottom rows
        - color: 0 (white)
          location: scattered, including center

  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      center_pixel: 0 (white)
      regions:
        - color: 8 (azure)
          location: all cells except center

  - transformation:
      type: extraction
      focus: region of color 8 (azure)
      size: 3x3 grid around input center of azure region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Find the largest contiguous region of pixels in the input grid with the color "azure" (value 8).
2.  **Locate Center:** The program should extract a region that matches the last occurance of azure.
3.  **Extract Sub-Grid:** Extract a 3x3 sub-grid centered at the center point determined from the input.
4. Return the extracted sub-grid.

In summary, the program identifies the last azure region in the input grid, locates its center, and extracts a 3x3 region around that center.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
