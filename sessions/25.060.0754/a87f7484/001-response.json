Here's my breakdown of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The output grids consistently appear to be 3x3. There's a strong emphasis on the central 3x3 area of the larger input grid. It appears that a single color and its surrounding pixels are extracted. White (0) seems to act as a background or null value. The dominant color within the input (excluding white) appears to be the basis for the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Color:** Scan the input grid to find the bottom-most, non-zero color.\n2.  **Extract Central Region:** If this color is present, center a 3x3 window around instances of the last most occurrence of that color, taking boundary into account.\n3. **Form output grid** Return the 3x3 sub-grid derived in the last step, using the 3x3 subgrid content as the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation identifies the most prominent non-white color and its immediate neighbors, forming a 3x3 output grid centered on instances of this color. The bottom most non-zero object is used.\n"
