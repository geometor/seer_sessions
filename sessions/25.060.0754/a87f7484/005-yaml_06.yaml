overall_observations:
  - The initial assumption about the 3x3 azure region is incorrect.
  - Example 2 suggests a pattern repetition and color inversion.
  - Example 3 shows an even more complex transformation with size reduction and shape simplification
  - the code needs to handle None return from the find_last_region_center function
