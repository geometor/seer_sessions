Previous Code:
```python
"""
Examine the input grid for the presence of orange (7).
Create a 3x3 output grid.
If orange is present, fill corners and center with orange, otherwise fill with white.
If no orange, fill entire output grid with white.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid to the output grid based on the presence of orange.
    """
    # Initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Check for orange (7) in the input grid
    orange_present = 7 in input_grid

    # Conditional Fill
    if orange_present:
        # Fill the corner and center pixels of output grid with orange (7)
        output_grid[0, 0] = 7
        output_grid[0, 2] = 7
        output_grid[1, 1] = 7
        output_grid[2, 0] = 7
        output_grid[2, 2] = 7
        # The rest of the pixels are already initialized to 0 (white)
    else:
        # All pixels remain 0 (white) as initialized
        pass

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handles the first training example, where the presence of orange dictates a specific pattern in a 3x3 output grid. However, it fails on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the initial natural language program was too specific to the first example and didn't generalize. We need to re-evaluate the relationship between input and output, paying close attention to *all* examples. It appears the output is *always* 3x3. The presence or absence of orange in the input seems to be the primary driver, but the output pattern when orange is present needs adjustment.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine all Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, not just the first one.
2.  **Identify the Core Rule:** Determine the precise rule governing the output based on the presence/absence of orange. It is not simply filling corners and the center.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately capture the generalized rule.
4.  **Update Code:** Modify the Python code to reflect the revised program.
5. **Test and document**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
