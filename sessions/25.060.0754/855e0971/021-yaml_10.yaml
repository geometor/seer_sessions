    property: dynamic, moves, disappears,reappears
    initial_locations: variable, within grey and yellow regions

actions:
  - name: move_white_pixels
    actor: white_pixels
    precondition: white pixels exist within the larger rectangular colored object
    postcondition: white pixels move or disappear if some condition is met, new one generated
  - name: propagation
    actor: white_pixels
    precondition: original region of the white pixel
    postcondition: if from yellow, stay, if from grey, propagate to red section

relationships:
