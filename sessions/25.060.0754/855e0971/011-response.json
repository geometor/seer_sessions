            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, identifying the presence of white pixels and their effect on red pixels. However, the initial program was incomplete. It correctly identified that white pixels cause some red pixels to their left to become white. The initial program failed to consider the right-most white pixel as a boundary and changed *all* red pixels in the same row to white. It also incorrectly assumed a column-wise transformation mirroring the row-wise behavior.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input-output pair, noting the precise location of white pixels and the resulting changes in red pixels. I'll pay close attention to the boundary conditions (edges of the grid, other colored pixels).\n\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the analysis, I will update the observations in a structured YAML format, focusing on object properties (color, position) and actions (change color).\n\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the observed transformation, incorporating the boundary condition.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately assess the transformation, I'll use a simple function to describe the locations of white and the state of red pixels.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the grid for white and red pixel positions and states.\"\"\"\n    white_pixels = []\n    red_pixels_before = []\n    red_pixels_after = []\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 0:\n                white_pixels.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r,c] == 2:\n                red_pixels_before.append((r,c))\n\n    return {\n        \"white_pixels\": white_pixels,\n        \"red_pixels_before\": red_pixels_before,\n\n    }\n\ndef compare_io(input, output):\n    input_analysis = analyze_grid(input)\n    output_analysis = analyze_grid(output)\n\n    print(\"Input:\")\n    print(input)\n    print(f\"  White Pixels: {input_analysis['white_pixels']}\")\n    print(f\"  Red Pixels  : {input_analysis['red_pixels_before']}\")\n    print(\"Output:\")\n    print(output)\n    print(f\"  White Pixels: {output_analysis['white_pixels']}\")\n    print(f\"  Red Pixels  : {output_analysis['red_pixels_before']}\")\n\n    return\n\n#Example Usage (substitute with actual input/output grids later)\n\n#input_grid = np.array([[1,0], [2,3]])\n#output_grid = np.array([[0,0],[0,3]])\n#compare_io(input_grid, output_grid)\n\n```\n\nNow, let's perform the analysis for each of the example pairs, using the code I just prepared:\n\n```python\n# Example Data (From the training set)\nexamples = [\n    (np.array([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]), np.array([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]])),\n    (np.array([[2, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]), np.array([[0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]])),\n    (np.array([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]), np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])),\n    (np.array([[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]]), np.array([[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]])),\n    (np.array([[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]), np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]))\n]\n\nfor input_grid, output_grid in examples:\n    compare_io(input_grid, output_grid)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n```\n\n**YAML Observations:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: Red Pixels\n    property: color=red (2)\n    action: Change to white (0) conditionally.\n  - object: White Pixels\n    property: color=white (0)\n    action: Act as a boundary for the red pixel transformation.\n  - condition: \"row_contains_white\"\n    description: \"If a row contains a white pixel...\"\n  - transformation_rule: |\n      For each row, find the right-most white pixel. \n      Change all red pixels to the left of this white pixel in that row to white.\n  - boundary: Right-most white pixel in each row.\n  - context: 2D Grid of pixels, colors 0-9\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is transformed as follows: For each row in the grid, identify the right-most white pixel.
