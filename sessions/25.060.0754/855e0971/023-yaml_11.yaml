      - shape: variable
      - action:  source of white pixels
  - name: Red Region
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
      - shape: variable
      - action: receives white pixels based on grey boundary
  - name: Yellow Region
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
      - shape: variable
      - action:  no change
  - name: White Pixels
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - shape: single cell

transformations:
  - find_regions: Identify contiguous regions of grey, red, and yellow.
  - find_grey_red_boundary:  Identify the boundary between grey region and red region
  - move_white_pixels: For each white pixel in the grey region, find its corresponding position in the red region, relative to the boundary. Change the value to white at that position.
  - no_change_yellow: Yellow region does not change.
