            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the core idea of mirroring white pixels across a grey-red boundary. However, the code fails on several examples. The issue isn't the overall concept, but the specific details of *how* the mirroring is implemented, and assumptions made about boundaries. Specifically, the assumptions include that any red and grey regions have a boundary and the boundary should be used to find the relative positions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Boundary Detection:** The current `find_boundary` function assumes *any* pair of grey and red regions have a relevant boundary. This is incorrect. We need to ensure we're only considering boundaries between grey and red regions that are actually related to the transformation. It might not be a matter of *all* boundaries, but a specific, single boundary.\n\n2.  **Improve Relative Position Calculation:** The current relative position calculation is overly simplistic and doesn't guarantee a correct \"mirroring\" effect.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate Region Selection**: It seems like we are operating over all gray regions and all red regions, there is no selection for the relevant regions in the program.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nI will use a simplified representation of the grids, focusing on the relevant parts (grey, red, and white areas). I'll manually inspect, since I can't execute code directly in this turn.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Correct):** The code works as expected.\n*   **Example 2 (Incorrect):**\n    Input grid:\n    ```\n    5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n    5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n    5 5 5 0 5 5 5\n    5 5 0 0 0 5 5\n    5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n    2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n    2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n    ```\n    Expected Output:\n    ```\n    5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n    5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n    5 5 5 0 5 5 5\n    5 5 0 0 0 5 5\n    5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n    2 2 2 0 2 2 2\n    2 2 0 0 0 2 2\n    ```\n\n    Actual output:\n    ```\n    5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n    5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n    5 5 5 0 5 5 5\n    5 5 0 0 0 5 5\n    5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n    2 2 2 0 2 2 2\n    2 2 0 0 0 2 2\n    ```\n\n*   **Example 3 (Incorrect):**\n\nThe code is incorrectly transferring white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grey_region\n    color: 5\n    properties:\n      - contiguous\n      - contains_white_pixels\n  - name: red_region\n    color: 2\n    properties:\n      - contiguous\n  - name: white_pixels_in_grey\n    color: 0\n    properties:\n      - located_within: grey_region\n  - name: boundary\n    properties:\n      - between: grey_region, red_region\n      - type: adjacent # (up, down, left, right)\n\nactions:\n  - name: transfer_color\n    source: white_pixels_in_grey\n    target: red_region\n    mechanism: mirroring_across_boundary\n    condition: boundary_exists\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant Grey and Red Regions:** Find the single contiguous grey region and the single contiguous red region that are involved in the transformation. These regions *must* share a direct boundary (adjacent pixels, not diagonal).\n2.  **Identify White Pixels within Grey:** Locate all white pixels (0) contained *within* the identified grey region.\n3.  **Mirror Across Boundary:** For each white pixel in the grey region:\n    *   Find the *closest* grey pixel that is part of the grey-red boundary.\n    *   Find the corresponding red pixel on the other side of that boundary point.\n    *    Calculate the relative position vector between the white pixel and the grey boundary pixel.\n    *   Apply this same relative position vector, starting from the corresponding *red* boundary pixel, to find the target pixel in the red region.\n    *   Change the color of the target pixel in the red region to white (0), *if* the target pixel is within the bounds of the grid and is currently red.\n4. Regions which do not have adjacent boundaries should remain unchanged.\n"
