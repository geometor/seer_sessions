Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are gray (5), yellow (4), azure (8), and white (0). The input grid appears to be transformed into a modified output grid. The transformation seems to involve duplicating a specific pattern related to the white pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [gray, yellow, azure, white]
      - dimensions: [15 x 19]
  - name: white_pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      - color: white
      - original_positions: [(3,13), (5,4), (12, 9)]
  - name: yellow_block
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
       - color: yellow

  - name: azure_block
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: azure

  - name: gray_block
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: gray
actions:
 - name: duplicate
   description: replicate pattern vertically
relationships:
  - object1: white_pixel
    object2: column
    relation: appears_in
  - object1: yellow_block
    object2: grid
    relation: part_of

  - object1: azure_block
    object2: grid
    relation: part_of
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the columns containing white (0) pixels.
2.  **Within each identified column, Duplicate all rows vertically**, locate where the origional white
    pixel existed, and replace the values to with white pixels.

In essence, the transformation identifies columns with white pixels and then duplicates a vertical slice, replacing duplicated colors with white.
