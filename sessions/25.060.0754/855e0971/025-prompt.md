Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Identify all contiguous regions of grey (5), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Find Grey-Red Boundary:** Determine the boundary pixels between the grey and red regions. A boundary pixel is one that is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonal) to a pixel of the other color.
3. **Propagate White Pixels:**
    *   Iterate through all the white pixels (0) within the grey region.
    *   For each white pixel in the grey region, find its position relative to the grey-red boundary.
    *   Find the corresponding pixel in the red region, using the boundary as a reference for mirroring.
    *   Change the color of the corresponding pixel in the red region to white (0).
4.  **Yellow Region Unchanged:** Pixels within the yellow region remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
