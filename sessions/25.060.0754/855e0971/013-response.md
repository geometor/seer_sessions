Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address any discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good starting point, focusing on the interaction between white and red pixels within each row. However, the consistent success across all training examples indicates that the core logic is correct and robust. There are no errors to resolve, the rule holds across all training examples and no change to the natural language program is required. The strategy of identifying the right-most white pixel and modifying red pixels to its left is accurate.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To confirm, I will build a report about each example using code execution. The report will contain the dimensions of each grid, the number of white pixels, the number of red pixels, and confirm that the rule is followed.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    """
    Analyzes a single input-output pair and generates a report.
    """
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    white_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 0)
    red_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 2)
    white_pixels_output = np.sum(output_grid == 0)
    red_pixels_output = np.sum(output_grid == 2)

    # Verify the rule
    rule_followed = True
    for r in range(rows):
        white_indices = np.where(input_grid[r, :] == 0)[0]
        if white_indices.size > 0:
            rightmost_white_index = white_indices[-1]
            for c in range(rightmost_white_index):
                if input_grid[r, c] == 2 and output_grid[r,c] != 0:
                    rule_followed = False
                    break

            if not rule_followed:
              break

        elif white_indices.size == 0:
          if not np.array_equal(input_grid[r,:], output_grid[r,:]):
            rule_followed = False
            break
