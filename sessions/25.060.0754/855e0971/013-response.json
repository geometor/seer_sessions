However, the consistent success across all training examples indicates that the core logic is correct and robust. There are no errors to resolve, the rule holds across all training examples and no change to the natural language program is required. The strategy of identifying the right-most white pixel and modifying red pixels to its left is accurate.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo confirm, I will build a report about each example using code execution. The report will contain the dimensions of each grid, the number of white pixels, the number of red pixels, and confirm that the rule is followed.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a single input-output pair and generates a report.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    white_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 0)\n    red_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 2)\n    white_pixels_output = np.sum(output_grid == 0)\n    red_pixels_output = np.sum(output_grid == 2)\n\n    # Verify the rule\n    rule_followed = True\n    for r in range(rows):\n        white_indices = np.where(input_grid[r, :] == 0)[0]\n        if white_indices.size > 0:\n            rightmost_white_index = white_indices[-1]\n            for c in range(rightmost_white_index):\n                if input_grid[r, c] == 2 and output_grid[r,c] != 0:\n                    rule_followed = False\n                    break\n\n            if not rule_followed:\n              break\n\n        elif white_indices.size == 0:\n          if not np.array_equal(input_grid[r,:], output_grid[r,:]):\n            rule_followed = False\n            break\n\n    return {\n        \"rows\": rows,\n        \"cols\": cols,\n        \"white_pixels_input\": white_pixels_input,\n        \"red_pixels_input\": red_pixels_input,\n        \"white_pixels_output\": white_pixels_output,\n        \"red_pixels_output\": red_pixels_output,\n        \"rule_followed\": rule_followed,\n    }\n\n#the input and output grids from the training examples\nexamples = [\n([\n    [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 0, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2],\n],\n[\n    [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]\n]),\n([\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n],\n[\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n]),\n([\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n],\n[\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n]),\n([\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n],\n[\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n]),\n([\n  [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2],\n],\n[\n  [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2],\n])\n]\n\nreports = []\nfor input_grid, output_grid in examples:\n  report = analyze_example(np.array(input_grid), np.array(output_grid))\n  reports.append(report)\nprint(reports)\n```\n"
