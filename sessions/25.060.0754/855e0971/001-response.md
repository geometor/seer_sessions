Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids appear to be divided into horizontal bands of different colors. There are isolated white (0) pixels within some of these bands. The transformation seems to focus on manipulating the white pixels, specifically replicating them in a structured way, while largely preserving the colored background. The output grids have a similar overall structure of color bands to the input grids, but the white pixels are expanded, moved or duplicated.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: 2D array of color values (0-9)
  - type: color_band
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - start_row: integer
      - end_row: integer
  - type: white_pixel
    properties:
      - row: integer
      - column: integer
      - color: 0

actions:
  - name: replicate_white_pixels
    description:  Duplicates or moves white pixels based on their original position.
  - name: preserve_background
    description: Keeps the colored background bands the same.

relationships:
  - white_pixels are_within color_bands
  - output_grid has_same_dimensions as input_grid (except in cases that it doesn't)
  - output_grid background_colors match input_grid background_colors

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Background Bands:** Determine the distinct horizontal bands of color in the input grid and their respective row ranges.

2. **Locate White Pixels:** Find all pixels with the value 0 (white) within each color band.

3. **Transform White Pixels:**
    *   If a white pixel exists at column `c` in a band, replace with white pixels a set of columns starting with that column.
    *   The precise set of columns depends of the original position. Looking at all the training sets
    *   Example 1, if it is column 13 (starting from 0), the set of columns will be `[3,4,8,9]`
    *   Example 2, if the origin is `[2,4]` column 2, the set of columns is `[0,1,2,3,4]` and, if the origin is [11, 8], the set will be `[8,9,10,11,12]`
    *   Example 3, `[2,3]` the set is `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]`
    *   Example 4, `[2, 12]`, `[6, 6]` and `[12, 10]` the sets are `[2,10]`, `[2,6]` and `[2,10]`

4. **Preserve Background:** Keep all non-white pixels the same in the output grid as they were in the input grid.

In summary: find the white pixels and, depending on its origin, duplicate them. Preserve all non-white background.
