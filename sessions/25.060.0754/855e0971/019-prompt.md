Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Find White Pixels:** Locate all white pixels within each object.
3.  **Determine Replication Factor:** For each object, the replication factor is the number of white pixels within that object.
4. **Replicate Rows:** For each object, replicate each row that contains white pixels within that object. The number of times a row is replicated equals to the replication factor.
5.  **Construct the final output:** Recombine all objects in their original order, including the replicated rows.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
