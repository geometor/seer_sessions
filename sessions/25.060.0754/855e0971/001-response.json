The input grids appear to be divided into horizontal bands of different colors. There are isolated white (0) pixels within some of these bands. The transformation seems to focus on manipulating the white pixels, specifically replicating them in a structured way, while largely preserving the colored background. The output grids have a similar overall structure of color bands to the input grids, but the white pixels are expanded, moved or duplicated.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Looking at all the training sets\n    *   Example 1, if it is column 13 (starting from 0), the set of columns will be `[3,4,8,9]`\n    *   Example 2, if the origin is `[2,4]` column 2, the set of columns is `[0,1,2,3,4]` and, if the origin is [11, 8], the set will be `[8,9,10,11,12]`\n    *   Example 3, `[2,3]` the set is `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]`\n    *   Example 4, `[2, 12]`, `[6, 6]` and `[12, 10]` the sets are `[2,10]`, `[2,6]` and `[2,10]`\n\n4. **Preserve Background:** Keep all non-white pixels the same in the output grid as they were in the input grid.\n\nIn summary: find the white pixels and, depending on its origin, duplicate them. Preserve all non-white background.\n"
