The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), red (2), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve a subtle shift or alteration of the red (2) pixels within the grid, while the green (3) and white (0) pixels remain largely unchanged. The core of the transformation seems to focus on the configuration of the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
