The primary colors observed are red (2), green (3), and white/background (0). The core transformation seems to involve manipulating the red (2) pixels while preserving the green (3) and white (0) pixels. The shape formed by the red pixels appears to be an \"arrow\" or cross-like figure. The transformation seems to involve rotating this red shape. The green pixels act like fixed \"anchors\" or boundaries and do not move.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify pixels with the value 3 (green) and consider their locations as fixed.\n\n2.  **Rotate Shape:** Rotate the red shape 90 degrees clockwise. The \"center\" of rotation appears to be implicitly defined within the red shape itself and shifts appropriately with each rotation.\n\n3. **Preserve Other Pixels.** Keep all pixels with the value 0 (white/background) and 3 (green) in their original positions. The transformation only affects red objects.\n\n4.  **Output:** Generate the new grid with the rotated red shape and the unchanged green and white pixels.\n"
