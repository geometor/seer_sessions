The grids contain numerical values representing colors: 0 (white), 2 (red), and 3 (green). The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve a manipulation of the red (2) colored regions, specifically a rotation, while the green (3) pixels seem to stay fixed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
