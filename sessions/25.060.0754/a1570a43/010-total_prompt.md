Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of the same dimensions (9x9). The grids contain numerical values representing colors: 0 (white), 2 (red), and 3 (green). The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve a manipulation of the red (2) colored regions, specifically a rotation, while the green (3) pixels seem to stay fixed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: irregular
      position: variable
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: single cell
      position: fixed

actions:
  - type: rotation
    object: red_block
    parameters:
      center: grid_center ?  #need to confirm the center of rotation
      degrees: 90 # clockwise? need to confirm direction

relationships:
  - green_blocks: invariant
  - red_block: transformed_by_rotation

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Identify the green (3) pixels. They don't change so can ignore them, other
    than to copy to the same place in the output.
3.  Treat the red block as a single object.
4.  Rotate the red object 90 degrees clockwise. It *looks* like it is around
    the center of the grid, but it is hard to say in this example.
5.  Place the rotated red block in the output grid.
6.  Copy the two green pixels from the input grid to identical location in the output grid.
7.  All other cells in the output remain as 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
