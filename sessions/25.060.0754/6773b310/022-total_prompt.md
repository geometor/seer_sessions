Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (11x11) containing three colors: white (0), azure (8), and magenta (6).  The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) containing only white (0) and blue (1). The azure squares in the input grid seem to form a regular, cross-like, shape. Magenta seems scattered randomly. The output grid appears to have downsampled the general "shape" of the azure, replacing azure by blue (1).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 11x11
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_colors: [0, 8, 6]
  - output_colors: [0, 1]
  - input_object_1:
      color: 8
      shape: cross-like
      property: main structure
  - input_object_2:
      color: 6
      shape: scattered, single pixels
      property: noise
  - output_object:
      color: 1
      shape: simplified cross
      property: represents input azure object
  - transformation_type: downsampling, color replacement, noise filtering
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the primary structure:** Locate the azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid, which form a cross-like pattern.
2.  **Filter noise:** Ignore the magenta (6) colored pixels, treating them as noise.
3.  **Downsample:** Reduce the input grid to a 3x3 grid.
4.  **Color Replacement**: represent each 3x3 + 2 cell overlap sections of input as a single pixel in the output. Sections that were covered with a value of "8" should be converted to "1", others to "0".

Essentially, the transformation extracts the essential shape formed by the azure pixels, simplifies it by downsampling and replaces azure (8) with blue(1) . The magenta pixels are discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
