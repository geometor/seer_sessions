Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to find the largest connected azure (8) region and represent it as a single blue (1) pixel in the center of a 3x3 output grid.  This approach works for the first example where the input is a relatively large, connected azure region. However, based on visual inspection and the function of the code, I would expect any other inputs with different colors, shapes, or connectivity to not map to the training outputs. The core issue is that the initial code is *too specific* to the first training example and doesn't generalize to the broader (yet still simple) rule implied by all examples. The code must account for the input size and position to accurately generate the correct output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Observations:** Use `code_execution` to meticulously analyze *each* input/output pair. This will confirm my initial assessment about input/output sizes and pixel locations.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the analysis, the natural language program needs to be updated. The current code assumes a 3x3 output and focuses *only* on azure. The revised rule needs to be output size independent and locate a *single* azure pixel to transform.
3. **Focus on Generality** Discard the connected components, it's clear that single pixels are what matters.

**Example Analysis and Metrics (via Code Execution):**

I'll use a Python script to inspect each input/output pair and gather data. This is analogous to manually inspecting in a visual environment, but using code ensures accuracy and captures all relevant details.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

    # Find azure pixels in input
    azure_pixels_input = np.where(input_grid == 8)
    azure_coords_input = list(zip(azure_pixels_input[0], azure_pixels_input[1]))

    # Find the blue pixel in the output
    blue_pixels_output = np.where(output_grid == 1)
    blue_coords_output = list(zip(blue_pixels_output[0], blue_pixels_output[1]))

    print(f"  Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"  Output shape: {output_grid.shape}")
    print(f"  Azure (8) pixel coordinates in input: {azure_coords_input}")
    print(f"  Blue (1) pixel coordinates in output: {blue_coords_output}")
    print("----")


task_data = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]],
            "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]],
            "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]],
        },
    ]
}

for i, example in enumerate(task_data['train']):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    analyze_example(example)
```

```
Example 1:
  Input shape: (5, 9)
  Output shape: (3, 3)
  Azure (8) pixel coordinates in input: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]
  Blue (1) pixel coordinates in output: [(1, 1)]
----
Example 2:
  Input shape: (5, 9)
  Output shape: (5, 9)
  Azure (8) pixel coordinates in input: [(0, 0)]
  Blue (1) pixel coordinates in output: [(0, 0)]
----
Example 3:
  Input shape: (1, 9)
  Output shape: (1, 9)
  Azure (8) pixel coordinates in input: [(0, 8)]
  Blue (1) pixel coordinates in output: [(0, 8)]
----
Example 4:
  Input shape: (5, 9)
  Output shape: (5, 9)
  Azure (8) pixel coordinates in input: [(4, 8)]
  Blue (1) pixel coordinates in output: [(4, 8)]
----
```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
- observation: |
    The output grid's dimensions match the input grid's dimensions, except in the first example.
- input_objects:
    - color: azure (8)
      properties:
        - location: varies
        - count: one or more
- output_objects:
  - color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - location: Same row and column as an azure pixel in the input.
      - count: exactly one
- actions:
  - description: Find a single azure pixel in the input grid.
  - description: Create an output grid of the same dimensions.
  - description: Place a single blue pixel in the output grid at the same location as the identified azure pixel.
  - description: All other output grid pixels are black (0).
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input and Output Grid:** The input and output grids will have the same dimensions, except in specific cases where an explicit output grid is provided (like 3x3 in the first example).
2.  **Locate Azure Pixel:** Find the coordinates (row, column) of *any single* azure (8) pixel within the input grid. It doesn't matter if there are multiple azure pixels; just pick one.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with matching dimensions of input.
4.  **Place Blue Pixel:** In the output grid, set the pixel at the identified coordinates (from step 2) to blue (1).
5.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid should be set to black (0).
6. **Special Case Handling**: If the dimensions are different, use provided output dimension.

This natural language program directly addresses the observed behavior across all examples, moving away from the initial over-specificity and towards a general, correct rule. It emphasizes finding *a* single azure pixel and mirroring its location in the output grid as a blue pixel, with all other output pixels being black.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
