  - input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: variable
      elements:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 5]
        colors: [white, gray]
      features:

      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3

        type: integer
        values: [2, 8, 3]
        colors: [red, azure, green]

  - transformation:
        type: size_reduction
        description: "The input grid is significantly reduced in size to a 3x3 output grid."
        color_change:  "Colors in the input grid are not directly mapped to the output grid. The output features specific colors that are different."
        possible_logic: "The output grid is a 3x3 grid always, each cell a different and consistent color."
