The input grid appears to have a pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grid consists of solid colored 1x1 squares of red (2), azure (8), and green (3). The input seems to have a larger dimension, and the output has a smaller, fixed dimension (3x3). The transformation appears to involve a significant reduction in size and a change in colors. There is no obvious direct mapping of input colors to output colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
