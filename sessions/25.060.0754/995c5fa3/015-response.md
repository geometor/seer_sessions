Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a grid of pixels, primarily gray (5) with some white (0) pixels.
*   The output is a smaller grid with azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels.
*   The output grid's dimensions (3x3) are significantly smaller than the input grid's dimensions (4x14).
*   There's no immediately obvious spatial correspondence between the white pixels in the input and the colored pixels in the output. The output seems to be a summary or encoding, not a direct geometric transformation.
*   It can be noticed that the output grid's values can represent the counts of the white pixels in the rows of the original grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_description: |
  - Input: A 2D grid of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - Output: A 2D grid of pixels, smaller than the input.
  - Colors: Input contains gray (5) and white (0). Output contains azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4).
  - Input_Dimensions: 4 x 14.
  - Output_Dimensions: 3 x 3.
  - Objects:  Rows of pixels in the input grid. White pixels within each row.
  - Properties:  Count of white pixels in each row.
  - Actions: Count, Encode.
  - Relationships: The output grid's pixel values *might* relate to the count of white pixels in segments of the input grid or by rows.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of white (0) pixels in the current row.
3.  **Form** rows of 3 in the output grid and fill them with that number.
4. Repeat steps until all input rows have been proceed.

In simple words, the output grid presents the count of 0s in each row of the input.
