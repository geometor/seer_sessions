**output:**
```

4 4 4
2 2 2

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17541630D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of numbers, primarily 5s (gray) and 0s (white). The output is a smaller grid with numbers corresponding to different colors (3-green, 4-yellow, 2-red). The output grid appears to summarize or represent a condensed version of information contained within the input grid. It seems like the input grid is being divided into sections and each section of the output grid represents a different property or summary statistic.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    dimensions: 4 x 14
    primary_values: [5, 0]
    colors: [gray, white]

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    dimensions: 3 x 3
    primary_values: [3, 4, 2]
    colors: [green, yellow, red]

  - relationship: output_represents_sections_of_input
    description: The output grid appears to be a condensed representation of the input grid.

  - observation: vertical_stripes_output
    description: there are vertial lines of colors in the output grid

  - observation: input_grid_sections
    description: input grid is split into nine sections of various size

  - action: count_zeros_by_row_in_section
    description: The value in the output grid seems to correspond the the number of rows in the input_grid that have at least one zero in a defined section of the input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide Input:** Divide the input grid into nine sections. Looking at the input and output, and knowing that there will likely be nine total sections based on the 3x3 output grid:
    *   Section 1: Rows 1-1, Columns 1-4
    *   Section 2: Rows 1-1, Columns 5-9
    *   Section 3: Rows 1-1, Columns 10-14
    *   Section 4: Rows 2-2, Columns 1-4
    *   Section 5: Rows 2-2, Columns 5-9
    *   Section 6: Rows 2-2, Columns 10-14
    *   Section 7: Rows 3-4, Columns 1-4
    *   Section 8: Rows 3-4, Columns 5-9
    *   Section 9: Rows 3-4, Columns 10-14

2.  **Process Sections:** For each section:
    *   Iterate through each *row* within that section
    *   If the row section contains the value 0, record that, otherwise skip.

3.  **Generate Output:** The count of rows with at least one zero becomes the output grid's corresponding cell value. Each section maps to the output cell value.

    *    Example: Row 1 columns 1-4 is all 5s. No zero. Output top left is not affected.
    *    Example: Row 1, columns 5-9 contain one zero. Output is affected.
    *    Example: Rows 3-4, Columns 1-4. Row 3 has two zeros in this range and Row 4 has two zeros in this range. Both are recorded.
    *    Example: Section 5 count is equal to 1, so the central element of the output is 4
    *    Example: Section 9 count is equal to 2, so the lower right corner element of the output is 2

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
