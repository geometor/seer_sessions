The output is a smaller grid containing 2s (red) and 4s (yellow). The output grid seems to be related to a compressed or abstracted representation of the input grid. The spatial arrangement in the output is different and doesn't appear to be a straightforward sub-section of the input. There's likely a process involving identifying shapes, their features, and then mapping it all using new dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Think of this as the \"significant feature\" in the input.\n2. **Analyze Input:** Count the number of distinct gray (5) columns to the left of the white (0) region, count the number of distinct gray(5) columns to the right.\n3.  **Construct Output Dimensions:** The output grid will be 3x3.\n4. **Populate the output grid**:\n    *   Make rows 1 and 3 all red (2).\n    *   Make row 2 all yellow (4).\n\nEssentially, the transformation simplifies the input into a fixed-size output, discarding much of the original detail. The colours in the output have no relationship to the colours on the input, and only two colors will be in the result.\n"
