The output is a smaller grid with numbers corresponding to different colors (3-green, 4-yellow, 2-red). The output grid appears to summarize or represent a condensed version of information contained within the input grid. It seems like the input grid is being divided into sections and each section of the output grid represents a different property or summary statistic.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Looking at the input and output, and knowing that there will likely be nine total sections based on the 3x3 output grid:\n    *   Section 1: Rows 1-1, Columns 1-4\n    *   Section 2: Rows 1-1, Columns 5-9\n    *   Section 3: Rows 1-1, Columns 10-14\n    *   Section 4: Rows 2-2, Columns 1-4\n    *   Section 5: Rows 2-2, Columns 5-9\n    *   Section 6: Rows 2-2, Columns 10-14\n    *   Section 7: Rows 3-4, Columns 1-4\n    *   Section 8: Rows 3-4, Columns 5-9\n    *   Section 9: Rows 3-4, Columns 10-14\n\n2.  **Process Sections:** For each section:\n    *   Iterate through each *row* within that section\n    *   If the row section contains the value 0, record that, otherwise skip.\n\n3.  **Generate Output:** The count of rows with at least one zero becomes the output grid's corresponding cell value. Each section maps to the output cell value.\n\n    *    Example: Row 1 columns 1-4 is all 5s. No zero. Output top left is not affected.\n    *    Example: Row 1, columns 5-9 contain one zero. Output is affected.\n    *    Example: Rows 3-4, Columns 1-4. Row 3 has two zeros in this range and Row 4 has two zeros in this range. Both are recorded.\n    *    Example: Section 5 count is equal to 1, so the central element of the output is 4\n    *    Example: Section 9 count is equal to 2, so the lower right corner element of the output is 2\n"
