Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through each row of the input grid.
Count the number of white (0) pixels in the current row.
Create the output grid with 3x3, and place that number in the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid to the output grid by counting white pixels in each row and encoding."""

    # Get the number of rows in the input grid
    num_rows = len(input_grid)
    output_grid = []

    # Iterate through each row of the input grid
    for row in input_grid:
        # Count the number of white (0) pixels in the current row
        white_pixel_count = np.count_nonzero(row == 0)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
