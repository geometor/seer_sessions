Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 3x5.  The primary change observed is the movement and color change of a single colored pixel.  All other pixels are white (value 0) and remain unchanged. The colored pixel in the input is red (value 2), and in the output, it's green (value 3). The movement appears to be a specific shift in position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        values: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
      - name: output_grid
        values: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - name: colored_pixel
        initial_color: red (2)
        final_color: green (3)
        initial_position: [2, 4] # row, column (0-indexed)
        final_position: [1, 3]   # row, column (0-indexed)

actions:
  - type: move
    object: colored_pixel
    from: initial_position
    to: final_position
    details:  Moves up one row and left one column.

  - type: change_color
    object: colored_pixel
    from: red (2)
    to: green (3)

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by moving and recoloring the colored pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero pixel:** In the input grid, locate the single pixel that has a value other than 0. This is the "colored pixel."
2.  **Record Initial Position:** Note the row and column index of this colored pixel.
3. **Determine New Position:**
    *   The new row index is one less than the original row index.
    *   The new column index is one less than original column index
4.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified pixel from red (2) to green (3).
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with 0s.
6.  **Place Modified Pixel:** In the output grid, set the pixel at the new position (calculated in step 3) to the new color (determined in step 4, which is 3).
7. Return new grid

In short form: The colored pixel moves diagonally up and to the left by one position, and its color changes from red to green. All other pixels remain white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
