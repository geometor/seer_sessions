Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of numerical values. The input grid contains a single non-zero value (2, representing red), while the output grid contains multiple non-zero values at different positions with different colors, such as 3(green), 6(magenta), 8(azure) and 7(orange). All other cells are 0 (white). The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x5).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x5).
  - observation: The input grid contains only one non-zero pixel (value 2, red).
  - observation: The output grid contains four non-zero pixels in a different arrangement, and with no red pixels.
  - observation: The non-zero pixels in the output grid are green (3), magenta (6), azure (8), and orange (7).
  - observation: The output pixels replace some of the zeros, but do not seem related to input pixel directly.
  - observation: All the colored pixels of output grid are arranged in locations where the value 0 exists.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Replacement:** Create 4 new pixels of defined values.
    *   Set a cell to value 3 (green).
    *   Set a cell to value 6 (magenta).
    *   Set a cell to value 8 (azure).
    *   Set a cell to value 7 (orange).
3.  **Location Specification:** Define locations for the new pixels, replacing 0 values.
    *    put 3(green) at (0,0)
    *    put 6(magenta) at (0,2)
    *    put 8(azure) at (2,0)
    *    put 7(orange) at (2,2)
4. **Output Generation**: The output grid does not seem be to realted to the input. Keep input grid shape, and replace input grid values with new values for output grid.

Essentially, the transformation replaces specific zero-valued cells in the input grid with predetermined, constant-valued, colored pixels at defined coordinates. The input pixel value is irrelevant to the output, except that they are placed where zeros exist.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
