Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation replaces specific zero-valued cells in the input grid with
predetermined, constant-valued, colored pixels at defined coordinates. The
input pixel value is irrelevant to the output, except that they are placed
where zeros exist.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions and data type as the input grid, filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Set specific cells to predetermined values (colors).
    output_grid[0, 0] = 3  # Green
    output_grid[0, 2] = 6  # Magenta
    output_grid[2, 0] = 8  # Azure
    output_grid[2, 2] = 7  # Orange

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
