The input grid contains a single non-zero value (2, representing red), while the output grid contains multiple non-zero values at different positions with different colors, such as 3(green), 6(magenta), 8(azure) and 7(orange). All other cells are 0 (white). The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x5).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Keep input grid shape, and replace input grid values with new values for output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation replaces specific zero-valued cells in the input grid with predetermined, constant-valued, colored pixels at defined coordinates. The input pixel value is irrelevant to the output, except that they are placed where zeros exist.\n"
