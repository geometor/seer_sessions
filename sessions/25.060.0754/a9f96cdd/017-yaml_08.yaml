general_rule:
  target_object: "The top-leftmost non-zero pixel in the input grid."
  removal_condition: "The target object is always removed."
  addition_condition: "Azure and orange pixels are added diagonally below the removed pixel *only* if the target is not in the bottom row of the grid."
  azure_placement: "One row below and one column to the left of the removed pixel."
  orange_placement: "One row below and one column to the right of the removed pixel."
