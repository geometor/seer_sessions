Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation replaces specific zero-valued cells in the input grid with
predetermined, constant-valued, colored pixels at defined coordinates. The
input pixel value is irrelevant to the output, except that they are placed
where zeros exist.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions and data type as the input grid, filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Set specific cells to predetermined values (colors).
    output_grid[0, 0] = 3  # Green
    output_grid[0, 2] = 6  # Magenta
    output_grid[2, 0] = 8  # Azure
    output_grid[2, 2] = 7  # Orange

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial `transform` function to the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a very limited observation (likely just the first training example). It assumed that specific zero-valued cells are replaced with predetermined colors at fixed coordinates, irrespective of the input grid's content (beyond the presence of zeros). The provided results strongly indicate that this is incorrect. The transformation is NOT simply placing colors at hardcoded locations. It's clear the *input* grid's structure and content *does* influence the output. The strategy is to re-examine all the provided examples, paying close attention to how the *input* relates to the *output*, not just where colors appear in the output. We need to identify a rule that explains *all* examples, not just the first one. The function needs to examine the input grid, it is not placing outputs at constants.

**Metrics and Observations**

To accurately describe what is happening I will write a short program to
describe the example grids.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid, grid_name):
    """Provides a basic description of a grid."""
    print(f"Grid: {grid_name}")
    print(f"  Shape: {grid.shape}")
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    for color, count in zip(unique, counts):
        print(f"  Color {color}: {count} pixels")

# Assuming 'task' is the dictionary loaded from the JSON
for i, example in enumerate(task["train"]):
    describe_grid(np.array(example["input"]), f"train[{i}][input]")
    describe_grid(np.array(example["output"]), f"train[{i}][output]")
    if 'result' in example:
      describe_grid(np.array(example['result']),f"train[{i}][result]")
    print("---")

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
