Previous Code:
```python
"""
The colored pixel moves diagonally up and to the left by one position, and its color changes from red to green. All other pixels remain white.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_colored_pixel(grid):
    # Find the coordinates of the non-zero pixel.
    rows, cols = np.where(grid != 0)
    if len(rows) > 0:  # Ensure a non-zero pixel was found
      return rows[0], cols[0]
    return None

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find the colored pixel in the input grid.
    colored_pixel_coords = find_colored_pixel(input_grid)

    if colored_pixel_coords:
      # change output pixels
      row, col = colored_pixel_coords

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
