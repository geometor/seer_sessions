Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Divide**: Divide the input 9x9 grid into nine 3x3 non-overlapping subgrids.
2.  **Reduce**: For each 3x3 subgrid in the input:
    *   Iterate through the cells in the subgrid.
    *   If all cells are background (0/white), the output cell is background (0/white).
    *   If any cell in the subgrid has a non-zero color, the output cell takes that color. If there are multiple *different* non-zero colors within a single 3x3 subgrid, the output color will match the specific non-zero input color within that subgrid.
3.  **Output**: The result of each subgrid's reduction represents a single pixel in the corresponding location of the 3x3 output grid. The output color represents the color present in that subgrid based on the rule described in the reduce step.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
