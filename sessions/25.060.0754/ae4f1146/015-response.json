The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0-9). The primary colors present in this example are azure (8) and blue (1), with a significant amount of white (0) in the input. The output grid seems to be a highly condensed version of the input, retaining only the blue and azure pixels, and specifically focusing on a particular cluster or pattern of those pixels. The output grid appears to be related to the bottom and to be in lower-left part of input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
