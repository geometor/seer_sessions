observations:
  - task: downscaling_grid
    input_grid_size: 9x9
    output_grid_size: 3x3
    input_objects:
      - description: 3x3 subgrids within the 9x9 grid
        properties:
          - color: varies (can be any color from 0-9)
          - size: 3x3
          - contents: contiguous block of pixels
    output_objects:
      - description: Single pixels in the 3x3 output grid
        properties:
          - color: corresponds to a non-zero color present in the corresponding input subgrid
          - size: 1x1
    transformations:
      - action: Divide the 9x9 input into nine 3x3 subgrids.
      - action: Reduce each 3x3 subgrid to a single pixel.
        rule: "If any non-background (non-zero) color is present in the subgrid, the output pixel takes that color.  If multiple different non-zero colors exist, the test examples will help determine the behavior."
    color_priority: "Unknown - to be derived from test examples. It's clear background (0) is lowest priority, but the precedence among other colors is not yet fully defined."
