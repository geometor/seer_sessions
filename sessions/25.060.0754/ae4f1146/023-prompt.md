Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid appears to be
chosen based on being in the top-left region containing non-white pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier slicing
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Define the dimensions of the subgrid
    subgrid_height = 3
    subgrid_width = 3

    # Extract the 3x3 subgrid from rows 1-3, cols 2-4.
    output_grid = input_array[1:4, 2:5]

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
