The colors present in the input are primarily white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a highly condensed representation of the input, retaining only certain colors and seemingly focusing on a specific region or pattern. There's a clear reduction in dimensions, and the output doesn't seem to be a simple down-sampling or average of the input. It appears to be selecting specific pixels from the input, with an emphasis on relative position.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It *appears* that the program considers the subgrid from row 2, column 3 to row 4, column 5 (inclusive; 1-indexed, top-left is 1, 1), however row and column indexing starts at 0. So, that's rows 1-3 and columns 2-4 in python's 0-indexed system.\n2. **Extract Subgrid:** A 3x3 subgrid is extracted. It is the region identified.\n3. **Output:** The extracted subgrid is the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts a particular 3x3 region of the input grid and presents it as the output. The core challenge is to define the rule that determines *which* 3x3 region is chosen. In this particular instance, it is the subgrid at the top-left containing non-white pixels.\n"
