The input grids are larger (9x9) than the output grids (3x3). The dominant colors in the input grids are white (0), azure (8), and blue (1). The output grids consist only of azure (8) and blue (1).

The upper-left corner coordinate isn't fixed.\n2. **Extract the selected 3x3 subgrid.**\n3. **Output extracted subgrid becomes output**. The output is a 3x3 grid, same as the extracted subgrid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts a specific 3x3 region from the input grid, where the selection of this region seems to be based on identifying the most consistent region of alternating blue (1) and azure (8) pixels, prioritizing regions closer to the center of the input grid. The colors, relative positions and values of that 3x3 are maintained as it becomes the output.\n"
