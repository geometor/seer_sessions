**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (input and output) containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids are larger (9x9) than the output grids (3x3). The dominant colors in the input grids are white (0), azure (8), and blue (1). The output grids consist only of azure (8) and blue (1). It appears that a specific sub-region of the input grid is being extracted and condensed into the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_distribution: varied (0, 1, 8 are prevalent)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_distribution: limited (only 1 and 8)

  - name: sub_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers
    properties:
       - dynamic: "true"
       - derived_from: input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid
    output: sub_grid
    parameters:
      - location: dynamic (varies per example)
      - criteria: "alternating pattern of 1 and 8, prioritizing the central 3x3 area"

  - name: condense
    input: sub_grid
    output: output_grid
    parameters:
       - rule: "keep the colors, maintain grid positions"
       - size: "fixed(3x3)"

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: sub_grid
  - sub_grid_transforms_to: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify a 3x3 subgrid within the 9x9 input grid.** This subgrid seems to be selected based on an alternating or prevalent pattern of azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. It appears the algorithm is prioritizing a sub_grid near the middle. The upper-left corner coordinate isn't fixed.
2. **Extract the selected 3x3 subgrid.**
3. **Output extracted subgrid becomes output**. The output is a 3x3 grid, same as the extracted subgrid.

In summary, the transformation extracts a specific 3x3 region from the input grid, where the selection of this region seems to be based on identifying the most consistent region of alternating blue (1) and azure (8) pixels, prioritizing regions closer to the center of the input grid. The colors, relative positions and values of that 3x3 are maintained as it becomes the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
