**input:**
```
9 9 5
5 5 8
5 8 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C77AE50>

**output:**
```
9 5 5
9 5 8
5 8 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C77A350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer represents a color. The transformation seems to involve swapping the positions of certain cells within the grid.  Specifically, it looks like a horizontal shift or rearrangement of columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - columns: individual vertical lines of cells
      - rows: individual horizontal lines of cells

actions:
  - type: swap
    description: Interchanges the positions of two columns.

relationships:
  - spatial: Cells are arranged in a 2D grid structure with row and column indices.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to swap the first and second columns of the input grid to produce the output grid.  More generally, shift the leftmost column to the position just right of the now-leftmost column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
