Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the previously generated code to the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 3x3 kernel operation that swaps pixels within each subgrid. This approach correctly captures the transformation in the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the transformation isn't universally a 3x3 pixel swap. We need to identify the *conditions* under which the swaps occur and what determines the scope (it might not always be a 3x3 grid) of the operation. The provided results should highlight cases where it fails, offering hints about the true rule.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Focus on the examples where the output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns/Differences:** Look for patterns or differences between examples that do and don't match the rule in prior code.
3.  **Hypothesize Refined Rules:** Based on error analysis, propose modified rules.
4.  **Express as Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the revised transformation logic.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To gather metrics and better understand the examples, I will use a structured approach.
I will use the first example where the result is False as an example, then summarize:

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, predicted_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    predicted_output = np.array(predicted_output)
    
    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output Grid:")
    print(expected_output)
    print("Predicted Output Grid:")
    print(predicted_output)
    print("Shape - Input:", input_grid.shape)
    print("Shape - Expected:", expected_output.shape)
    print("Shape - Predicted:", predicted_output.shape)
    
    correct = np.array_equal(expected_output, predicted_output)
    print("Correct:", correct)
    if not correct:
        diff = expected_output != predicted_output
        print("Number of differences", np.sum(diff))
        print("Differences (Expected vs Predicted):")
        
        diff_indices = np.where(diff)
        for i in range(len(diff_indices[0])):
            row, col = diff_indices[0][i], diff_indices[1][i]
            print(f"  Row: {row}, Col: {col}, Expected: {expected_output[row, col]}, Predicted: {predicted_output[row, col]}")
