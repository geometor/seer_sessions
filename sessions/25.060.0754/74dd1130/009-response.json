Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.\n*   **Colors:** The colors present in this example, based on the digit values, are red (2), magenta (6), and gray (5).\n*   **Change:** Only a subset of the cells change color. The transformation appears local, as the changed pixel seems to depend only on the original value of that pixel.\n*    A pixel's value is potentially swapped with the pixel to the left, otherwise remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
