facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids maintain the same dimensions.
  - object: pixels
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)
      color: derived from value (0: white, 3: green, 8: azure)
    actions:
      change_value: |
        Some pixels with value 3 change to 8.
      stay:
        Pixels that do not change value.
    relationships:
      - spatial_relationship: adjacency (pixels next to each other)
      - change_relationship: |
          If a green(3) pixel is adjacent to any other green(3) pixel, change green(3) pixel to azure (8).
          If a green pixel is not adjacent to any other green pixel, it will not change.
