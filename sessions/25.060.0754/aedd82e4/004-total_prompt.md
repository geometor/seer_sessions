**input:**
```
0 2 2
0 2 2
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C75CDD0>

**output:**
```
0 2 2
0 2 2
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C75DD50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and red (2). The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixel in the bottom-left corner, which has changed from red (2) to blue (1).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
        color:
            white: 0
            red: 2
            blue: 1

actions:
  - type: change_color
    location: bottom-left corner
    from: red
    to: blue

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grid is a 2D arrangement of pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid of pixels.
2.  Locate the pixel at the bottom-left corner (row 2, column 0, using 0-indexing).
3.  If this pixel is red (2), change its color to blue (1).
4. All other pixels remain in the initial state (keep original values).
5.  Output the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
