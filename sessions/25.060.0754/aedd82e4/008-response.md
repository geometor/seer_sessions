The input is a 3x3 grid of pixels. Examine the pixel at the bottom-left corner (row 2, column 0, using 0-indexing). If this pixel is red (2), change its color to blue (1).  If it is not red, leave it unchanged. All other pixels remain in their initial state (keep original values). Output the modified grid.
