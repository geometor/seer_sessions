- task: "Change white pixels to blue if and only if they are diagonally adjacent to a red pixel"
  objects:
    - name: pixel
      properties:
        color:
          - white (0)
          - blue (1)
          - red (2)
        adjacency:
          - diagonal
  actions:
    - name: transform_color
      precondition:
        - "pixel is white"
        - "pixel is diagonally adjacent to a red pixel"
      postcondition:
        - "pixel color changes to blue"
    - name: identify_red
      precondition: 
        - "pixel is red"
      postcondition:
        - "no change if no white pixels are diagonally adjacent"
