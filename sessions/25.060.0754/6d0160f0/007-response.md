Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The grids have the same dimensions (11x11).
*   A dominant color is 'gray' (5).
*   Most non-gray pixels in the input grid are replaced by gray pixels in the output grid.
*   It appears that a horizontal line of gray (5) pixels are maintained in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 11x11
      elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer value (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      row_index: 3 and 7

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    description: Change the color of a pixel.
    parameters:
      original_color: any color
      new_color: gray (5)

relationships:
  - element_of: (pixel, grid)
  - contains: (grid, pixel)
  - adjacent: (pixel, pixel)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** horizontal lines of 'gray' (5) pixels in rows 3 and 7 (counting from 0).
2.  **Iterate** through all the pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Maintain** All 'Gray' (5) pixels to output grid.
4.  **Maintain** all pixels that are not 'Gray'(5) in the same column as any Gray pixel to the output grid.
5.  **Replace** other pixel with a 'Gray'(5) pixel.

Essentially, the transformation seems to preserve the 'gray' horizontal lines and selectively replaces other colored pixels with 'gray' while maintaining a relationship relative to the existing Gray Pixels, either vertically or horizontally.
