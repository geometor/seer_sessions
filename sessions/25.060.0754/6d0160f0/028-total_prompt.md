"""
1.  **Identify Separators:** Locate all pixels with the color gray (5).
2.  **Preserve Separators:** Maintain the gray pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  Within the two horizontal gray lines, locate the positions of any colors in the top most segment
4.  If any color exists in that segment between two vertical gray lines, maintain the first occurence of each unique non zero color just below the horizontal divider
5.  **Replace other colors:** Replace all other colored pixels that do not meet the previous condition with white color (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying gray separators and selectively copying colors from the top segment. However, the test results reveal that the logic needs adjustments to handle variations in the input grids, specifically:
*   **Multiple Horizontal Segments:** The initial code presumed a structure of only a top, middle, and bottom. Many examples have more than one section below the first horizontal separator.
*    **Correct row for output**: The program currently only places the colors on the row immediately below the top horizontal segment. It needs to consider other segments, too.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves these steps:

1.  **Generalized Segment Identification:** Instead of assuming a fixed number of horizontal segments, dynamically identify all segments bounded by horizontal gray lines.
2.  **Iterate through Segments:** Process not just the top segment, but all segments sequentially. Within each segment, identify the color presence and move the colors to the row below the *current* segment's lower boundary.
3.   Ensure we are taking the first presence of the colors, going left to right, top to bottom.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

To gather more precise metrics, I'll use a `code_execution` block to analyze each input/output/predicted output trio. This will help pinpoint exactly where the logic is failing. Specifically, I want to know:
* The row coordinates of horizontal separator lines
* For each vertical segment defined by columns (within each main horizontal segment):
  *   The colors that should be extracted.
    * The first location of that color
  *   The row in the output where those colors should be placed.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid. These act as horizontal and vertical separators, dividing the grid into segments.

2.  **Segment Iteration**: Iterate through each horizontal segment defined by the horizontal gray separators, from top to bottom.

3.  **Vertical Segment Processing:** Within each horizontal segment, iterate through the vertical segments defined by the vertical gray lines.

4.  **Extract and Copy Colors:** For each segment (defined by both horizontal and vertical separators):
    *   Find all unique, non-zero, non-gray colors within the segment, recording the location of the color's first appearance (top to bottom, left to right).
    *   Copy these unique colors to the row *immediately below the current horizontal segment's lower boundary*. Maintain the original column position of the first occurance.
    *   If the target location is occupied by a gray pixel, keep the gray pixel.

5.  **Preserve Separators:** Ensure all gray separators from the input grid are present in the output grid at their original positions.

6.  **Clear Remaining Pixels:** All pixels in a segment, other than the copied colors and gray separators, should be set to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
