Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Locate the two horizontal lines composed entirely of '5' (grey) pixels. These lines divide the input grid into three distinct sections (top, middle, and bottom).
2.  **Process Each Section Independently:** For each of the three sections:
    *   Iterate through each row within the section.
    *   Copy all '5' pixels from the Input to the Output
    *   Identify non-'0' and non-'5' pixels in the input row of the section.
    *   Moving from left to right, check input rows. If a value different than `0` and `5` exists in the input, then fill it with the value `0`. If it exists, copy them, one by one, to the `0` valued cells in the corresponding output row.
3.  **Combine Sections:** The output grid is formed by combining the processed top, middle, and bottom sections, maintaining the '5' (grey) separator lines in their original positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
