Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   There's a prominent horizontal line of 5s (gray) in both input and output, dividing each grid into two parts.
*   Many digits above and below this line are replaced with 0s (white) in the output.
*    Specifically the digits that change are not 5
*   The transformation seems to involve removing or blanking out certain digits/colors based on their position relative to the gray line and their value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: mapped from integers
  - object: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - value: 5 (gray)
      - position: row_index_3 and row_index_7
      - role: divider
  - action: remove_pixels
    properties:
      - condition:
          - pixel_value: not_equal_to 5
          - relative_position: not on horizontal line
      - result: change_value_to 0 (white)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the horizontal lines of 5s (gray pixels). In this example the lines of 5s exist on index 3 and 7.
2.  **Iterate** through all other cells in the grid.
3.  **If** a cell's value is not 5, **then** change the cell's value to 0.
4. **If** the value on a line is 5 keep it the same.
5. Keep the lines of 5s

In essence, the transformation preserves the horizontal gray lines of '5's and converts all other non-5 digits to 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
