The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Examine Input:** The input is a grid (2D array) of colored pixels, where each color is represented by an integer from 0 to 9.
2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid will be a subgrid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by taking the smaller of 3 and the corresponding input grid dimension. This means:
    *   The output grid will have a maximum of 3 rows, but will use the available input rows if fewer than 3.
    *   The output grid will have a maximum of 3 columns, but will use the available input columns if fewer than 3.
3. **Extract Subgrid:** Copy the top-left portion of the input grid up to the sizes determined in Step 2.
4. **Output:** The extracted subgrid becomes the output. The output grid can therefore be a maximum of 3x3 but smaller if the input dimensions are smaller.

In summary, the output is always the top-left corner of the input grid, with dimensions limited to a maximum of 3x3. The program correctly extracts the largest possible subgrid, up to 3x3, from the top-left corner of the input grid.
