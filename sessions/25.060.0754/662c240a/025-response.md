Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are composed of colored squares (pixels), represented by single-digit numbers. The input grid appears to be divided into 3x3 subgrids, each with uniform colors. The output grid retains only the top 3x3 subgrid of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 3] # input grid
      elements: colored squares (pixels)
      values: [0-9] # representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # output grid
      elements: colored squares (pixels)
      values: [0-9]

  - type: subgrid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3,3]
      parent: input_grid

actions:
  - type: extract
    agent: system
    target: top-left 3x3 subgrid
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: part_of
    subject: subgrid
    object: input_grid
  - type: corresponds_to
    subject: output_grid
    object: top_left_subgrid # of input grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:** The input is a 9x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Locate the target subgrid:** The target is the 3x3 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.
3.  **Extract the subgrid:** Copy the 3x3 top-left portion of the input grid.
4.  **Create output grid:** Use the extracted subgrid as the output grid. Essentially, the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid.
In short form, it means: Crop the input grid to the first 3 rows.
