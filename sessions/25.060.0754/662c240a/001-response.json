Each input grid appears to be segmented into 3x3 blocks of pixels. The transformation seems to select one of these 3x3 blocks and output it. The selection criteria are not immediately obvious but appear consistent across examples.  The overall input grid is always 9x3 and the output grid is 3x3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
