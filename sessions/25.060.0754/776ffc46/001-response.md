Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing digits representing different colors.  The primary colors involved appear to be gray (5), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and white(0). The transformations seem to involve replacing certain colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color) with objects of a different color, while often retaining the shape. Gray areas may be acting as background. The shapes formed look like plus signs, rectangles, and squares.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_shape
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (plus, rectangle)
      - size: variable
  - name: red_shape
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (plus)
      - size: variable
  - name: green_shape
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - shape: variable (rectangle)
      - size: variable
  - name: grey_background
    color: grey (5)
    properties:
      - constant
  - name: white_background
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - constant
  
actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Changes the color of an object while maintaining its shape and position.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are positioned relative to each other within the grid.
  - type: color_change
    description: in each pair of input-output, a blue object is replaced by an object with the color of another shape.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color, recognizing them as distinct objects. Note down their color, shape, and position. The are colors, and shapes seem to be mostly grey(5) background, and blue(1), red(2), or green(3) shapes.

2.  **Find the substitution**: In each example input-output, a single shape with blue color exists, and this shape and position exists with another color in the output. Find this blue shape and the color that replaces.

3. **Apply Transformation**: Apply the color substitution found in step 2.

In summary, the core transformation is the substitution of a shape's color, specifically a blue shape, by the color of the other non-gray shape present in the input.
