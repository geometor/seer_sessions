example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
  output_objects:
    - color: green
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
  transformation: isolated blue pixel becomes green

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: false #Adjacent to the edge of the grid
  output_objects:
    - color: green
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: green
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: false

  transformation: isolated blue pixels become green, blue pixels on edge remain

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      isolated: false
    - color: blue
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      isolated: false
  output_objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: 2x1 rectangle
        isolated: false
      - color: blue
        shape: 2x1 rectangle
        isolated: false
  transformation: No change; non-isolated blue pixels remain blue
