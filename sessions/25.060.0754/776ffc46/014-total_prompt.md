Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code focused on identifying *isolated* blue pixels and changing them to green. The provided code seems to correctly implement this logic. The core issue is how to evaluate the validity of the transformation rule in all cases. Looking at the examples and outputs is the most effective way to do this. I will assess each example pair and provide an analysis. It is likely, given the simplicity of the first transformation program and the additional, untested, examples, that the transformation program will need to be improved or expanded to capture the new observations.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I will use a structured approach to analyze each example, combining visual inspection of the input/output pairs.

Here's a breakdown of each example pair and the observed results:

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 3 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

-   **Observation:** A single, isolated blue pixel is transformed to green. The code correctly handles this.
-   **Metrics:**
    -   Input: 1 blue pixel, isolated.
    -   Output: 1 green pixel, at the same location.
    -   **Result: Correct**

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]]
Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 3 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 3 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]]
```

-   **Observation:** Two isolated blue pixels are transformed to green, one blue pixel is unchanged, which could be because it is touching the edge.
-   **Metrics:**
    -   Input: 3 blue pixels, two of which are fully isolated.
    -   Output: 2 green pixels, at the locations of the 2 isolated blue pixels.
    -   **Result: Correct**

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

-   **Observation:** Pairs of adjacent blue pixels are *not* transformed.
-   **Metrics:**
    -   Input: 4 blue pixels, forming two pairs.
    -   Output: 4 blue pixels, unchanged.
    -   **Result: Correct**
**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
  output_objects:
    - color: green
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
  transformation: isolated blue pixel becomes green

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: false #Adjacent to the edge of the grid
  output_objects:
    - color: green
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: green
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: true
    - color: blue
      shape: single pixel
      isolated: false

  transformation: isolated blue pixels become green, blue pixels on edge remain

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      isolated: false
    - color: blue
      shape: 2x1 rectangle
      isolated: false
  output_objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: 2x1 rectangle
        isolated: false
      - color: blue
        shape: 2x1 rectangle
        isolated: false
  transformation: No change; non-isolated blue pixels remain blue
```

**Natural Language Program**

A blue pixel is transformed into a green pixel if and only if it is isolated.  A blue pixel is considered isolated if none of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) are also blue. If a blue pixel has one or more blue neighbors, it remains blue. Blue pixels on the edges of the grid are *not* considered isolated if they don't have blue neighbors.

This version provides a clearer definition of "isolated" and explicitly states the behavior of non-isolated blue pixels. It incorporates the observations from all three training examples. It handles edge cases (Example 2). It addresses cases where adjacent pixels of same color make the pixel NOT isolated.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
